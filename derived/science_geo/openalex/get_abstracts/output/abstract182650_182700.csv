https://openalex.org/W2060525726,"Truncation of Notch1 has been shown to cause a subtype of acute leukemia, and activation of Notch4 has been associated with mammary and salivary gland carcinomas of mice. Here we identify a new mechanism for disrupting Notch signaling in human tumorigenesis, characterized by altered function of a new ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster Notch co-activator molecule Mastermind. We cloned the t(11;19) translocation that underlies the most common type of human malignant salivary gland tumor. This rearrangement fuses exon 1 from a novel gene of unknown function at 19p13, termed mucoepidermoid carcinoma translocated 1 (MECT1), with exons 2-5 of a novel member of the Mastermind-like gene family (MAML2) at 11q21 (ref. 3). Similar to D. melanogaster Mastermind and MAML1 (refs. 4,5), full-length MAML2 functioned as a CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless and Lag-1)-dependent transcriptional co-activator for ligand-stimulated Notch. In contrast, MECT1-MAML2 activated transcription of the Notch target gene HES1 independently of both Notch ligand and CSL binding sites. MECT1-MAML2 induced foci formation in RK3E epithelial cells, confirming a biological effect for the fusion product. These data suggest a new mechanism to disrupt the function of a Notch co-activator in a common type of malignant salivary gland tumor."

Here we provide new evidence suggesting that basal dromaeosaurid dinosaurs were four-winged animals and probably could glide, representing an intermediate stage towards the active, flapping-flight stage. The new discovery conforms to the predictions of early hypotheses that proavians passed through a tetrapteryx stage."

https://openalex.org/W2032858763,"Acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation of the amino-terminal tails of histones are thought to be involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. With just one exception, the enzymes identified in the methylation of specific lysine residues on histones (histone methyltransferases) belong to the SET family. The high-resolution crystal structure of a ternary complex of human SET7/9 with a histone peptide and cofactor reveals that the peptide substrate and cofactor bind on opposite surfaces of the enzyme. The target lysine accesses the active site of the enzyme and the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) cofactor by inserting its side chain into a narrow channel that runs through the enzyme, connecting the two surfaces. Here we show from the structure and from solution studies that SET7/9, unlike most other SET proteins, is exclusively a mono-methylase. The structure indicates the molecular basis of the specificity of the enzyme for the histone target, and allows us to propose a model for the methylation reaction that accounts for the role of many of the residues that are invariant across the SET family."

https://openalex.org/W2046251153,"Some European species of crab-spider match the colour of the flower on which they lie in wait to ambush insect pollinators, a tactic that is presumed to camouflage them from their intended prey and from predators1,2. Here we show that the coloration of an Australian species of crab-spider, Thomisus spectabilis, which is cryptic on the white daisy Chrysanthemum frutescens to the human eye, is highly conspicuous to ultraviolet-sensitive insect prey — but that, instead of repelling foraging honeybees (Apis mellifera) as might be expected, the contrast of the spider against the petals makes the flowers more attractive. The spider is apparently exploiting the bee's pre-existing preference for flowers with colour patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2059213607,"The orphan receptor C5L2 has recently been described as a high affinity binding protein for complement fragments C5a and C3a that, unlike the previously described C5a receptor (CD88), couples only weakly to Gi-like G proteins (Cain, S. A., and Monk, P. N. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 7165–7169). Here we demonstrate that C5L2 binds the metabolites of C4a and C3a, C4a des-Arg77, and C3a des-Arg77 (also known as the acylation-stimulating protein or ASP) at a site distinct from the C5a binding site. The binding of these metabolites to C5L2 does not stimulate the degranulation of transfected rat basophilic leukemia cells either through endogenous rat G proteins or when co-transfected with human Gα16. C3a des-Arg77/ASP and C3a can potently stimulate triglyceride synthesis in human skin fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Here we show that both cell types and human adipose tissue express C5L2 mRNA and that the human fibroblasts express C5L2 protein at the cell surface. This is the first demonstration of the expression of C5L2 in cells that bind and respond to C3a des-Arg77/ASP and C3a. Thus C5L2, a promiscuous complement fragment-binding protein with a high affinity site that binds C3a des-Arg77/ASP, may mediate the acylation-stimulating properties of this peptide. The orphan receptor C5L2 has recently been described as a high affinity binding protein for complement fragments C5a and C3a that, unlike the previously described C5a receptor (CD88), couples only weakly to Gi-like G proteins (Cain, S.

Although initially described as leukocyte chemoattractants and anaphylatoxins, it is now clear that C5a and C3a are involved in microbial host defense, immune regulation (1Kohl J. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 175-187Google Scholar), and protection against toxic insult (2Bhatia M. Brady M. Shokuhi S. Christmas S. Neoptolemos J.P. Slavin J. J.

C5a and C3a are also reported to have psychopharmacological effects on feeding and drinking behavior (6Schupf N. Williams C.A. Hugli T.E. Cox J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1983; 5: 305-316Google Scholar, 7Schupf N. Williams C.A. Berkman A. Cattell W.S. Kerper L. Brain Behav. Immun. 1989; 3: 28-38Google Scholar). Both complement fragments are rapidly desarginated by serum carboxypeptidase, which modulates their function. Although C5a des-Arg74 retains most of the activity of intact C5a, albeit with a generally lower affinity for the C5a receptor (CD88),1 C3a des-Arg77activity is profoundly reduced relative to C3a with respect to immunologic function. No binding of the C3a des-Arg77 form to the previously cloned and characterized C3a receptor (C3aR) is observed in transfected RBL cells or mouse macrophage/monocytes (8Zwirner J. Werfel T. Wilken H.C. Theile E. Gotze O. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1570-1577Google Scholar) and, unlike C3a, C3a des-Arg77 does not stimulate eosinophil chemotaxis (9Daffern P.J. Pfeifer P.H. Ember J.A. Hugli T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2119-2127Google Scholar), prostanoid production by guinea pig peritoneal macrophages and rat Kupffer cells (10Puschel G.P. Nolte A. Schieferdecker H.L. Rothermel E. Gotze O. Jungermann K. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 685-690Google Scholar), or human monocyte-like U937 cell degranulation (11Klos A. Bank S. Gietz C. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Burg M. Kretzschmar T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11274-11282Google Scholar). However, the following responses to C3a des-Arg77 have been reported. (i) The cytotoxicity of NK cells is inhibited by both C3a and C3a des-Arg77 (12Charriaut C. Senik A. Kolb J.P. Barel M. Frade R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6003-6007Google Scholar). (ii) Cytokine production by human monocyte/macrophages and PBMC is enhanced by these ligands but inhibited in human tonsil-derived B cells (13Fischer W.H. Jagels M.A. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 453-459Google Scholar, 14Fischer W.H. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4279-4286Google Scholar). (iii) Histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells is stimulated (15Mousli M. Hugli T.E. Landry Y. Bronner C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2456-2461Google Scholar). In addition, C3a des-Arg77 has well documented acylation-stimulating properties and increases triacylglycerol synthesis in human adipocytes, preadipocytes, and human skin fibroblasts (HSF), where this function as an acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) was initially characterized (16Cianflone K. Maslowska M. Eur J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 817-825Google Scholar). This triglyceride-stimulating activity is also shared by C3a (17Murray I. Parker R.A. Kirchgessner T.G. Tran J. Zhang Z.J. Westerlund J. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2492-2501Google Scholar). One hypothesis explaining this pattern of responses is that cells may express two kinds of receptor; one, probably C3aR, binds only C3a, and another, as yet unidentified receptor, binds both C3a and C3a des-Arg77.We have recently characterized a novel chemoattractant-binding protein, C5L2, that has high affinity for C5a, C5a des-Arg74, and C3a (18Cain S.A. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7165-7169Google Scholar). Here we report that C5L2 also binds C3a des-Arg77/ASP and is expressed in three C3a des-Arg77/ASP-responsive cell types.

https://openalex.org/W1988883176,"It is generally assumed that in proteins hydrophobic residues are not favorable at solvent-exposed sites, and that amino acid substitutions on the surface have little effect on protein thermostability. Contrary to these assumptions, we have identified hyperthermostable variants of Bacillus licheniformis α-amylase (BLA) that result from the incorporation of hydrophobic residues at the surface. Under highly destabilizing conditions, a variant combining five stabilizing mutations unfolds 32 times more slowly and at a temperature 13 °C higher than the wild-type. Crystal structure analysis at 1.7 Å resolution suggests that stabilization is achieved through (a) extension of the concept of increased hydrophobic packing, usually applied to cavities, to surface indentations, (b) introduction of favorable aromatic-aromatic interactions on the surface, (c) specific stabilization of intrinsic metal binding sites, and (d) stabilization of a β-sheet by introducing a residue with high β-sheet forming propensity. All mutated residues are involved in forming complex, cooperative interaction networks that extend from the interior of the protein to its surface and which may therefore constitute “weak points” where BLA unfolding is initiated. This might explain the unexpectedly large effect induced by some of the substitutions on the kinetic stability of BLA. Our study shows that substantial protein stabilization can be achieved by stabilizing surface positions that participate in underlying cooperatively formed substructures. At such positions, even the apparently thermodynamically unfavorable introduction of hydrophobic residues should be explored.

At such positions, even the apparently thermodynamically unfavorable introduction of hydrophobic residues should be explored. B. licheniformis α-amylase not determined root mean square Some general rules for increasing the stability of proteins have been derived from a large number of comparative structural and mutagenesis studies (1Matthews B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 139-160Google Scholar, 2Lee B. Vasmatzis G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 423-428Google Scholar). Among the most generally recognized strategies for protein thermostabilization are: increasing the hydrophobic packing in the interior, decreasing surface hydrophobicity, extending networks of salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds, engineering disulfide bonds or metal binding sites, shortening or strengthening solvent-exposed loops and termini, increasing the extent of secondary structure formation, and replacing residues responsible for irreversible chemical alterations of the protein structure. Yet, these general rules may not always be applied successfully and examples of engineered mutations resulting in effects opposite to the ones expected are legions. Such studies have also failed to reveal outstanding features associated with the adaptation of proteins to a given temperature range, i.e. psychrophilicity, mesophilicity, thermophilicity, and hyperthermophilicity. While most natural proteins seem to achieve their respective stability by accumulating a large number of weakly stabilizing interactions that result in a large net effect, some have acquired specialized structural features that cannot easily be transferred in a general way into other proteins (3Demirjian D.C. Moris-Varas F. Cassidy C.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 144-151Google Scholar, 4Jaenicke R. Bohm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Google Scholar). Elucidating the origin of thermal stability for a given protein and finding ways to increase it remains a specific and challenging task. Highly thermostable Bacillus licheniformis α-amylase (BLA)1 is widely used in biotechnology for the initial steps of starch degradation at temperatures up to 110 °C (5Vihinen M. Mäntsälä P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 329-418Google Scholar). The primary substrate for BLA is starch, but similar compounds, such as glycogen or smaller oligosaccharides, are readily converted as well. Furthermore, BLA, like other α-amylases, shows pronounced transglycosylation activity and is therefore also used in synthetic chemistry for the enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides. For this purpose, attempts are being made to modify the enzymatic activity of BLA in order to accommodate a wider variety of substrates with varying specificity (6Terashima M. Katoh S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 799: 65-69Google Scholar). The main focus, however, is the search for α-amylases that are less prone to oxidative effects, highly stable at temperature and pH extremes and still enzymatically active. Although thermophilic and acidophilic α-amylases have been found in extremophiles (3Demirjian D.C. Moris-Varas F. Cassidy C.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 144-151Google Scholar, 7Bertoldo C. Antranikian G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 151-160Google Scholar), BLA remains a prime target for extensive protein engineering projects (8Shaw A. Bott R. Day A.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 349-352Google Scholar, 9Nielsen J.E. Borchert T.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 253-274Google Scholar, 10Declerck M. Machius M. Joyet P. Wiegand G. Huber R. Gaillardin C. Biologia, Bratislava. 2002; 57 (in press)Google Scholar). When subjected to high temperatures, BLA unfolds irreversibly and precipitates (11Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3092-3096Google Scholar, 12Violet M. Meunier J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 665-670Google Scholar). The derivation of comprehensive and accurate thermodynamic parameters for the folding/unfolding process of BLA is therefore not straightforward. Nevertheless, a wealth of information has been acquired in various laboratories providing insights into the origin of BLA stability (11Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3092-3096Google Scholar, 12Violet M. Meunier J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 665-670Google Scholar, 13Conrad B. Hoang V. Polley A. Hofemeister J. Eur. J.

Several hundred BLA variants have been constructed and characterized and have led to the identification of protein regions and residues that are important for thermostability (13Conrad B. Hoang V. Polley A. Hofemeister J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 481-490Google Scholar, 17Declerck N. Joyet P. Gaillardin C. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15481-15488Google Scholar, 18Declerck N.

BLA is also one of the few proteins for which detailed biochemical studies on the mechanism of irreversible thermal inactivation have been carried out. It is suspected that the main cause of irreversible BLA inactivation at high temperature is the deamidation of Asn/Gln residues (11Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3092-3096Google Scholar), although the particular residues involved have not been identified. BLA is a secreted metallo-enzyme that requires the presence of calcium for structural integrity and enzymatic competence, but the metal ions are not directly involved in catalysis. The wild-type BLA species that could readily be crystallized was depleted of the intrinsic metal ions and proteolytically nicked (14Machius M. Wiegand G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 545-559Google Scholar). The first detailed views of the structure of BLA were available for this particular inactive form (14Machius M. Wiegand G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 545-559Google Scholar,21Hwang K.Y. Song H.K. Chang C. Lee J. Lee S.Y. Kim K.K. Choe S. Sweet R.M. Suh S.W. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 251-258Google Scholar). This model served as a basis for a broad mutagenesis study (19Declerck N. Machius M. Wiegand G. Huber R. Gaillardin C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1041-1057Google Scholar). In the course of this work, we discovered that variants that included the mutations Q264S and N265Y gave crystals of the native, uncleaved enzyme in the presence of calcium and reported the crystal structure of such a variant solved to a resolution of 1.9 Å (22Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar). This structure revealed the presence of a calcium-sodium-calcium metal triad instead of the single conserved calcium ion that is usually found at the interface between domains A and B. The metal triad is a unique feature among metallo-proteins in general, and is only present in BLA and its closest relatives from B. amyloliquefaciens (23Brzozowski A.M. Lawson D.M. Turkenburg J.P. Bisgaard-Frantzen H. Svendsen A. Borchert T.V. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9099-9107Google Scholar) andB. stearothermophilus (24Suvd D. Fujimoto Z. Takase K. Matsumura M. Mizuno H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 461-468Google Scholar). BLA provides a rare example of a secretory metalloprotein for which crystal structures of both the metal-containing form and the metal-free form are available. A comparison between these two structures shows that metal loss causes a number of drastic structural changes in the vicinity of the active site, although more than 95% of the structure is unaffected. Here we describe the crystal structure of a BLA variant containing five mutations that increase the kinetic stability of BLA. The effects of the single mutations are cumulative and result in a protein that unfolds 32 times more slowly under conditions where the wild-type enzyme is rapidly unfolded. Four of five mutations involve the incorporation of seemingly unfavorable hydrophobic residues at solvent-exposed sites. Structural analysis indicates how the mutations exert their stabilizing effect. The structural integrity of cooperatively formed substructures, especially the central ternary Ca-Na-Ca metal binding site, proves particularly crucial for the overall kinetic stability of BLA. BLA variants containing various combinations of the mutations, H133V, N190F, A209V, Q264S, and N265Y were constructed as described (18Declerck N. Joyet P. Trosset J.Y. Garnier J. Gaillardin C. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1029-1037Google Scholar). The thermally induced irreversible unfolding of BLA was followed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy using a Jasco J-715 CD-spectrometer equipped with a peltier thermostatting cuvette holder. Samples were incubated at 85 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mmCaCl2, pH 5.6 and the CD signal recorded at 222 nm for up to 800 min. The concentration of the samples was routinely around 0.1 mg/ml with a pathlength of 0.1 cm. To investigate the influence of intermolecular interactions on the unfolding behavior, the concentration of wild-type BLA was varied over about three orders of magnitude (0.85 mg/ml with 0.1-cm pathlength, 0.1 mg with 0.1-cm pathlength, and 0.02 mg/ml with 0.2-cm pathlength). Pseudomelting curves were recorded by heating BLA with a rate of 1°/min from 20 to 95 °C and following the CD signal at 222 nm. Because of the extreme thermostability of BLA, it was technically not possible to record the entire unfolding curve. In order to obtain an estimate of the relative stabilities for the mutants, we determined the temperature where unfolding started. After normalizing the raw data for sample concentration, this point was derived by calculating the intersection between the CD baseline at low temperatures (between 20 and 60 °C) and a line drawn through the linear part of the transition region. The BLA variant containing all five stabilizing mutations was crystallized by vapor diffusion from drops containing 4 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0) plus 4 μl of reservoir solution (50 mmHepes, 1 m ammonium sulfate, 1% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 500, pH 7.0) equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Hexagonal bipyramids appeared after 3–10 days and grew to a final size of 0.5 mm in length within 1–3 weeks. The crystals show the symmetry of space group P61, with cell constants of a = b = 91.3 Å, c = 137.7 Å, and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data of up to 1.7 Å Bragg spacing were collected on a MAR-research image plate system using CuKα radiation and a beam-focusing mirror system (MSC). Data were processed and reduced with the DENZO/SCALEPACK package version 1.9.0 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar).

The starting point for refinement was a crystal structure of another BLA variant, which had previously been solved by Patterson search techniques using the cleaved form of BLA (22Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar). All refinement steps were carried out with the program CNS version 1.0 (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). In order to minimize model bias, ten residues around the individual mutation sites were removed from the starting structure, which was then subjected to simulated annealing at a starting temperature of 3000 K, followed by cycles of energy-restrained positional refinement of the coordinates, calculation of individual B factors, as well as visual inspection and manual correction of the model using the program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The missing residues were built at the full resolution, and water molecules added where stereochemically reasonable. Refinement statistics are listed in Table II. For the present study, we have selected five mutations that we had previously identified as retarding the irreversible thermal inactivation of BLA. The mutation H133V was identified while probing residues that are not conserved between BLA and the highly homologous but much less stable α-amylase fromB. amyloliquefaciens (17Declerck N. Joyet P. Gaillardin C. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15481-15488Google Scholar, 18Declerck N. Joyet P. Trosset J.Y. Garnier J. Gaillardin C. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1029-1037Google Scholar). The mutation A209V was obtained by in vivo screening of suppressive mutations in a thermosensitive BLA variant (20Joyet P. Declerck N. Gaillardin C. Biotechnology (NY). 1992; 10: 1579-1583Google Scholar). The double mutant Q264S/N265Y was found when replacing residues that potentially undergo deamidation in BLA by non-deamidating amino acids found at the same positions in the homologous α-amylase from B. stearothermophilus. 2N. Declerck, unpublished results.These four mutants were identified before detailed experimentally obtained structural information about BLA was available. Recently, we have carried out a broad study based on the first reported crystal structure of BLA (14Machius M. Wiegand G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 545-559Google Scholar) where we probed 15 positions and characterized more than 175 mutations in terms of their influence on the kinetic thermostability of BLA (19Declerck N. Machius M. Wiegand G. Huber R. Gaillardin C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1041-1057Google Scholar). During this study, we identified the mutation N190F as the most stabilizing single site mutation found for BLA so far. The unfolding kinetics of wild type BLA and BLA variants at 85 °C was followed by recording the CD signal at 222 nm (Fig.1 A). Highly destabilizing conditions (low pH and calcium concentration) were used in order to reduce the incubation time required for accurate measurements. Experiments with different sample concentrations show that BLA unfolding under these conditions is a monomolecular process (11Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3092-3096Google Scholar). Overall, the kinetics of BLA unfolding can be modeled with high accuracy with a single exponential term as shown in Equation 1, Nt=No·exp(−kap·t)Equation 1 where Nt specifies the concentration of native molecules at time t, N0specifies the concentration of native molecules at time 0, andk ap is the apparent rate constant for BLA unfolding. The half-life for the thermally induced denaturation of wild-type BLA is about 14 min. The five mutations described above all prolong the lifetime of BLA at 85 °C to a various extent (Table I). The stabilizing effects are cumulative with the BLA variant that contains all five mutations exhibiting a half-life of 447 min, which is 32 times longer than the wild type. The investigated variants not only unfold more slowly at 85 °C, but the onset of unfolding is also shifted toward higher temperatures (Fig.1 B). From pseudomelting curves it can be estimated that the most stabilized BLA variant has a melting temperature that is about 13 °C higher than that observed for wild type BLA (Table I). We have determined the crystal structure of the BLA variant containing the five stabilizing mutations mentioned above to a resolution of 1.71 Å. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table II. A representative part of the electron density is shown in Fig. 2 A. The overall topology of BLA, shown in Fig. 2 B, is typical for α-amylases with a central A domain containing a (βα)8-barrel forming the core of the enzyme. Attached to this core is a C-terminal domain that invariably comprises a Greek key motif. A third domain (B domain) is established as a loop-rich protrusion from the A domain. This domain is the most dissimilar among the known α-amylase structures and varies widely in size, with BLA exhibiting the largest and most complex structure (14Machius M. Wiegand G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 545-559Google Scholar, 22Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar). In the following, we present a structural interpretation of the stabilizing effects exerted by the mutations. A general overview of the location of these mutations is given in Fig. 2. Residue 133 is located at the surface of domain B where it is the first residue of β-strand Bβ6 (secondary structure nomenclature described in Ref. 14Machius M. Wiegand G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 545-559Google Scholar), which is involved in forming the large central β-sheet in this domain (Figs. 2 and3). The wild-type histidine at this position is part of a weak hydrogen-bonding network (Tyr-175OH ↔ Wat ↔ His-133NE2 and His-133ND1 ↔ Gly-131O) involving a well-ordered water molecule at the bottom of a small surface indentation in between β-strands Bβ4, Bβ5, and Bβ6. The histidine side chain partly fills this cavity and shields the hydrophobic interior formed by residues Ala-117, Ile-135, and Tyr-175. It was observed that the introduction of hydrophobic residues at position 133 is particularly effective in increasing BLA stability (18Declerck N. Joyet P. Trosset J.Y. Garnier J. Gaillardin C. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1029-1037Google Scholar), with isoleucine, tyrosine, and valine being the most stabilizing residues. As a consequence of the H133V mutation, the hydrogen-bonding network that originally involved the histidyl side chain is disrupted, and the hydrophobic nature of the surface indentation is increased. The crystal structure of the mutant reveals that there is a main chain displacement around residue 133 with the φ/ϕ angles of residue 133 changing from −150/163° for the histidine in wild-type BLA to −135/145° for the valine in the mutant (Fig. 3 A). The latter values are more favorable for forming the hydrogen-bonding patterns observed in β-sheets. As a result, the hydrogen bonds between the two strands are slightly shorter and consequently the entire β-sheet presumably more stable when compared with wild-type BLA (Fig. 3 B). The interactions of the wild-type histidine side chain with its neighbors prevent the side chain from turning more into the hydrophobic indentation causing the main chain to slightly tilt backwards. A detailed analysis of the deviation of geometric parameters, such as bond lengths, dihedral, and improper angles from ideal values (carried out with the program CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar)) shows that there is considerable strain around position 133 in wild-type BLA (Fig. 4 C). This strain is diminished and spread out over a wider range in the H133V mutant.Figure 4Stereoview of the region around the Ca-Na-Ca metal triad containing the mutation N190F. Calcium ions are shown in cyan and the sodium ion is in yellow; other atoms are in standard colors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Residue 190 lies at one end of the central cleft between domains A and B with the side chain fully solvent-exposed. It is located in a long loop region that undergoes a disorder-order transition upon metal binding (Fig. 2). The structure of native BLA harboring an asparagine at this position is not known, but the mutational profile provides valuable information on possible thermostability determinants (19Declerck N. Machius M. Wiegand G. Huber R. Gaillardin C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1041-1057Google Scholar). Introducing large and mainly hydrophobic residues increases the stability of BLA by a factor of up to four. Surprisingly though, tyrosine has no effect. On the other hand, introducing small side chains, e.g. alanine, reduces the stability by a factor of up to four. Introducing a negatively charged residue in the form of a glutamate at position 190 is similarly destabilizing, suggesting that a potential deamidation of Asn-190 is deleterious to BLA stability. Overall, the preference for hydrophobic residues indicates increased hydrophobic packing with underlying aromatic residues. Indeed, the mutation of Asn-190 to phenylalanine creates a triple aromatic interaction where the ring system of Tyr-193 is oriented perpendicular to the neighboring rings of Phe-190 and His-235 (Fig. 4). This arrangement allows a favorable interaction of the partially positively charged rims of Phe-190 and His-235 with the π-electron cloud of the central Tyr-193. Residue 209 is located close to the N terminus of α-helix Aα3 in domain A of BLA (Fig. 2). In wild-type BLA, there is a shallow hydrophobic indentation around the Cβ atom of Ala-209 (Fig. 5). The base of this indentation is composed of residues Tyr-203 and Phe-240, whereas the rather hydrophilic rim is formed by the side chains of Lys-213, Asp-243, and Lys-237 as well as by carbonyl oxygen atoms from residues 203 through 206. Phe-240 is located in the opposing α-helix Aα4, which, together with Aα3, points toward the Ca-Na-Ca metal triad. There are five ordered water molecules covering the indentation. As previously observed (18Declerck N. Joyet P. Trosset J.Y. Garnier J. Gaillardin C. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1029-1037Google Scholar), the introduction of small hydrophobic residues in place of Ala-209 increases the half-life for the thermal inactivation of BLA by a factor of up to three. In the absence of structural information, it was argued that a favorable residue should contribute to the hydrophobic packing at the bottom of the indentation and should not disturb the pronounced water structure at the top (15Declerck N. Machius M. Chambert R. Wiegand G. Huber R. Gaillardin C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 541-549Google Scholar). For the mutant A209V, the first premise is true, but the water structure is considerably diminished as indicated by the missing central water molecule and significantly higher B factors for the rest of the water molecules. Residues 264 and 265 have historically been treated as a pair in mutational studies of BLA. They are located on the surface of the interface between domains A and B (Fig. 2). In wild-type BLA, residue 264 is a glutamine whose side chain is able to form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Glu-189 in domain B. A possible deamidation of Gln-264 at high temperatures could place the resulting negatively charged side chain in an electrostatically unfavorable environment because of its close proximity to Glu-189 and Asp-266 (Fig. 6). Yet, as for Asn-190, there is no experimental proof that the removal of the amide side chain at this position reduces BLA deamidation. Residue 265 (asparagine in wild-type BLA) shields a hydrophobic region composed of the underlying Pro-287 and Tyr-290. The crystal structure of the BLA variant containing a mutation of asparagine to tyrosine at this position shows that the tyr"

The mechanism by which PML regulates cell death remains unclear. In this study we found that ectopic expression of PML potentiates cell death by apoptosis in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-resistant cell line U2OS and other cell lines. Treatment with TNFalpha significantly sensitized these cells to apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. PML/TNFalpha-induced cell death is associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, -7, and -8, and degradation of DNA fragmentation factor/inhibitor of CAD. PML/TNFalpha-induced cell death could be blocked by the caspase-8 inhibitors CrmA and c-FLIP but not by Bcl-2. These findings indicate that this cell death event is initiated through the death receptor-dependent apoptosis pathway. PML is a transcriptional repressor of NF-kappaB by interacting with RelA/p65 and prevents its binding to the cognate enhancer through the C terminus. Coimmunoprecipitation and double-color immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that PML physically interacts with RelA/p65 in vivo and the two proteins colocalized at the endogenous levels. Overexpression of NF-kappaB rescued cell death induced by PML/TNFalpha. Furthermore, PML(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts are more resistant to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. Together this study defines a novel mechanism by which PML induces apoptosis through repression of the NF-kappaB survival pathway."

The goal of this work was to determine the biochemical function of Ohr fromXylella fastidiosa.

Therefore, we have investigated whether Ohr possesses thiol-dependent peroxidase activity. The ohrgene from X. fastidiosa was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant Ohr decomposed hydroperoxides in a dithiothreitol-dependent manner. Ohr was about twenty times more efficient to remove organic hydroperoxides than to remove H2O2. This result is consistent with the organic hydroperoxide sensitivity of Δohr strains. The dependence of Ohr on thiol compounds was ascertained by glutamine synthetase protection assays. Approximately two thiol equivalents were consumed per peroxide removed indicating that Ohr catalyzes the following reaction: 2RSH + ROOH → RSSR + ROH + H2O. Pretreatment of Ohr with N-ethyl maleimide and substitution of cysteine residues by serines inhibited this peroxidase activity indicating that both of the Ohr cysteines are important to the decomposition of peroxides.

Levine A. Brisson L.F. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4158-4163Google Scholar). Lipid hydroperoxides can be generated from the attack of ROS to the bacterial membrane. Organic hydroperoxides can also be formed during metabolism of certain drugs or during oxidation of n-alkanes (2Maeng J.H. Sakai Y. Tani Y. Kato N. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3695-3700Google Scholar). These peroxides can then react with metals or with metalloproteins leading to the production of secondary free radicals (3Jiang Z.-Y. Hunt J.V. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 384-389Google Scholar, 4Barr D.P. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12709-12716Google Scholar), which may be related to the fact that organic peroxides possess bactericidal activity (5Akaike T. Sato K. Ijiri S. Miyamoto Y. Kohno M. Ando M. Maeda H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 55-63Google Scholar). The alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpR) is frequently considered the main enzyme responsible for the conversion of organic peroxides to the corresponding alcohols in bacteria (6Bsat N. Chen L. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6579-6586Google Scholar, 7Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Google Scholar). This enzyme comprises two subunits, AhpF and AhpC. AhpC is a thiol-dependent peroxidase that belongs to the peroxiredoxin family (8Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Google Scholar). A cysteine residue of AhpC is oxidized to sulfenic acid (R-SOH) by peroxides. NADH reduces the sulfenic acid back to its sulfhydryl (R-SH) form in a reaction catalyzed by AhpF. AhpF is a flavo-enzyme that shares homology with thioredoxin reductase (9Poole L.B. Ellis H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 56-64Google Scholar). Recently a gene was isolated in Xanthomonas campestrispv. phaseoli because its deletion rendered cells highly sensitive to killing by organic peroxides but not to H2O2 or superoxide generators (10Mongkolsuk S. Praituan W. Loprasert S. Fuangthong M. Chamnongpol S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2636-2643Google Scholar). Therefore, it was named organic hydroperoxide resistance(ohr) gene. ohr gene expression was highly induced by t-bOOH, weakly induced by H2O2, and not induced at all by superoxide (10Mongkolsuk S. Praituan W. Loprasert S. Fuangthong M. Chamnongpol S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2636-2643Google Scholar). Recently, homologues of this gene were also characterized in other bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis andPseudomonas aeruginosa (11Ochsner U.A. Hassett D.J. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 773-778Google Scholar, 12Fuangthong M. Atichartpongkul S. Mongkolsuk S. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4134-4141Google Scholar) among others. Interestingly, Ohr, but not AhpR, appears to play a significant role in Cu-OOH resistance in B. subtilis (12Fuangthong M. Atichartpongkul S. Mongkolsuk S. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4134-4141Google Scholar). In Enterococcus faecalis, ohr deletion rendered the cells more sensitive to t-bOOH and also to ethanol (13Rince A. Giard J.C. Pichereau V. Flahaut S. Auffray Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1482-1488Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has shown that ohr homologues are widely spread among different bacteria genera, many of them pathogenic (14Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Google Scholar). Ohr also shares similarities with OsmC, which is involved in bacterial defense against osmotic stress (14Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Google Scholar). All the Ohr and OsmC homologues have two cysteine residues located in motifs that are also very conserved. One of the cysteine residues is part of a VCP motif that is also found in peroxiredoxins. Therefore, it was postulated that Ohr could decompose peroxides directly, similarly to AhpC, a peroxiredoxin found in bacteria (14Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Google Scholar). In fact, AhpC complement ohr deletion in Escherichia coli and in X. campestris (10Mongkolsuk S. Praituan W. Loprasert S. Fuangthong M. Chamnongpol S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2636-2643Google Scholar). In P. aeruginosa, the deletion of ohr rendered the cells more sensitive to organic peroxide than ahpC deletion, and the double mutantohr, ahpC is more sensitive than the single mutants (11Ochsner U.A. Hassett D.J. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 773-778Google Scholar). Finally, media from mutants for Ohr contain higher levels of organic peroxides than the correspondent wild-type cells (11Ochsner U.A. Hassett D.J. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 773-778Google Scholar,15Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 794-802Google Scholar). Despite the suggestions that Ohr might directly detoxify organic hydroperoxides, it was not possible to rule out the possibility that Ohr is involved in other processes such as the transport of organic molecules (10Mongkolsuk S. Praituan W. Loprasert S. Fuangthong M. Chamnongpol S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2636-2643Google Scholar) or in yet undefined signaling pathways that lead to activation of secondary molecules that would then inactivate organic peroxides. Here, for the first time, the biochemical activity of Ohr was elucidated: Ohr from Xylella fastidiosa possesses a thiol-dependent peroxidase activity, which is probably responsible for the hypersensitivity of Δohr mutants to treatment with organic hydroperoxides. All the reagents were purchased with the highest degree of purity. DHLA was purchased in the reduced form from Sigma (T8620). DHLA is a yellow oil, and its stock solution was prepared by dilution to 50 mm concentration in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH = 7.5 and heated at 45 °C for 30 min. DHLA concentration was ascertained by the use of the Ellman's reagent as described bellow. The ohr gene was PCR-amplified from the cosmid XF-07F02 that was used in the X. fastidiosasequencing genome project (16Simpson A.J.G. Reinach F.C. Arruda P. Abreu F.A. Acencio M. Alvarenga R.

The following forward 5′-CGCGGATCCCATATGAATTCACTGGAG (Xfo1) and reverse 5′-CGCAAGCTTGGATCCTTAGTCAATCAG (Xfo2) primers were used. The underlined bases represent the NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) resulting in the pGEM/ohr plasmid. AnE. coli DH5-α strain was transformed with pGEM/ohr, and white colonies were selected from LB-ampicillin-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) medium. Plasmid extraction was performed using the Rapid Plasmid Miniprep System Concert kit (Invitrogen). The plasmid PGEM/ohr was used to generate the two individually ohr mutant proteins, C61S and C125S, in which cysteines Cys-61 and Cys-125 were replaced by serines through PCR megaprimer methods (17Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 4: 404-407Google Scholar, 18Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 21: 4530-4531Google Scholar). In the case of the C61S construct, PCR was performed first with the mutagenic primer XfoC1 forward 5′-TTATTCTGCCTCTTTCATTGG-3′ and Xfo2 reverse, where the bold letters denote the mutation performed. A single band of 277 bp was eluted out from the agarose gel and used as a primer (megaprimer) along with the primer Xfo1 to the second PCR step to amplify the rest of Ohr gene. In the case of the C125S construct, replacement was performed in one-step PCR using the primers Xfo1 and a large terminal mutagenic primer XfoC2 5′-CGCAAGCTTGGATCCTTAGTCAATCAGAATCAAAACGACGTCGATATTTCCACGGGTTGCATTAGAGTACGGAGAAACACGATGC-3′, where the boldface typing represents the codon mutation and the underlined bases represents the BamHI restriction site. The final mutated PCR products were ligated in pGEMT easy vector to produce PGEM/C61S and PGEM/C125S, independently. pET15b, pGEM/ohr, PGEM/ohrC61S, and PGEM/C125S were first digested with NdeI and after by BamHI. The fragments generated byNdeI/BamHI digestion of plasmids derived from pGEMs were extracted from agarose gel by the Rapid Gel Extraction Concert kit (Invitrogen) and were individually ligated to the digested pET-15b expression vector. The resulting pET15b/ohr, PET15b/C61S, and PET15b/C125S plasmids were sequenced in an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 377 96 to confirm that the constructions were correct. An E. coli DH5-α strain was transformed with the expression vectors and cultured to increase plasmid production. Another plasmid extraction was performed, andE. coli Bl21(DE3) cells were transformed with the same constructs. The resulting strains were used for expression and purification of Ohr, C61S, and C125S. E. coliBl21(DE3) strains transformed with pET15b/ohr, pET15b/C61S, and pET15b/C125S were cultured (50 ml) overnight in LB + ampicillin medium, transferred to 1 liter of fresh LB + ampicillin (100 μg/ml) medium, and cultured further until the A 600 reached 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration equivalent to 1 mm. After 3 h of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was washed and suspended in the start buffer (phosphate buffer, 20 mm, pH 7.4). Seven cycles of 30 s of sonication (35% amplitude) following 30 s in ice were applied to cell suspension. The cell extracts were kept in ice during streptomycin sulfate 1% treatment for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 31,500 × g for 30 min to remove nucleic acid precipitates. Finally cell extract was applied to a nickel affinity column (Hi-trap from Amersham Biosciences). The conditions of protein purification were optimized using the gradient procedure for imidazole concentration described by the manufacturer. Peroxide concentration was determined by the ferrous oxidation xylenol (FOX) assay as previously described (3Jiang Z.-Y. Hunt J.V. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 384-389Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of thiol compounds and stopped at different intervals by addition of 20 μl of HCl (1m) into 100-μl reaction mixtures. No peroxide consumption was detected in the absence of thiols. H2O2 concentration in stock solutions was checked by its absorbance (ε240 nm = 43.6m−1·cm−1). The amount of thiol groups remaining in solution was determined by the Ellman's reagent (DTNB), using the ε412 nm = 13,600m−1·cm−1 for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (TNB) (19Riddles P.W. Robert L.B. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Google Scholar). As described above, reactions were stopped at different intervals by addition of 20 μl of HCl (1m) into 100-μl reaction mixtures. Samples were neutralized by dilution (1:10) in a solution containing Hepes (1m, pH 7.4) and DTNB (5 mm). Absorbance at 412 nm was immediately recorded. Antioxidant activities of Ohr, OhrC61S, OhrC125S, and cTPxI were measured by their ability to protect glutamine synthetase from oxidative inactivation. Several H2O2-removing enzymes such as GSH peroxidase, catalase, and cTPxI can protect glutamine synthetase (20Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee Ki-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Google Scholar). The procedure used to determine glutamine synthetase activity was the same described by Kim et al. (20Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee Ki-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Google Scholar). Recombinant Ohr (2 mg/ml) was treated with NEM (1 mm) for 1 h at room temperature and then was dialyzed against phosphate buffer (20 mm), pH 7.4. The concentration of histidine-tagged Ohr was determined using the extinction coefficient ε280 nm = 3960 m−1·cm−1, which was determined using the software of ExPASy proteomics from Swiss Institute of bioinformatics (ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Histidine tag of recombinant Ohr was digested with thrombin (0.01 units/μl) using the thrombin cleavage capture kit from Novagen. The digestion was carried out for 16 h at 25 °C. The concentration of the recombinant protein without histidine tag was determined spectrophotometrically, using the same extinction coefficient ε280 nm = 3960m−1·cm−1 determined above because the histidine tag does not contain optically active residues. Determination of sulfenic acid (R-SOH) in wild-type as well as in mutant proteins was performed by the TNB anion method described by Ellis and Poole (21Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Google Scholar). In summary, TNB was prepared by incubation of an almost equimolar mixture of DTNB and DTT (1 DTNB:0.9 SH). Proteins preincubated or not with peroxides were treated with a 20-fold excess of TNB. As described before (21Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Google Scholar), TNB reacts with sulfenic acids in a 1:1 stoichiometry, generating a mixed disulfide between TNB and a cysteine residue. Excess of TNB was removed by PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Mixed disulfides were then treated with 10-fold excess of DTT, and the amount TNB released (which was equal to the amount sulfenic acid formed) was determined spectrophotometrically. Ohr from X. fastidiosa possesses a very high degree of similarity with proteins from various bacteria such as X. campestris pv.phaseoli and P. aeruginosa (14Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Google Scholar). In general, theohr gene is present in a single copy, but in some cases such as B. subtilis, Mesorhizobium loti, andRalstonia solanacearum two copies of ohr are present (12Fuangthong M. Atichartpongkul S. Mongkolsuk S. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4134-4141Google Scholar, 22Kaneko T. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Asamizu E. Kato T. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Idesawa K. Ishikawa A.

Nature. 2002; 415: 497-502Google Scholar). In Streptomyces coelicolor, three copies of ohr appear to be present (24Redenbach M. Kieser H.M. Denapaite D. Eichner A. Cullum J. Kinashi H. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 77-96Google Scholar). A blastp analysis on theX. fastidiosa genome using the tools available at the site aeg.lbi.ic.unicamp.br/xf/detected only one copy of ohr in this bacteria located between coordinates 1,742,868 and 1,743,299 with 432 nucleotides. The predicted amino acid sequence possesses 143 residues and a molecular mass equivalent to 14.9 kDa. Among other characteristics Ohr proteins have two conserved cysteine residues that are at positions 61 and 125 in the homologue from X. fastidiosa. Based on sequence homology two domains of Ohr can be defined: domain 1, which contains cysteine 61 and a high number of hydrophobic residues, and domain 2, which has cysteine 125 in a VCP motif (Fig. 1 A). The VCP motif is also present in the peroxiredoxin family, whose proteins are thiol-dependent peroxidases (25Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Netto L.E.S. Seo M.S. Stadtman E.R. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 207-209Google Scholar). The two proposed domains are highly conserved among Ohr homologues, especially domain 1 (14Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Because ohr deletion renders cells very sensitive to organic peroxide treatment, a hydrophobicity analysis of Ohr protein was carried out (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar). Our data indicated that cysteine 61 is in a highly hydrophobic environment, whereas cysteine 125 is in a hydrophilic environment (Fig.1 B). To investigate whether Ohr possesses thiol-dependent peroxidase activity, ohr gene from X. fastidiosawas expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel affinity chromatography (see “Materials and Methods”). A histidine tag recombinant Ohr was obtained with high degree of purity as ascertained by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Two bands corresponding to Ohr were observed, both of which migrate closely to 17 kDa, as expected for a monomer (Fig. 2 A). Removal of histidine tag by thrombin proteolysis also resulted in two bands both of which migrated at ∼15 kDa (data not shown). The abundance of each band was dependent on the oxidative condition to which Ohr was exposed (Fig. 2) and was independent of the presence of the histidine tag (data not shown). Bands corresponding to dimers did not appear even after treatments of Ohr with H2O2 or organic hydroperoxide at various concentrations (Fig. 2 B) indicating that no disulfide bond was formed between two Ohr molecules. Since the two bands observed in Fig. 2 have approximately the monomer size, they should represent different configurations of Ohr monomers. The lower band (band a) should correspond to an oxidized state of Ohr, which is generated after H2O2treatment or at mild concentrations of t-bOOH (Fig.2 B). On the other side, the upper band (band b) may represent a mixture of reduced and oxidized states of Ohr. This is because Ohr treatment with increasing concentrations of DTT provoked augment of band b intensity (Fig.2 A) as well as Ohr treatment with high organic peroxide concentrations (Fig. 2 B). The meanings of these two bands are further discussed below, after the description of results with Ohr site-specific mutants. In any case, it is important to emphasize that different monomeric configurations were also observed before for cTPxI, a thiol-dependent peroxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1994; 91: 7022-7026Google Scholar). Recombinant Ohr decomposed peroxides only if DTT was also present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3). Because the substrates were present in a 350–4100-excess over the protein, it is reasonable to think that Ohr was acting catalytically. In the conditions described in Fig. 3, the specific activity of Ohr was 20.0, 17.0, and 1.3 μm/min/ng when, respectively,t-bOOH, Cu-OOH, and H2O2 were considered the substrates. This indicates that Ohr was 10–20 times more efficient in the removal of organic peroxides than in the removal of H2O2. These results are consistent with the high susceptibility of Δohr mutants to organic peroxides but not to H2O2 (Ref. 14Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Google Scholar and references cited herein). In any case, Ohr did decompose H2O2when DTT was present in the reaction mixture. This ability of Ohr to decompose peroxides was dependent on the integrity of its cysteine residues because pretreatment of Ohr with NEM inhibited its peroxidase activity (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, it is reasonable to think that Cys-61, Cys-125, or both are directly involved in the decomposition of peroxides by Ohr. Ohr also possesses antioxidant property as demonstrated by its capacity to protect glutamine synthetase from inactivation by thiol-containing oxidative system composed of DTT/Fe3+/O2 or composed of DHLA/Fe3+/O2 (Fig.4 A). Probably, this protection was due to the thiol-dependent peroxidase activity of Ohr because other thiol-dependent peroxidase such as GSH peroxidase and cTPxI also protect glutamine synthetase from inactivation (20Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee Ki-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Google Scholar). In fact, the glutamine synthetase protection assay has been used to investigate whether proteins possess peroxide-removing activity (28Lee S.P. Hwang Y.S. Kim Y.J. Kwon K.S. Kim H.J. Kim K. Chae H.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29826-29832Google Scholar, 29Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. London R. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Rogers R.A. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29897-29904Google Scholar). Ohr did not protect glutamine synthetase against the ascorbate/Fe3+/O2 system, indicating that this protein is a thiol-specific antioxidant protein (Fig. 4 A). The protective activity of Ohr was dependent on the concentration of protein and is comparable to the cTPxI activity (Fig. 4 B). Removal of histidine tag by thrombin treatment did not alter the enzymatic characteristics of Ohr nor its ability to protect glutamine synthetase (data not shown). When H2O2 was used as substrate, the specific activity of Ohr (Fig. 3) was similar to cTPxI (data not shown). These results are consistent with the glutamine synthetase assays (Fig.4 B) where these two proteins were also equally protective. The oxidative inactivation of glutamine synthetase is dependent on H2O2 formation by metal catalyzed oxidation systems and by its posterior conversion to hydroxyl radical through the Fenton reaction (30Stadtman E.R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Google Scholar). Therefore protection of glutamine synthetase from inactivation probably occurs through the removal of H2O2 by antioxidant enzymes (31Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Google Scholar). The role of Ohr cysteines in peroxide reduction was strongly suggested since treatment of Ohr with NEM lead to protein inactivation (Fig. 3). To specifically investigate the roles of Cys-61 and Cys-125 on Ohr catalysis these two residues were individually replaced by serine generating, respectively, C61S and C125S. Initially, the capacity of the mutant proteins to decompose hydroperoxides was investigated. C61S and C125S had no detectable peroxidase activity when t-bOOH was used as a substrate (Fig.5 A). When H2O2 was the substrate, C125S had a residual activity, whereas C61S did not decompose any peroxide (Fig.5 B). These results indicated that both cysteine residues are important for catalysis. Replacement of either Cys-61 or Cys-125 also provoked great decreases in the ability of Ohr to protect glutamine synthetase from oxidative inactivation (Fig. 5 C). C61S only showed some protective effect at very high doses, which might be attributable to nonspecific activity. Interestingly, replacement of two of the cysteines of human peroxiredoxin V (prx V), which forms a stable intramolecular disulfide intermediate during its catalytic cycle, produced similar effects (32Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Google Scholar). Therefore, the results described in Fig.5 represented an initial suggestion that an intramolecular disulfide is also a reaction intermediate of wild-type Ohr. Further evidences are presented below. The migration of Ohr mutants was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.6) under both reducing and non-reducing conditions to understand the meaning of the two monomeric bands observed in Fig. 2. As standards for mutant proteins, wild-type Ohr was treated with peroxides (60 μm) and with DTT (100 mm), which provoked the appearance of the monomeric lower (band a) and upper band (band b) respectively. Interestingly, neither C61S nor C125S, in any condition tested, migrated at the same position that the wild-type protein treated with peroxides (60 μm) (band a) (Fig. 6). Therefore, band aobserved for the wild-type protein (Fig. 2) should represent an intramolecular intermediate since any of the mutants can form an intramolecular disulfide bond. This was expected since an intramolecular disulfide bond should lead to a more compact protein configuration that would migrate faster than the other REDOX states. Interestingly, two other bands, named c and d, could also be observed in C125S exposed to oxidative conditions (Fig.6 A). Band d was detected in non-treated C125S (data not shown) as well as in C125S submitted to mild oxidative conditions (Fig. 6 A, lane 7). Under stronger oxidative conditions, band c became predominant and band d disappeared (Fig. 6 A,lane 6 and data not shown). Sometimes a band of ∼30 kDa was observed in substitution of band c after C125S treatment with organic peroxides (data not shown). The meaning ofband c is unknown and could be attribu"

To study the mechanism(s) by which persistent ERK phosphorylation might induce cell growth inhibition, we used Cpd 5 as a tool to examine its effects on the activity of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) transcription factor in Hep3B human hepatoma cells. We found that CREB activity, including its DNA binding ability and phosphorylation on residue Ser-133, was strongly inhibited by Cpd 5, followed by suppression of CRE-mediated transcription of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 genes. Cpd 5-mediated suppression of CREB phosphorylation and transcriptional activity was antagonized by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors PD 98059 and U-0126, implying that this inhibition of CREB activity was regulated at least in part by the ERK pathway. The phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90RSK), a CREB kinase in response to mitogen stimulation, was also found to be inhibited by Cpd 5 action. This inhibition of pp90RSKphosphorylation is likely the result of its increased association with CREB-binding protein (CBP), which subsequently caused inhibition of CREB phosphorylation and activity. To support the hypothesis that Cpd 5 effects on Cdc25A inhibition with subsequent ERK activation could cause CREB inhibition, we examined the effects of Cdc25A inhibition without the use of Cpd 5. Hep3B cells were transfected with C430S Cdc25A mutant, and ERK was found to be phosphorylated in a constitutively activated manner, which was accompanied by decreased CREB phosphorylation and increased recruitment of CBP to pp90RSK. These data provide evidence that CBP·RSK complex formation in response to persistent ERK phosphorylation by Cpd 5 down-regulates CREB activity, leading to inhibition of both cAMP response element-mediated gene expression and cell growth.

In addition to its role as a cAMP-responsive activator, CREB can also be phosphorylated in response to several growth factor and stress signals, which have been shown to promote phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133, with comparable stoichiometry and kinetics (3Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Google Scholar). This growth factor activation of CREB has been shown to be Ras-dependent and to involve the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Although a number of kinases downstream from the MAPKs may also be implicated, members of the pp90RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase, RSK) family have been identified as mitogen-responsive CREB kinases (4Xing J. Ginty D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Google Scholar). For instance, both CREB phosphorylation and c-fostranscriptional induction are drastically impaired in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in human fibroblasts derived from Coffin-Lowry syndrome patients, which carry mutations in the gene encoding the RSK-2 kinase (5De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Google Scholar, 6Trivier E.D. De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Pannetier S. Zackai E. Young I. Mandel J.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Hanauer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 567-570Google Scholar). CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a large pleiotropic cellular coactivator protein which is critical to the execution of a large variety of cellular programs, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. CBP was originally discovered through its interaction with the cellular transcription factor CREB (7Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Google Scholar, 8Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Google Scholar). Protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of a critical Ser-133 on CREB is required for the complex formation between CREB and CBP (9Parker D. Ferreri K. Nakajima T. LaMorte V.J. Evans R. Koerber S.C. Hoeger C. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 694-703Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that CBP can also interact with a multitude of structurally unrelated cellular transcription factors and components of the basal transcription apparatus (10Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Google Scholar). It has been reported that insulin or nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated activation of the Ras pathway represses CREB activity by inducing recruitment of pp90RSK to CBP (11Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Google Scholar). CBP and RSK-2 associate in a complex in quiescent cells, and they dissociate within a few min of mitogenic stimulation (12Merienne K. Pannetier S. Harel-Bellan A. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7089-7096Google Scholar). CBP interacts preferentially with unphosphorylated RSK-2 in a complex where both RSK-2 kinase activity and CBP acetylase activity are inhibited (12Merienne K. Pannetier S. Harel-Bellan A. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7089-7096Google Scholar). Moreover, both CREB and p53 can interact directly with CBP, and phosphorylated CREB mediates recruitment of CBP to p53-responsive promoters through direct interaction with p53 (13Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4849-4858Google Scholar). These reports provide evidence that CBP has a pivotal effect on gene regulation and plays an important role in cellular differentiation and development (14Liu Y.-Z. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Google Scholar). MAPKs are a family of second messenger kinases that are essential for transferring signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (15Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14533-14556Google Scholar, 16Pawson A.J. Adv. Oncol. 1997; 13: 3-9Google Scholar). Among them, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is activated in response to proliferative factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as in response to differentiative factors such as NGF (17Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar). Although ERK is thought to play a key role in the proliferative process, recent studies have also suggested that persistent activation of ERK might mediate cell cycle arrest and differentiation (17Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar, 18Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Google Scholar, 19Pang L.

After activation, phospho-ERK is translocated to the nucleus (20Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1089-1101Google Scholar,21Adachi T. Kar S. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 151-159Google Scholar), where it can phosphorylate transcription factors, leading to altered gene expression (19Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar, 22Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Google Scholar, 23Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Google Scholar). We have shown previously that a Cdc25A protein phosphatase inhibitor, 2-(2-mercaptoethanol)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, or compound 5 (Cpd 5), can induce persistent ERK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which is related to cell growth inhibition in both normal rat hepatocytes and Hep3B human hepatoma cells (24Vogt A. Adachi T. Ducruet A.P. Chesebrough J. Nemoto K. Carr B.I. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20544-20550Google Scholar, 25Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Google Scholar). In the current study, we used Cpd 5 as a tool to explore the mechanism(s) by which persistent ERK phosphorylation regulates transcription factor activity. We found that in Cpd 5-treated Hep3B cells, CREB activity was strongly inhibited, and this inhibition was antagonized by MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors PD 98059 and U-0126. Furthermore, Cpd 5 treatment increased CBP binding to CREB kinase pp90RSK, leading to pp90RSK hypophosphorylation followed by suppression of CREB transcriptional activity. We propose that persistent ERK activation negatively regulates CREB activity via increased association of CBP to pp90RSK. Cells of the Hep3B human hepatoma cell line were maintained in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For experiments comparing the effects of EGF and Cpd 5 on CREB phosphorylation, Hep3B cells were grown in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. After about 75% confluence, Hep3B cells were serum starved for 24 h and then treated with either EGF or Cpd 5 at different time intervals. Cpd 5, a synthetic vitamin K analog, was synthesized as described previously (25Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Google Scholar). Hep3B cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and treated with or without Cpd 5 for various times. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Whole cell extracts (20 μg) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked using Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, then probed with the indicated primary antibody for 1 h. After washing four times with TBST, the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody to allow detection of the appropriate bands using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Hep3B cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously, with some modifications (26Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). Briefly, EGF- or Cpd 5-treated Hep3B cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, then resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C. Nuclei were collected by removing the supernatant and then washed with 500 μl of buffer A without Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged for 15 min at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol (v/v), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 m KCl) and incubated on ice for 60 min. A stock solution giving 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mg/ml chymostatin was added to buffer A and buffer B before use. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, supernatants were collected, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation assay, 100-μg nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein A-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The protein A-agarose pellets were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, boiled in 40 μl of 2 × sample buffer for 5 min, and resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE. The transferred polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was then probed with anti-RSK-1 or anti-phosphoserine antibody to detect the phosphorylation status of CBP and the existence of the CBP·RSK immunocomplex. Consensus CRE oligonucleotides (5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For binding reactions, 1 × 105 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide probes were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (4% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 20 min. Protein·DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of cold or mutant oligonucleotides (5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ATA TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were included in the mixture. A mammalian expression plasmid encoding catalytically inactive C430S mutant Cdc25A in a pcDNA3 vector were generously provided by Dr. Thomas Roberts (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) (27Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out by the LipofectAMINE method following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, Hep3B cells (100,000/well) were plated in six-well plates and transfected with 1.0 μg/well plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) After a 5-h transfection, the medium was replaced with complete growth medium, and the cells were allowed to recover for 48 h. Cells were treated without or with 20 μm Cpd 5, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot or immunoprecipitation assay. Hep3B cells were plated in six-well plates and cotransfected with 1.0 μg/well pCRE-Luc plasmid (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μg/well pIETLacZ (β-galactosidase expression plasmid with cytomegalovirus promoter) (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent for 6 h. Cells were allowed to recover by changing to complete growth medium overnight and were then treated with Cpd 5 at the indicated concentrations. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer provided in the Promega luciferase assay kit and centrifuged to remove the cell debris. The luciferase activity was measured in relative light units using a Monolight Luminometer. The β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (28Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11 (742–743): 739-740Google Scholar). To normalize the transfection efficiency, the luciferase activity was expressed as a ratio of relative light units to the β-galactosidase activity obtained from the same cell lysates. We have shown previously that Cpd 5, a Cdc25A protein phosphatase inhibitor, induced persistent ERK phosphorylation in rat hepatocytes and Hep3B cells, which was in turn related to cell growth inhibition (24Vogt A. Adachi T. Ducruet A.P. Chesebrough J. Nemoto K. Carr B.I. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20544-20550Google Scholar, 25Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Google Scholar, 29Wang Z. Nishikawa Y. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 85-92Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism(s) by which persistent ERK activation causes cell growth inhibition, we examined the transcription factor CREB in Hep3B cells because various signaling routes converge on CREB and control its function by modulating its phosphorylation status (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Google Scholar). Hep3B cells were grown in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum until about 75% confluence, then cells were serum-starved for 24 h. 10 ng/ml EGF or 20 μm Cpd 5 was then added to the medium for periods from 15 to 180 min. After harvest, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and Western blots were performed using anti-phospho-ERK antibody. Fig.1 A shows that EGF induced a transient ERK phosphorylation with a peak at 15 min, which then returned to base line levels at 60 min and disappeared by 180 min. However, Cpd 5 induced a persistent ERK phosphorylation for at least 180 min. For CREB phosphorylation experiments, nuclear extracts were prepared from Hep3B cells treated with either EGF or Cpd 5 as described above, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133) antibody. In contrast to ERK phosphorylation, EGF gradually induced CREB phosphorylation, whereas Cpd 5 inhibited it (Fig.1 B). To support our findings on CREB phosphorylation further, we also examined the CRE DNA binding activity. Hep3B cells were treated with 10 ng/ml EGF or 5–20 μm Cpd 5 for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were used for DNA binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that EGF stimulated CREB DNA binding activity, whereas Cpd 5 inhibited it in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2).Figure 2Cpd 5 inhibited CREB DNA binding activity in a dose-dependent manner. Hep3B cells were treated with 10 ng/ml EGF or 5–20 μm Cpd 5 for 30 min. Nuclear extract preparation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been reported that CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 is required for signal-induced transcription in vivo(30Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Cpd 5-inhibited CREB phosphorylation might effect its transcriptional activity. We first measured CRE-dependent promoter activity in Hep3B cells using the pCRE-Luc reporter plasmid transfection and found that Cpd 5 strongly inhibited the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). Then, we examined two well known products of CREB-regulated gene expression, namely cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. Fig. 3 B shows that EGF had little effect on the expression of either cyclin D1 or Bcl-2, whereas both gene products were strongly suppressed by Cpd 5, as early as 1 h after treatment. This is consistent with our previous findings in rat hepatocytes that Cpd 5-induced rat hepatocyte apoptosis and DNA synthesis were associated with Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 inhibition (29Wang Z. Nishikawa Y. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 85-92Google Scholar,31Carr B.I. Wang Z. Wang M. Kar S. Wilcox C.S. Rosi K. Southwick E. Lazo J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 721-735Google Scholar). Because Cpd 5 induced persistent ERK phosphorylation and suppressed CREB activity, we investigated whether the inhibition of CREB activity was the result of ERK phosphorylation. Hep3B cells were treated with MEK inhibitors PD 98059 (20 μm) or U-0126 (5 μm) for 1 h before the addition of 20 μm Cpd 5. We found that both PD 98059 and U-0126 effectively antagonized the effects of Cpd 5 on ERK and CREB phosphorylation (Fig.4 A). We further evaluated the effects of these MEK inhibitors on CREB-dependent transcriptional activity. Hep3B cells were transiently transfected with pCRE-Luc plasmids. After recovery, the cells were treated with PD 98059 or U-0126 for 1 h before the addition of 20 μm Cpd 5. Fig. 4 B shows that Cpd 5 almost completely inhibited luciferase activity and that both PD 98059 and U-0126 antagonized this inhibition by about 60 and 50%, respectively. These data suggest that the inhibition of CREB activity by Cpd 5 is regulated at least in part by the phosphorylation of ERK pathway. The pp90RSKfamily of serine/threonine kinases has been shown to be activated by the ERK kinase pathway in response to many growth factors, including EGF (32Chen R. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Google Scholar, 33Hsiao K. Chou S. Shih S. Ferrell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5480-5484Google Scholar), and it functions to phosphorylate transcription factors such as CREB (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that Cpd 5 induced a persistent ERK activation and suppressed CREB activity prompted us to examine whether pp90RSK was involved in Cpd 5 actions. We first compared the effects of EGF and Cpd 5 on RSK-1 phosphorylation at residues Ser-380, Thr-359/Ser-363, and Thr-574 because the phosphorylation at these residues is thought to be related to ERK kinase activity (34Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Google Scholar). We found that EGF moderately stimulated RSK-1 phosphorylation at these residues, but Cpd 5 had an inhibitory effect on them. Cpd 5 strongly inhibited RSK-1 phosphorylation at Ser-380 and Thr-574 and moderately inhibited phosphorylation at Thr-359/Ser-363 (Fig.5 A). To examine the relationship between RSK and ERK phosphorylation, we used PD 98059 and U-0126 to determine whether these MEK inhibitors could reverse the inhibitory effects of Cpd 5 on RSK phosphorylation. Fig. 5 Bshows that both PD 98059 and U-0126 effectively antagonized Cpd 5-mediated RSK hypophosphorylation at Ser-380, suggesting that persistent ERK activation by Cpd 5 mediated inhibition of RSK phosphorylation. The Ras-ERK pathway has been shown to up-regulate a number of nuclear factors via a cascade of kinases to phosphorylate these factors in response to mitogenic signals. Our experiments showed that the growth-inhibiting Cpd 5-induced persistent ERK phosphorylation suppressed RSK kinase and subsequently CREB activity. These results led us to speculate that CBP might play an important role in controlling CREB-regulated gene expression because it has been reported that insulin or NGF suppressed CREB transcriptional activity via recruitment of RSK to CBP (11Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Google Scholar). To investigate whether Cpd 5-induced persistent ERK phosphorylation increased recruitment of RSK to CBP, Hep3B cells were serum starved for 24 h and then treated with EGF or Cpd 5 for the indicated times (15–60 min). Nuclear extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody and then Western blotted with anti-RSK1 and anti-phosphoserine antibodies. Fig.6 shows that after stimulation by EGF, CBP serine phosphorylation and its binding to RSK-1 were decreased, whereas Cpd 5 treatment enhanced both CBP phosphorylation and CBP·RSK-1 complex formation. Because Cdc25A protein phosphatase has multiple protein substrates and Cpd 5-induced persistent ERK phosphorylation is partially related to its inhibitory effects on Cdc25A activity, we thus examined whether Cdc25A was able to dephosphorylate phosphorylated CBP directly and inhibition of Cdc25A activity by Cpd 5 could result in CBP phosphorylation. We used Cpd 5-treated Hep3B cell nuclear extracts as the source of phosphorylated CBP, which were immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody and incubated with 25 units of recombinant active GST-Cdc25A protein (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence or absence of 10 μm Cpd 5 pretreatment in 1 × phosphatase buffer at 30 °C for 10 min. We found that GST-Cdc25A had no dephosphorylation effect on phosphorylated CBP, and pretreatment of GST-Cdc25A with Cpd 5 did not alter CBP phosphorylation status either (data not shown). These data provide evidence that persistent, but not transient, ERK phosphorylation is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of CBP and thus an increase in the binding of CBP to RSK-1. This increased binding of CBP to RSK is an important mechanism in the negative regulation of CREB activity. We have reported previously that Cdc25A has a direct dephosphorylation effect on ERK kinase, and the inhibition of Cdc25A activity by Cpd 5 contributes to persistent ERK phosphorylation (24Vogt A. Adachi T. Ducruet A.P. Chesebrough J. Nemoto K. Carr B.I. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20544-20550Google Scholar). We therefore expected that Cdc25A mutation might cause a constitutive-like ERK phosphorylation, which would also negatively regulate CREB·RSK activity. To confirm our hypothesis, Hep3B cells were transiently transfected with C430S Cdc25A mutant and then treated with or without Cpd 5 for 60 min. Fig.7, top lane, shows that C430S Cdc25A transfection resulted in strong basal ERK phosphorylation compared with wild-type Hep3B cells. Cpd 5 treatment also induced ERK phosphorylation in cultures of C430S transfected cells, which is caused by the coexistence of an admixture of the wild-type cells. CREB Ser-133 and RSK-1 Ser-380 phosphorylation were almost completely suppressed in C430S Hep3B cells. Furthermore, CBP and RSK-1 coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Cdc25A mutation caused a much stronger CBP·RSK-1 association in untreated cells containing the Cdc25A mutant compared with the Cpd 5-treated wild-type cells. These data further support our above observations that persistent ERK phosphorylation caused by Cdc25A inhibition down-regulates CREB phosphorylation and activity, likely via the recruitment of CBP to hypophosphorylated RSK-1. We have reported previously that both EGF and Cpd 5, a protein phosphatase Cdc25A inhibitor, activate the MAPK pathway in normal rat hepatocytes, human hepatoma cells, and multiple other cell types (21Adachi T. Kar S. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 151-159Google Scholar,25Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Google Scholar, 35Osada S. Osada K. Carr B.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 765-772Google Scholar). However, EGF induces hepatocyte DNA synthesis and Hep3B cell growth, whereas Cpd 5 mediates an inhibitory effect on the growth of both cell types. This paradox is probably caused by the duration and strength of the ERK phosphorylation: EGF induces a transient and weak ERK phosphorylation without significant nuclear translocation, and Cpd 5 induces a persistent and strong ERK phosphorylation with dramatic nuclear translocation (21Adachi T. Kar S. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 151-159Google Scholar, 24Vogt A. Adachi T. Ducruet A.P. Chesebrough J. Nemoto K. Carr B.I. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20544-20550Google Scholar, 25Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Google Scholar). In the current study, we extended our previous investigations to explore the mechanism(s) by which persistent ERK activation inhibits cell growth. We established a persistent endogenous ERK phosphorylation model using Cpd 5 as a tool to examine how it regulates the function of the CREB transcription factor. We found that Cpd 5 inhibited CREB activity, including CREB phosphorylation and DNA binding ability, and subsequently CREB-regulated Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 expression. The inhibitory effect of Cpd 5 on CREB activity was most likely mediated by ERK phosphorylation because MEK inhibitors PD 98059 and U-0126 partially blocked Cpd 5-mediated CREB hypophosphorylation and inhibition of CREB-regulated gene transcription. We cannot role out, however, that other signal pathways may also be involved in regulating Cpd 5-induced suppression of CREB transcriptional activity. We showed previously that Cpd 5 induced multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated protein bands (36Ni R.-Z. Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9906-9911Google Scholar), implying that multiple phosphatases are likely involved. Furthermore, in Cdc25A mutant C430S-transfected Hep3B cells, CREB was in a hypophosphorylation state similar to wild-type Hep3B cells treated with Cpd 5 because Cdc25A is thought to be an ERK phosphatase, and C430S transfection is able to induce a constitutive-like ERK phosphorylation (24Vogt A. Adachi T. Ducruet A.P. Chesebrough J. Nemoto K. Carr B.I. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20544-20550Google Scholar). Although the MAPK pathway has been shown to function in the stimulation of cellular proliferation (37Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar), we provide evidence here that persistent ERK activation can also lead to suppression of CREB activity and inhibition of cell growth. A role for MAPK pathway signaling in growth arrest or cellular differentiation is not unprecedented. For instance, it has been reported that MAPK is necessary for differentiation of thymocytes (38Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Google Scholar), and in PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells, NGF-induced cellular differentiation and cell cycle arrest are accompanied by a prolonged increase in MAPK activity and by inhibition of CDK activity through induction of the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1/WAF1 (18Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Google Scholar, 39Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6122-6132Google Scholar, 40Park D.S. Farninelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8161-8169Google Scholar). In contrast to these reports, which showed an increased transcriptional activity by persistent ERK activation, our results indicated that Cpd 5-induced persistent ERK phosphorylation resulted in an inhibition of CREB transcriptional activity. CREB was originally identified as a target of the cAMP signaling pathway, but studies on activation of immediate-early genes revealed that CREB is a target of other signaling pathways, including ERK (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Google Scholar). ERK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are thought to phosphorylate and activate CREB kinase RSKs, which then phosphorylate CREB at Ser-133, thus inducing its transcriptional activity (32Chen R. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Google Scholar, 33Hsiao K. Chou S. Shih S. Ferrell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5480-5484Google Scholar, 34Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Google Scholar). We therefore examined three different RSK-1 phosphorylation sites, Ser-380, Thr-359/Ser-363, and Thr-574, which were believed to be regulated by ERK phosphorylation and related to RSK activity (34Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Google Scholar, 41Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Google Scholar), and we found that EGF slightly induced the phosphorylation of each of these three sites, but Cpd 5 strongly inhibited their phosphorylation. These results imply that CREB hypophosphorylation was caused by inhibition of its kinase RSK-1 activity. Cpd 5-induced ERK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation resulted in enhanced ERK kinase activity, using Elk-1 and myelin-based protein as substrates (21Adachi T. Kar S. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 151-159Google Scholar). So why is it that EGF-induced transient ERK activation can phosphorylate RSK-1, whereas Cpd 5-induced persistent ERK phosphorylation results in an opposite effect on RSK-1 phosphorylation and on cell growth? This puzzle has prompted us to consider that CBP may interfere with the ERK-RSK interaction because it has been reported that growth factor-dependent activation of MAPK pathway can repress RSK and CREB activity by inducing recruitment of CBP to RSK (11Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Google Scholar, 12Merienne K. Pannetier S. Harel-Bellan A. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7089-7096Google Scholar). CBP was originally regarded as a bridging protein, bringing together proteins of the RNA polymerase II-dependent basal transcription complex with specific transcription factors (42Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Google Scholar, 43Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Google Scholar). However, recent studies have found that CBP functions as a coactivator for many signal-dependent factors. Indeed, CBP has been shown to interact with ERK and RSK and even to be phosphorylated by ERK kinase. For instance, NGF can induce formation of the pp90RSK·CBP complex, which appears to be essential for induction of NGF-responsive genes (11Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Google Scholar), and ERK has been found to interact functionally with CBP and mediate NGF-induced up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of CBP, possibly through stimulating CBP phosphorylation (14Liu Y.-Z. Chrivia J.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Google Scholar, 44Zanger K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 551-558Google Scholar). Our data show that Cpd 5-induced ERK activation resulted in CBP phosphorylation and enhanced its binding to RSK-1, thus inhibiting RSK-1 phosphorylation. To rule out the possibility of Cdc25A-CBP direct interaction, we used purified active Cdc25A to dephosphorylate phosphorylated CBP, and no direct CBP dephosphorylation was found. We hypothesize that increased association of CBP with RSK-1 makes RSK-1 unavailable for phosphorylation by ERK kinase, and inactivated RSK-1 in turn fails to phosphorylate CREB, eventually leading to transcriptional suppression and cell growth inhibition (Fig. 8). This finding is consistent with a current report showing that CBP preferentially interacts with unphosphorylated RSK-2 in a complex where both RSK-2 kinase and CBP acetylase activity are inhibited (12Merienne K. Pannetier S. Harel-Bellan A. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7089-7096Google Scholar). Taken together, we provide evidence here that persistently activated and nuclear translocated ERK is able to phosphorylate coactivator CBP, which then binds to RSK and interferes with RSK phosphorylation by ERK, leading to negative regulation of CREB-mediated gene transcription and cell proliferation. This observation can partially explain our puzzle over the functional significance of transient versus persistent activation of ERK signaling. It seems that the differential end results of transient versus persistent signaling are caused entirely by the intensity and duration of the same molecules having different effects on gene transcription and cell growth. Although we can clearly correlate the activity of persistent ERK phosphorylation with one set of molecular consequences and transient phosphorylation correlates with another set, we have still to explain in molecular terms how these differential consequences occur."

To date, the precise contribution of each pathway has been difficult to ascertain. Evidence has accumulated to suggest that the InsP3 receptor pathway has a primary role in causing Ca2+ release and egg activation. However, this was recently called into question by a report implicating NO as the primary egg activator. In the present study we pursue the hypothesis that NO is a primary egg activator in sea urchin eggs and build on previous findings that an NO/cGMP/cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) pathway is active at fertilization in sea urchin eggs to define its role. Using a fluorescence indicator of NO levels, we have measured both NO and Ca2+ at fertilization and establish that NO levels rise after, not before, the Ca2+ wave is initiated and that this rise is Ca2+-dependent. By inhibiting the increase in NO at fertilization, we find not that the Ca2+transient is abolished but that the duration of the transient is significantly reduced. The latency and rise time of the transient are unaffected. This effect is mirrored by the inhibition of cGMP and cADPR signaling in sea urchin eggs at fertilization. We establish that cADPR is generated at fertilization, at a time comparable to the time of the rise in NO levels. We conclude that NO is unlikely to be a primary egg activator but, rather, acts after the initiation of the Ca2+ wave to regulate the duration of the fertilization Ca2+ transient.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2333-2342Google Scholar). Sea urchin eggs contain both InsP31 and ryanodine receptor channels. The microinjection of either InsP3, ryanodine, or the ryanodine receptor agonist cADPR mobilizes [Ca2+]i and activates eggs (4Whitaker M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 636-639Google Scholar, 5Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Reg. 1990; 1: 279-290Google Scholar, 6Shen S.S. Buck W.R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 157-169Google Scholar). The presence of these receptors in sea urchin eggs has been demonstrated immunologically (7McPherson S.M. McPherson P.S. Mathews L. Campbell K.P. Longo F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1111-1121Google Scholar, 8Parys J.B. McPherson S.M. Mathews L. Campbell K.P. Longo F.J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 466-476Google Scholar), and a sea urchin ryanodine receptor has now been cloned (9Shiwa M. Murayama T. Ogawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R727-R737Google Scholar). Both these channel types contribute to the Ca2+ transient at fertilization. Studies have shown that microinjection of the InsP3 receptor antagonist heparin in conjunction with antagonists of the ryanodine receptor, such as ruthenium red and the cADPR inhibitor 8-amino-cADPR, block the Ca2+ transient at fertilization (10Galione A. McDougall A Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Google Scholar, 11Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Google Scholar). Injection with heparin alone, unless used at relatively high concentrations (12Mohri T. Ivonnet P.I. Chambers E.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 139-157Google Scholar), does not abolish the fertilization Ca2+ transient (10Galione A. McDougall A Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M.

Cell Reg. 1991; 2: 121-133Google Scholar). cADPR and ryanodine receptor antagonists block the transient only in the presence of InsP3 antagonists (10Galione A. McDougall A Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Google Scholar, 11Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Google Scholar), if at all (14Lee S.S Christenson L. Martin T. Shen S.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 324-335Google Scholar). The precise roles of the InsP3 and ryanodine receptor pathways at fertilization in sea urchins have been more difficult to ascertain. There is evidence to suggest that the InsP3receptor pathway has a primary role in causing Ca2+ release and egg activation. InsP3 is produced by members of the phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme family and has been shown to be generated at fertilization (15Turner P.R. Sheetz M.P. Jaffe L.A.

Kontani K. Kanda Y. Katada T. Nakano T. Satoh Y. Suzuki N. Kuroda H. Development. 2001; 128: 4405-4414Google Scholar). Chemical inhibitors of PLC, pentosan polysulfate and U73122, can abolish fertilization Ca2+ transients in sea urchin eggs (12Mohri T. Ivonnet P.I. Chambers E.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 139-157Google Scholar, 17Lee S.-J. Shen S.S. Dev. Biol. 1998; 193: 195-208Google Scholar). Molecular inhibition studies, using dominant negative PLCγSH2 domain constructs, show that sperm-activated Ca2+ release and egg activation are markedly delayed, then blocked, when activation of this enzyme is inhibited (19Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Google Scholar, 20Carroll D.J. Albay D.T. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. Foltz K.R. Dev.

In mouse eggs, diffusion of a newly characterized PLC, PLCζ, from sperm to egg triggers Ca2+oscillations and embryo development (22Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest an InsP3-based initiation mechanism for the fertilization calcium wave. Nonetheless an NO-mediated pathway has been proposed to be the primary mechanism for egg activation (23Kuo R.C. Baxter G.T. Thompson S.H. Stricker S.A. Patton C. Bonaventura J. Epel D. Nature. 2000; 406: 633-636Google Scholar). In sea urchins the external application of NO to intact eggs and egg homogenates generates Ca2+ transients, although this doesn't lead to egg activation (24Sethi J.K. Empson R.M. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 613-617Google Scholar, 25Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Google Scholar). Eggs can be activated when microinjected with an NO donor (23Kuo R.C. Baxter G.T. Thompson S.H. Stricker S.A. Patton C. Bonaventura J. Epel D. Nature. 2000; 406: 633-636Google Scholar). Ca2+ elevation in eggs by NO has been demonstrated to require the operation of a cGMP-mediated synthesis of cADPR (24Sethi J.K. Empson R.M. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 613-617Google Scholar, 25Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Google Scholar), and levels of cGMP (26Ciapa B. Epel D.

Development. 2001; 128: 4405-4414Google Scholar) and cADPR (18Kuroda R. Kontani K. Kanda Y. Katada T. Nakano T. Satoh Y. Suzuki N. Kuroda H. Development. 2001; 128: 4405-4414Google Scholar) are known to rise at fertilization in sea urchin eggs. Kuo and coworkers (23Kuo R.C. Baxter G.T. Thompson S.H. Stricker S.A. Patton C. Bonaventura J. Epel D. Nature. 2000; 406: 633-636Google Scholar) found that microinjection of an NO scavenger into eggs abolished the fertilization Ca2+ transient and prevented egg activation. Microinjection of recombinant nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) and calmodulin was sufficient to fully activate eggs, indicating that NOS substrates were present. The measurement of an increase in endogenous NO in fertilized eggs very soon after sperm-egg fusion using a fluorescent indicator dye supported the proposition that an NO rise might trigger the Ca2+ wave and egg activation; NO and Ca2+ were not measured simultaneously, so the precise temporal relationship between the NO rise and the Ca2+transient could only be inferred (23Kuo R.C. Baxter G.T. Thompson S.H. Stricker S.A. Patton C. Bonaventura J. Epel D. Nature. 2000; 406: 633-636Google Scholar). It was pointed out that initiation of the Ca2+ transient by NO was unlikely to be due to the activation of a pathway mediated by cADPR, because antagonists of this pathway alone cannot block fertilization. A more recent study of two separate chordate species, where NO and Ca2+ were measured simultaneously, could detect no NO increases either prior to, or after, the generation of the Ca2+ transient, or obtain abolition of the transient with NO-signaling inhibitors (27Hyslop L.A. Carroll M. Nixon V.L. McDougall A. Jones K.T. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 216-230Google Scholar). We, and others, were also concerned that the NO indicator dye used by Kuo and co-workers (23Kuo R.C. Baxter G.T. Thompson S.H. Stricker S.A. Patton C. Bonaventura J. Epel D. Nature. 2000; 406: 633-636Google Scholar), diaminofluorescein (DAF-2), might also report the post-fertilization pH increase that occurs in sea urchins (2Whitaker M.J. Steinhardt R.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1982; 15: 593-666Google Scholar). The fluorescent product of the reaction of DAF-2 with NO is said to exhibit pH-dependent fluorescence intensity (28Kojima H. Urano Y. Kikuchi K. Higuchi T. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 3209-3212Google Scholar). This report contributes to the debate on the relative roles of the InsP3 and ryanodine receptor pathways at fertilization in sea urchin eggs. We have focused on the specific role of NO and the cADPR-regulated ryanodine receptor pathway. We have examined the temporal relationship between NO and Ca2+ in sea urchin eggs at fertilization by simultaneously measuring these signaling components. By using specific inhibitors we establish that an NO/cGMP/cADPR pathway plays a major role in regulating the later phase of the fertilization Ca2+ transient, supporting the view that the general role of the NO pathway is to enhance and sustain Ca2+ signals independently of other signaling pathways (25Willmott N. Sethi J.K. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. White A.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3699-3705Google Scholar). We have been unable to confirm an early role for NO in initiating the events that lead to egg activation in the sea urchin at fertilization. Eggs were obtained by ovulating female Psammechinus miliaris (Marine Biological Station, Millport, Isle of Cumbrae, Scotland) or Lytechinus pictus (Marinus, Long Beach, CA) with an intracoelomic injection of 0.5 m KCl solution. The jelly was removed by several passages through Nitex mesh, and the eggs were suspended in artificial sea water (ASW: 410 mm NaCl, 39 mmMgCl2, 15 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, at pH 8.0). Unless otherwise stated, treatments and their corresponding controls were carried out on the same batches of eggs. To visualize NO, we examined the specificity of two available fluorescent indicators, DAF-2, and the more recently available dye DAF-FM. We compared changes in fluorescence of the two dyes in eggs at fertilization, with and without the addition of 100 ॖm5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride hydrochloride (DMA) to block the Na+/H+ antiporter and thus prevent pH increases (29Rees B.B. Patton C. Grainger J.L. Epel D. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 683-698Google Scholar, 30Swann K. Whitaker M. Nature. 1985; 314: 274-277Google Scholar). DAF-2 responses were largely abolished in eggs fertilized in DMA (DAF-2 fluorescence levels 200 s post-fertilization were on average 9 ± 0.77 higher than resting levels (n = 6), whereas in the presence of DMA the increase was just 2 ± 0.67 (n = 5)). DAF-FM responses were not abolished by DMA treatment. We confirmed that DAF-FM loaded into unfertilized sea urchin eggs reported NO increases by the external application of 5.7 mm of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (which caused a 6 ± 27 fluorescence increase above resting levels after 5 min in four eggs) and that the fluorescence did not increase with the addition of 10 mm NH4Cl (fluorescence levels fell 2 ± 0.57 below resting after 5 min in four eggs), which is known to cause an elevation in cytosolic pH in sea urchin eggs (31Shen S.S. Steinhardt R.A. Nature. 1978; 272: 253-254Google Scholar). Due to its specificity, DAF-FM was our indicator of choice for measuring NO changes. Eggs of P. miliaris were transferred to poly-d-lysine (10 mg/ml)-coated glass coverslips and maintained at 16 °C in ASW. Fura-2 dextran, pentapotassium salt (10,000 Mr, 10 mm in the pipette, Molecular Probes) in a buffer consisting of 0.5 mKCl, 20 mm PIPES, 0.1 mm EGTA at pH 6.8, was pulsed into eggs with drawn borosilicate glass micropipettes (GC150F-10, Clark Electromedical Instruments) using gas pressure, to a final concentration of ∼50–100 ॖm. Injection volumes did not exceed 1.57 of the cell volume. Following injection, eggs were incubated in ASW containing 50 ॖm DAF-FM DA for 15 min, followed by a 30–40 min post-incubation step in ASW, or a 15-min post-incubation step in ASW followed by 15 min in low sodium ASW (50 mm NaCl, 360 mm choline Cl, 39 mmMgCl2, 15 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm KHCO3, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.0) supplemented with 100 ॖm DMA with fertilization being carried out in this medium. For DAF-2 experiments, 50 ॖm DAF-2 DA was added externally to eggs, and the procedure followed was then the same as that for DAF-FM loading in the absence of DMA. Oxyhemoglobin (Sigma, H-0267, lot 20K7618; 467 purity, assayed spectroscopically) was co-loaded with fura-2 dextran, whereas dibromo-BAPTA was loaded into cells previously injected with fura-2 dextran, prior to incubation with DAF-FM followed by 100 ॖm DMA. Because inhibiting the fertilization pH changes was found to result in enhanced NO production and Ca2+ transients of longer duration, experiments using oxyhemoglobin and dibromo-BAPTA were performed in the presence of DMA, so that differences in levels of NO produced and the Ca2+transient generated due to the antagonists were more readily apparent when compared with controls. All work was carried out at 16 °C, and all post-injection steps were performed under red light. Eggs were illuminated on a stage of a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope using a 100-watt mercury lamp light source and a UV-F 20× numerical aperture 0.8 objective (Nikon). Simultaneous Ca2+ and NO levels were measured using narrow band-pass filters (350, 380, and 490 nm, Chroma) housed in a Lambda 10-2 filter wheel (Sutter Instrument Co.), and a polychroic beamsplitter (61000v2bs, Chroma) with emission filter (61000v2m, Chroma). Images were collected using a charge-coupled device camera (Photometrix Coolsnap fx, Roper Scientific). Both the filter wheel and acquisition by the charge-coupled device camera were controlled by Metafluor software version 4.0 (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was determined by ratioing average fluorescence intensity values calculated from the images excited at 350 and 380 nm, and standard CaCl2 solutions were used to calibrate the system with corrections for viscosity (32Poenie M. Alderton J. Tsein R.Y. Steinhardt R.A. Nature. 1985; 315: 147-149Google Scholar). Images were processed by IDL software (Research Systems Inc.) on an Indigo 2 workstation (Silicon Graphics). All compounds were introduced into eggs of L. pictus using the same injection buffer and procedure as above. The amount injected never exceeded 17 of cell volume. For treatments involving cGMP, eggs were double-injected, first with fura-2 dextran (final concentration of ∼20 ॖm) or fura-2 dextran and ॆ-NAD+ or inhibitors, and then with cGMP or injection buffer (control). For inhibitor treatments, control responses to cGMP were performed after each experiment on eggs from the same batch to exclude the possibility of a reduction in responsiveness to cGMP with time. Ca2+ levels were measured using ratio photometry and calibrated as described previously (3Swann K. Whitaker M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2333-2342Google Scholar). (Rp)-cAMP-S (final concentration, 2–4 mm) was co-loaded into eggs of L. pictus with fura-2 dextran (final concentration, ∼100 ॖm) and Ca2+ levels measured and calibrated as for the simultaneous Ca2 + and NO experiments, replacing the polychroic beamsplitter and emission filter with a 400-nm dichroic and 510-nm band-pass emission filter (Nikon). Eggs of L. pictus were prepared as above and microinjected with a mixture of fura-2 pentapotassium salt and 8-NH2-cADPR (final intracellular concentration of ∼10 ॖm for both compounds) in injection buffer (0.5 m KCl, 20 mm PIPES, at pH 6.7). Experiments were performed at 20–22 °C. Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was determined by ratioing fluorescence intensities at 340 and 380 nm using an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Ratio images were obtained using a fluorometric imaging system (monochromator, TILL Photonics, Germany) and Ionvision software (Improvision Ltd., UK) as described previously (33Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Google Scholar). Eggs of L. pictus (0.8–1.5 ml) were dejellied, washed twice in ASW, and made to a final volume of 20 ml with ASW. 350 ॖl of sperm was added, and the solution continuously mixed. At given time points, 2-ml aliquots were removed and centrifuged for 6 s at 6000 rpm. Excess ASW was removed, and eggs were treated with 3 m perchloric acid (1:1 w/v). The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were neutralized with 2 mKHCO3. To remove contaminating nucleotides that weakly interfere with [32P]cADPR binding, tissue samples were treated with NADglycohydrolase (0.25 unit/ml), nucleotide pyrophosphatase (1.75 units/ml), alkaline phosphatase (50 units/ml), and apyrase (5 units/ml) for 4 h, as described previously (34Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 230-241Google Scholar). Acid extracts were stored at −20 °C prior to use in the radioreceptor assay. The binding assay was performed as previously described (35Wilson H.L. Dipp M. Thomas J.M. Lad C. Galione A. Evans A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11180-11188Google Scholar). Briefly, tracer [32P]cADPR was synthesized from a high specific activity (1000 Ci/nmol) radiolabeled form of its precursor [32P]NAD+. The cyclization reaction was carried out for 2 h at room temperature using 250 mCi of [32P]NAD+, 100 ng ml−1 of ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. cADPR was purified using high-performance liquid chromatography, and fractions containing cADPR were neutralized with Tris base. The binding assay consisted of sea urchin egg homogenate made up to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml protein in IM buffer (333 mmN-methylglucamine, 333 mmpotassium acetate, 27 mm HEPES, 1.3 mmMgCl2; pH titrated to 7.2 with acetic acid). Approximately 22.5 fmol of [32P]cADPR was incubated with homogenate in a total volume of 250 ml for 10 min at room temperature. The binding reaction was terminated by rapid filtration with a Brandel cell harvester using GF/B filters washed immediately before filtration with ice-cold IM and washed twice with 2–4 ml of ice-cold IM immediately after filtration. Radioactivity retained on the filters was determined using standard scintillation counting techniques. Inhibitory effects of acid extracts on [32P]cADPR binding were compared with standard curves constructed using authentic cADPR. As a control, each sample was heat treated at 85 °C for 45 min to hydrolyze the cADPR to ADPR. The inhibitory effect on [32P]cADPR binding of all samples was abolished by heat treatment. 5,5′-Dibromo-BAPTA tetrapotassium salt and fura-2 dextran pentapotassium salt were purchased from Molecular Probes. 4,5-Diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA), 3-amino-4-aminomethyl-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM DA), sodium nitroprusside, and adenosine cyclic 3′,5′-monophosphorothioate,Rp isomer ((Rp)-cAMP-S) were purchased fromCalbiochem. 8-Bromo-cADPR was synthesized as described previously (36Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Average pixel intensity values for 350-, 380-, and 490-nm excitation wavelengths were determined from a region of interest bordering the outside of labeled eggs using Metafluor image analysis software and background subtracted using values determined from a specified background region. DAF-2 and DAF-FM intensity values were baseline-corrected using the measured resting values recorded prior to insemination. Statistical analyses used a Student t test (one-tail, unpaired). Data were expressed as the means ± S.E. for n eggs tested. DAF-FM is said to be a more faithful indicator of NO above pH 5.8 (28Kojima H. Urano Y. Kikuchi K. Higuchi T. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 3209-3212Google Scholar) and has been used to image NO production in several cell types, including rat neuronal cells and smooth muscle cells (37Kojima H. Hirata M. Kudo Y. Kikuchi K. Nagano T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1404-1410Google Scholar, 38Itoh Y. Ma F.H. Hoshi H. Oka M. Noda K. Ukai Y. Kojima H. Nagano T. Toda N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 203-209Google Scholar). We confirmed the specificity of DAF-FM in sea urchin eggs at fertilization (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). Using DAF-FM, in combination with the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2, we were able to simultaneously measure NO and Ca2+ levels in intact eggs at fertilization. Simultaneous measurements of Ca2+ and DAF-FM fluorescence demonstrated that DAF-FM was not directly sensing Ca2+ under our experimental conditions. In P. miliaris eggs loaded with DAF-FM and subsequently fertilized, an increase in fluorescence was found to occur after the onset of the Ca2+ wave (Fig. 1,A and B). On average, DAF-FM fluorescence started to increase 68.4 ± 5.4 s post-fertilization (PF) or 5.3 ± 4.2 s after peak Ca2+ levels were reached (n = 16). Increases in DAF-FM fluorescence were not attenuated when eggs were fertilized in low sodium sea water in the presence of 100 ॖm5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride hydrochloride (DMA, Fig. 1B) to block the Na+/H+antiporter and thus prevent an elevation of the pH (29Rees B.B. Patton C. Grainger J.L. Epel D. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 683-698Google Scholar, 30Swann K. Whitaker M. Nature. 1985; 314: 274-277Google Scholar). We observed differences in the shape of the fertilization Ca2+transient when DMA-treated, DAF-FM-loaded eggs were compared with those loaded with DAF-FM only (Fig. 1B, panel i). The duration of the Ca2+ transient was significantly prolonged. The time taken for [Ca2+]i to fall to 257 of the peak level was 189.8 ± 5.5 s (n = 16) in control eggs compared with 263.6 ± 6 s in DMA-treated (n= 14, p = < 0.001, t test). The response of DAF-FM was also affected (Fig. 1B, panel ii). The magnitude of the response was significantly greater (the DAF-FM fluorescence levels, 200 s PF, were an average of 6.9 ± 0.97 greater than resting in DMA-treated eggs and 3.9 ± 0.47 greater than resting in untreated eggs; p = <0.01,t test). These results confirm that NO levels increase in sea urchin eggs at fertilization and that this rise occurs during the period of sustained Ca2+ elevation after the Ca2+ wave has been generated. Interestingly, the enhanced levels of NO production in fertilized eggs in which the pH change is inhibited correlate with a Ca2+ transient of increased duration. It has been reported that the fluorescence levels of the NO indicator DAF-2 increase very early during the fertilization response and the consequent suggestion is that NO is a very early player in the fertilization signaling cascade (23Kuo R.C. Baxter G.T. Thompson S.H. Stricker S.A. Patton C. Bonaventura J. Epel D. Nature. 2000; 406: 633-636Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed whole egg average fluorescence intensity immediately after sperm-egg fusion, in DAF-2-loaded eggs of P. miliaris (50 ॖm, applied externally) fertilized in normal sea water (n = 11), and DAF-FM loaded eggs with and without the addition of DMA (n = 30) and failed to find the small increases in fluorescence previously observed. Careful inspection of both DAF-2 (Fig. 1C, panel i) and DAF-FM fluorescence images (Fig. 1C, panel ii) at the point of initiation of the fertilization Ca2+ transient again offered no confirmation of these earlier observations. Analysis of a 30-ॖm diameter region (average egg diameter, 120 ॖm) at the point of sperm egg fusion (as defined by the initial Ca2+ increase) in 17 eggs did not reveal any local increase in fluorescence. We estimate that, given the noise in our measurements, if a local NO increase occurs, the fluorescence increase locally must be <0.37 above mean resting values for DAF-FM-labeled eggs and <0.87 for those labeled with DAF-2. Oxyhemoglobin scavenges NO (39Wennmalm A. Benthin G. Peterson A.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 507-508Google Scholar, 40Pietraforte D. Mallozzi C. Scorza G. Minetti M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7177-7185Google Scholar, 41Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9027-9032Google Scholar). To determine whether prolongation of the Ca2+ transient that we observed in DMA-treated eggs was due to NO production, we microinjected oxyhemoglobin (12–28 ॖm) into DMA-treatedP. miliaris eggs. Oxyhemoglobin both delayed and very markedly attenuated the post-fertilization increase in DAF-FM fluorescence (Fig. 1D). In control eggs, the start of the DAF-FM fluorescence increase was observed 60.6 ± 8 s after peak [Ca2+]i (108.2 ± 8.1 s PF,n = 10), whereas in oxyhemoglobin loaded eggs, where an increase occurred, it was significantly later, at 128.6 ± 12.6 s after the [Ca2+]i peak (171.7 ± 13 s PF, n = 8, p < 0.001,t test). In oxyhemoglobin-loaded eggs DAF-FM increased on average only 1.0 ± 0.47 above resting levels 200 s PF (n = 10), whereas control eggs showed a 7.3 ± 0.87 increase (n = 10, p < 0.001,t test). For two out of ten oxyhemoglobin-loaded eggs, no increase in DAF-FM fluorescence was detected during fertilization, but Ca2+ transients leading to egg activation did occur. In the presence of oxyhemoglobin, the latency, magnitude, and rise time of the fertilization Ca2+ transient was unaffected. The average control latency, rise time, and amplitude were 27.3 ± 1.5 s, 21.6 ± 0.8 s, and 1.04 ± 0.1 ॖm, respectively, in control eggs (n = 10), and the corresponding values for 10 oxyhemoglobin-loaded eggs were 24.1 ± 1.3 s, 22.5 ± 2.7 s, and 1.1 ± 0.06 ॖm. However, the rate at which calcium decreases after the [Ca2+]i peak was significantly increased. The time taken for a fall to 257 of peak [Ca2+]i was 243.1 ± 14.6 s (n = 10) in control eggs, compared with 192.9 ± 9.9 s in oxyhemoglobin-loaded eggs (n = 10, p < 0.01, t test). These observations show that inhibiting the NO rise in sea urchin eggs does not abolish the fertilization Ca2+ transient and has no effect on the initiation or rate of rise of the transient. However, inhibiting the NO rise shortens the transient. Because enhanced NO levels lengthen the transient (Fig. 1B), these data imply a causal relationship between NO production and Ca2+transient duration. It has been demonstrated that the treatment of unfertilized eggs with the calcium ionophore ionomycin causes NO production as measured by the accumulation of nitrite (23Kuo R.C. Baxter G.T. Thompson S.H. Stricker S.A. Patton C. Bonaventura J. Epel D. Nature. 2000; 406: 633-636Google Scholar). The Ca2+ c"

Using a yeast three-hybrid system, we demonstrated that, in addition to full-length La protein, both N- and C-terminal halves were able to interact with HCV IRES in vivo. The exogenous addition of purified full-length and truncated La proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate showed dose-dependent stimulation of HCV IRES-mediated translation. However, an additive effect was achieved adding the terminal halves together in the reaction, suggesting that both might play critical roles in achieving full stimulatory activity of the full-length La protein. Using computational analysis, three-dimensional structures of the RNA recognition motifs (RRM) of the La protein were independently modeled. Of the three putative RRMs, RRM2 was predicted to have a good binding pocket for the interaction with the HCV IRES around the GCAC motif near the initiator AUG and RRM3 binds perhaps in a different location. This observation was further investigated by the filter-binding and toe-printing assays. The results presented here strongly suggest that both the N- and C-terminal halves can interact independently with the HCV IRES and are involved in stimulating internal initiation of translation.

Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Google Scholar). HCV has been shown to be the primary causative agent of non-A, non-B viral hepatitis, which often leads to development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (2Houghton M. Weiner A. Han J. Kuo G. Choo Q.-L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 381-388Google Scholar, 3Saito I. Miyamura T. Ohbayashi A. Harada H. Katayama T. Kikuchi S. Watanabe Y. Koi S. Onji M. Ohta Y. Choo Q.-L. Houghton M. Kuo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6547-6549Google Scholar). The HCV genome RNA is ∼9.5 kb in length and consists of a 5′-untranslated region (UTR), a long open reading frame encoding the viral polyprotein, and a 3′-UTR (4Kato N. Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M. Ohkoshi S. Sugimura T. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9524-9528Google Scholar). The translation initiation of HCV occurs by cap-independent mechanism that is directed by the highly structured 5′-UTR (341 nt long), consisting of four stem-loops and a pseudoknot structure. The 5′-UTR contains unique cis-acting element called 舠internal ribosome entry site舡 (IRES) that mediates 5′-cap-independent internal initiation of translation (5Tsukiyama-Kohara Z. Iizuka N. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Google Scholar, 6Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3338-3344Google Scholar, 7Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Carroll A.R. Clarke B.E.

Nomoto A. Virology. 1997; 233: 9-18Google Scholar). The HCV IRES element requires most of the 5′-UTR, except the first 40 nt, and extends to a short stretch (30–40 nt) of sequence downstream of the initiator AUG codon (6Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3338-3344Google Scholar, 10Rijnbrand R. Bredenbeek P. van der Straaten T. Whetter L. Inchauspe G. Lemon S. Spaan W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 115-119Google Scholar). Hepatitis C virus IRES is significantly different from that of picornaviruses (e.g. poliovirus) with respect to length, secondary and tertiary structure of the 5′-UTR RNA (11Rijnbrand R.C.A. Lemon S.M. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 85-111Google Scholar). Also in contrast to picornavirus IRES, HCV IRES does not have a strict requirement for the canonical initiation factors (eIFs) other than eIF2 and eIF3 (12Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Google Scholar). A number of cellular polypeptides have been shown to specifically interact with the HCV 5′-UTR RNA, which include polypyrimidine-tract binding protein (p57/60) (13Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Google Scholar), human La antigen (La, p50/52) (14Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Google Scholar), poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (15Fukushi S. Okada M. Kageyama T. Hoshino F.B. Nagai K. Katayama K. Virus Res. 2001; 73: 67-79Google Scholar), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (p68) (16Hahm B. Kim Y.K. Kim J.H. Kim T.Y. Jang S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8782-8788Google Scholar), and ribosomal protein factors S9 and S5 (12Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Google Scholar). Interaction of these proteins with the 5′-UTR may be important for translation and/or replication of the HCV genome, although the precise roles are not known yet. The La protein (also called SS-B) was originally identified as an autoantigen that was recognized by sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome (17Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 93-151Google Scholar). Homologues of La protein have been identified in fruit fly, (Drosophila melanogaster) and in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (18Yoo C.J. Wolin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5412-5424Google Scholar). Human La antigen is an RNA-binding protein, belonging to the RNA recognition motif (RRM) super family. It is a 50/52-kDa protein, which is predominantly localized within the nucleus and which functions in the maturation of RNA polymerase III transcripts and the unwinding of double-stranded RNA (19Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 841-850Google Scholar, 20Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 851-861Google Scholar, 21Maraia R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pederson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1929-1933Google Scholar), telomerase RNA (24Ford L.P. Sway J.W. Wright W.E. RNA. 2001; 7: 1068-1075Google Scholar), adenovirus VA RNA (25Francoeur A.M.

Cell. 1983; 34: 837-845Google Scholar), influenza virus (27Park Y.-W. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28433-28439Google Scholar), Sindbis virus (28Pardigon N. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1173-1181Google Scholar), and the HIV TAR element (29Chang Y.-N. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Gatignol A. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7008-7020Google Scholar). The other targets of the La protein binding include the 5′-UTRs of poliovirus (30Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K. Agol V.I. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Google Scholar), hepatitis C virus (14Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Google Scholar), encephalomyocarditis virus (31Kim Y.K. Jang S.K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3159-3166Google Scholar), and Bip mRNA (32Kim Y.K. Back S.H. Jungmin R. Lee S.H. Jang S.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5009-5016Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that La protein specifically interacts with both the 5′- and 3′-UTR of hepatitis C virus RNA (33Spangberg K. Wiklund L. Schwartz S. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 113-120Google Scholar). La protein plays a functional role in internal initiation of translation where addition of purified La to RRL in thein vitro translation assays using either HCV or poliovirus IRES resulted in stimulation of the translation activity (14Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Google Scholar, 30Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K. Agol V.I. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Google Scholar). Sequestration of La in RRL inhibits HCV IRES-mediated translation, which can be rescued by exogenous addition of purified La protein. Different approaches of La depletion were employed to demonstrate the functional requirement of La protein on HCV IRES-mediated translation. A small RNA called I-RNA (60 nt) originally isolated from S. cerevisiae has been shown to bind to La protein and inhibit HCV IRES-mediated translation (34Das S. Ott M. Yamane A. Tsai W. Gromier M. Lahser F. Gupta S. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5638-5647Google Scholar). Similarly, a SELEX RNA generated against La protein has been used to compete with HCV 5′-UTR for the La protein binding to block the IRES-mediated translation (35Ali N. Pruijn G.J.M. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Siddiqui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27531-27540Google Scholar). However, it has been noted that HCV IRES has a lower requirement of La protein, compared with poliovirus IRES (36Isoyama T. Kamoshita N. Yasui K. Iwai A. Shiroki K. Toyoda H. Yamada A. Takasaki Y. Nomota A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2319-2327Google Scholar). Similarly, in absence of La protein, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein IRES-mediated translation is shown to be severely affected (37Holcik M. Korneluk R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4648-4657Google Scholar) and Bip IRES activity is enhanced severalfold in presence of La protein (32Kim Y.K. Back S.H. Jungmin R. Lee S.H. Jang S.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5009-5016Google Scholar). Interestingly, binding of La protein to the HIV TAR sequence alleviates the translational repression exerted by the TAR sequence on a downstream reporter gene (38Svitkin Y.V. Pause A. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7001-7007Google Scholar) and, in the case of encephalomyocarditis virus, La protein alleviates inhibitory activity of surplus polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (31Kim Y.K. Jang S.K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3159-3166Google Scholar). La protein has been shown to have three putative RRMs and a basic region followed by a stretch of acidic region at the C terminus (39Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Google Scholar). A truncated La protein (1–194), which still contained RRM and bound the poliovirus 5′-UTR, failed to stimulate poliovirus translation or correct the aberrant translation in RRL (40Svitkin Y.V. Meerovitch K. Lee H.S. Dholakia J.N. Kenan D.J. Agol V.I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1544-1550Google Scholar), suggesting that binding of the La protein with the RNA is insufficient to explain the activity. The C terminus also contains a homodimerization domain; deletion of this domain has been shown to abrogate the ability of La protein to enhance IRES-mediated translation of poliovirus (41Craig A.W.B. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 163-169Google Scholar). In this report we have demonstrated that both N- and C-terminal halves of La protein are able to interact with HCV IRES in vivo by the yeast three-hybrid assay system. The relative binding affinities have been determined using filter-binding assays. Furthermore, the biological relevance of these interactions was studied by exogenous addition of purified full-length and truncated La proteins in thein vitro translation system using bicistronic constructs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Interestingly, both the N- and C-terminal halves of La proteins were able to stimulate the HCV IRES-mediated translation unlike the case in poliovirus IRES, suggesting that the deletion of the C terminus does not abrogate the ability of La protein to enhance the translation of hepatitis C virus. To date, no crystallographic or NMR structure information is available for either the full-length or individual domains of La protein. Using computational analysis, we have searched for traditional RRMs in the La protein. We have generated the three-dimensional model of the RRM regions of the La protein by comparative modeling on the basis of the closest homologues of known structures determined using NMR or crystallography. The predicted secondary structure of the region 105–208 residues of La (referred to as RRM2) showed similarity with that of RRM-containing proteins of known structures. Additionally, using comparative sequence and structural analysis, it is suggested that the RRM2 within the N-terminal domain of La protein binds HCV RNA at the GCAC motif near the initiator AUG. The prediction was further investigated by the filter-binding and toe-printing assays, which clearly demonstrated much higher RNA binding affinity of the RRM2 at this region. The results constitute the first report to demonstrate physical interaction of La protein with the viral RNA in vivo and provide direct evidence of the in vitrointeractions of RRM2 of La protein with the HCV IRES around the region encompassing the initiator AUG and the GCAC motif.

La coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GACCGGATCCATGGCTGAAAATGG-3′ and 5′-CGTAGAATTCCTACTGGTCTCCAG-3′. The amplified product was subcloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen). The two deletion constructs pRSET-A La1–208 (La-N) and pRSET-A La209–408 (La-C) were constructed using the primers 5′-GACCGGATCCATGGCTGAAAATGG-3′, 5′-GGCCGAATTCTTTAGCTCTTAATT-3′, 5-ATATGGATCCCAGGAGCAAGAAGC-3′, and 5′-CGTAGAATTCCTACTGGTCTCCAG-3′. The deletion constructs pRSET-A La1–100 (RRM1) and pRSET-A La101–208 (RRM2) were also constructed using the primers 5′-GACCGGATCCATGGCTGAAAATGG-3′, 5′-GATCGAATTCACTTCA GGTAGGGG-3′, 5′-GGCCGGATCCGAAGTGACTTGGGA-3′, and 5′-CGTAGAATTCCTACTGGTCCCAG-3′. Similarly, pRSET-A La209–300 (RRM3) was amplified by PCR and cloned in pRSET-A vector inBamHI and EcoRI sites using the following primers: 5′-ATATGGATCCCAGGAGCAAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-TCTCGAATTCTCCCAAGTCACCTT-3′. All the PCRs were carried out with 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of denaturation (95 °C for 40 s), annealing (55 °C for 1 min), and extension (68 °C for 1 min) using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pRSET-A vectors containing either the full-length or the deletion mutants of La. Single colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth containing 75 ॖg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C incubator shaker at 200 rpm speed untilA600 reached 0.6. The cultures were induced with 0.6 mm isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside and grown for another 4 h. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200 ॖl of lysis buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The extract was made by sonication. The above crude extracts were mixed with 0.25 volume of Ni-NTA-agarose slurry (Qiagen) and kept for rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. The lysate was loaded onto a column, and the flow-through was discarded. The column was washed with 5 ml of wash buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole). The bound protein was eluted with 500 ॖl of elution buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C for 4–6 h in 500 ml of dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 7 mm ॆ-mercaptoethanol, 207 glycerol), aliquoted, and stored in a −70 °C freezer. mRNAs were transcribed in vitro from different linearized plasmid constructs under T7 promoters in run-off transcription reactions. The HCV bicistronic construct, pRL HCV 1b, was linearized with HindIII, and poliovirus bicistronic construct, p2–5′, was linearized withXhoI downstream of firefly luciferase to be used as templates for run-off RNA synthesis. The linear DNA were electrophoresed on agarose gels and extracted using silica beads (Bangalore Genie) and then transcribed using a Ribomax large scale RNA production system-T7 (Promega). Radiolabeled mRNAs were transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and [α-32P]uridine triphosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The pcDHCV-383 and pcDHCV-341 were linearized with EcoRI, gel eluted, and transcribed in vitro to generate the 32P-labeled RNA. The transcription reaction was carried out under standard conditions (Promega protocol) using 2.5 ॖg of linear template DNA at 37 °C for 1 h 30 min. After alcohol precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 25 ॖl of nuclease-free water. 1 ॖl of the radiolabeled RNA sample was spotted onto DE81 filter paper, washed with phosphate buffer, and dried, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation counter. The [α-32P]HCV 18–383 RNA or [α-32P]HCV 1–341 RNA was incubated with the proteins at 30 °C for 15 min in RNA binding buffer (containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 3.87 glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA), and loaded onto nitrocellulose filters equilibrated with 2 ml of RNA binding buffer. The filters were then washed twice with 2 ml of binding buffer and dried, and the counts retained were measured in liquid scintillation counter. The graph was plotted with protein concentration (nm) on xaxis and the percentage of bound RNA as the percentage of counts retained, on the y axis. The relative affinity constants were calculated as the protein concentrations at which 507 RNA was bound. The RNA-hybrid and the protein-hybrid vectors were co-transformed into yeast host strain, L40uraMS2, by lithium acetate method. The overnight culture grown in 10 ml of YPD medium (17 yeast extract, 27 peptone, and 27 dextrose) was diluted into 50 ml of YPD such that A600 is 0.4 and grown for an additional 2–4 h. The cells were pelleted, washed with 40 ml of 1× TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), resuspended in 2 ml of 1× LiAc/0.5× TE buffer (100 mmlithium acetate, pH 7.5, and 0.5× TE) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. 1 ॖg of each plasmid and 100 ॖg of herring sperm DNA were mixed with 100 ॖl of the yeast suspension and 700 ॖl of 1× LiAc, 407 polyethylene glycol 3350, 1× TE, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. 88 ॖl of Me2SO was added, and heat shock was given for 15 min at 42 °C. The cells were washed with 1× TE and plated onto His-selective plates and incubated at 30 °C. The transformants growing on His− plates were later spotted as different dilutions onto plates containing 10 mm 3-aminotriazole. The yeast colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of selective medium and grown overnight. The cells were harvested and suspended in 100 ॖl of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 17 SDS. Cells were disrupted by repeated cycles of vortexing and cooling in presence of glass beads. 0.8 ml of Z buffer, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 17 SDS was added, and 100 ॖl was set aside for protein estimation. To the remaining, 0.2 ml of 4 mg/ml ONPG in 200 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was added and incubated at room temperature until yellow color developed. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m Na2CO3, andA420 was measured. In vitro translation of the capped bicistronic mRNAs were carried out in micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL, Promega Corp.). Briefly, 12.5-ॖl reaction mixtures contained 8.75 ॖl of RRL containing 0.25 ॖl each of minus methionine and minus leucine amino acid mixtures and 10 units of RNasin (Promega Corp.). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and 30 min. 2 ॖl of the reaction mixtures were assayed for both the Renilla and firefly luciferase activity according to Promega protocol using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system. To assay the CAT reporter gene activity, 2 ॖl of 1:10 dilution of the reactions mixtures were added to 38 ॖl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 ॖl of [14C]chloramphenicol in total volume of 90 ॖl. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, 8 ॖl of 10 mmacetyl-CoA was added and incubated further for 1 h at 37 °C followed by ethyl acetate (500 ॖl) extraction. The upper organic phase was separated and evaporated to dryness. The residues were resuspended in 25 ॖl of ethyl acetate and spotted onto silica gel TLC plates, followed by chromatography using a mixture of chloroform/methanol (95:5). The TLC plate was dried and exposed to PhosphorImager, and bands corresponding to acetylated and unacetylated forms were quantified. The relative CAT activity was expressed as a ratio of acetylated form to the total. Primer extension inhibition (toe-printing) assay was performed as described previously (12Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing concentration of purified His-tagged La full-length or deletion proteins (200, 400, and 600 ng) were incubated with 2.5 pmol of in vitro transcribed RNA corresponding to the HCV IRES (18–383), and binding reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 ॖl at 30 °C for 20 min. To this reaction,32P-end-labeled primer complimentary to 25 nucleotides of the 3′ end of the HCV-383 was added and allowed to extend using 3 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 30 °C for 1 h. The cDNAs were alcohol-precipitated, resuspended, and compared with the dideoxynucleotide sequence ladders by electrophoresis on a 67 polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel. Traditional RRMs in the La protein were searched using the motif search tools such as PROSITE. The known related crystal and NMR structures of RNA-bound complexes were used as the basis in modeling the three-dimensional structure of RRM2-RNA complex. At least six different proteins with complex crystal or NMR structures of RRMs bound to RNA or DNA are available. The highest sequence identity between any of the putative RRMs of La proteins and the RRMs of known structure is on the order of 147, which is very low. Such sequence identities are possible even between two entirely unrelated proteins of completely different fold. Hence we identified the best homologues for comparative analysis and modeling on the basis of highest compatibility of the sequences of putative RRMs in the La protein with each of the known structures that are bound to RNA. The structural features considered for compatibility analysis are solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding pattern, and secondary structures. It is important to choose a minimal subset of known structures as the basis under low sequence similarity situation, as it has been shown earlier that choosing all the possible structures as basis can result in high errors in the model (42Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 501-512Google Scholar). Thus, two constraints were used in choosing the template structures: (a) the RRM of known structure should be bound to RNA, and (b) the compatibility of the sequences of RRMs in the La protein with the chosen structures should be highest. Two different known structures of RRMs of RNA-bound complexes used in the modeling were: 舠splicing factor U2B舡 from human and U1A spliceosomal protein. The suite of programs encoded in COMPOSER (42Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 501-512Google Scholar) and incorporated in SYBYL (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) was used to generate the three-dimensional models of RRMs in La protein. The sequences of the known structures of RRM proteins were aligned on the basis of their three-dimensional structures and refined using the structural features such as solvent accessibility and secondary structures and relationships such as hydrogen bonding pattern (43Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 403-428Google Scholar, 44Zhu Z.-Y. Sali A. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 43-51Google Scholar). The optimal superposition of Cα atoms in the template structures resulted in the identification of the structurally conserved regions (SCRs) and structurally variable regions. The mean of the topologically equivalent Cα atoms weighted by the square of the sequence identity (42Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 501-512Google Scholar) between the RRM in the La protein and each one of the template structures define the framework for the family of RRM proteins of known structure. The sequence of an RRM of La was then aligned with the known structures and the framework. The regions of RRM of the La protein equivalent to the framework region were modeled from the SCRs of the template structures. To model a given SCR of RRM-La, the equivalent SCR in a homologue of known structure with the best local sequence identity with RRM-La is superimposed on the framework. The variable regions are modeled by identifying a suitable segment from a known structure in the data bank. A search is made for a segment having the desired number of residues and the proper end-to-end distances across the three 舠anchor舡 Cα at the either side of the putative loop such that the loop can be fitted joining the contiguous conserved regions. A template matching approach (45Topham C.M. McLeod A. Eisenmenger F. Overington J.P. Johnson M.S. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 194-220Google Scholar) to rank the candidate loops was also used. The best ranking loop with no short contacts with the rest of the protein is fitted using the ring-closure procedure of F. Eisenmenger. 2F. Eisenmenger, unpublished results. Side chains are modeled either by extrapolating from the equivalent positions in the basis structure where appropriate or by using rules derived from the analysis of known protein structures (46Sutcliffe M.J. Hayes F. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 385-392Google Scholar). The COMPOSER-generated model was energy minimized in SYBYL using the AMBERforce-field (47Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Google Scholar). During the initial cycles of energy minimization, the backbone was kept rigid and side chains alone were moved. Subsequently, all atoms in the structure were allowed to move during minimization. This approach kept disturbance of the backbone structure to the minimum. Energy minimization was performed until all short contacts and inconsistencies in geometry were rectified. During the initial stages of minimization, the electrostatic term was not included, as the main objective was to relieve steric clashes and to rectify bad geometry. The NMR structure of human U1A protein bound to RNA (48Allain F.H.-T. Howe P.W.A. Neuhaus D. Varani G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5764-5772Google Scholar) has been used as the template to model the binding of RNA in the RRMs of La protein. The choice of 1aud is made on the basis of the highest sequence similarity of 1aud with RRM2 and RRM3 of La. We have identified the regions of U1A protein that interacts with RNA and placed the RNA in an identical orientation in the RRM models of La protein. This has been achieved by optimally superimposing the RNA-interacting regions of U1A on the equivalent regions of the RRM model of La and carrying RNA from the U1A protein complex in the process. Previously, it has been demonstrated that La autoantigen interacts with the 5′-untranslated region of hepatitis C virus RNAin vitro and the C terminus effector domain modulates the binding efficiency (35Ali N.

This is a mandatory activation step of the isoprenoid unit for subsequent prenyl transfer reactions in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Isomerization of the carbon-carbon double bond in IPP involves an antarafacial (1Cornforth J.W. Popjak G. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 15: 359-371Google Scholar, 3Clifford K. Cornforth J.W. Mallaby R.

John Wiley and Sons, New York1981: 162-209Google Scholar). During the reaction, a proton is added to the re-face of the double bond in IPP, and there-proton at C2 is removed (3Clifford K. Cornforth J.W. Mallaby R. Phillips G.T. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1971; : 1699-1700Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, IPP is synthesized by the mevalonate pathway and is the exclusive product from phosphorylation and decarboxylation of mevalonic acid. IPP isomerase activity is an essential enzyme for these organisms. In many bacteria and in plant chloroplasts, IPP and DMAPP are both synthesized from 4-hydroxydimethylallyl diphosphate by the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (4Hoeffler J.F. Hemmerlin A. Grosdemange-Billard C. Bach T.J. Rohmer M. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 573-583Google Scholar). Although IPP isomerase is often found in these bacteria, it is not essential. Multiple sequence alignments indicate that Escherichia coli IPP isomerase is related to the eukaryotic enzymes (5Hahn F.M. Hurlburt A.P. Poulter C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4499-4504Google Scholar). In addition, a combination of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and NMR studies with labeled IPP showed that the stereochemistry for the reversible introduction and removal of a proton at C2 during interconversion of IPP and DMAPP is the same for E. coli IPP isomerase and the eukaryotic enzymes (6Leyes A. Baker J.A. Hahn F.M. Poulter C.D. Chem. Commun. 1999; : 717-718Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the protonation/deprotonation mechanism shown in SchemeFS1. These include proton exchange measurements (7Street I.P. Christensen D.J. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 8577-8578Google Scholar), decreased reactivity for a fluorinated analogue of DMAPP, potent noncovalent inhibition by ammonium analogues of the putative carbocationic intermediate (8Reardon J.E. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5609-5616Google Scholar, 9Muelherbacher M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7315-7328Google Scholar), and irreversible inhibition by mechanism-based inhibitors containing epoxide moieties (9Muelherbacher M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7315-7328Google Scholar, 10Poulter C.D. Muelhbacher M. Davis D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3740-3742Google Scholar, 11Lu X.J. Christensen D.J. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9955-9960Google Scholar). Based on the antarafacial stereochemistry for protonation/deprotonation, it has been proposed that IPP isomerase has two active-site bases located on opposite faces of the allylic moiety defined by C2-C3-C4 in IPP. One of these bases is in the conjugate acid form and protonates the double bond. The other assists with the subsequent elimination of a proton (9Muelherbacher M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7315-7328Google Scholar). Reardon and Abeles (8Reardon J.E. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5609-5616Google Scholar) presented evidence for involvement of a thiol group during catalysis. The thiol group at Cys-139 was later identified as a catalytic-site residue in yeast IPP isomerase by covalent modification using epoxide (11Lu X.J. Christensen D.J. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9955-9960Google Scholar) and allylic fluoride (12Street I.P. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7531-7538Google Scholar) analogues of IPP. This residue corresponds to Cys-67 in E. coli IPP isomerase. Replacement of Cys-139 with serine by site-directed mutagenesis gave a catalytically compromised protein that was covalently modified at Glu-207 upon incubation with 3-(fluoromethyl)-3-butenyl diphosphate (13Street I.P. Coffman H.R. Baker J.A. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4212-4217Google Scholar). Kinetic studies showed that an E207Q yeast mutant was also catalytically compromised (13Street I.P. Coffman H.R. Baker J.A. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4212-4217Google Scholar). This residue corresponds to Glu-116 inE. coli IPP isomerase. The three-dimensional structure of E. coli IPP isomerase was recently solved. Crystal structures of free and metal-bound IPP isomerase show that the protein requires a divalent cation to fold into its active conformation (14Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Google Scholar, 15Bonanno J.B. Edo C. Eswar N. Pieper U. Romanowski M.J. Ilyin V. Gerchman S.E. Kycia H. Studier F.W. Sali A. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12896-12901Google Scholar). Three histidines and two glutamates form a distorted octahedral metal coordination site for the divalent cation. In the structure of E. coli IPP isomerase, residues Cys-67 and Glu-116 (corresponding to Cys 139-and Glu-207 in theSaccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme) face each other within the active site and are located close to the metal-binding site. Based on this structure, a mechanism was proposed where the cysteine initiates the reaction by protonating the carbon-carbon double bond and one of the glutamates in the metal coordination sphere (Glu-114 or Glu-116) assists with proton elimination (14Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the catalytic mechanism of IPP isomerase, we obtained crystal structures of the E. coli protein crystallized in the presence of N,N-dimethyl-2-amino-1-ethyl diphosphate (Scheme FS2, NIPP, 3), a transition state analogue (8Reardon J.E. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5609-5616Google Scholar, 9Muelherbacher M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7315-7328Google Scholar), and 3,4-epoxy-3-methyl-1-butyl diphosphate (EIPP, 4), a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor (9Muelherbacher M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7315-7328Google Scholar, 10Poulter C.D. Muelhbacher M. Davis D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3740-3742Google Scholar, 11Lu X.J. Christensen D.J. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9955-9960Google Scholar). In NIPP, the positively charged ammonium group mimics the putative tertiary carbocation formed by protonation of the double bond in IPP. The inhibitor forms a stable noncovalent complex with IPP isomerase. EIPP is an irreversible inhibitor that forms a covalent bond to Cys-139 in the yeast enzyme. Analysis of the crystal structures (1.96 Å) of complexes between those transition state analogues and wild-typeE. coli IPP isomerase provides evidence for the involvement of Cys-67 and Glu-116 and suggests Tyr-104 may also be part of the catalytic machinery. Recombinant E. coli IPP isomerase (C-terminal His-tagged) was produced and purified as previously described (16Oudjama Y. Durbecq V. Sainz G. Clantin B. Tricot C. Stalon V. Villeret V. Droogmans L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 287-288Google Scholar). Prior to enzymatic activity tests or crystallization trials, the protein was treated by EDTA (5 mm) and dialyzed against metal-free 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.4) buffer. The assay of E. coli IPP isomerase is based on the acidic lability of the DMAPP described by Satterwhite (17Satterwhite D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 92-99Google Scholar). The allylic product is hydrolyzed in aqueous acid, whereas IPP is stable. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme to the assay mixture constituted of Tris/HCl buffer 50 mm, pH 7.5, and 18 ॖm [1-14C]IPP in a final volume of 50 ॖl. The effect of divalent cations was tested by addition of Mn2+ and/or Mg2+ to the buffer. After incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 400 ॖl of methanol/concentrated HCl (4:1, v/v). The mixture was subsequently incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the radioactive products were extracted with chloroform. The extraction was facilitated by vigorous vortexing followed by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 2 min. A 200-ॖl portion of the organic layer was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation mixture (ICN Biomedicals). The radioactivity is counted as a measure for the conversion of IPP into DMAPP. Crystals of E. coli IPP isomerase were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop method. Protein (10 mg/ml) was equilibrated against a reservoir containing PEG2000 (167), ammonium sulfate (100 mm), and MnCl2 (10 mm) buffered with Tris/maleate at pH 5.5. Complexes were obtained by soaking crystals of the enzyme with NIPP (3) and EIPP (4). Solutions of the inhibitors (25 mm) in Tris/maleate (100 mm, pH 5.5), PEG2000 (167), ammonium sulfate (100 mm), MnCl2 (10 mm), and glycerol (257) were replaced every 8 h for at least 24 h. After soaking, crystals were flash-frozen, and diffraction data were collected with a Mar345 imaging plate system from marresearch equipped with Osmic optics and running on an FR591 rotating anode generator. Diffraction data were processed with the MarFLM suite. In the presence of metal, the protein crystallizes in the space group P212121 with cell parameters a = 69.3, b = 72.6, and c = 92.5 Å. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry. Data sets were recorded at 1.96 Å resolution for the NIPP and EIPP complexes. Refinements were performed with the program Shelxl97 (18Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Google Scholar) using the structure of unliganded IPP isomerase (Protein Data Bank reference code 1hxz) as starting model. Non-crystallographic restraints were used during the whole refinement (NCSY restrain in Shelxl97) except for the conformation of the inhibitor, which was refined independently in the two molecules of the asymmetric unit. As a test, non-crystallographic restraints were removed and further refinement cycles performed. This led to a small drop inR1 but no significant decrease inRfree. Electron density maps were inspected with the graphical program Turbo-Frodo (19Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo Biographics Architecture et Fonction des Macromolecules Biologique. University of Marseille, France1992Google Scholar). Quality of the models was analyzed with the program Procheck (20Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). Final coordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank under codes 1NFS and 1NFZ for the NIPP and EIPP complexes, respectively. Crystal structures were refined at 1.96 Å resolution forE. coli IPP isomerase in complex withN,N-dimethyl-2-amino-1-ethyl diphosphate (SchemeFS2, NIPP,3) and 3,4-epoxy-3-methyl-1-butyl diphosphate (EIPP, 4). The quality of the data and the refinement are summarized in Table I. The protein crystallizes with two molecules in the asymmetric unit related by non-crystallographic symmetry. Both molecules adopt an identical fold, and the geometries of the complexes with NIPP and EIPP are similar.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsNIPPEIPPCrystal data Space groupP212121P212121 Cell dimensions (Å)69.10569.10172.22372.10691.72291.520 Subunits per asymmetric unit22Data set Wavelength (Å)1.541791.54179 Highest resolution (Å)1.971.97 Total reflections107068102886 Unique reflections2778828408 Observed reflections (I> 2ς(I))2330226786 Completeness (7)1-aStatistics for the highest resolution shell (2.08–1.97 Å) are given in parentheses.94.8 (94.8)98.8 (97.2) Rmerge(7)1-aStatistics for the highest resolution shell (2.08–1.97 Å) are given in parentheses.4.2 (24.4)3.7 (10.1) I/ς(I)9.28.8Refinement Resolution range (Å)10–1.9710–1.97 Number of protein atoms28222822 Number of ligand atoms3234 Number of water molecules117298 Rcryst (observed/all data) (7)21.0/22.217.6/18.0 Rfree1-bFree test subset represents 107 of total unique reflections.(7)26.223.7 Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0050.006Bond angles (Å)0.0190.021 Average B-factorAll protein atoms (Å2)35.3826.95All ligand atoms (Å2)41.8036.16All water molecules (Å2)36.9434.31 Ramachadran plot1-cAs defined by PROCHECK, Gly and Pro residues excluded.Most favored regions (7)89.288.2Additionally allowed region (7)10.811.8Generously allowed region (7)0.00.0Disallowed region (7)0.00.01-a Statistics for the highest resolution shell (2.08–1.97 Å) are given in parentheses.1-b Free test subset represents 107 of total unique reflections.1-c As defined by PROCHECK, Gly and Pro residues excluded. Open table in a new tab E. coli IPP isomerase folds into a compact globular protein that belongs to the class of α/ॆ proteins, with an original architecture (Fig. 1). In the presence of divalent metal, the N-terminal residues fold into a small ॆ-sheet domain of two antiparallel strands that partly covers a pocket comprising the putative catalytic site. This domain is not observed in the absence of metal (14Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Google Scholar). In the metal-bound, active conformation, the protein forms a unique distorted octahedral metal coordination site composed of residues His-25, His-32, His-69, Glu-114, and Glu-116 (Fig.1). Both carboxylate oxygens of Glu-114 coordinate to the metal. In contrast, only one carboxylate oxygen of Glu-116 coordinates with the metal, and the other oxygen faces the thiol group of Cys-67, which is ∼7 Å away. Unambiguous electron density in the initial Fourier difference (Fo−Fc) maps (contoured at 3ς) revealed the location and conformation of the transition state analogue NIPP (3) and the irreversible inhibitor EIPP (4) in the structures of the two complexes (Fig.2). Simulated annealing omit maps of the refined models confirmed the placement on each inhibitor in the active sites. In the complex of E. coliisomerase with NIPP (3), the inhibitor adopts an extended conformation with the positively charged ammonium moiety between Glu-116 and Cys-67 (Fig.3a). Main torsion angles defining the conformation of NIPP are given in TableII, together with selected interactions with surrounding residues of the active site.Table IISelected geometric features for complexes of IPP isomerase with NIPP (top) and EIPP (bottom)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)a X = N (NIPP) or C (EIPP).b Two distinct divalent metal cations are located in the binding site of IPP isomerase, one associated to His-25, His-32, His-69, Glu-114, Glu-116 and the other binding to Cys-67, Glu-87 and the diphosphate group of the inhibitors. Open table in a new tab a X = N (NIPP) or C (EIPP). b Two distinct divalent metal cations are located in the binding site of IPP isomerase, one associated to His-25, His-32, His-69, Glu-114, Glu-116 and the other binding to Cys-67, Glu-87 and the diphosphate group of the inhibitors. The geometry around nitrogen atom N1 is tetrahedral, as expected. The two methyl groups are displaced toward Cys-67, and the nitrogen atom is protonated. In this geometry, N1 is optimally placed to be stabilized by an ionic interaction involving the oxygen atom of Glu-116 that is not directly coordinated with the divalent metal (N1 (3)–OE1 (Glu-116) distance about 2.7 Å, Table II). Proximity of the divalent metal cation binding site should stabilize the carboxylate form of Glu-116. The hydroxyl group of Tyr-104 is near OE1 of Glu-116. Interestingly, this residue is highly conserved in IPP isomerases. Its location in the active site, H-bonded to Glu-116, suggests that it could be involved in the proton transfer to substrates/inhibitors. However, the precise role that Tyr-104 residue plays during catalysis is not understood. Trp-161 is also optimally positioned in the active site to interact with the positively charged ammonium moiety in NIPP and presumably stabilizes the developing positive charge at C3 of IPP or DMAPP during isomerization through a π-cation interaction (21Wouters J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2472-2475Google Scholar, 22Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Google Scholar). This observation is among the first that provides direct experimental evidence for a π-cation interaction in a protein·transition state analogue complex. A π-cation interaction involving the polarizable indole ring in Trp-161 may explain the reduced activity reported for the W161F mutant (14Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Google Scholar). The diphosphate group in NIPP is stabilized by a dense network of ionic and H-bond interactions. A second divalent metal ion interacts with a non-bridging oxygen of each phosphorus to form a six-membered ring chelate whose geometry is similar to that found in crystal structures of other diphosphate binding proteins, including isoprenoid diphosphate cyclases and flavoproteins or dehydrogenases that stabilize the diphosphate moieties of the FAD or NAD(P) cofactors. The diphosphate group is further stabilized by interactions with Arg-51, Lys-55, Glu-83, and Lys-21 (Table II). The relative importance of those residues has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (14Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Google Scholar). Ordered water molecules have also been located in the active site ofE. coli IPP isomerase. Although not directly involved in the catalysis, they could play a role in stabilization of the substrate/inhibitor in the active site of the protein. No water molecules were located close to the ammonium moiety in NIPP (corresponding to the positively charged center of the putative tertiary carbocationic intermediate). The water molecules in the active site of IPP isomerase participate in a network of H-bonds involving the phosphate-bound divalent metal and Glu-87 and stabilize the diphosphate moiety of NIPP. Interestingly, in the absence of inhibitor, the active site of the reported structure of E. coli IPP isomerase (14Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Google Scholar) contains molecules of imidazole and phosphate from the buffer that lie between Glu-116/Tyr-104 and Cys-67. No water molecules connect those residues. It is, however, anticipated that water molecules would occupy this site in the absence of other ligands (inhibitor, substrate, imidazole). In the complex of E. coliisomerase with EIPP, electron density is observed consistent with a covalent bond between the sulfur of Cys-67 in the active site and C3 of the inhibitor (Fig. 3b). Thus, the epoxide in 4has been opened with concomitant alkylation of thiol moiety in Cys-67. The newly formed hydroxyl moiety at C4 forms a strong H-bond with Tyr-104 with a distance about 2.9 Å (Table II). Although the H atom is not observed, it is reasonable to suggest that the hydroxyl group in Tyr-104 is unprotonated based on the pKadifferences between phenols and alcohols and serves as H-bond acceptor for the O2 hydroxyl group in the covalently bound inhibitor. This leads to the hypothesis that the hydroxyl group in Tyr-104 may donate its proton (via Glu-116) to the substrate/inhibitor. The conformation of EIPP (Table II) is similar to that seen for enzyme-bound NIPP. Like the NIPP complex, the diphosphate moiety of EIPP is stabilized by interactions with a divalent metal ion and residues Arg-51, Lys-55, Glu-83, and Lys-21 (Table II). Extensive kinetic characterization of NIPP with IPP isomerase fromClaviceps purpurea showed that NIPP formed a stable non-covalent complex with the enzyme with a dissociation constantKD < 1.2 × 10−10m(9Muelherbacher M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7315-7328Google Scholar). The enzyme·inhibitor complex was stable in 6 m urea, but the inhibitor was partially released upon treatment with SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 1 h. The results indicate that NIPP is a transition state/reactive intermediate analogue where the positively charged ammonium group mimics a putative tertiary carbocation formed upon protonation of the carbon-carbon double bonds in IPP or DMAPP during catalysis. In contrast, EIPP is an irreversible inactivator of the yeast and E. coli proteins. The epoxide forms a stable covalent adduct that is stable to ion-exchange chromatography and gel electrophoresis (9Muelherbacher M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7315-7328Google Scholar). The crystal structures of E. coli IPP isomerase complexed with NIPP and EIPP support a mechanism for isomerization in which the first step is the protonation of the unactivated carbon-carbon double bond in IPP or DMAPP. The orientation of NIPP in the complex shows that metal-chelated Glu-116 is optimally positioned to interact with substrate (Fig. 2). Protonated enzyme-bound NIPP is stabilized, in part, by an ionic interaction with unprotonated Glu-116. Additional stabilization is provided by a cation-π interaction with the indole side chain of Trp-121. A similar stabilization is expected for the tertiary carbocationic species formed during the enzyme-catalyzed isomerization. The origin of the protonating H has not been conclusively established. Glu-116 is an essential active-site residue. It is directly ligated to the divalent metal, which will stabilize the carboxylate form of the side chain carboxylic acid. Even in the absence of inhibitor/substrate, Glu-116 is probably unprotonated, given the location of Glu-116 in the inner coordination sphere of the metal. However, the structure of the complex with NIPP strongly suggests that protonation of substrate involves Glu-116 and that the metal-stabilized carboxylate moiety stabilizes the carbocationic intermediate. No ordered water molecules that could serve as proton donors during catalysis are observed near Glu-116. However, Tyr-104 is H-bonded to the side chain carboxylate in Glu-116, both in the unliganded structure of IPP isomerase (14Durbecq V. Sainz G. Oudjama Y. Clantin B. Bompard-Gilles C. Tricot C. Caillet J. Stalon V. Droogmans L. Villeret V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1530-1537Google Scholar) and in the NIPP complex. The phenolic hydroxyl group in Tyr-104 might be the source of the proton transferred to the double bond in IPPvia Glu-116. In the presence of EIPP, Cys-67 acts as a nucleophile that opens the epoxide ring and forms a covalent bond to C3 (Fig. 2). Presumably, the initial stage of the inactivation reaction involves protonation of the oxygen, in analogy to the protonation of the double bond in IPP during catalysis, followed by nucleophilic attack of the activated epoxy by the side chain thiol group in Cys-67. Although not essential, deprotonation of the thiol prior to the nucleophilic displacement would facilitate the reaction. Thus, it is likely that Cys-67 acts as a base to facilitate removal of the proton from carbocationic intermediate during the isomerization. The interconversion of IPP and DMAPP proceeds by an antarafacial protonation/deprotonation of the molecules. The x-ray structures of NIPP and EIPP complexes with IPP isomerase suggest that the active site of the enzyme has an acid positioned on one side of the hydrocarbon moiety of the substrate and a base on the other. Whether IPP and DMAPP need to bind to the active site in different conformation to account for the antarafacial stereochemistry of the reaction is not fully answered. The residues that donate and abstract protons in isomerization of IPP (probably Tyr-104 and Cys-67, respectively) likely exist as an equilibrium mixture of protonated and unprotonated forms. They thus would be capable of reversing roles for isomerization of DMAPP (that is, the protonated form of Cys-67 would be the proton donor to DMAPP, and Tyr-104 would be the proton acceptor). In both reactions Glu-116 could still act as the essential acid (but not proton source) that helped drive the formation of the carbocation. Determination of the pKa of Cys-67 or Tyr-104 in the enzyme would give some idea of how effective they would be as proton donors and acceptors. Although the deprotonation step is highly stereo- and regio-selective, prolonged incubation of IPP and DMAPP in D2O results in exchange of all of the hydrogens on carbons adjacent to C3 in the tertiary cationic intermediate (7Street I.P. Christensen D.J. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 8577-8578Google Scholar). A mechanism for isomerization of IPP to DMAPP, which is consistent with the structural features of the complexes of E. coli IPP isomerase with NIPP and EIPP, is presented in Fig.4. These features are summarized as follows. 1. The diphosphate moiety of the ligand is stabilized by a network of H-bonds and ionic interactions that involves a divalent metal and residues Arg-51, Lys-55, Glu-83, and Lys-21. 2. The reaction is initiated by protonation of the double bond with involvement of Glu-116. The proton could be given directly by this residue or could come from Tyr-104 located within H-bonding distance of the carboxylate group of Glu-116. The possibility that the proton comes from water cannot be excluded but seems less probable because an appropriately positioned water molecule has not been detected thus far. 3. The tertiary carbocationic intermediate is stabilized by the metal-activated carboxylate form of Glu-116 and by a cation-π interaction with the indole side chain of Trp-121. 4. The thiol moiety of Cys-67, presumably in the thiolate form, assists in removing the proton from the tertiary cation. Following catalysis, the thiol proton Cys-67 would then be recycled to Glu-116/Tyr-104."

Activated receptor tyrosine kinases trans-phosphorylate several tyrosines in their cytoplasmic domains, which provide recognition sites for various adaptor and effector proteins in multiple signal transduction pathways (1Stanley E.R. Guilbert L.J. Tushinski R.J. Bartelmez S.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 21: 151-159Google Scholar, 2Rohrschneider L.R. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995: 168-170Google Scholar). These adaptor proteins utilize their Src homology-2 (SH2)1 and SH3 domains to mediate the interactions that link different proteins involved in signal transduction. For example, the adaptor protein Grb2 links a variety of surface receptors to the Ras/MAP kinase signaling cascade. Grb2 interacts with activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its SH2 domain and recruits the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, SOS (Son of Sevenless), close to its target protein, Ras, at the cell membrane. Phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) are also recruited to receptor tyrosine kinases through their SH2 domains. Growth factor-induced membrane recruitment of signaling proteins is also mediated by a family of docking proteins. These docking proteins contain an N-terminal membrane-targeting domain, such as the PH domain, and C-terminal multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites for recruiting SH2 domain-containing proteins. A significant effort has been made to search for novel adaptor and docking proteins, because these molecules will uncover the unique signal transduction and modulation mechanisms of receptor tyrosine kinases. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family proteins were identified in the last decade as transcription factors that are critical in mediating virtually all cytokine signaling (3Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Google Scholar, 4Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Google Scholar). These proteins become activated through tyrosine phosphorylation, which typically occurs through cytokine receptor-associated kinases, the Janus kinase (JAK) family proteins (5Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar). However, many reports suggest that STATs are activated by receptors unrelated to cytokines. For example, angiotensin II has been shown to activate the JAK/STAT pathway by unknown mechanisms (6Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Google Scholar), and we recently reported that STAT3 is activated by the hepatitis type C virus core protein (7Yoshida T. Hanada T. Tokuhisa T. Kosai K. Sata M. Kohara M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 641-653Google Scholar). Usually, STAT3 is activated by IL-6-related cytokines, IL-10 and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (4Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Google Scholar). Moreover, STAT 3 was also activated by many tyrosine kinases unrelated to those cytokines, including v-Src, the EGF receptor, and c-Kit (8Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 5: 2553-2558Google Scholar, 9Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Google Scholar). Cytokine receptors that activate STAT3 possess a YXXQ motif in the cytoplasmic region, which recruits STAT3 to the receptor (10Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Google Scholar). Most tyrosine kinases that activate STAT3 do not possess this motif. A mutation in the sequence Y933VPL, present in c-Eyk, which is a member of the Axl/Tyro3 subfamily, to the v-Eyk sequence Y933VPQ led to increased activation of STAT3 and increased transformation efficiency (11Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1401-1409Google Scholar). Therefore, an adaptor protein that recruits STAT3 to the receptor tyrosine kinases or Src-like tyrosine kinases may be required for efficient STAT3 activation. However, so far, no such adaptor molecule that can recruit STAT3 has been identified. In the present study, we cloned an adaptor molecule, STAP-2, by yeast two-hybrid screening of a fetal liver cDNA library using c-fms as bait. STAP-2 contains a PH domain, an SH2-like domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich region. STAP-2 is a murine homologue of the recently identified adaptor molecule, BKS, a substrate of the Src-type nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, BRK (12Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Google Scholar). However, the physiological function of STAP-2/BKS has not been investigated. Therefore, we generated STAP-2/BKS gene-disrupted mice. We also noticed that STAP-2 contains a YXXQ motif in the C-terminal region and that this motif is conserved among mammals. Therefore, we examined the role of STAP-2 in the liver at the acute-phase (AP) response, which is shown to be dependent on the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. We found that STAP-2 was induced by IL-6 in wild-type primary hepatocytes and that STAT3 activation as well as the induction of AP response genes was reduced in the liver of the mutant mice. Using cultured cells and transient expression systems, we confirmed that STAP-2 potentiated STAT3 activation through its conserved YXXQ motif. These data indicate that STAP-2 is a unique signal-transducing adaptor molecule that may link several tyrosine kinases and STAT3. The cytoplasmic domain of c-fms (codon 560–926) was inserted in-frame into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pBTM116 (13Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Google Scholar). The fetal liver yeast two-hybrid cDNA library in pACT2 was purchased from Clontech. More than 2 × 106transformants were screened according to the procedure described previously (14Masuhara M. Nagao K. Nishikawa M. Sasaki M. Yoshimura A. Osawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 697-703Google Scholar). A genomic library from the 129/SV mouse strain (Stratagene) was screened with a cDNA probe of the mouse STAP-2, and several overlapping positive clones, including all 13 exons, were identified. The targeting vector was constructed by replacing the 4th through 13th exons with a pgk-neo cassette while preserving 3.8-kb (left arm) and 10.5-kb (right arm) flanks of homologous sequences (see Fig.4 A). The hsv-tkgene was inserted for negative selection. Homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem cells was performed as described previously (15Ohtsuka S. Takaki S. Iseki M. Miyoshi K. Nakagata N. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Takatsu K. Yoshimura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3066-3077Google Scholar) and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The chimeric mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 five times. The resultant F5 mice were intercrossed to obtain the offspring for analysis. Mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Ten-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally once with 2 mg/mouse of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma). After the indicated periods, blood samples were collected, and the mice were sacrificed. The livers were immediately removed and used for total RNA or protein. Total RNAs from mouse liver, primary hepatocytes, primary macrophages, or Hep3B cells were prepared using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). RNAs were separated on 1% agarose, 2.4% formaldehyde gels and then transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The 0.2–0.4-kb cDNA probes of murine STAP-2, serum amyloid P component (SAP), haptoglobin, and GAPDH were prepared using polymerase chain reaction with reverse-transcribed liver first-strand cDNAs as the template. STAP-2 primers were used as indicated below (for RT-PCR). The filters were preincubated for 1 h at 65 °C and incubated overnight at 65 °C with a radiolabeled probe in a hybridization solution (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 4 mm EGTA, 0.6 mNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 10× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The filters were washed three times with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and analyzed by autoradiography. For RT-PCR, first-strand cDNAs were prepared using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The specific primer set for mouse STAP-2 cDNA used was 5′-TGAGGCTCTGCTGGGAAGCTCACG-3′/5′-GGGAGACCCATTGAGAATCTGCCG-3′. Cells were grown in 6- or 10-cm dishes and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. For the binding assays, immunoprecipitation or GST-IBD was performed. Cell lysates were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with 20 μl (50% v/v) of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with 1 μg of rabbit anti-STAT3 (C-20) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 20 μl (50% v/v) of GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then washed six times with a radioimmune precipitation buffer. For the tyrosine phosphorylation assay, v-Src or GST-JH1 cDNAs were co-transfected to HEK-293 cells with each YF mutant of STAP-2. After 24 h, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-Flag M2 antibody as described above. For immunoblotting, samples were separated with 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and then probed with anti-Flag M2, anti-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Tyr-705-STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies as described (16Hanada T. Yoshida T. Kinjyo I. Minoguchi S. Yasukawa H. Kato S. Mimata H. Nomura Y. Seki Y. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40746-40754Google Scholar). Total proteins from mouse liver were prepared as described previously (17Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Google Scholar). cDNAs of human STAP-2 and mutants were generated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with wild-type human STAP-2 cDNA as the template and then cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Four tyrosine mutants were prepared using PCR-based point mutation. Deletion mutants lacking the PH domain (ΔPH) (codon 147–403), the SH2-like domain (ΔSH2) (lacking 142–242), and the C-terminal region (ΔC) (1–242) were also constructed. For GFP fusion, wild-type human STAP-2 and these mutants were subcloned into a pEGFP-C vector (Clontech). HEK-293 cells, A431 cells, and Hep3B cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. MCF7 cells were kindly provided by Dr. T. Furukawa (Kagoshima University) and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin. For the luciferase assay, the acute-phase response element (APRE) and Elk-1 reporter plasmids (Promega) (16Hanada T. Yoshida T. Kinjyo I. Minoguchi S. Yasukawa H. Kato S. Mimata H. Nomura Y. Seki Y. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40746-40754Google Scholar, 18Sasaki A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kato R. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36804-36808Google Scholar) and several STAP-2 constructs with v-Src or EGF receptor cDNAs were transfected using a Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. A β-galactosidase plasmid was co-transfected for each experiment for the internal control. Cells were grown for 36 h after transfection, and EGF (100 ng/ml) or LIF (10 ng/ml) was added to the cells 6 h before harvest. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (16Hanada T. Yoshida T. Kinjyo I. Minoguchi S. Yasukawa H. Kato S. Mimata H. Nomura Y. Seki Y. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40746-40754Google Scholar, 18Sasaki A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kato R. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36804-36808Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were prepared using the two-step collagenase perfusion method as described (19Brysha M. Zhang J.G. Bertolino P. Corbin J.E. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Starr R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22086-22089Google Scholar). After isolation, the cells were washed two times in Williams' E medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (Sigma), 100 nmdexamethasone (Sigma), and 1 μm insulin (Sigma). The cells were centrifuged at 600 rpm for 1 min between washes. Cell viability, as estimated by trypan blue exclusion, was routinely more than 90% following this procedure. The cells were plated on collagen type I-coated plates in the above described medium at 3 × 106cells/100-mm dish and incubated in 5% CO2at 37 °C for 36 h prior to the experiments. Intraperitoneal macrophages were prepared and cultured as described previously (20Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D. Ohishi M. Yoshida H. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 583-591Google Scholar). For each experiment, cells were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) (Sigma), IL-6 (50 ng/ml, Calbiochem), or IL-1β (10 ng/ml, Calbiochem) for the indicated periods in the presence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Hep3B stable transfectants were selected and cloned in the presence of G418 (1 mg/ml). The amount of fibrinogen in the culture supernatant was measured by ELISA (21Natsuka S. Isshiki H. Akira S. Kishimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 58-62Google Scholar). The concentration of serum IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1β was measured by ELISA using kits purchased from BIOSOURCE Int. according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper will appear in the GSDB, DDBJ, EMBL, and NCBI nucleotide sequence data bases under accession numberAW049765. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening with an oncogenic c-fms kinase domain as bait, we isolated a cDNA clone, designated STAP-2, from a fetal liver library. Full-length human and mouse cDNA of STAP-2 was isolated by cDNA library screening by RACE-PCR. STAP-2 is a murine homologue of BKS, an adaptor molecule recently identified as a substrate of BRK (12Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Google Scholar). The mouse STAP-2 gene encodes a protein of 411 amino acids that is structurally related to STAP-1 (stem cell-specificadaptor protein-1) (14Masuhara M. Nagao K. Nishikawa M. Sasaki M. Yoshimura A. Osawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 697-703Google Scholar). STAP-1 is identical to the Tec-interacting molecule, BRDG1, which is implicated in a link between a B-cell receptor and c-fos induction (22Ohya K. Kajigaya S. Kitanaka A. Yoshida K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Yamanaka T. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Ozawa K. Mano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11976-11981Google Scholar). Because STAP-2 is expressed in a variety of tissues, we changed the definition of STAP to signal-transducingadaptor protein. For a comparison with STAP-1/BRDG1, we have used STAP nomenclature throughout this paper. Both STAP-1 and STAP-2 contain an N-terminal PH domain and a region distantly related to the SH2 domain (overall 33% amino acid identity). However, STAP-2 has a C-terminal proline-rich region that is not present in STAP-1. The N-terminal PH domain of STAP-1 and STAP-2 shared 36% identity and 58% similarity. The central region of STAP-2 is distantly related to the SH2 domain. This region of STAP-2 shares 40% sequence identity with that of STAP-1 and 29% sequence identity with the SH2 domain of human PLCγ2 (23Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of STAP-2 contains several proline-rich motifs (boxed in Fig.1 A) that constitute potential SH3 domain (PXXP) or WW domain (PXPX) binding sites and four predicted tyrosine phosphorylation sites (asterisks in Fig. 1A). Y250EKV is a potential binding site for the SH2 domain of Src-like kinases as is Y322MNQ for Grb2 and/or STAT3. Tyr-22 and Tyr-310 are also the potential phosphorylation sites (asterisk). These motifs are well conserved between human and mouse (Fig. 1 A). The overall structure of STAP-2 resembles that of docking proteins such as IRS, GAB, and Dok, because these docking molecules contain a PH domain at the N terminus, a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain or a Met-binding domain (MBD) in the middle, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region. From its docking/adaptor protein-like structure, we expected STAP-2 to be a substrate of tyrosine kinases. To examine this possibility, STAP-2 was co-transfected with constitutively active tyrosine kinases in HEK-293 cells. STAP-2 was strongly phosphorylated by various tyrosine kinases, including v-Src (Fig.2 A-a), a JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain fused to GST (GST-JH1) (Fig. 2 A-b), and an active c-Kit (D816V) (data not shown). To determine the phosphorylation site of STAP-2, four predicted tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine residues. These four YF mutants (Y22F, Y250F, Y310F, and Y322F) of human STAP-2 were co-transfected with v-Src or GST-JH1, and the phosphotyrosine state was investigated by anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) immunoblotting. The intensity of the bands was then quantified using a densitometer (Fig.2 A, a and b). Compared with the phosphorylation levels of wild-type (WT) STAP-2, the Y250F mutant was rarely phosphorylated by v-Src and GST-JH1, which suggests that the Tyr-250 residue is important for the interaction with kinases. The phosphorylation levels of three other tyrosine residues were different between v-Src and GST-JH1. Y22F and Y322F mutants were much less phosphorylated by v-Src, and the Y310F mutant was phosphorylated normally, which suggests that Tyr-22 and Tyr-322 are the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites by v-Src. On the other hand, the phosphorylation levels of Y22F, Y310F, and Y322F by GST-JH1 were reduced to 80–60% of the levels of wild-type STAP-2, which suggests that these three are potential phosphorylation sites by activated JAK2. Next, we examined the phosphorylation of STAP-2 by natural ligands that activate tyrosine kinases. We detected the mRNA expression of endogenous STAP-2 in M1 myeloid cells treated with LIF and NIH-3T3 fibroblastic cells (Fig. 2 B). However, because anti-murine STAP-2 antibody was not available, we could not detect the phosphorylation of endogenous STAP-2 protein. Thus, we generated stable transformants expressing wild-type STAP-2. In the M1 cells, the STAP-2 protein was phosphorylated after long-term LIF treatment (Fig.2 C-a). We also found that STAP-2 was rapidly (10 min) tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF in NIH-3T3 expressing exogenous STAP-2 and the EGF receptor (Fig. 2 C-b). To determine the subcellular localization of STAP-2, we expressed STAP-2 fused to GFP at the C terminus in A431 cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, GFP-wild-type STAP-2 was present throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus before stimulation, but the STAP-2 protein was rapidly (5–10 min) translocated to the plasma membrane in response to EGF stimulation (Fig. 3 A). The mutant STAP-2 lacking an N-terminal PH domain (Δ PH) did not translocate to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 B). A GFP fused to the PH domain alone was translocated to the plasma membrane in response to EGF (data not shown). Therefore, the PH domain of STAP-2 is necessary and sufficient for plasma membrane recruitment in response to EGF. Although STAP-2 has been shown to be relatively widely expressed in murine and human tissues (data not shown and Ref. 12Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Google Scholar), the regulation of STAP-2 expression has not been clarified. Thus, we examined the 5′ region of the STAP-2 genomic sequence by using a data base (www.motif.genome.ad.jp). We found that the mouse STAP-2 genome contains several potential binding sites for c-Rel, AP-1, p65/NF-κB, and STATs within the 2-kb of the 5′ flanking region of the STAT-2 transcription initiation sites (data not shown). Because these transcription factors are often activated by bacterial pathogens and inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6, we examined the effect of intraperitoneal injection of LPS on the STAP-2 mRNA levels in mouse liver. RT-PCR analysis with specific primers for STAP-2 revealed that STAP-2 expression was markedly elevated at 3 to 6 h after LPS challenge in mouse liver (Fig.4 A). To determine which stimuli directly induce STAP-2 expression, we examined the induction of STAP-2 in the primary hepatocytes or macrophages in the presence of cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 4 B, STAP-2 mRNA levels were elevated in hepatocytes, but not in macrophages, by IL-6 and IL-1β but not by LPS (Fig. 4 B). We confirmed the IL-6-induced up-regulation of STAP-2 mRNA levels by Northern hybridization analysis in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 4 C-b) as well as the Hep3B human hepatoma cell line (Fig. 4 C-b). These data indicate that STAP-2 expression is regulated by several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, in hepatocytes. Thus, STAP-2 could mediate IL-6 signaling in acute-phase (AP) response. To further assess the physiological function of STAP-2 in AP response, we developed mice with a targeted disruption in the STAP-2 gene locus. To obtain the loss-of-function mutant, 9 (4th–13th) of 13 exons containing the last half of the PH domain as well as the entire SH2 domain and the C-terminal region of STAP-2 were deleted (Fig.5 A). The disruption of STAP-2 gene and expression were confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig.5 B) and Northern blot analysis of total RNA from the heart (Fig. 5 C), respectively. Offspring were born within the Mendelian expectation ratio from intercrosses of heterozygotes as well as incrosses of homozygotes. This indicates that STAP-2 is not necessary for fertility and development. Adult STAP-2−/−mice appeared to be healthy and showed no apparent abnormalities in most organs, including the digestive and respiratory organs, heart, blood vessels, muscles, and lymphoid tissues, at the gross and histological levels (data not shown). We then investigated the effect of STAP-2 deficiency on AP response in the liver. STAP-2+/+ and STAP-2−/− mice were treated once with LPS. Liver samples were then collected at different times, and the mRNA levels of AP genes, SAP, and haptoglobin were measured by Northern hybridization analysis (Fig.6 A). The haptoglobin (Fig.6 A-a) and SAP (Fig. 6 A-b) mRNA levels normalized to GAPDH mRNA are also plotted on graphs. Induction of these two AP genes, especially SAP, in liver was reduced in STAP-2−/− mice after the LPS challenge. However, IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels induced by LPS mostly from macrophages were not different between STAP-2−/−mice and their wild-type littermates (data not shown). These data suggest that the STAP-2 protein may positively regulate AP gene induction in hepatocytes. We then examined AP gene induction in primary hepatocytes isolated from wild-type or STAP-2-deficient mice. We focused on IL-6, because IL-6 has been shown to play a major role in AP gene induction (35Fattori E. Cappelletti M. Costa P. Sellitto C. Cantoni L. Carelli M. Faggioni R. Fantuzzi G. Ghezzi P. Poli V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1243-1250Google Scholar), inducing STAP-2 mRNA expression by IL-6 in hepatocytes (see Fig.4 B). As shown in Fig. 6 B, IL-6-induced SAP mRNA levels were similar at 1.5 h after stimulation between STAP-2+/+ and STAP-2−/− cultured hepatocytes. However, after 6 h, the SAP mRNA level decreased in STAP-2−/− hepatocytes but was elevated in STAP-2+/+ hepatocytes. This late effect of STAP-2 deficiency on IL-6-induced SAP induction is consistent with the time course of induction of STAP-2 by IL-6 (Fig. 4). It has been shown that STAT3 plays an essential role in AP gene induction in the liver (17Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms of STAP-2 on AP gene induction, we investigated STAT3 activity in the liver after LPS challenge in vivo or in the primary hepatocytes stimulated with IL-6. As shown in Fig. 6 C-a, at 6 h after LPS challenge, the phosphotyrosine levels of STAT3 were lower (about 50%) in the mutant mice than in their wild-type littermates. STAT3 phosphorylation was detected even at 24 h after LPS challenge in wild-type mice liver, but it was not detectable in STAP-2-deficient mice liver. In the wild-type primary hepatocytes, the time course of IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was biphasic; it peaked after 30 min-1 h and decreased but was up-regulated again at 6 h (Fig. 6 C-b). In the mutant hepatocytes, the re-up-regulation after 6 h was not observed (Fig.6 C-b). These data suggest that in IL-6-treated hepatocytes as well as in the liver after LPS challenge, the STAP-2 gene is involved in the induction of AP genes through STAT3, especially at the later phase of the responses. To confirm the positive regulatory role of STAP-2 on STAT3 activation, we examined the effect of forced expression of STAP-2 and its mutants on STAT3 activation. First, we tried the STAT3-dependent APRE-reporter assay in HEK-293 and MCF7 cells (10Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Google Scholar, 24Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka A. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Google Scholar). Wild-type STAP-2 enhanced EGF- or LIF-induced APRE-reporter activation in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 7 A). With the same conditions, the Elk-1 reporter gene, which reflects MAP kinase activation (18Sasaki A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kato R. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36804-36808Google Scholar, 25Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Google Scholar), was not enhanced by STAP-2 (Fig. 7 B). As shown in Fig. 7 C, v-Src-induced APRE-reporter gene activation was also enhanced by wild-type STAP-2 but not by STAP-2Y250F and STAP-2Y322F mutants and a deletion mutant lacking the PH domain (ΔPH) in MCF7 cells. The STAP-2Y22F mutant instead suppressed STAT3 activation, suggesting that this mutant function was a dominant negative form, because a high level of endogenous STAP-2 protein was detected by Western blotting in MCF7 cells (12Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of STAP-2 overexpression on IL-6-induced AP protein in a hepatoma cell line (Fig. 7 D). We measured β-fibrinogen, one of the AP proteins, by ELISA. Wild-type STAP-2, but not deletion mutants, strongly enhanced IL-6-induced β-fibrinogen production in Hep3B cells. These data suggest that overexpression of STAP-2 potentiates cytokine- as well as tyrosine kinase-dependent STAT3 activation. Because Tyr-322 of human STAP-2 is the potential STAT3-binding site, we examined the interaction between STAP-2 and STAT3. Flag-tagged wild-type and mutant STAP-2 were expressed in HEK-293 cells in the presence of v-Src, and STAP-2 protein co-immunoprecipitated with STAT3 was examined by immunoblotting with an anti-Flag antibody. As shown in Fig. 7 E, wild-type STAP-2 (WT), but not STAP-2Y250F or STAP-2Y322F mutants, was associated with STAT3. None of the tyrosine residues of the Y250F mutant was phosphorylated by v-Src or GST-JH1 (see Fig. 2). Thus, these data indicate that phosphorylated Tyr-322 is necessary for the interaction between STAT3 and STAP-2. In this report, we have characterized a novel adaptor/docking protein called STAP-2. STAP-1 was previously cloned as a c-Kit-interacting protein expressed predominantly in undifferentiated hematopoietic stem cells or myeloid cell lines (14Masuhara M. Nagao K. Nishikawa M. Sasaki M. Yoshimura A. Osawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 697-703Google Scholar). STAP-1 also was identified as a Tec-interacting protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to B-cell receptor stimulation, termed BRDG1 (22Ohya K. Kajigaya S. Kitanaka A. Yoshida K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Yamanaka T. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Ozawa K. Mano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11976-11981Google Scholar). BRDG1 was shown to participate in a positive feedback loop by increasing the activity of Tec. In this study, we found that STAP-2, rather than MAP kinase, is involved in the activation of STAT3. STAP-2 contains a YXXQ motif, and its mRNA was induced by IL-6 in primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we showed that late-phase activation of STAT3 as well as AP gene induction was impaired in STAP-2−/− liver or hepatocytes in response to endotoxin shock or IL-6, respectively. These data indicate that STAP-2 is a novel class of adaptor/docking molecules that potentiate STAT3 activation in response to IL-6-related cytokines or other stimuli. The overall structure of STAP-2 resembles that of docking proteins such as IRS, GAB, and Dok. All docking proteins contain the N-terminal membrane-targeting domain and a large region that contains multiple binding sites for the SH2 and SH3 proteins in the C-terminal region (26Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R. Chang E.T. Lane W.S. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21403-21407Google Scholar, 27Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Google Scholar, 28Grimm J. Sachs M. Britsch S. Di Cesare S. Schwarz-Romond T. Alitalo K. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 345-354Google Scholar). Some docking proteins are associated with the cell membrane by a myristyl anchor (e.g. FRS2) or a transmembrane domain (e.g. LAT) (29Burack W.R. Cheng A.M. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 312-316Google Scholar). However, most docking proteins contain a PH domain at their N terminus that interacts with phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in response to agonist-induced stimulation of PI3K (30Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Google Scholar). Translocation of STAP-2 to the cell membrane in response to EGF stimulation also depended on the N-terminal PH domain. In addition to the membrane-targeting signal, most docking proteins contain specific domains, such as PTB domains, that are responsible for complex formation with a particular set of cell surface receptors. For example, the PTB domains of IRS-1 and IRS-2 bind specifically to insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors as well as the IL-4 receptor (31Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PTB domain of FRS2 binds preferentially to fibroblast growth factor or nerve growth factor receptors (32Ong S.H. Guy G.R. Hadari Y.R. Laks S. Gotoh N. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 979-989Google Scholar). Gab1 and Gab2 contain a Met-binding domain, which can preferentially interact with c-Met (33Lock L.S. Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2132-2146Google Scholar, 34Bardelli A. Longati P. Gramaglia D. Stella M.C. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3103-3111Google Scholar). Therefore, each docking protein may preferentially transmit signals from a specific tyrosine kinase through its phosphotyrosine-interacting domains. STAP-1 and STAP-2 also contain an SH2-related domain that may interact with the phosphotyrosine residues. Because the deletion of the SH2 domain of STAP-2 resulted in the loss of v-Src-induced STAT3 up-regulation (data not shown), this SH2-like domain may be responsible for interaction with tyrosine kinases activated by a particular extracellular stimulus. Identification of any specific target of the STAP-2 SH2-like domain will facilitate the understanding of the upstream kinase of STAP-2. It has been shown that docking proteins function as platforms for the recruitment of signaling proteins in response to growth factor stimulation. IRS-1 and IRS-2 amplify the PI3K signal by recruiting PI3K through their multiple YMXM motifs. Gab1 and FRS2 have been shown to amplify Ras/MAP kinase signaling by recruiting Grb2 and SHP-2. We have shown that STAP-2 can potentially associate with PLCγ1 and Grb2; however, STAP-2 had no effect on the Ras/MAP kinase pathway induced by EGF (Fig. 6 B) or on intracellular calcium signaling. 2M. Minoguchi, S. Minoguchi, D. Aki, A. Joo, T. Yamamoto, T. Yumioka, T. Matsuda, and A. Yoshimura, unpublished data. Unlike other docking proteins, STAP-2 has additional unique proline-rich motifs and a YXXQ motif that is a potential STAT3-binding site in its C terminus. We confirmed the STAP-2 function of STAT3 activation by overexpression experiments in cell lines. Furthermore, using knockout mice, we identified the role of STAP-2 in AP response and STAT3 activation in vivo as well as cultured hepatocytes in vitro. In AP response, IL-6 has been shown to play an essential role in hepatocytes (35Fattori E. Cappelletti M. Costa P. Sellitto C. Cantoni L. Carelli M. Faggioni R. Fantuzzi G. Ghezzi P. Poli V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1243-1250Google Scholar). The IL-6 receptor signaling subunit, gp130, is known to elicit the activation of two major signaling pathways through the activation of JAK kinases: STAT3, recruited by the YXXQ motif of gp130, and the MAP kinase pathway, through the SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) as a molecular adapter (10Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Google Scholar). Although both pathways lead to the activation of transcription factors, on the basis of a number ofin vitro data, STAT3 has been proposed to be the main mediator of AP gene induction in response to IL-6 (17Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Google Scholar). However, because a number of cytokines are induced by LPS, it is not clear whether IL-6/gp130 is the sole factor for AP gene induction and STAT3 activation during endotoxic shock. For example, in IL-6-deficient mice, the induction of some AP genes by turpentine treatment was severely impaired, whereas the LPS-induced AP gene induction was normal (36Alonzi T. Fattori E. Cappelletti M. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 13-18Google Scholar). On the other hand, conditional deletion of the STAT3 gene in the livers of adult mice and AP gene induction were defective upon LPS injection (17Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Google Scholar). These findings suggest that other factors or molecules in addition to the IL-6/gp130 system are involved in STAT3 activation for AP gene induction by LPS. Our STAP-2 knockout mice showed a reduction in the late phase of STAT3 activation and AP gene indication. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of STAP-2 in Hep3B cells enhanced IL-6-induced β-fibrinogen production and that STAP-2 was phosphorylated in LIF-treated M1 cells. Thus, STAP-2 seems to be one of the molecules that supports or potentiates STAT3 activation. Understanding the precise mechanism of STAT3 activation through STAP-2 may be important for the control of the AP response and bacterial infection. Although we could not see any potentiation of MAP kinase activation in response to EGF by STAP-2 overexpression, we could not rule out the possibility that STAP-2 is involved in signaling pathways other than STAT3. Our preliminary results indicate instead that STAP-2 inhibits NF-κB transcriptional activation. Because STAP-2 expression is induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or IL-1β, STAP-2 may play a role in the regulation of inflammation. The STAP-2 gene knockout mice will provide a powerful tool for such investigations. We thank H. Ohgusu, M. Sasaki, and I. Ueno for their excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2032712278,"Recent observations have shown that, only a billion years after the Big Bang, the Universe was already lit up by bright quasars fuelled by the infall of gas onto supermassive black holes. The masses of these early black holes are inferred from their luminosities to be >10(9) solar masses (M(O)), which is a difficult theoretical challenge to explain. Like nearby quasars, the early objects could have formed in the central cores of massive host galaxies. The formation of these hosts could be explained if, like local large galaxies, they were assembled gravitationally inside massive (> 10(12) M(O)) haloes of dark matter. There has hitherto been no observational evidence for the presence of these massive hosts or their surrounding haloes. Here we show that the cosmic gas surrounding each halo must respond to its strong gravitational pull, where absorption by the infalling hydrogen produces a distinct spectral signature. That signature can be seen in recent data."
https://openalex.org/W2054439045,"Single-stranded DNA has been speculated to be the initial signal in the DNA damage signaling pathway. We showed that introduction of single-stranded DNA with diverse sequences into mammalian cells induced DNA damage as well as apoptosis signals. Like DNA damaging agents, single-stranded DNA up-regulated p53 and activated the nuclear kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM) as evidenced by phosphorylation of histone 2AX, an endogenous ATM substrate. Single-stranded DNA also triggered apoptosis as evidenced by the formation of caspase-dependent chromosomal DNA strand breaks, cytochrome c release, and increase in reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, single-stranded DNA-induced apoptosis was reduced significantly in p53 null cells and in cells treated with ATM small interfering RNA. These results suggest that single-stranded DNA may act upstream of ATM/p53 in DNA damage signaling.

Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 523-529Google Scholar). At the cellular level, DNA damage induces complicated cellular responses including checkpoint activation and apoptotic cell death (4Kulms D. Schwarz T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 837-841Google Scholar, 5Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E277-E286Google Scholar). Ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM)1 and p53 are two key regulatory molecules in DNA damage signaling and apoptosis. The tumor suppressor p53 is known to mediate G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (6King K.L. Cidlowski J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 601-617Google Scholar). p53, which is a transcription activator, is up-regulated during DNA damage and transactivates a number of genes such asgadd45, p21, and bax involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (7Tarapore P. Fukasawa K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6234-6240Google Scholar, 8Xu H. Raafat el-Gewely M. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2001; 7: 131-164Google Scholar). While multiple mechanisms, including modification of p53 and Mdm2, are involved in up-regulation of p53 upon DNA damage (9Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Google Scholar, 10Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7666-7675Google Scholar), the immediate signal following DNA damage remains unclear. The nuclear kinase, ATM, and its related kinase ATR are critically involved in integrating the initial DNA damage signals to cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar, 2Bernstein C. Bernstein H. Payne C.M. Garewal H. Mutat. Res. 2002; 511: 145-178Google Scholar). Activation of ATM/ATR by DNA damage has been widely demonstrated (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar, 11Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Google Scholar). For example, ionizing radiation and etoposide have been shown to induce ATM-dependent apoptosis (12Guo C.Y. Brautigan D.L. Larner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4839-4844Google Scholar), while camptothecin and UV have been shown to induce ATR-dependent apoptosis (13Cliby W.A. Lewis K.A. Lilly K.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1599-1606Google Scholar, 14van Vugt M.A. Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41656-41660Google Scholar). Oxidative stress-induced neuron degeneration has also been shown to depend on ATM (15Lee Y. Chong M.J. McKinnon P.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6687-6693Google Scholar). It is generally believed that ATM mediates a signal from DNA double-strand breaks, whereas ATR mediates a signal from replication fork arrest (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar, 16Li J.J. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 223-226Google Scholar). Activation of the ATM kinase, which is evidenced by phosphorylation of the ATM target proteins, has been demonstrated in cells treated with DNA damage agents, especially those that produce DNA double-strand breaks (17Digweed M. Demuth I. Rothe S. Scholz R. Jordan A. Grotzinger C. Schindler D. Grompe M. Sperling K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4873-4878Google Scholar, 18Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylates a large number of proteins in response to DNA damage, e.g. Ser-139 of histone 2AX (H2AX) (19Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Google Scholar), Thr-68 of Chk2 (20Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While ATM kinase is considered to be one of the earliest regulatory molecules in DNA damage signaling, the initial DNA damage signal that triggers ATM activation remains unclear. Single-stranded DNA, which activates the RecA protease activity toward LexA, is known to be the initial signal for activating the SOS repair response in bacteria (24Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA has also been speculated to act as the initial signal for DNA damage responses in eukaryotic cells (16Li J.J. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 223-226Google Scholar). In the current study, we have investigated the effect of single-stranded oligonucleotides on DNA damage signaling and apoptosis. We showed that transfection with synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos) as short as 5-mer up-regulated p53 and activated ATM. Moreover, single-stranded oligos induced ATM/p53-dependent apoptosis. Our results thus suggest that single-stranded DNA may act as a signal upstream of ATM/p53 in DNA damage and apoptosis signaling. Tissue culture cells used in the current study include BALB/c 3T3, NIH 3T3, p53 (wild type), and p53−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) (obtained from Dr. Baoji Li, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, The National University of Singapore, Singapore), HCT116 and HCT-116 p53−/− (obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, MD), and HeLa cells. BALB/c 3T3 (p53 wild type) and BALB/c 3T3(10)1 (p53 mutated) were obtained from Dr. Arnold Levine, The Rockefeller University, New York. Antibodies against a synthetic peptide consisting of the last nine amino acids (KATQASQEY) of H2AX with phospho-Ser-139 were obtained from Dr. D. Chen (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Antibodies against histone 2A, cytochrome c, p53, ATM, and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The caspase 3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) was purchased from Calbiochem. Oligos were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. CaspACE (FITC-VAD-FMK) was purchased from Promega. Cellfectin®, Lipofectin, and Oligofectamine were purchased from Invitrogen. FuGENE was purchased from Roche Diagnostics Corporation. BALB/c 3T3 cells were cultured to semiconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 107 bovine serum at 37 °C in an environment containing 57 CO2. Oligos (200 nm or as indicated) or oligos complexed with 10 ॖg Cellfectin (Invitrogen) were mixed with 2 ml of serum-free DMEM according to the supplier's protocol and then added to cells. Cells were harvested 4 h after transfection. The following single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were used: NT36 (5′-AAG AGG TGG TGG AGG AGG TGG TGG AGG AGG TGG AGG-3′), NT27 (5′-TTG AAT TCC TAG TTT CCC AGA TAC AGT-3′), NT12 (5′-TCG GTA ACG GG-3′), NT18 (5′-TTA GGG TTA GGG TTA GGG-3′), THIONT5 (a phosphorothioate oligo of the sequence 5′-CGTTA-3′), NT8F (5′-GCCACTGC-3′), and NT8R (5′-GCAGTGGC-3′). Genomic DNA strand breaks were analyzed by alkaline SCGE as described previously (25Morris E.J. Dreixler J.C. Cheng K.Y. Wilson P.M. Gin R.M. Geller H.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 282-289Google Scholar). Briefly, pelleted cells (104/ml) were resuspended in 0.77 low melting point agarose (SeaKem Gold® from BioWhittaker Molecular Application, Rockland, ME) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C. After transfection, cells (3000/sample) in 150 ॖl of liquefied 0.77 agarose were applied on top of a very thin agarose layer on a frosted glass slide. Cells were then lysed by treatment with an alkaline lysis solution (17N-lauryl sarcosine, 17 Triton X-100, 2.5 mNaCl, 100 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 10.5) for 1 h, followed by incubation in a DNA-denaturing solution (0.3m NaOH and 1 mm EDTA, pH 11.5) for 20 min. Slides were subjected to electrophoresis at 1.7 V/cm for 10 min (DNA SubCellTM gel electrophoresis apparatus from Bio-Rad) using the DNA-denaturing solution as the gel electrophoresis buffer. After electrophoresis, DNA was stained by submerging the slides into a DNA staining solution containing 1× SybrGold® (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei in random and non-overlapping fields were visualized using epifluorescent illumination on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. A comet tail length that was more than twice the diameter of the nuclei was considered as comet-positive. Comet-positive nuclei (damaged DNA) and intact nuclei (undamaged nuclei) were determined by analyzing, random microscopic field, at least 100 nuclei for each experiment. Each experiment was repeated three times. The percent of comet-positive nuclei was calculated and plotted. BABL/c 3T3 cells were harvested and lysed in a modified buffer containing 100 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 ॖm EGTA, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, and 10 ॖg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (26Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic fraction was separated from the mitochondrial and nuclear fractions by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were mixed with the Lammelli SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. ROS production was measured using flow cytometry as described previously (27Sureda F.X. Camins A. Pallas M. Trullas R. Escubedo E. Camarasa J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 30: 507-511Google Scholar). Briefly, BALB/c 3T3 cells were grown to semiconfluence and transfected with the oligo:Cellfectin (10 ॖg) complex as described above. After 4 h, 5-(6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA; Molecular Probes) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 20 ॖm. Cultures were then incubated again for 40 min at 37 °C to allow accumulation of DCFH. Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and suspended in ice-cold PBS. Cellular fluorescence from a sample of 15,000 cells was analyzed using a Coulter EPICS Profile II flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Miami, FL). Fluorescence, excited at 488 nm, was detected using a 525 ± 20 band pass filter. Cellular debris was excluded from analysis by gating based on forward angle light scatter. Histograms were analyzed using EPICS Workstation Software (version 4). After transfection, cells were harvested and washed twice with 1× PBS buffer. Hoechst 33342 (0.5 ॖm in PBS) and CaspACE (10 ॖm in PBS) were then added to the cells. Cells were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Both chromatin condensation and caspase activation were examined by fluorescence microscopy. BALB/c 3T3 cells were cultured to semiconfluence. Cells were transfected with indicated oligo (200 nm):Cellfectin (10 ॖg) complexes as described above and incubated for 4 h. Cell viability was evaluated using a modification of the MTT reduction assay (28Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar). Briefly, a sterile solution of 0.1 mg/ml MTT in DMEM was added to each well in a multiwell plate and incubated for 4 h. The MTT color complex was then solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), the solution transferred to a 96-well plate, and transmission evaluated at 570 nm. Data are expressed as percent of control (no oligo and no Cellfectin). Transfected or control cells were lysed in Lammelli SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nylon membrane. Western blotting was performed according to the ECL protocol provided by the suppliers (Amersham Biosciences) using specific antibodies. A pair of complementary RNA primers of 21 nucleotides (Dharmacon Research, Inc.) corresponding to the 5′-non-coding region of the ATM cDNA (5′-AAU GUC UUU GAG UAG UAU GdTdT-3′ and 5′-CAU ACU ACU CAA AGA CAU UdTdT-3′) was annealed to form the ATM siRNA (a 19-nucleotide duplex stem with 2-nucleotide overhangs on either side) according to the instructions provided by the Dharmacon Research, Inc. 145 ng of annealed double-stranded ATM siRNA or sense strand of ATM RNA oligo was then complexed with 10 ॖg of Cellfectin. The RNA:Cellfectin complex was used to transfect BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts as described above. After 4 h, cells were replenished with fresh DMEM containing 107 bovine serum and further incubated for another 24 h. Cells were then transfected again with indicated oligo:Cellfectin complexes. After 4–6 h, nuclear DNA damage or cytochrome crelease was determined by comet assay or immunocytochemistry, respectively. To test whether single-stranded DNA could induce apoptosis, apoptotic nuclease-mediated DNA cleavage in the chromosomal DNA was monitored by an alkaline SCGE assay. Different single-stranded oligos were complexed with Cellfectin and used to transfect BALB/c 3T3 cells. Transfected cells were then analyzed for apoptotic nuclease-mediated DNA strand breaks in genomic DNA using the alkaline SCGE assay. As shown in Fig.1A, oligos with different sequences and sizes (from 5 to 36 nucleotides) were found to induce genomic DNA strand breaks. The deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), on the other hand, were unable to induce genomic DNA strand breaks above the background level (Fig. 1A). The THIONT5, which is a 5-mer oligo with phosphorothioate linkages, was found to be as active as other oligos in inducing DNA strand breaks (Fig.1A). We have also tested different transfection agents, including Oligofectamine, Cellfectin, Lipofectamin, and FuGENE, all of which are effective in mediating the effect of oligos. These results suggest that single-stranded oligos can indeed activate a nuclease (see below for the involvement of an apoptotic nuclease) in treated cells. The oligo-induced chromosomal DNA cleavage showed dose dependence from 0 to 200 nm (Fig. 1B). A maximum of 607 of cells was shown to exhibit DNA cleavage (Fig. 1A). Above 200 nm, the oligo was unable to increase the level of DNA cleavage. The oligo-induced chromosomal DNA cleavage were found to be time-dependent (Fig. 1C). DNA strand breaks were detectable within 1 h of treatment and found to increase with time (Fig. 1C). The oligo-induced DNA strand breaks were shown to depend on the single-strandedness of the oligo. As shown in Fig.1D, the double-stranded oligo was much less effective than the single-stranded oligo in inducing DNA strand breaks. However, at higher concentrations of double-stranded oligo, DNA cleavage was also detectable (data not shown). We have studied a possible involvement of apoptotic nuclease in oligo-induced cleavage in the genomic DNA. Treatment of BALB/c 3T3 cells with the caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK was found to inhibit oligo-induced cleavage in the genomic DNA (Fig.2A), suggesting that a caspase-activated apoptotic nuclease(s) is involved in oligo-induced chromosomal DNA cleavage. The fact that oligos can induce an apoptotic nuclease in treated cells has prompted us to examine whether oligos can induce (apoptotic) cell death. As shown in Fig. 2B, oligos indeed induced cell death in BALB/c 3T3 cells as evidenced by the MTT assay. To test whether oligo-induced cell death is due to apoptosis, we have measured the expression of various apoptotic markers in oligo-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, transfection of BALB/c 3T3 cells with different oligos caused release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). Transfection of oligos also caused increased production of ROS as evidenced by increased fluorescence of oxidized DCFH (Fig. 3B). In addition, the NT8R oligo was shown to induce both chromatin condensation (Fig. 3C, upper panel) and caspase activation (Fig. 3C, lower panel) in BALB/c 3T3 cells. About equal numbers of cells (507) were shown to undergo chromatin condensation and caspase activation (Fig. 3D). As a positive control, camptothecin, which is a topoisomerase I-specific inhibitor, was shown to induce chromatin condensation and caspase activation in about equal numbers of cells (807). In the aggregate, these results strongly suggest that oligos can induce apoptotic cell death. Thus, it seems likely that oligo-induced DNA strand breaks, which are blocked by a caspase 3 inhibitor (Fig. 2A), are due to activation of an apoptotic nuclease(s). Oligos could mimic a DNA damage signal(s) to trigger apoptosis. One of the most important cellular responses to DNA damage is up-regulation of p53 (29Fritsche M. Haessler C. Brandner G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 307-318Google Scholar, 30Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Google Scholar). We have thus tested whether oligos up-regulate p53 in BALB/c 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.4A, both oligos, NT36 and NT27, up-regulated p53 in BALB/c 3T3 cells. Activation of the nuclear kinase ATM is another important cellular response to many DNA damaging agents (18Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Google Scholar, 31Caspari T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R315-R317Google Scholar). H2AX is a target protein of the ATM kinase and is known to be phosphorylated at Ser-139 by ATM (19Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Google Scholar). Using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated peptide epitope of H2AX, we have measured the amount of phosphorylated H2AX in BALB/c 3T3 cells treated with different oligos. As shown in Fig.4B, NT36 and NT27 oligos stimulated phosphorylation of H2AX in BALB/c 3T3 cells. The increase in the amount of phosphorylated H2AX was not due to an overall elevation of histone H2A (Fig. 4B,lower panel). Phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser-139 suggests that the ATM kinase is activated by oligos. Our results thus suggest that oligos can mimic a DNA damage signal(s) to both up-regulate p53 and activate ATM kinase. DNA damage is known to induce ATM/p53-dependent apoptosis (32Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5A, SIA as monitored by the alkaline SCGE assay was found to be significantly reduced (about 807 reduction) in p53−/− MEF as compared with wild type MEF (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained using two other isogenic pairs of p53 cell lines, HCT116/HCT116p53−/− and BALB/c 3T3 (p53 wild type)/BALB/c 3T3(10)1 (p53 mutated) (Fig. 5,B and C). These results indicate that oligos act upstream of p53 in SIA. To study the role of ATM in SIA, ATM siRNA was employed to knock down the expression of ATM in BALB/c 3T3 cells (33Lipardi C. Wei Q. Paterson B.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 297-307Google Scholar, 34Paul C.P. Good P.D. Winer I. Engelke D.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 505-508Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6A, ATM siRNA significantly reduced (about 607) SIA in BALB/c 3T3 cells as monitored by the alkaline SCGE assay. As a control, the corresponding ATM sense strand RNA did not affect SIA (Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis indicated that the ATM protein level was reduced more than 3-fold in ATM siRNA-treated, but not the corresponding ATM sense-strand RNA-treated, BALB/c 3T3 cells (Fig. 6A). We have also monitored the effect of ATM siRNA on cytochrome c release from mitochondria in BALB/c 3T3 cells treated with different oligos. As shown in Fig. 6B, oligo-induced release of cytochromec from the mitochondria was greatly reduced in BALB/c 3T3 cells treated with ATM siRNA. These results suggest that oligos act upstream of ATM in SIA. Taken together, our results suggest that oligos may mimic a DNA damage signal(s) to induce ATM/p53-dependent apoptosis. DNA damage is known to trigger a myriad of cellular responses including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (35Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Google Scholar, 36Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Google Scholar). While many key regulatory proteins (e.g. ATM and p53) have been identified, the immediate signal following DNA damage remains unclear (37Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Google Scholar). A number of studies have demonstrated that introduction of fragmented or single-stranded DNA into cells can influence the cell cycle and induce cell death, suggesting a potential role of DNA ends or single-stranded DNA in DNA damage signaling. For example, transfection with randomly fragmented herring sperm DNA induces apoptosis (38Schiavone N. Papucci L. Luciani P. Lapucci A. Donnini M. Capaccioli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 406-414Google Scholar). Nuclear injection of linearized plasmid DNA, circular DNA with a large gap, or single-stranded circular phagemid induces a p53-dependent G1 arrest (39Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4827-4832Google Scholar). Transfection of a plasmid containing the telomeric sequence was found to activate p53 (40Milyavsky M. Mimran A. Senderovich S. Zurer I. Erez N. Shats I. Goldfinger N. Cohen I. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5207-5215Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a CpG sequence has previously been reported to be required for induction of apoptosis in T lymphocyte cell lines (41Tidd D.M. Spiller D.G. Broughton C.M. Norbury L.C. Clark R.E. Giles R.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2242-2250Google Scholar). Our studies have shown that single-stranded oligos are more effective than duplex forms in inducing apoptosis. In our system, all oligos tested induce apoptosis. In addition to the oligos shown in Fig. 1, we have tested over a dozen other oligos, all of which induce apoptosis. We did not observe a CpG sequence requirement. However, some oligos appear to be more effective than others in inducing apoptosis. Oligos containing the human telomeric G-tail sequence or a stretch of Gs are much more effective in inducing apoptosis. 2H. Qi, T.-K. Li, A. Nur-E-Kamal, and L. F. Liu, unpublished results. Indeed, a recent report has shown that poly(G) motif-containing oligos can induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (42Shen W. Waldschmidt M. Zhao X. Ratliff T. Krieg A.M. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 155-164Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the observed sequence specificity is unclear and is currently under investigation. Oligos have been used extensively in antisense research (43Flaherty K.T. Stevenson J.P. O'Dwyer P.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 499-505Google Scholar). SIA could potentially be explained by an antisense effect. However, two observations argue against the antisense explanation for apoptosis induction. First, we have shown that oligos as short as a 5-mer can induce apoptosis. It is unlikely that a 5-mer antisense oligo can form a stable RNA/DNA hybrid (44Wei Z. Tung C.H. Zhu T. Dickerhof W.A. Breslauer K.J. Georgopoulos D.E. Leibowitz M.J. Stein S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 655-661Google Scholar). Second, all sequences used in this study induce apoptosis. These sequences are not designed to be antisense oligos. It seems highly unlikely that all these sequences act as antisense oligos. The oligos could potentially activate apoptosis by acting on cytoplasmic or mitochondrial apoptosis modulators. However, our studies have suggested that oligos act in the nucleus. First, oligos activate the nuclear kinase ATM as evidenced by phosphorylation of the ATM target protein H2AX in the nucleus. Second, like many DNA damaging agents, oligos up-regulate p53. Third, like DNA damage-induced apoptosis, SIA was found to be ATM- and p53-dependent. The similarity between SIA and DNA damage-induced apoptosis suggests that oligos may mimic a DNA damage signal in the nucleus to activate ATM/p53. Activated ATM/p53 signals are transduced to the mitochondria leading to the activation of caspase pathway and apoptotic cell death. The molecular mechanism by which oligos activate ATM is unclear. One possibility is that oligos directly activate ATM kinase, which then triggers DNA damage responses. Consistent with this hypothesis, single-stranded DNA and linear DNA have been shown to activate replication protein A (RPA) phosphorylation by the ATM immunocomplex (45Gately D.P. Hittle J.C. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the role of single-stranded DNA is for direct ATM kinase activation or for binding to the ATM substrate RPA. Alternatively, oligos may act by titrating single-stranded DNA binding proteins (e.g.RPA) (46Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Google Scholar, 47Gasior S.L. Olivares H. Ear U. Hari D.M. Weichselbaum R. Bishop D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8411-8418Google Scholar). Such a titration may cause deprotection of single-stranded regions in the genome (e.g. replication forks), which in turn could trigger DNA damage responses. Regardless of the mechanism, our results suggest that the single-stranded DNA must act upstream of ATM/p53 in DNA damage signaling. As shown in Fig.7, a schematic model for the role of single-stranded DNA in DNA damage and apoptotic signaling is presented. In this model, DNA damage is first converted into single-stranded DNA by a nuclease. The single-stranded DNA then activates ATM/p53-dependent DNA damage and apoptotic signaling. A double-strand break in the chromosomal DNA or a telomere end may not activate ATM/p53-dependent DNA damage and apoptotic signaling unless the end is invaded by exonuclease/helicase or de-protected (e.g. inactivation of telomere protecting proteins) to produce single-stranded DNA. This is in contrast to the DNA-PK signaling pathway in which the ends of a DNA double-strand break may be sufficient to signal (48Lee S.H. Kim C.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 13: 159-166Google Scholar). Similarly, DNA adducts (e.g. UV and carcinogenic DNA adducts) may not signal through this pathway unless they are processed by nuclease/helicase to expose single-stranded DNA. Transfection of oligos to induce DNA damage/apoptosis signals might provide a very useful system to study the molecular mechanism of apoptotic signal transduction pathways. The potency of oligos in inducing apoptosis also suggests their potential use as anticancer agents. Clearly, more studies are necessary to establish the molecular mechanism of SIA and the potential application of oligos in cancer therapy. It should be noted that oligos have already been successfully used to treat tumors in animals (49Wang H. Prasad G. Buolamwini J.K. Zhang R. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2001; 1: 177-196Google Scholar). However, the antitumor activity of the oligos has been attributed to the antisense effect (50Lambert G. Bertrand J.R. Fattal E. Subra F. Pinto-Alphandary H. Malvy C. Auclair C. Couvreur P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 401-406Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether SIA may play a role in the antitumor activity of oligos. We are grateful to Dr. B.

https://openalex.org/W2074909707,"The directional dependence of folding rates for rod-like macromolecules such as parallel α-helical coiled-coils, DNA double-helices, and collagen triple helices is largely unexplored. This is mainly due to technical difficulties in measuring rates in different directions. Folding of collagens is nucleated by trimeric non-collagenous domains. These are usually located at the COOH terminus, suggesting that triple helix folding proceeds from the COOH to the NH2 terminus. Evidence is presented here that effective nucleation is possible at both ends of the collagen-like peptide (Gly-Pro-Pro)10, using designed proteins in which this peptide is fused either NH2- or COOH-terminal to a nucleation domain, either T4-phage foldon or the disulfide knot of type III collagen. The location of the nucleation domain influences triple-helical stability, which might be explained by differences in the linker sequences and the presence or absence of repulsive charges at the carboxyl-terminal end of the triple helix. Triple helical folding rates are found to be independent of the site of nucleation and consistent with cis-trans isomerization being the rate-limiting step.

Triple helical folding rates are found to be independent of the site of nucleation and consistent with cis-trans isomerization being the rate-limiting step. N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl guanidine hydrochloride Proteins fold along multiple pathways (1Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Google Scholar), and rod-like macromolecules may fold in two different directions depending on the site of nucleation. Experimental evidence concerning the directionality of kinetics is limited. An interesting study with a two-stranded coil-coil structure tethered by disulfide bridges at either the NH2 or COOH terminus has been performed (2Krantz B.A. Sosnick T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1042-1047Google Scholar) and for collagen NMR diffusion was proposed as a potential method to determine directionality (3Buevich A.V. Baum J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7156-7162Google Scholar). The collagen triple helix is a linear structure composed of three left-handed polyproline-II-type helices. Chains in this conformation are not stable as individual structures, but associate to form a right-handed triple helix, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between chains (4Traub W. Piez K.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1971; 25: 243-352Google Scholar). Formation of the triple helix is only possible if every third residue in the sequence of the chains is glycine (Gly). Imino acid residues favor polyproline-II-type helices and therefore the frequency of proline (Pro) residues in the typical collagen like sequence (Gly-X-Y)nis high in X and Y positions. 4-Hydroxyproline plays a special role in stabilizing the triple helix (5Jenkins C.L. Raines R.T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 49-59Google Scholar, 6Burjanadze T.V. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 931-938Google Scholar) and is frequently in the Y position. Collagen triple helices are very abundant structures. They occur in all collagens as long rod-like elements and form short rods in the first component of complement C1q, lung surfactant protein SPA, mannose-binding protein, scavenger receptors, and many other extracellular proteins (7Hakansson K. Reid K.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1607-1617Google Scholar). Collagen triple helices are slowly folding structures with peptide cis-trans isomerization as the rate-limiting step (8Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Google Scholar). Cis-trans isomerization is often rate-limiting also for globular proteins (9Schiene C. Fischer G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 40-45Google Scholar) and is dominating for collagens because of the many X-Pro bonds (Xstands for any amino acid residue) with their high probability to form cis-peptide bonds in the unfolded state. Another peculiarity for collagens is the need of nucleation domains for correct and sufficiently fast triple helical folding. It was found that trimerizing non-collagenous domains is essential for initial chain association and chain registration. This requirement for oligomerization and registration was explained by the need to establish a high local concentration at the nucleus and to prevent mismatched structures. For thermodynamic and kinetic studies, collagen-like peptides with designed oligomerization and nucleation domains have been particularly useful (10Ackerman M.S. Bhate M. Shenoy N. Beck K. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7668-7673Google Scholar, 11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar, 12Ottl J. Musiol H.J. Moroder L. J. Pept. Sci. 1999; 5: 103-110Google Scholar, 13Xu Y. Bhate M. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8143-8151Google Scholar). Spontaneous folding of the collagen triple helix is extremely slow, follows a third order reaction, and is therefore strongly concentration dependent (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar, 14Piez K.A. Sherman M.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4134-4140Google Scholar). For most collagens NC-1 domains are found at the COOH terminus, leading to the idea that triple helices may only or preferentially fold from the COOH terminus. Recently it was suggested that a three-stranded coiled-coil domain at the NH2 terminus of collagen XIII can induce collagen folding from the NH2 terminus (15Snellman A. Tu H. Vaisanen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5051-5059Google Scholar). Similar suggestions have been made for other collagens (16Areida S.K. Reinhardt D.P. Müller P.K. Fietzek P.P. Köwitz J. Marinkovich M.P. Notbohm H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1594-1601Google Scholar). This stimulated us to measure the rate of collagen triple helix folding in both directions applying designed proteins in which a globular oligomerization domain or a disulfide knot is attached to either the NH2 or COOH terminus of (Gly-Pro-Pro)10. The designed proteins (GPP)10-Cys2 and (GPP)10-foldon were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar, 17Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Google Scholar). These models were used by these authors to study the increase in stability caused by the trimerization of the fused phage protein foldon (17Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Google Scholar) or by the linkage of the three chains by the disulfide knot Cys2 = GPPGPCCGGG of type III collagen (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar). The inverted protein with the oligomerization disulfide knot at the NH2terminus Cys2-(GPP)10 was expressed using the same strategy but an additional Gly-Ser-spacer was inserted between Cys2 and the (GPP)10 moiety. The protein foldon-(GPP)10 was synthesized by Fmoc1 chemistry with a Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly-spacer between the domains (for exact sequences, see the legend of Fig. 1). (GPP)10-Cys2 and Cys2-(GPP)10 were trimerized at 20 °C by their (GPP)10 domains, and formation of the disulfide knot was achieved by oxidation of the fully reduced material with a mixture of oxidized and reduced glutathione at a molar ratio of 9:1. Trimer formation was verified by mass spectroscopy and by analytical ultracentrifugation. For mass spectral analysis, the peptides were chromatographed on a 100-μm inner diameter column packed with Vydac C18 reverse-phase material (5-μm particle size). The proteins were eluted with a linear 20-min gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. The outlet of the column was directed to a microspray needle, which was pulled from 100-μm inner diameter 280-μm outer diameter fused silica capillaries (LC Packings) on a model P-2000 quartz micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Company). The needle was placed into an XYZ micropositioner, and the voltage was applied directly to the sample stream through the capillary union (18Davis M.T. Stahl D.C. Hefta S.A. Lee T.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 67: 4549-4556Google Scholar). Spray voltages were usually between 1100 and 1400 V. Mass determinations were carried out on a TSQ7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan). Formation of trimers of the predicted mass was verified for (GPP)10-Cys2 and Cys2-(GPP)10. In foldon-(GPP)10 and (GPP)10-foldon the three chains are not connected by covalent bonds and mass spectrometry demonstrated monomers of the predicted mass. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with 12-mm Epon double-sector cells in an An-Ti-60 rotor. The peptides were analyzed in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed at a rotor speed of 56,000 rpm, and sedimenting material was assayed by absorbance at 234 nm. Sedimentation coefficients were corrected to standard conditions (water, 20 °C; Ref. 19van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliff, NJ1985: 93-136Google Scholar). Molecular masses were evaluated from lnA versus r 2 plots, where A is the absorbance, and r is the distance from the rotor center (19van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliff, NJ1985: 93-136Google Scholar). A partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g was used for all calculations. CD experiments were acquired on a Cary 61 (Varian) or an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter, equipped with a thermostatted 1-mm path length quartz cell. Data were normalized for concentration and path length to obtain the mean molar residue ellipticity after subtraction of the buffer contribution. Thermal stability was determined by monitoring the change in the mean molar residue ellipticity ([θ]) at a fixed wavelength of 221 nm for (GPP)10-Cys2 and Cys2-(GPP)10 and 210 nm for foldon-(GPP)10 and (GPP)10-foldon as a function of temperature. Data analysis was performed with the LABView (National Instruments) and Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific) software packages. The thermal transition profile of Cys2-(GPP)10 was measured by the change in circular dichroism at 221 nm, and a midpoint transition temperatureT m = 67 °C was obtained which is 15 °C lower than the value for (GPP)10-Cys2 (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar) (Fig.1 a, TableI). As previously observed for (GPP)10-Cys2, the thermal transition curves of Cys2-(GPP)10 were not fully reversible at temperatures higher than 70 °C, probably because of chemical degradation. Measurements were therefore performed in the presence of 2m guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) resulting inT m values of 40 and 63 °C for Cys2-(GPP)10 and (GPP)10-Cys2, respectively (Table I). In the presence of guanidine HCl the transition was fully reversible according to two criteria: (i) after heating to 50 °C for Cys2-(GPP)10 and to 70 °C for (GPP)10-Cys2, for 5 min, the sample was cooled to 20 °C and the value before heating returned after 2 h; (ii) a second transition profile after this refolding was identical to the initial one. The thermal transition of foldon-(GPP)10 was measured by circular dichroism at 210 nm, where the spectrum of foldon alone shows no change upon increasing the temperature (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar). The midpoint transition temperature T m = 53 °C corresponds to the (GPP)10-triple helix and is 17 °C lower than the value for the (GPP)10 domain in (GPP)10-foldon measured by the same method (Fig.1 b). Full reversibility was demonstrated by repeated scanning. Comparing the T m values with those of (GPP)10-triple helix without oligomerization domains (TableI), the results demonstrate that nucleation at either the NH2 and COOH terminus stabilizes the triple helix. The mode of stabilization by foldon at the COOH terminus was investigated in some detail (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar, 17Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of (GPP)10-foldon has recently been solved. 2J. Stetefeld, S. Frank, M. Jenny, T. Schulthess, R. A. Kammerer, S. Boudko, R. Landwehr, and J. Engel, submitted for publication. It was concluded that the stabilization is entropic in nature such that the oligomerization domain creates an internal concentration of about 1m at the junction between foldon (or the disulfide knot) and (GPP)10. A number of unfavorable interactions at the domain junction counteract the entropic stabilization. First, foldon-(GPP)10 has a different linker sequence to that in (GPP)10-foldon. Second, there are repulsive carboxylate charges at the COOH-terminal end of the triple helix that are not present in (GPP)10-foldon, and this may explain the lower transition temperature. The peptide Ac-(GPP)10-NH2 has a T m of 45 °C in H2O as compared with 25 °C for (PPG)10. 3K. Mizuno and H. P. Bächinger, unpublished data. Also, for Cys2-(GPP)10 the linker sequence is different from that in (GPP)10-Cys2, and COOH-terminal repulsive charges at the end of the triple helix are present, leading to a reduced stability. In all cases the internal concentrations imposed by the oligomerization domains are expected to be approximately identical.Table IMidpoint transition temperatures Tm of the (GPP)10domain in designed proteins and their molecular massesCys2-(GPP)10(GPP)10-Cys2Foldon-(GPP)10(GPP)10-foldon(PPG)10T m in PBS without GuHCIaThe T mvalues were determined at total chain concentrations of 50 μm.

Open table in a new tab The designed proteins with oligomerization domains either at the NH2 or COOH terminus were then used to compare the rates of refolding. It is known that nucleation of triple helices from free (GPP)10 chains is extremely slow, concentration-dependent, and of apparent third order (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar). Connection of three chains by oligomerization domains increases the intrinsic chain concentrations to a level at which cis-trans isomerization steps in helix propagation, rather than chain finding steps, become rate-limiting (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar). Given the very high concentration dependence of nucleation, it has to be expected that helix propagation will be preferentially initiated at the end at which the oligomerization domain is attached, although we cannot exclude the possibility that a small fraction of helix initiations may also occur at other sites. Fig. 2 shows the time-resolved phases that follow a fast and kinetically unresolved jump of the circular dichroism signal. The fast phase mainly consists of the temperature-dependent change of circular dichroism, which is visible also in temperature regions where no transition takes place (Fig. 1). It may also include a very small fast phase of triple helix formation before the first cis-peptide bond is met (8Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Google Scholar, 20Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 605-613Google Scholar). The slow phase reflects the major part of the transition of the (GPP)10 domain, and long triple helices of real collagens fold entirely with a slow phase determined by cis-trans isomerization (8Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Google Scholar). For Cys2-(GPP)10 and foldon-(GPP)10 it was verified that the kinetic time courses did not change upon increasing the concentration by a factor of 4 at 10 or 20 °C. For (GPP)10-Cys2 this was shown previously (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar). Figs. 2 and 3clearly demonstrate that the first order rate constant of folding is identical for proteins carrying the oligomerization domains at opposite ends. The refolding rate constant for Cys2-(GPP)10 was 0.00037 s−1measured at 20 °C and a peptide concentration of 100 μm. For foldon-(GPP)10 a value of 0.00098 s−1 was determined for a peptide concentration of 51 μm at the same temperature. Also, the activation energies obtained from an Arrhenius plot of rate constants measured at different temperatures turned out to be identical within the limits of experimental error (Fig. 3). Values of activation energy larger than 50 kJ/mol confirm cis-trans isomerization steps as rate-limiting events. Deviations from the maximum activation energies predicted for this step have been discussed (11Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Google Scholar).Figure 3Refolding rates of (GPP)10 with foldon domains.

The activation energies are 50.0 kJ/mol and 54.5 kJ/mol, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In summary the results demonstrate that collagen triple helix formation can be nucleated at both ends. The rates are equal within experimental errors. To exclude possible effects of the nature of the nucleation domain, two very different oligomerization sequences were employed. It was shown that their influence on protein stability was slightly different and also that the location of the domains at either end of the collagen-like domain was an important factor. These differences may be explained by energetic differences in the linker sequences between the collagen triple helix and the oligomerization domains and the presence of charges at the end of the triple helix. The rate-limiting step of cis-trans isomerization is, however, independent of the direction of folding. We thank Ariel Lustig for the analytical ultracentrifugation measurements."

Crystallographic analyses of 11 PelC-Ca2+complexes, formed at pH 4.5, 9.5, and 11.2 under varying Ca2+ concentrations, have been solved and refined at a resolution of 2.2 Å. The Ca2+ site represents a new motif for Ca2+, consisting primarily of ॆ-turns and ॆ-strands. The principal differences between PelC and the PelC-Ca2+ structures at all pH values are the side-chain conformations of Asp-129 and Glu-166 as well as the occupancies of four water molecules. According to calculations of pKa values, the presence of Ca2+and associated structural changes lower the pKaof Arg-218, the amino acid responsible for proton abstraction during catalysis. The Ca2+ affinity for PelC is weak, as theKd was estimated to be 0.132 (±0.004) mm at pH 9.5, 1.09 (±0.29) mm at pH 11.2, and 5.84 (±0.41) mm at pH 4.5 from x-ray diffraction studies and 0.133 (±0.045) mm at pH 9.5 from intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. Given the pH dependence of Ca2+affinity, PelC activity at pH 4.5 has been reexamined. At saturating Ca2+ concentrations, PelC activity increases 10-fold at pH 4.5 but is less than 17 of maximal activity at pH 9.5. Taken together, the studies suggest that the primary Ca2+ ion in PelC has multiple functions.1O881O8D1O8E1O8F1O8G1O8H1O8I1O8J1O8K1O8L1O8M Ca2+ is essential for in vitro activity of Erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase C (PelC).

The Ca2+ affinity for PelC is weak, as theKd was estimated to be 0.132 (±0.004) mm at pH 9.5, 1.09 (±0.29) mm at pH 11.2, and 5.84 (±0.41) mm at pH 4.5 from x-ray diffraction studies and 0.133 (±0.045) mm at pH 9.5 from intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. Given the pH dependence of Ca2+affinity, PelC activity at pH 4.5 has been reexamined. At saturating Ca2+ concentrations, PelC activity increases 10-fold at pH 4.5 but is less than 17 of maximal activity at pH 9.5. Taken together, the studies suggest that the primary Ca2+ ion in PelC has multiple functions.1O881O8D1O8E1O8F1O8G1O8H1O8I1O8J1O8K1O8L1O8M Erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase C galacturonic acid 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2- (hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol Erwinia sp. are pathogenic bacteria that are causally involved in soft rot diseases in a wide variety of plant crops (1Barras F. Van Gijsegem F. Chatterjee A.K. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1994; 32: 201-234Google Scholar, 2Collmer A. Keen N.T. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1986; 24: 383-409Google Scholar). The bacteria enter the plant through wounds produced by either insects or harvesting and subsequently multiply in the intercellular spaces, secreting large amounts of pectolytic enzymes. These enzymes degrade the middle lamella portion of the plant cell wall, causing tissue damage and cell rupture. Erwinia bacterial strains, which are deficient in one or more pectate lyase genes, have decreased virulence (3Boccara M. Chatain V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4085-4087Google Scholar, 4Boccara M. Diolez A. Rouve M. Kotoujansky A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1988; 33: 95-104Google Scholar, 5Ried J.L. Collmer A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1988; 1: 32-38Google Scholar). Mutations affecting the extracellular secretion of the pectic enzymes also reduce virulence (6Thurn K.K. Chatterjee A.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1985; 50: 894-898Google Scholar). The introduction of pectate lyase genes into Escherichia coli enables E. coli to macerate plant tissue and display soft rot-like symptoms (7Tamaki S.J. Gold S. Robeson M. Manulis S. Keen N.T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3468-3478Google Scholar). Highly purified pectate lyase preparations macerate plant tissue, thus confirming a causal relationship between the enzymes and soft rot diseases (8Kita N. Boyd C.M. Garrett M.R. Jurnak F. Keen N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26529-26535Google Scholar).Pectate lyases constitute a family of isozymes that share 29–917 sequence similarity (9Heffron S. Henrissat B. Yoder M.D. Lietzke S. Jurnak F. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 331-334Google Scholar). All isozymes cleave α-1,4-linked galacturonic acid units of the pectate component of the plant cell wall by a ॆ-elimination mechanism. In vitro catalyzed reactions have a bell-shaped pH profile, which extends from 6 to 10 with a pH optimum near 9.0 for most isozymes (10Tardy F. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2503-2511Google Scholar). Pectate lyases require Ca2+ for in vitro activity and presumably utilize the abundant Ca2+ in the plant cell wall forin vivo activity (11Hepler P.K. Wayne R.O. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1985; 36: 397-439Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ once was assumed to bind only the substrate (12Crawford M.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 196-205Google Scholar), now it is known that Ca2+ binds directly to the protein. Several three-dimensional structures of pectate lyases have been determined in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (13Yoder M.D. Jurnak F. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 349-364Google Scholar, 14Lietzke S.E. Keen N.T. Yoder M.D. Jurnak F. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 849-862Google Scholar, 15Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Harris G. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Nat. Struct.

All such structures reveal a novel parallel ॆ-helical topology that probably is shared by all family members. The structures of Bacillus subtilis pectate lyase (15Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Harris G. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 717-723Google Scholar) and Bacillus sp. strain KSM-P15 pectate lyase (16Akita M. Suzuki A. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Yamane T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1786-1792Google Scholar) reveal details of a Ca2+ binding site at the same relative location in each structure. Another structure, that of a complex between an inactive PelC1 mutant and a pentagalacturonate substrate, has revealed three additional Ca2+ sites linking the substrate to the protein (17Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Google Scholar). Although the PelC R218K-(Ca2+)4-pentaGalpA structure provides many insights into the pectate lyase cleavage mechanism, the structure complicates questions regarding the function of the Ca2+ ions. Are all Ca2+ ions essential forin vitro catalytic activity? Are the Ca2+ ions only required for substrate binding, or do any have an active catalytic role? If so, which Ca2+ ion has an active catalytic role, and how might the ion participate in catalysis? Is the primary Ca2+ ion involved in the polygalacturonic acid hydrolase activity that is observed in some pectate lyases (18Hotchkiss Jr., A.T. Hicks K.B. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 247: 1-7Google Scholar,19Hotchkiss Jr., A.T. Revear L.G. Hicks K.B. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1996; 48: 1-9Google Scholar)? In view of the observations that the pH of the plant cell wall increases as the pectate component is degraded (20De Lorenzo G. Cervone F. Hahn M.G. Darvill A. Albersheim P. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1991; 39: 335-344Google Scholar), how does pH affect the affinity of the Ca2+ ions for PelC? To address these questions, various studies with Ca2+ have been initiated. The results presented herein explore the binding of the primary Ca2+ ion to PelC over a broad pH range.DISCUSSIONThe primary Ca2+ site of PelC shares the same location and coordination as the primary Ca2+ site for the heavy atom derivative Lu3+, which is used to phase the initial structure. The Ca2+ coordination involves three amino acids and two water molecules arranged in the typical bipentagonal coordination. The primary Ca2+ ion has been observed in two other pectate lyase structures, that of B. subtilis pectate lyase (15Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Harris G. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 717-723Google Scholar) and Bacillus sp. strain KSM-P15 pectate lyase (16Akita M. Suzuki A. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Yamane T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1786-1792Google Scholar). Although the location and coordination numbers are the same, there are small differences between the Ca2+ binding sites. Asp-129 in PelC corresponds to Gln-182 in B. subtilispectate lyase. As an uncharged residue, Gln-182 is unable to coordinate to the Ca2+ ion. Instead, a water molecule fills the comparable position in B. subtilis pectate lyase. Thus the Ca2+ ion in B. subtilis pectate lyase coordinates to one less oxygen atom from an amino acid but one more oxygen atom from a water molecule, leaving the net coordination number unchanged. The average Ca2+-oxygen distance is 2.46 Å in PelC and 2.42 Å in B. subtilis pectate lyase. The details of the Ca2+ binding site in Bacillus sp. strain KSM-P15 pectate lyase are not yet available for a detailed comparison.For many years, Ca2+ was believed to interact only with the substrate in order to induce a substrate conformation that could be recognized by the pectate lyases (12Crawford M.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 196-205Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising to find that PelC-Ca2+ has an apparentKd in the tenth millimolar range even at the optimal pH for enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, the weak association between PelC and Ca2+ is not so weak as to be insignificant, particularly in the context of the plant cell wall, where Ca2+ is believed to be abundant (11Hepler P.K. Wayne R.O. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1985; 36: 397-439Google Scholar). The actual concentration of Ca2+ in the plant cell is difficult to determine because Ca2+ is distributed differentially in various areas of the plant tissue and is dependent upon plant type and stage of growth (38Rihouey C. Jauneau A. Cabin-Flaman A. Demarty M. Lefèbvre F. Morvan C. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 497-508Google Scholar). One estimate for soybean hypocotyl cell walls places the Ca2+ concentration between 10 and 50 mm (39Virk S.S. Cleland R.E. Planta. 1988; 176: 60-67Google Scholar). The x-ray diffraction method is somewhat unconventional for measuring Ca2+ affinity, but it has been used previously in the quantitation of Ca2+ binding to internalin B (40Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1063-1072Google Scholar). Moreover, the Kd at pH 9.5 determined by the x-ray diffraction method has been corroborated with intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. The present research does not address whether the affinity of Ca2+ for PelC increases in the presence of the substrate. Such a question is difficult to answer because additional Ca2+ ions are bound at the PelC-oligosaccharide interface (17Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Google Scholar).Although the x-ray diffraction method has many drawbacks over conventional methods for determining Ca2+ affinity for a protein, the approach offers one significant advantage in that the actual Ca2+ ion for which Kd is being measured can be visualized. The diffraction studies of the PelC R218-(Ca2+)4-pentaGalpA complex as well as preliminary fluorescence data indicating a negative Hill coefficient raised the possibility that native PelC might have more than one Ca2+ site, each with differing affinities, at exogenous Ca2+ concentrations of 10 mm or less. No positive electron density, consistent with partially occupied Ca2+ ions, is present at any other site at which the exogenous Ca2+ concentration is 30 mm or less. This observation is consistent with the R218-(Ca2+)4-pentaGalpA complex structure in which the other Ca2+ ions coordinate to only one or two amino acids, suggesting that the affinity of these Ca2+ ions for the protein may be very weak (17Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Google Scholar).The Ca2+ affinity for PelC is highest at pH 9.5, the optimal pH for in vitro enzymatic activity. The Ca2+ affinity decreases 10-fold at pH 11.2, possibly as a consequence of the affinity of Ca2+ for water. At pH 11.2, there is a large population of hydroxyl ions that will compete effectively with the amino acids for direct coordination to Ca2+. The nearly 100-fold reduction in Ca2+affinity for PelC at pH 4.5 can be explained by the increased protonation of the aspartic and glutamic acid groups that otherwise would coordinate with the Ca2+ ion. The detection of any Ca2+ affinity at pH 4.5 is somewhat surprising, given thatin vitro pectate lyase activity had not been detected previously under standard assay conditions. However, the standard assays routinely employ Ca2+ concentrations that are too low at pH 4.5 to saturate the Ca2+ site as deduced by the x-ray diffraction analyses. This observation raises the question as to what extent pectate lyase activity at pH 4.5 is dependent upon the Ca2+ concentration. To answer this question, we have determined pectate lyase activity in the presence of higher Ca2+ concentrations and found that saturation of the Ca2+ binding site increases the enzymatic activity by 10-fold. Nevertheless, the activity of PelC at pH 4.5 still is very low, as it is less than 17 of the maximal activity measured at pH 9.5. Therefore, the low pectate lyase activity at pH 4.5 must be dependent upon additional factors.The Ca2+ binding motif found in PelC differs from the high affinity Ca2+ sites found in EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (41Yap K.L. Ames J.B. Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 37: 499-507Google Scholar, 42Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Google Scholar, 43Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Google Scholar, 44Linse S. Forsén S. Means A.R. Calcium Regulation of Cellular Function. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1995: 89-151Google Scholar, 45Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Google Scholar). The typical EF-hand Ca2+ binding site consists of a continuous or discontinuous helix-loop-helix motif on which the coordinating amino acids are located. In the continuous type (Fig.6A), the helix-loop-helix motif is composed of a contiguous sequence of 12 amino acids. In the discontinuous type (Fig. 6B), the helix-loop-helix is composed of two noncontiguous sequences of amino acids. In contrast to the typical EF-hand Ca2+ binding motif, the Ca2+ binding pocket on PelC is composed entirely of ॆ-strands and ॆ-turns (Fig. 6C). The coordinating amino acids are located on two adjacent rungs of the parallel ॆ-helix. Three of the four amino acids that coordinate the Ca2+ ion are located on ॆ-turns that connect two ॆ-strands. Only one amino acid, Asp-170, is located within a ॆ-strand. Despite the differences in the surrounding topology of the Ca2+ sites, the coordination around the Ca2+ ion in PelC appears to be identical in number and average bond distance to typical helix-loop-helix proteins that have much higher Ca2+affinities.Why then does PelC bind Ca2+ weakly, whereas proteins with a helix-loop-helix motif bind Ca2+ with high affinity? In reviews of Ca2+-binding proteins (44Linse S. Forsén S. Means A.R. Calcium Regulation of Cellular Function. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1995: 89-151Google Scholar, 45Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Google Scholar, 46Pidcock E. Moore G.R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 479-489Google Scholar), no one has been able to find a direct correlation between the metal ion binding site and its affinity for the protein. Pidcock and Moore (46Pidcock E. Moore G.R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 479-489Google Scholar) observed other features that may affect the strength of binding. Among these features are the nature of the electrostatic interactions, including extensive hydrogen bond networks, and large metal ion-induced protein conformational changes. As discussed previously, PelC has an extensive hydrogen bond network that is altered in the presence of Ca2+. The Ca2+-induced conformational changes are relatively minor in PelC and less likely to influence the affinity of Ca2+. We propose that the answer for PelC may lie in the orientation of the Ca2+ toward the lone pairs of electrons on the carboxylate oxygen. High affinity for a Ca2+ ion usually is found when Ca2+ is coordinated directly to both oxygen atoms or to the syn conformation of the lone electron pair on one of the carboxylate oxygens (47Carrell C.J. Carrell H.L. Erlebacher J. Glusker J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8651-8656Google Scholar). In PelC, the carboxylate oxygen atoms of two amino acids, Glu-166 and Asp-170, coordinate to Ca2+ in the anti conformation of the lone electron pair. Asp-131 forms a direct interaction with the Ca2+, and only Asp-129 binds in the synconformation. Thus one possible explanation for the weaker Ca2+ affinity in PelC may be the weak coordination to theanti conformation in two of the four coordinating amino acids.In the presence of a substrate, PelC is known to bind to three additional Ca2+ ions, each of which has fewer coordinating ligands to the protein. None of these Ca2+ ions are observed in the PelC structure in the absence of a substrate. The presence of only one Ca2+, which coordinates more tightly than the other sites through an invariant and several highly conserved amino acids, suggests that this Ca2+ has a special role. One role, suggested by the present study, is to reduce the pKa of Arg-218 so that the amino acid is better suited chemically to act as a proton acceptor in the ॆ-elimination reaction mechanism. Another possibility, suggested by the PelC R218K-(Ca2+)4-pentaGalpA complex, is that this Ca2+ is critical for aligning the substrate properly in the active site. Other studies suggest that the occupancy of the primary Ca2+ site determines whether PelC functions as a hydrolase or a lyase (48Herron S.R. Jurnak F. Schols H. Pectins and Pectinases. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002Google Scholar). When the structure of the PelC-Ca2+ complex is superimposed upon the polygalacturonase structures (48Herron S.R. Jurnak F. Schols H. Pectins and Pectinases. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002Google Scholar), the PelC amino acids coordinated to the primary Ca2+ ion are analogous to the catalytic residues in polygalacturonases. The PelC amino acids are in the proper orientation to carry out hydrolase activity but only in the absence of the Ca2+ ion. Thus the weak affinity of PelC for the primary Ca2+ ion, as determined herein, is critical for understanding how Ca2+ can regulate the function of PelC.Although structure-function studies have focused primarily on microbial pectate lyases, pel genes have been identified in a wide range of plants with at least 25 isozymes found by gene annotation in Arabidopsis thaliana. 2P. M. Coutinho and B. Henrissat, carbohydrate-active enzymes server at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼cazy/CAZY/index.html. Because the plant cell wall pH is ∼5.75, it has been difficult to understand how any pectate lyase functions in such an environment. The present study indicates that pectate lyases are active even at a low pH if the exogenous Ca2+ concentration is sufficiently high. If the Ca2+ concentration is low, other studies suggest that the enzymes function as hydrolases. The occupancy of the primary Ca2+ site appears to determine whether the pectate lyase functions as a hydrolase or a lyase. Although additional studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, the weak affinity of the primary Ca2+ ion for PelC observed herein is a necessary feature for the Ca2+ ion to serve as a regulatory switch. Erwinia sp. are pathogenic bacteria that are causally involved in soft rot diseases in a wide variety of plant crops (1Barras F. Van Gijsegem F. Chatterjee A.K. Annu. Rev.

The x-ray diffraction method is somewhat unconventional for measuring Ca2+ affinity, but it has been used previously in the quantitation of Ca2+ binding to internalin B (40Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1063-1072Google Scholar). Moreover, the Kd at pH 9.5 determined by the x-ray diffraction method has been corroborated with intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. The present research does not address whether the affinity of Ca2+ for PelC increases in the presence of the substrate. Such a question is difficult to answer because additional Ca2+ ions are bound at the PelC-oligosaccharide interface (17Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Google Scholar).Although the x-ray diffraction method has many drawbacks over conventional methods for determining Ca2+ affinity for a protein, the approach offers one significant advantage in that the actual Ca2+ ion for which Kd is being measured can be visualized. The diffraction studies of the PelC R218-(Ca2+)4-pentaGalpA complex as well as preliminary fluorescence data indicating a negative Hill coefficient raised the possibility that native PelC might have more than one Ca2+ site, each with differing affinities, at exogenous Ca2+ concentrations of 10 mm or less. No positive electron density, consistent with partially occupied Ca2+ ions, is present at any other site at which the exo"
https://openalex.org/W1974515461,"The benzylindazole compound YC-1 has been shown to activate soluble guanylate cyclase by increasing the sensitivity toward NO and CO. Here we report the action of YC-1 on the coordination of CO- and NO-hemes in the enzyme and correlate the events with the activation of enzyme catalysis. A single YC-1-binding site on the heterodimeric enzyme was identified by equilibrium dialysis. To explore the affect of YC-1 on the NO-heme coordination, the six-coordinate NO complex of the enzyme was stabilized by dibromodeuteroheme substitution. Using the dibromodeuteroheme enzyme, YC-1 converted the six-coordinate NO-heme to a five-coordinate NO-heme with a characteristic EPR signal that differed from that in the absence of YC-1. These results revealed that YC-1 facilitated cleavage of the proximal His-iron bond and caused geometrical distortion of the five-coordinate NO-heme. Resonance Raman studies demonstrated the presence of two iron-CO stretch modes at 488 and 521 cm−1 specific to the YC-1-bound CO complex of the native enzyme. Together with the infrared C-O stretching measurements, we assigned the 488-cm−1 band to the iron-CO stretch of a six-coordinate CO-heme and the 521-cm−1 band to the iron-CO stretch of a five-coordinate CO-heme. These results indicate that YC-1 stimulates enzyme activity by weakening or cleaving the proximal His-iron bond in the CO complex as well as the NO complex.

The enzyme contains a stoichiometric amount of heme bound to histidine 105 of the N-terminal region of the β-subunit through a weak His-iron bond (15Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Google Scholar, 16Zhao Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15959-15964Google Scholar, 17Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Google Scholar). The C-terminal regions of the two subunits, which share sequence homology to the catalytic site of adenylate cyclases, are thought to comprise the catalytic domain. The weak proximal His-iron bond plays a crucial role in the ability of the enzyme to form an enzymatically active five-coordinate NO-heme. NO initially binds to the heme to form an inactive six-coordinate NO complex, which is then converted to an active five-coordinate NO complex leading to cleavage of the weak His-iron bond, thereby resulting in a 200-fold increase in activity above the basal level (18Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayshi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Google Scholar,19Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Google Scholar). Although the formation of NO-heme is known to occur in two steps as described above, details for the activation of the catalytic domain coupled with NO binding remain elusive. There has been much interest concerning the possible physiological role of CO in the activation of sGC, but its role as a signaling molecule remains uncertain because of its poor sGC-stimulating properties. Wuet al. (20Wu C.C. Ko F.N. Lee F.Y. Teng C.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1973-1978Google Scholar) reported that a benzylindazole compound YC-1 (3-(5′-hydroxymethyl-3′-furyl)-1-benzylindazole; structure shown in Scheme 1) is a NO-independent activator of platelet sGC. Subsequent work indicated that YC-1 stimulates in vitro cyclase activity of the CO-bound enzyme to a level comparable with that of NO activation (21Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Google Scholar). Significant stimulation of the ferrous and the ferrous NO enzymes by YC-1 was also noted (21Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Google Scholar, 22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandise P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Google Scholar). Despite the important observation of YC-1 sensitization of the enzyme toward NO and CO, no firm structural information concerning the binding of this molecule to the enzyme is available. For instance, some reports indicate that YC-1 binds to the N-terminal region of the β-subunit (22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandise P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Google Scholar), whereas work using a newly discovered antiplatelet reagent suggests that the YC-1-binding site is located on the α-subunit (23Stasch J.-P. Becker E.M. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Dembowsky K. Feurer A. Gerzer R. Minuth T. Perzborn E. Pleiβ U. Schröder H. Schroeder W. Stahl E. Steinke W. Straub A. Schramm M. Nature. 2001; 410: 212-215Google Scholar). The effects of YC-1 on the CO-heme coordination of the enzyme have been examined by the resonance Raman method. The results indicated that although YC-1 altered the CO-heme coordination, the CO-heme of the YC-1-bound enzyme was in a six-coordinate state with a proximal ligandtrans to CO (22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandise P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Google Scholar). Therefore, the YC-1-dependent activation of the CO bound enzyme did not apparently couple to the cleavage of the proximal His-iron bond. However, analyses of CO recombination kinetics suggest that the proximal His-iron bond may weaken or be replaced by a different base upon YC-1 binding (24Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Madge D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10699-10706Google Scholar). Although there is no evidence that an endogenous YC-1-like molecule plays a physiological role in regulating sGC activity, an investigation of its interaction with the enzyme will contribute to understanding mechanisms of regulation of the catalytic activity. In this study we attempted to solve the ambiguities regarding the YC-1-dependent stimulation of the NO and CO complexes of sGC. To obtain clear evidence of YC-1-dependent changes in the NO coordination, we have prepared the stable six-coordinate NO-heme by dibromodeuteroheme substitution. The NO complex of the reconstituted enzyme contained a significant amount of the six-coordinate NO-heme when the NO complex was prepared at pH 8.3. Binding of YC-1 resulted in a complete loss of the six-coordinate NO-heme with the concomitant formation of a five-coordinate NO-heme. This clearly demonstrates that YC-1 binding facilitates the cleavage of the proximal His-iron bond. YC-1-dependent scission of the proximal His-iron bond was confirmed by vibrational spectroscopic studies on the native CO-bound enzyme. This is a first observation for the formation of a five-coordinate CO-heme and provides a molecular mechanism for the YC-1-dependent CO sensing function of the enzyme. Agarose resins with dye ligands were prepared by an epoxy coupling method (25Sundberg L. Porath J. J. Chromatogr. 1974; 90: 87-98Google Scholar). Packed Sepharose 4B (100 g; Amersham Biosciences) was suspended in 150 ml of 1n NaOH solution containing 500 mg of NaBH4 and 8 ml of 1,4-butanediol-diglycidylether (Sigma-Aldrich). The gel was gently shaken for 5 h at 30 °C and was collected using a glass filter funnel and then washed with 3 liters of H2O. The packed gel was suspended in 150 ml of 0.5 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 12, and reacted with 1.2 g of Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A (Sigma-Aldrich), Cibacron Blue F3G-A (Fluka), or Cibacron Brilliant Yellow 3G-P (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 h at 42 °C with gentle shaking. The resultant derivatized gels were suspended in 200 ml of sodium carbonate solution containing 0.2m glycine and gently agitated overnight at 30 °C to completely block any residual epoxy groups. Fresh bovine lung (5 kg) was minced and homogenized using a Waring blender in 12 liters of 50 mmTEA buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 55 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). Protease inhibitors and β-mercaptoethanol were included in all the buffers throughout the purification unless stated otherwise. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was then mixed with 1.4 kg of DEAE cellulose A-500 (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with buffer A. The slurry was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and collected by sedimentation. Subsequently, the resin was washed two times with buffer A and poured into a column. The enzyme was eluted with a 3.5-liter linear NaCl gradient of 0–0.35 m in buffer A. The active fractions were concentrated and washed with 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.6, using a Minitan concentrator (Millipore) and then was applied to a Red Sepharose column (5 × 50 cm) equilibrated with the MOPS buffer described above. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl. The pooled active enzyme, which was equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.6, was adsorbed to a Yellow agarose column, and the protein was eluted by a linear gradient of 0–0.7 mm ATP. The concentrated active fractions were further purified on a Superdex 200-pg column (2.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) followed by a Source Q15 HPLC column (1.6 × 10 cm; Amersham Biosciences). sGC was purified to apparent homogeneity using a ceramic hydroxylapatite HPLC column (Bio-Rad), where the elution was carried out by increasing the phosphate concentration from 0 to 0.45 m at pH 7.6 in the absence of EDTA. The overall yield was about 20%. The resultant homogenous enzyme preparation was stored in liquid nitrogen until use. The apoenzyme was obtained by a previously described method (18Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayshi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The DEAE cellulose column fractions of crude homogenate treated at pH 8.5 were equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.6, and applied to a Blue Sepharose column. When protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl, the cyclase activity was recovered as two peaks, one containing the holoenzyme and the other containing the apoenzyme. The apoenzyme was reconstituted with dibromodeuteroheme in 40 mm TEA buffer, pH 7.5, containing the protease inhibitor mixture described earlier supplemented with pepstatin A, leupeptin, and E64, under anaerobic conditions at 20 °C. The remaining purification steps were the same as those used for the native enzyme purification. Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 18 spectrophotometer. The temperature of the cuvette holder was controlled with thermomodule elements. The buffer used was 40 mm TEA buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol or ethylene glycol. The details are given in the figure legends. EPR spectra were measured on a Varian E-12 X-band EPR spectrometer with 100-kHz field modulation at 77 K. The microwave frequency was calibrated with a microwave frequency counter (Takeda Riken, Model TR 5212), and the magnetic field strength was determined by the nuclear magnetic resonance of water protons. The accuracy of gvalues is ± 0.005. NO complexes for EPR measurements were prepared in the buffer containing 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol and 2.5% (v/v) DMF at 20 °C, as follows. The enzyme solution was transferred to a septum capped EPR tube and flushed with oxygen-free N2 gas for 10 min. Then, NO gas previously washed with 1 n NaOH solution was introduced with a gas tight syringe. After incubation at 20 °C for 5 min, the formation of NO complexes was monitored directly by measuring the optical spectrum of the sample. The samples in the EPR tubes were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Resonance Raman spectra were measured using a JASCO NR-1800 spectrometer equipped with liquid nitrogen cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instruments). Excitation wavelength was the 413.1-nm line from a Krypton ion laser (Coherent, Innova 90). The spectra were collected using a laser power of about 7 mW. To prevent the photodissociation of the bound CO, the laser beam was defocused. The Raman spectrometer was calibrated using indene. The infrared spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Spectral One FTIR spectrophotometer with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. A temperature-controlled cell holder was used. The cell had CaF2 windows with a light path length of 0.1 mm. The ferrous enzyme was used as a reference. In equilibrium dialysis, 6% (v/v) DMF was added to the buffer to maintain the required concentration of the poorly water-soluble YC-1. A five-cell rotating equilibrium dialyzer (Spectrum) was used for equilibrium dialysis experiments. Chambers (250 μl) were separated by dialysis membrane with a cut-off of 14 kDa. One chamber was filled with the ferrous enzyme, and the opposite chamber contained the desired amount of YC-1. In some cases, one chamber was filled with the ferrous enzyme and the desired amount of YC-1, and the opposite one contained the buffer solution alone. After introducing the sample (180 μl) into each chamber, the dialysis cells were rotated at a constant rate at 27 °C. The reaction achieved equilibrium within 5 h under these conditions. After dialysis for 6 h at 27 °C under constant rotation, the samples in each chamber were removed by a gas-tight syringe for quantitative analyses of YC-1. An aliquot of the enzyme solution was used to determine the heme concentration and to check the integrity of the enzyme. After dialysis, ∼85% of the enzyme was recovered as the active form with the same optical spectra and SDS-PAGE profile as the native enzyme. The samples removed from both chambers were diluted with a 2-fold volume of DMF to prevent the adsorption of YC-1 on the inner surface of sample cup. The concentration of YC-1 was determined by HPLC using a C18 column at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min of 65% (v/v) methanol. The amount of enzyme-bound YC-1 was calculated from the difference in the concentration between the two chambers with and without enzyme. The enzyme activity was measured as described previously (18Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayshi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Google Scholar). In brief, the assays were conducted in 50 mm TEA buffer, pH 7.5, supplemented with 5 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP in a final volume of 235 μl, and 10 μl of the enzyme was added to the mixture. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of SNAP (2 mm) and was conducted for 10 min at 37 °C. After terminating the reaction by addition of 10 μl of 30% (v/v) acetic acid, cGMP was determined by HPLC as described previously (18Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayshi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Google Scholar). For the activation by CO, the assay mixture was saturated with CO gas prior to the addition of the enzyme. Reducing SDS-PAGE was carried out using an 8% acrylamide running gel. The protein was visualized using either Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain (Daiichi Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). GTP and cGMP were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Research grade NO and CO were obtained from Takachiho Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). YC-1 and SNAP were purchased from ALEXIS (San Diego, CA). Dibromodeuteroheme was prepared according to the method of Seybert et al. (26Seybert D. Moffat K. Gibson Q.H. Chang C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4225-4231Google Scholar). Other chemicals, purchased from Nacalai Tesque Co. (Kyoto, Japan), were of the highest commercial grade and were used without further purification. The homogenous native enzyme exhibited a NO-dependent activity of 27–30 μmol/min/mg protein at 37 °C in the presence of Mg2+. This activity corresponded to a turnover of about 3,800 min−1 (μmol of cGMP/min/μmol of heme). SDS-PAGE analyses indicated that the enzyme was a heterodimeric protein consisting of the α-subunit of 78 kDa and the β-subunit of 70 kDa. The enzyme contained 0.95 protoheme IX/heterodimer, in which the protein and heme were determined by a modified biuret method (27Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1680-1688Google Scholar) and by the pyridine hemochromogen method (28Paul K.G. Theorell H. Akesson A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1284-1287Google Scholar), respectively. The optical spectra of the ferrous and the ferrous NO enzymes were identical to previous results (18Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayshi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Google Scholar). The dibromodeuteroheme-substituted enzyme had a subunit structure identical to that of the native enzyme (data not shown). The reconstituted enzyme in the ferrous state exhibited the Soret band at 426 nm and the visible absorption at 553 nm, indicative of a five-coordinate high spin state (Fig. 1). The addition of NO yielded the NO complexes with an intense Soret band at 393 nm with a shoulder around 410 nm. The bands at 393 and 410 nm were assigned to the five- and six-coordinate NO-hemes, respectively, as described later. The weak band at 481 nm was characteristic of the formation of five-coordinate NO-heme. The absorption band of the six-coordinate NO-heme at 410 nm was stable for at least 1 h at 20 °C. The addition of YC-1 rapidly converted the six-coordinate NO-heme to the five-coordinate NO-heme (data not shown). The stoichiometry of the binding between YC-1 and the ferrous enzyme was measured by equilibrium dialysis. The data were analyzed by Scatchard plot (29Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar), in which the fractional saturation (n = [YC-1]bound/[sGC]total) was plotted against the fractional saturation divided by the free concentration of YC-1 (n/[YC-1]free). The result obtained by least square analysis indicates that YC-1 bound/heme is 0.96 with a dissociation constant of 124 μm at 27 °C (Fig.2). This approximates to 1 mol of bound YC-1/mol of heterodimeric enzyme. A different enzyme preparation also displayed stoichiometry of 0.93 YC-1/heme. When guanylate cyclase activities were measured at pH 7.5, YC-1 enhanced the activity of the native NO-bound enzyme by about 1.1-fold (Fig.3), confirming previous results (21Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Google Scholar, 22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandise P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Google Scholar). The level of the stimulation by YC-1 is significantly higher at pH 8.3 (1.24-fold) than at pH 7.5. Similar experiments performed using the dibromodeuteroheme-substituted enzyme provide a clear mechanism of action for YC-1 (see Fig. 3). In this case, YC-1 stimulates the cyclase activity by 1.28-fold at pH 7.5 and by 2-fold at pH 8.3, suggesting that the NO complex of dibromodeuteroheme-substituted enzyme is largely made up of the catalytically inactive six-coordinate NO-heme. The activities of the reconstituted enzyme at both pH 7.5 and 8.3 are about 60% of those of the native enzyme even in the presence of YC-1. The reasons for heme-dependent changes in the activity are unknown. Fig. 4 shows the optical absorption spectra of the NO complex of the native and substituted enzymes. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, the NO complex of native enzyme at pH 8.3 comprises a small amount of six-coordinate NO-heme detected as a shoulder around 420 nm (18Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayshi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Google Scholar). The disappearance of the shoulder at 420 nm and the enhanced 399-nm band after binding of YC-1 indicates conversion of the six-coordinate NO-heme to the five-coordinate NO-heme (Fig. 4 A, spectrum c). As shown in Fig.4 B, the NO complex of dibromodeuteroheme-substituted enzyme exhibited two Soret bands at 393 and 410 nm. The 410-nm band was assigned as the six-coordinate NO complex of the substituted enzyme, as established by EPR spectroscopy described below. The effects of pH and YC-1 binding on the optical spectra of the NO complexes were consistent with the activity measurements, in which the inactive six-coordinate NO-heme accumulated at pH 8.3. To determine the coordination states of the NO-hemes, both NO-ligated forms of the native and the reconstituted enzymes were rapidly frozen and then analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. The14N16O complex of the native enzyme in the absence of YC-1 exhibits characteristic EPR signals of axially symmetric five-coordinate NO-heme (g ⊥ = 2.069 and g z = 2.009) with a triplet 14NO hyperfine splitting (Fig. 5, trace a). The spectral features agreed with the previous reports (18Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayshi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Google Scholar,30Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 572-577Google Scholar). At pH 8.3, a weak EPR signal at g = 1.976 caused by the six-coordinate NO-heme was observed in addition to EPR signals of the five-coordinate NO-heme (Fig. 5, trace b). The addition of YC-1 changed the six-coordinate NO-heme signal to a new five-coordinate NO-heme signal with rhombic symmetry. The new five-coordinate NO-heme was characterized by three distinctg values of g x = 2.103,g y = 2.032, and g z = 2.009 with triplet 14N hyperfine splitting (Fig. 5,trace c). For the dibromodeuteroheme-substituted enzymes (Fig. 5, traces d and e), the six-coordinate NO-heme was detected as an EPR signal at g = 1.976 (trace d). The addition of YC-1 resulted in the loss of the six-coordinate NO-heme signal and generated an EPR signal with rhombic symmetry that was essentially identical to the native enzyme (Fig. 5,trace e). This is the first direct evidence for YC-1-induced changes to the proximal His-iron bond and the NO coordination of the five-coordinate NO-heme. Ca2+-GTP also induced the conversion of the axially symmetric NO-heme signal to the NO-heme signal with rhombic symmetry as shown in trace f of Fig. 5, whereas neither Mg2+-ATP nor Ca2+-ATP altered the g value anisotropy in the NO-heme EPR signal (data not shown). The increase in g value anisotropy implies that YC-1 and Ca2+-GTP induce a significant geometrical distortion of the NO-heme coordination. YC-1 stimulated the cyclase activity of the CO-bound enzyme from 0.8 to 27 μmol/min/mg protein, as reported previously (21Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Google Scholar, 22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandise P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Google Scholar). The YC-1-induced changes in the iron-CO stretching vibration (νFe-CO) have been reported (22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandise P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Google Scholar), but precise analyses of the C-O stretching vibration (νC-O) and of the effects of YC-1 on the νC-O were not carried out (22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandise P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Google Scholar, 31Kim S.Y. Deinum G. Gardner M.T. Marletta M.A. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8769-8770Google Scholar). The infrared spectra of the 12C16O complex under various conditions are summarized in Fig. 6. We found a sharp band at 1987 cm−1 and a broad band centered at 1968 cm−1 both at 15 and 25 °C in the absence of YC-1 (Fig.6, traces A and B). The bands at 1987 and 1968 cm−1 shifted to 1943 and 1924 cm−1 upon13C16O substitution, respectively, indicating that they can be assigned to the νC-O mode (data not shown). At 15 °C, binding of YC-1 slightly diminished the 1987-cm−1 band and resulted in a small enhancement of the 1972-cm−1 band (Fig. 6, trace C). Raising the temperature up to 25 or 32 °C markedly intensified the band at 1972 cm−1 with the appearance of a shoulder at 1965 cm−1 (Fig. 6, traces D and E). The temperature-dependent changes were reversible. The shoulder at 1965 cm−1 is also seen in the difference spectrum (Fig.6, inset). No additional CO stretch band was detectable even when the concentration of sGC and YC-1 was increased (Fig. 6,trace F). These data demonstrate that there are two types of CO complex in the presence of YC-1, one with a 1972-cm−1band and the other with a 1965-cm−1 band. The effect of YC-1 on the formation of the two CO complexes is more apparent at elevated temperatures, suggesting an increase in affinity of YC-1 at a higher temperature. To determine the identity of these two CO species, we searched the νFe-CO mode by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The νFe-CO and the iron-carbon-oxygen bending vibration (δFe-C-O) of the CO complex in the absence of YC-1 have been reported to be 472 and 562 cm−1, respectively (17Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Google Scholar). The corresponding Raman bands in our experiments were at 475 and 565 cm−1 (Fig. 7,trace a). The former Raman band monotonously downshifted (475 → 472 → 468 → 466 cm−1), and the latter exhibited a zigzag isotope shift (565 → 552 → 565 → 549 cm−1) by increasing the mass of CO (Fig. 7, traces b–e), indicating that the former and the latter bands were assigned to the νFe-CO and the δFe-C-O, respectively. YC-1 produced a new Raman band at 488 cm−1with diminished intensity of the 475- cm−1 band in the YC-1-free form (Fig. 7, trace b). YC-1 did not alter the vibrations of the porphyrin macrocycle in the high frequency region (data not shown). The 488-cm−1 band monotonously downshifted to 485, 477, and 475 cm−1 by increasing the mass by 13C16O, 12C18O, and 13C18O, respectively (Fig. 7, traces c–e). The Raman band at 488 cm−1therefore is assigned to the νFe-CO mode of the YC-1-bound CO complex. In addition to the νFe-CO mode at 488 cm−1, YC-1 produced two other isotope-sensitive Raman bands at 521 and 589 cm−1 (Fig. 7, trace b). Careful examination revealed that the 589-cm−1 band exhibits a decrease-increase-decrease frequency shift in the order12C16O (589 cm−1) →13C16O (584 cm−1) →12C18O (589 cm−1) →13C18O (583 cm−1) (Fig. 7,traces b–e). Therefore, this band can be assigned to the δFe-C-O mode of the CO complex of the YC-1-bound enzyme. Comparison of the Raman spectrum with the infrared spectrum (Fig. 6, trace E) leads to the conclusion that one of the YC-1-bound CO complexes exhibits the νFe-CO at 488 cm−1,"
https://openalex.org/W2035750828,"We recently developed STO-609, a selective inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaM-KK), and we demonstrated that CaM-KKβ is more sensitive to STO-609 than the CaM-KKα isoform (Tokumitsu H., Inuzuka H., Ishikawa Y., Ikeda M., Saji I., and Kobayashi R. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 15813–15818). By using catalytic chimera and point mutants of both isoforms, we demonstrated that Val269 in CaM-KKβ/Leu233 in CaM-KKα confers a distinct sensitivity (∼10-fold) to STO-609 on CaM-KK isoforms. Various mutations of Val269 in CaM-KKβ indicate that substitution by hydrophobic residues with bulky side chains significantly decreases drug sensitivity and that the V269F mutant is the most effective drug-resistant enzyme (∼80-fold higher IC50 value). These findings are consistent with a result obtained with a full-length mutant expressed in COS-7 cells. Furthermore, suppression of CaM-KK-mediated CaM-KIV activation in transfected HeLa cells by STO-609 treatment was completely abolished by the co-expression of the CaM-KKβ V269F mutant. Based on the results that the distinct sensitivity of CaM-KK isoforms to STO-609 is because of a single amino acid substitution (Val/Leu) in the ATP-binding pocket, we have generated an STO-609-resistant CaM-KK mutant, which might be useful for validating the pharmacological effects and specificity of STO-609 in vivo. We recently developed STO-609, a selective inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaM-KK), and we demonstrated that CaM-KKβ is more sensitive to STO-609 than the CaM-KKα isoform (Tokumitsu H., Inuzuka H., Ishikawa Y., Ikeda M., Saji I., and Kobayashi R.

Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase calmodulin cAMP-dependent protein kinase cAMP-response element binding protein hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase Intracellular Ca2+ is known to be a second messenger mediating a wide variety of physiological functions such as contraction, gene expression, and secretion. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM-K)1 constitute a diverse group of enzymes involved in many cellular responses mediated by an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium. Previous studies have demonstrated that two multifunctional CaM kinases, CaM-KI and -IV, are activated by the phosphorylation of an activation loop Thr residue by an upstream CaM kinase kinase (CaM-KK), resulting in a large increase in catalytic efficiency (1Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Google Scholar, 2Corcoran E.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2975-2978Google Scholar). In mammals, two CaM-KK genes (CaM-KKα and CaM-KKβ) have been cloned, both of which are highly expressed in the brain and also expressed (to a low degree) in various peripheral tissues such as the thymus and spleen (3Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Google Scholar, 4Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 243-250Google Scholar, 5Anderson K.A. Means R.L.

CaM-KK is also known to be a Ca2+/CaM-regulated enzyme (3Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Google Scholar, 5Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E.

Indeed, Ca2+/CaM binding is absolutely required for the relief of CaM-KKα autoinhibition, which results in the activation of the enzyme (8Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Google Scholar, 9Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21473-21481Google Scholar, 10Tokumitsu H. Muramatsu M. Ikura M. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20090-20095Google Scholar). In contrast, CaM-KKβ exhibits enhanced Ca2+/CaM-independent activity, because of the suppression of autoinhibition by the second regulatory segment (residues 129–151) located at the N terminus of the catalytic domain (5Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Google Scholar, 11Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Google Scholar). The CaM-KK gene has been found in Caenorhabditis elegans andAspergillus nidulans, and the proteins they encode are components of the CaM kinase cascade of these organisms (12Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10806-10810Google Scholar, 13Tokumitsu H. Takahashi N. Eto K. Yano S.

A functional CaM kinase cascade leading to the activation of CaM-KIV in response to Ca2+ mobilization has been demonstrated by using transfected COS-7 cells (6Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Google Scholar), Jurkat cells (16Park I.-K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30464-30469Google Scholar), and cultured hippocampal neurons (17Bito H. Deisserroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Google Scholar). The cascade has also been shown to be required for the activation of CaM-KI in PC-12 cells upon membrane depolarization (18Alleta J.M. Selbert M.A. Nairn A.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20930-20934Google Scholar). An important role has been demonstrated for the CaM-KIV cascade in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent gene expression by the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as CREB (19Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Google Scholar, 20Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 21Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J.

A recent study of transgenic mice carrying dominant negative CaM-KIV alleles that confer a defect in the phosphorylation of CREB indicates that these animals exhibit a disruption of late-phase long term potentiation, and that they are impaired in the consolidation/retention phase of hippocampus-dependent memory (23Kang H. Sun L.D. Atkins C.M. Soderling T.R. Wilson M.A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2001; 106: 771-783Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the CaM kinase cascade regulated CREB-dependent gene expression in neurons of living nematodes by using transgenic worms (24Kimura Y. Corcoran E.E. Eto K. Gengyo-Ando K. Muramatsu M. Kobayashi R. Freedman J.H. Mitani S. Hagiwara M. Means A.R. Tokumitsu H. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 962-966Google Scholar). Analysis of mice deficient in CaM-KIV revealed that the CaM-KIV-mediated pathway plays an important role in the function and development of the cerebellum and is critical for male and female fertility (25Ribar T.J. Rodriguiz R.M. Khiroug L. Wetsel W.C. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC107Google Scholar, 26Wu J.Y. Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Richards J.S. Means A.R.

In addition, a physiological role has been predicted for CaM-KK, with the suggestion that it may act as a regulatory protein kinase in the CaM kinase cascade; however, this has not been demonstrated in vivo. To evaluate the physiological functions of CaM-KK and those of the CaM kinase cascade, we recently developed a relatively selective and cell-permeable inhibitor of CaM-KK, STO-609 (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar). However, a recent search for protein kinase sequences in the human genome revealed that 510 protein kinase genes are encoded in the human genome (29Kostich M. English J. Madison V. Gheyas F. Wang L. Qiu P. Greene J. Laz T.M. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 0043.1-0043.12Google Scholar), indicating the practical difficulty of precisely examining the specificity of the protein kinase inhibitor in vivo as well as in vitro (35Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterized the inhibitory mechanism of STO-609 on CaM-KK activity; based on the results, we attempted to generate an inhibitor-resistant CaM-KK mutant that might prove valuable for evaluating the specificity of the pharmacological effect(s) of STO-609 in vivo. CaM-KKα cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number L42810 (3Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Google Scholar)) was obtained from a rat brain cDNA library. Rat CaM-KKβ was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR, as described previously (11Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Google Scholar). Recombinant rat CaM was expressed in theEscherichia coli strain BL-21(DE3) using pET-CaM (30Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Takasaki A. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 25-28Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Nobuhiro Hayashi, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan) and was purified by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography. Rat CaM-KI-(1–293, K49E) was expressed in E. coli JM-109 as a GST fusion protein and was purified by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography (10Tokumitsu H. Muramatsu M. Ikura M. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20090-20095Google Scholar). STO-609 (7H-benzimidazo[2,1-a]benz[de]isoquinoline-7-one-3-carboxylic acid, MW 314.29) was synthesized as recently described (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar). GST fused with CaM-KKα-(126–434) and CaM-KKβ-(162–470) was constructed by amplification of each fragment by PCR using specific primers (CaM-KKα-(126–434): sense primer, 5′-TCTCTAGAGAACCAGTACAAGCTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TTGACTGTCGACTACACCTCCTCCTCAGTC-3′; CaM-KKβ-(162–470), sense primer/5′-GCTCTAGAGAATCAGTACACGCTGAAG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-TTGACTGTCGACTAGACCTCCTCTTCGGTC-3′) followed by ligation into an XbaI/SalI site in a pGEX-PreS vector (11Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Google Scholar). GST-CaM-KKβ-(162–374)/CaM-KKα-(339–434) and GST-CaM-KKβ-(162–303)/CaM-KKα-(268–434) were constructed by replacement of the corresponding fragment using common restriction sites, StuI and ScaI, respectively. GST-CaM-KKβ-(162–271)/CaM-KKα-(236–434) was constructed by PCR amplification of each cDNA fragment using phosphorylated primers (sense primer, 5′-GCTCTAGAGAATCAGTACACGCTGAAG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-CCCTTGGTTGACCAGTTCAAACACCATGTA for the amplification of CaM-KKβ-(162–272) and sense primer, 5′-CCAGTCATGGAAGTGCCCTGCGACAAGCCC-3′, antisense primer, 5′-TTGACTGTCGACTACACCTCCTCCTCAGTC-3′ for the amplification of CaM-KKα-(237–434)) and pyrobest DNA polymerase, followed by the insertion of both fragments into anXbaI/SalI-digested pGEX-PreS vector. GST-CaM-KKβ-(162–250)/CaM-KKα-(215–434) was constructed by PCR amplification of each cDNA fragment using phosphorylated primers (sense primer, 5′-GCTCTAGAGAATCAGTACACGCTGAAG-3′, antisense primer/5′-TCCACAAGCTTCACCACGTTGGGGTGATCC-3′ for the amplification of CaM-KKβ-(162–251) and sense primer, 5′-TAGTCAAGCTTATCGAGGTCCTGGATGATC-3′, antisense primer, 5′-TTGACTGTCGACTACACCTCCTCCTCAGTC-3′ for the amplification of CaM-KKα-(212–434)) and pyrobest DNA polymerase, followed byHindIII digestion and ligation of both fragments into anXbaI/SalI-digested pGEX-PreS vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by GenEditorTM (Promega) using GST-CaM-KKβ-(162–470) cDNA as a template and the following mutagenic primers: V251I, 5′-ACGTGGTGAAGCTTATCGAGGTCCTGGATG-3′; N258A, 5′-CTGGATGACCCTGCTGAGGACCATCTGTAC-3′; H261N, 5′-GACCCTAACGAGGACAATCTGTACATGGTG-3′; M264L, 5′-AGGACCATCTGTACTTGGTGTTTGAACTGG-3′; E267D, 5′-ACATGGTGTTTGACCTAGTCAACCAAGGGC-3′; V269L, 5′-TGGTGTTTGAACTGCTCAACCAAGGGCCTG-3′; N270R, 5′-TTTGAACTGGTCAGACAAGGGCCTGTGATG-3′; Q271K, 5′-TTGAACTGGTCAACAAGGGGCCTGTGATGG-3′; V269A, 5′-TGGTGTTTGAACTGGCCAACCAAGGGCCTG-3′; V269I, 5′-TGGTGTTTGAACTGATCAACCAAGGGCCTG-3′; V269F, 5′-TGGTGTTTGAACTGTTCAACCAAGGGCCTG-3′; V269H, 5′-TGGTGTTTGAACTGCACAACCAAGGGCCTG-3′; V269M, 5′-TGGTGTTTGAACTGATGAACCAAGGGCCTG-3′; V269P 5′-TGGTGTTTGAACTGCCCAACCAAGGGCCTG-3′. GST-CaM-KKα-(126–434) L233V mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis as described above using GST-CaM-KKα-(126–434) cDNA as a template and 5′-TTTGACCTCGTGAGAAAGGGCCCAGTCATG-3′ as a mutagenic primer. The nucleotide sequences of each mutant were confirmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer. GST-fused CaM-KK mutants were expressed in E. coli JM-109 and purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (11Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Google Scholar). Either purified recombinant CaM-KKs (20–30 ng of GST-fusion enzyme) or CaM-KKβ expressed in COS-7 cells (4 ng enzyme) were incubated with 10 μg of GST-CaM-KI-(1–293, K49E) at 30 °C for 5 min in a solution (25 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMg(Ac)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3000–7000 cpm/pmol) with various concentrations of STO-609 (0–1 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 4%) in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA for GST fusion enzymes or 1 mmCaCl2, 2 μm CaM for CaM-KKβ expressed in COS-7 cells. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated by spotting aliquots (15 μl) onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81) followed by several washes with 75 mm phosphoric acid (31Roskowski R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 99: 3-6Google Scholar). Phosphate incorporation into GST-CaM-KI-(1–293, K49E) was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. A 5-min reaction was chosen to determine CaM-KK activity based on a recently described time course experiment (11Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were subcultured in 6-cm dishes 12 h before transfection. The cells were then transferred to serum-free medium and treated with a mixture of either 2.7 μg of pME18s plasmid DNA (DNAX Research Institute, Inc.) or 2.7 μg of HA (hemagglutinin-tagged)-CaM-KIV with or without 40 ng of CaM-KKβ and 20 μg of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in 2.5 ml of medium. After 40 h of culture, the cells were further cultured in serum-free medium for 6 h in either the absence or presence of various concentrations of STO-609 (1 and 10 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 0.5%) and then treated with or without 1 μm ionomycin for 5 min. Stimulation was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μmmycrocistin-LR), and the cells were lysed for 30 min on ice. The cell extract was collected and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 15 min and the supernatant was precleared with 40 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry, Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then mixed with 4 μg of anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h. In addition, 40 μl of Protein G-Sepharose was applied to the extract and incubated overnight. The immunoprecipitated resin was washed three times with 1 ml of the lysis buffer, as described above, and then the resin was washed with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 μm mycrocistin-LR). Protein G-Sepharose with immunoprecipitated HA-CaM-KIV was incubated with 40 μmsyntide-2 at 30 °C for 10 min in a solution (40 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm mycrocistin-LR, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. To estimate the amount of immunoprecipitated HA-CaM-KIV, SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 μl) was added to immunoprecipitated samples and then heated at 95 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, 5 μl of the sample was subjected to SDS-7.5% PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-CaM-KIV antibody (1:2000, Transduction Laboratories). To confirm the expression level of co-expressed CaM-KKβ (wild-type and V269F mutant), transfected HeLa cells were lysed with 160 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer after stimulation with or without ionomycin as described above, and then the sample was heated at 95 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, 20 μl of the sample was subjected to SDS-7.5% PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-CaM-KK antibody (1:2000, Transduction Laboratories). Expression of full-length CaM-KKβ in COS-7 cells was carried out essentially as described above, using 3 μg of either pME-CaM-KKβ (wild-type or V269F mutant) or empty vector (pME18s, mock) and 20 μg of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). After 36 h culture, cells in 6-cm dishes were lysed with 250 μl of lysis buffer, as described above, without EGTA. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected and stored at −30 °C until used for the CaM-KK activity assay. The amount of CaM-KKβ in the cell extract was estimated by Western blot analysis with anti-CaM-KK antibody (1:2000, Transduction Laboratories) using purified recombinant wild-type CaM-KKβ (11Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Google Scholar) as a standard. The antibody was capable of recognizing both α and β isoforms of CaM-KK (11Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) as a secondary antibody and chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for detection. Protein concentrations for E. coli expressing GST-fused CaM-KK mutants were estimated by Coomassie dye binding (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. We have recently developed a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of CaM-KK, STO-609, which can permeate cells and is a competitive inhibitor of ATP (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar). According to previous results, the sensitivity of CaM-KKβ to the compound is >5-fold higher than that of the α isoform whereas the apparent K m values of both isoforms for ATP (∼33 μm) are indistinguishable (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of the differential sensitivity of CaM-KK isoforms to STO-609, we examined the inhibitory effect of STO-609 on various catalytic domain chimera mutants of both isoforms, because the inhibitor has been shown to target the catalytic domain of CaM-KK (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar). Catalytic domain mutants, including the wild-type enzyme, lack both an N-terminal extension domain (residues 1–125 in the α isoform and residues 1–161 in the β isoform) and a C-terminal domain containing an autoinhibitory segment and a CaM-binding segment (8Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Google Scholar, 11Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Google Scholar). These mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified as GST fusion proteins. Thus, all of the recombinant enzyme phosphorylates the protein substrate (GST-CaM-KI-(1–293), K49E) in a complete Ca2+/CaM-independent manner. Despite the 70% amino acid identity of the catalytic domain between rat CaM-KKα and -β (Fig.1 A), STO-609 suppressed CaM-KKβ-(162–470) activity more efficiently (IC50 = ∼10 ng/ml) than did the α isoform (126–434, IC50 = ∼130 ng/ml) in the presence of 50 μm ATP (Fig.1 B). When we compared the inhibitory potency of STO-609 against various chimera mutants, CaM-KKβ-(162–374)/CaM-KKα-(339–434), CaM-KKβ-(162–303)/CaM-KKα-(268–434), and CaM-KKβ-(162–271)/CaM-KKα-(236–434) mutants showed no significant difference in their IC50 value (∼10 ng/ml) from that of CaM-KKβ-(162–470). Only the CaM-KKβ-(162–250)/CaM-KKα-(215–434) mutant drastically decreased the sensitivity to STO-609 (IC50 = ∼130 ng/ml), whose IC50 value is comparable with that of the CaM-KKα isoform (126–434). This result suggests that residues 251–271 in CaM-KKβ that correspond to residues 215–235 in the α isoform (Fig.1 A) appear to be involved in the sensitivity to inhibition by STO-609. These residues of both CaM-KK isoforms are located between subdomains IV and V in the protein kinase catalytic domain (32Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar), containing an ATP-binding hydrophobic pocket. According to the amino acid sequence alignment of the region involved in the distinct sensitivity of CaM-KK isoforms to the inhibitor described above, eight amino acid residues were shown to differ (Fig.2). Then, we replaced each of the differing amino acids among residues 251–271 of CaM-KKβ-(162–470) by the corresponding residues in the α isoform and measured the inhibitory effects of STO-609 on the activities of the mutants (Fig.2). The IC50 values of seven of eight substitution mutants (V251I, N258A, H261N, M264L, E267D, N270R, and Q271L) for inhibition by STO-609 were indistinguishable to that of CaM-KKβ-(162–470)(IC50 = ∼10 ng/ml). Only the V269L mutation significantly reduced the sensitivity of the enzyme to STO-609 (IC50 = ∼140 ng/ml) without any effects on the catalytic efficiency. This IC50 value reflects a similar inhibitory potency to CaM-KKα-(126–434). To confirm whether Leu233(i.e. the equivalent of Val269 in the β isoform) in CaM-KKα is indeed involved in lowered drug sensitivity, as compared with the β isoform, we replaced Leu233 in CaM-KKα-(126–434) with a Val residue and measured the inhibitory effect of STO-609 on the mutant. As was expected, the IC50value of the L233V mutant of CaM-KKα-(126–434) for inhibition by STO-609 was ∼8-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic activity of the L233V mutant in the absence of STO-609 was comparable with that of the wild-type CaM-KKα-(126–434). These results strongly indicate that a single amino acid difference (Val/Leu) in the catalytic domain of CaM-KK isoforms dictates sensitivity to the inhibitor. Val residue at position 269 in the rat CaM-KKβ is conserved in human CaM-KKβ (Val270) (5Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Google Scholar) and C. elegans CaM-KK (Val125) (13Tokumitsu H. Takahashi N. Eto K. Yano S. Soderling T.R. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16073-16076Google Scholar). According to the crystal structure of PKA, Val269 in CaM-KKβ is also conserved in subdomain V in PKA as Val123, which helps to anchor Mg-ATP by hydrogen bonding, and also contributes to a hydrophobic pocket that surrounds the adenine ring (33Knighton D.R. Zheng L. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Google Scholar, 34Knighton D.R. Zheng L. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Google Scholar). Next, we mutated Val269 in CaM-KKβ-(162–470) with various amino acid residues, and in particular, hydrophobic residues, to maintain the hydrophobic ATP-binding pocket. We then examined the inhibitory potency of the inhibitor against these mutants (Fig.3). Although the Ala mutation had little or no significant effect on the drug sensitivity of the enzyme, the mutations with hydrophobic residues with relatively bulky side chains (Leu, His, and Met) resulted in a significant increase (>10-fold) in the IC50 value for inhibition by STO-609 of the CaM-KK mutants. We found that the mutation of Val269 by Phe caused the most dramatic effect (i.e. ∼80-fold increase in the IC50 value) on the drug sensitivity of CaM-KKβ. It is of note that a Pro mutation results in an inactive enzyme, probably because of the destruction of the structure of the ATP-binding pocket necessary for efficient catalysis. Because the V269A mutant was inhibited by STO-609 with the same potency as was the wild-type enzyme, an amino acid residue at Val269 in CaM-KKβ/Leu233 in CaM-KKα may not be involved in the direct binding of the compound to CaM-KK. However, mutation of Val269 by hydrophobic residues with relatively larger side chains (e.g. Leu, Met, His, and Phe) can efficiently block the STO-609/CaM-KK interaction resulting in decreased drug sensitivity of CaM-KK. Identification of Val269/Leu233 in the CaM-KK isoforms involved in the STO-609 sensitivity described above was performed by using E. coli expressing GST fusion proteins with the catalytic domain of each CaM-KK. We attempted to express the V269F mutant of full-length CaM-KKβ in mammalian cells to confirm the drug sensitivity of the mutant enzyme. As shown in Fig.4, the protein kinase activity of wild-type CaM-KKβ expressed in COS-7 cells was inhibited by ∼80% in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml STO-609 with an IC50 value of 20–30 ng/ml. This result is consistent with that of a previous report using E. coli expressing full-length CaM-KKβ (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar). In contrast, although the CaM-KK activities of COS-7 cells expressing the wild-type CaM-KKβ (504 ± 15 nmol/min/mg) and the V269F mutant (656 ± 22 nmol/min/mg) in the absence of STO-609 were comparable, 1 μg/ml STO-609 suppressed only 40% of the V269F mutant activity. And the IC50 value for inhibition by STO-609 of the mutant was approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. This finding is in good agreement with the results obtained with catalytic domain mutants, as shown in Fig. 3. Finally, we examined whether or not ectopical expression of the CaM-KKβ V269F mutant induces STO-609 resistance in the kinase-expressing cells. After we co-transfected HA-tagged CaM-KIV with an empty vector, wild-type CaM-KKβ, or V269F mutant cDNA into HeLa cells, the cells were treated with (1 and 10 μg/ml) or without STO-609, and then the cells were stimulated with ionomycin for 5 min, thereby increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Then, HA-CaM-KIV was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody followed by measurement of its Ca2+/CaM-independent activity using syntide-2 as a substrate (Fig. 5). Western blot analysis of the cell extract using anti-CaM-KK antibody revealed that HeLa cells contain endogenous CaM-KKα and the expression levels of overexpressed wild-type CaM-KKβ and V269F mutant were indistinguishable (Fig. 5, upper inset). The amount of immunoprecipitated HA-CaM-KIV was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, lower inset). The protein kinase activity of immunoprecipitated CaM-KIV from cells co-expressed with or without wild-type CaM-KKβ or V269F mutant was largely activated by Ca2+ mobilization. Maximum activity of the immunoprecipitated CaM-KIV induced by ionomycin was not affected by co-expression of either wild-type CaM-KKβ or V269F mutant. Suppression of Ca2+-dependent induction of CaM-KIV activity by STO-609 treatment indicates an endogenous CaM-KK-mediated CaM-K cascade in HeLa cells. STO-609 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar), and the ATP-concentration in cells is in the millimolar range. Therefore, a much higher concentration of STO-609 appears to be required to suppress CaM-KK activity in these cells, as compared with the concentration required for the inhibition of CaM-KK activity in vitro. Although the overexpression of wild-type CaM-KKβ significantly reduced the inhibitory potency of STO-609 for the activation of CaM-KIV in these cells, when compared with the inhibition of endogenous CaM-KK activity in HeLa cells, it was nonetheless shown that 50–60% of the ionomycin-induced CaM-KIV activation was suppressed by treatment with 10 μg/ml STO-609 in the presence of overexpressed wild-type CaM-KKβ. In contrast, activation of CaM-KIV from the cells co-expressed with the V269F mutant was completely resistant to the inhibitor at concentrations up to 10 μg/ml. This result establishes that the suppression of ionomycin-induced CaM-KIV activity by STO-609 was because of direct inhibition of endogenous CaM-KK in these cells, as effected by the inhibitor. We have observed a similar result with the same transfection experiment using COS-7 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results support the idea that the V269F mutant of CaM-KKβ functions as an STO-609-resistant mutant in intact cells as well as in vitro. In summary, we have characterized the inhibitory mechanism of a recently developed inhibitor of CaM-KK, STO-609, with regard to the distinct sensitivity of CaM-KK isoforms to the inhibitor. We have shown in this report that a single amino acid difference (Val269in CaM-KKβ/Leu233 in CaM-KKα) in the ATP-binding hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic domain of CaM-KK isoforms is directly involved in the distinct sensitivity to the inhibitor. This conclusion is well correlated with findings from the kinetic analysis of STO-609 inhibition, which revealed that the compound is ATP-competitive (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar). Although Val269 is conserved in PKA (Val123) as an important residue that contributes to a hydrophobic pocket and also helps to anchor Mg-ATP, STO-609 has a less effective inhibitory potency (<100-fold) against PKA than does CaM-KK (28Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Google Scholar). This suggests that the reduced inhibitory potency of this compound against PKA appears to proceed in a totally different manner from that of CaM-KK. According to the present results with various point mutants of Val269 in CaM-KKβ, substitution of Val269 by residues with bulky side chains resulted in effectively increasing IC50 values of the mutants. This result is probably because of interference with the binding of STO-609 to CaM-KK by bulky side chains, because the substitution of Val269 by a residue with a relatively small side chain such as Ala had no impact on inhibition by STO-609. Based on these results, we generated an STO-609-resistant CaM-KKβ mutant (V269F), which was able to induce STO-609 resistance in transfected HeLa cells in terms of the activation of CaM-KK-mediated CaM-KIV activation. Because 510 protein kinases are likely encoded in the human genome (29Kostich M. English J. Madison V. Gheyas F. Wang L. Qiu P. Greene J. Laz T.M. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 0043.1-0043.12Google Scholar), it is very difficult to evaluate the specificity of a protein kinase inhibitor,in vitro as well as in vivo. Therefore, the availability of an STO-609-resistant CaM-KK mutant could be useful to validate the pharmacological effect(s) and the specificity of a compound in vivo with regard to elucidation of the physiological function(s) mediated by the CaM kinase cascade. We thank Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals for the synthesis of STO-609 and N. Ishikawa (Kagawa Medical University) for excellent technical assistance. We are also grateful to Y. Watanabe (Kagawa Medical University) for helpful discussions."

To study the contributions of different domains of the standard isoform of CD44 to cell rolling, a CD44-negative mouse T lymphoma AKR1 was transfected with wild type (WT) or mutated cDNA constructs. A parallel flow chamber was used to study the rolling behavior of CD44 transfectants on immobilized HA. For CD44WT transfectants, the fraction of cells that rolled and the rolling velocity was inversely proportional to the amount of cell surface CD44. When the cytoplasmic domain distal to Gly305 or sequences that serve as binding sites for cytoskeletal linker proteins, were deleted or replaced with foreign sequences, no significant changes in the rolling behavior of mutant cells, compared with the transfectant expressing CD44WT, were observed. Transfectants lacking 64 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail distal to Cys295 adhered to HA but showed enhanced rolling at low shear forces. When 83 amino acids from the “non-conserved” membrane-proximal region of the CD44 extracellular domain were deleted, cells adhered firmly to the HA substrate and did not roll at any fluid shear force tested. Unlike wild type cells that exhibited a nearly homogenous distribution of CD44 on a smooth cell surface, cells expressing the non-conserved region deletion mutant accumulated CD44 in membrane protrusions. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin B precluded the formation of membrane protrusions, however, treated cells still adhered firmly to HA and did not roll. We conclude that interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 and the cytoskeleton is not required for cell rolling on immobilized ligand. The strong effect of deletion of the non-conserved region of the extracellular domain argues for a critical role of this region in CD44-dependent rolling and adhesion interactions with HA under flow.

This multistep process begins with establishment of relatively weak, transient adhesive interactions between the leukocyte and the vessel wall that result in cell rolling along the endothelium under blood flow (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Google Scholar). The rolling interaction is a prerequisite for the generation of high strength intermolecular bonds and firm adhesion of the leukocyte to the vessel wall via activation-induced binding of integrins to their ligands (2Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Google Scholar). The sequence of cell rolling, firm adhesion, and transendothelial migration requires cooperation among a number of adhesion receptors (1Springer T.A.

CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in a wide variety of cell types (reviewed in Refs. 5Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Google Scholar and 6Lesley J. Hyman R. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: 616-630Google Scholar). The primary physiologic ligand of CD44 is hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA)1 (7Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Google Scholar), a component of the extracellular matrix. CD44 is believed to be one of the key adhesion molecules that direct the traffic of activated T cells to inflamed tissues (8DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Siegelman M.H.

Cell surface expression of CD44 is up-regulated in activated lymphocytes, and cell activation also facilitates HA binding (12Lesley J. Howes N. Perschl A. Hyman R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 383-387Google Scholar, 13DeGrendele H.C. Kosfiszer M. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2549-2553Google Scholar). HA expression is also up-regulated on the endothelial cell surface upon pro-inflammatory stimuli (14Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14939-14948Google Scholar), thus providing a high local ligand density that may enhance the CD44-mediated interactions of lymphocytes with HA. CD44 has been implicated in metastasis formation by different types of malignant tumors that express high amounts of this receptor (16Thomas L. Byers H.R. Vink J. Stamenkovic I. J.

During the hematogenous spread of some types of cancer, the initial arrest of cancer cells, and the migration of these cells on endothelial HA or within an HA-rich stroma, could potentially be mediated via CD44 (16Thomas L.

It has not been demonstrated, however, whether tumor cell extravasation requires a rolling interaction with endothelial HA. The cytoplasmic tail of CD44 has sites mediating interaction with ezrin (23Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Google Scholar, 24Legg J.W.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Google Scholar). Intracellular association of CD44 with these cytoskeletal linker proteins could function in post-ligand binding events mediated by CD44. The cytoplasmic domain of CD44 may be phosphorylated at one or more serine residues (26Legg J.W. Lewis C.A. Parsons M. Ng T. Isacke C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 399-407Google Scholar, 27Peck D. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1595-1601Google Scholar), and phosphorylation has been implicated in mediating cell migration on HA (27Peck D. Isacke C.M. J.

Whether specific sequence within the CD44 cytoplasmic domain or other regions of the standard form of CD44 are required for or modulate cell rolling on an HA substrate remains unclear. Here we have used AKR1 lymphoma cells transfected with constructs encoding either WT or mutated mouse CD44 molecules to examine whether mutation of the CD44 cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or extracellular domains would alter the rolling behavior of transfected cells on an HA-coated substrate. HA, purified from either human umbilical cord (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) or rooster comb (Healon®, Pharmacia-Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI), was used in this study. Both preparations contain high molecular-weight HA (∼1 × 103 and 4 × 103 kDa for umbilical cord HA and Healon®, respectively). Rat monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for mouse CD44 IM7.8.1 (referred to as IM7) and IRAWB14 (28Trowbridge I.S. Lesley J. Schulte R. Hyman R. Trotter J. Immunogenetics. 1982; 15: 299-312Google Scholar, 29Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Google Scholar, 30Zheng Z. Katoh S. He Q. Oritani K. Miyake K. Lesley J. Hyman R. Hamik A. Parkhouse R.M.E. Farr A.G. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 485-495Google Scholar) were purified from ascites fluid on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) as described (31Mikecz K. Brennan F.R. Kim J.H. Glant T.T. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 558-563Google Scholar, 32Kim J.H. Glant T.T. Lesley J. Hyman R. Mikecz K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 445-453Google Scholar). Conjugation of antibodies with biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) or Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Fluorescein-conjugated HA (FL-HA) was prepared as described by de Belder and Wik (33de Belder A.N. Wik K.O. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Google Scholar). Streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) was obtained from Molecular Probes, andStreptomyces hyaluronidase, chondroitin sulfate A, cytochalasin B, and TRITC-labeled phalloidin were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). cDNA constructs, encoding wild type and mutated forms of the standard isoform (also known as hemopoietic form, CD44H) of mouse CD44, were generated using PCR and site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (29Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Google Scholar, 34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 245-253Google Scholar). The sequences of the PCR products were verified on an automated DNA sequencer, and the constructs were subcloned into expression vectors pRC/RSV, pHβAPr-1, or p304SRα (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar, 35He Q. Lesley J. Hyman R. Ishihara K. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1711-1719Google Scholar, 36Lesley J.

Schematic structures of CD44 proteins, encoded by these constructs, are shown in Fig. 1. AKR1, a CD44-negative mouse T-cell lymphoma, was transfected by electroporation, and stable transfectants were selected in the presence of G418 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) as described (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar, 36Lesley J. English N. Charles C. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 245-253Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma). AKR1 transfectants expressing WT and mutated CD44 molecules were assayed for cell surface CD44 density and for binding of FL-HA from solution. CD44 was detected using biotinylated IRAWB14 mAb (shown in Fig. 2 A) or IM7 (not shown), both mAb giving essentially identical results for each transfectant. Following incubation with streptavidin-PE and washing, fluorescence was analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For CD44 immunostaining, cells (with or without pretreatment with 40 μm cytochalasin B at 37 °C for 3 h) were incubated on HA-coated culture dishes (see below) for 10 min. Following washing and fixation with 2% formaldehyde, cells that adhered to immobilized HA were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated IM7 mAb. Because the epitope recognized by IM7 is outside of the HA binding domain of CD44 (30Zheng Z. Katoh S. He Q. Oritani K. Miyake K. Lesley J. Hyman R. Hamik A. Parkhouse R.M.E. Farr A.G. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 485-495Google Scholar), binding of this antibody to the epitope is not expected to be affected by ligand occupancy at the membrane-substrate interface. For actin staining, HA-adherent, formaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with TRITC-phalloidin (32Kim J.H. Glant T.T. Lesley J. Hyman R. Mikecz K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 445-453Google Scholar). The distribution of CD44 or filamentous actin was examined using an Eclipse TE200 confocal microscope (Nikon, Garden City, NJ) and Metavue imaging software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). For three-dimensional reconstruction of images, Z-series of 300-nm-thick slices were used. The experimental conditions for assessment of cell rolling on immobilized HA have been described in detail before (37Lesley J. English N.M. Gal I. Mikecz K. Day A.J. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26600-26608Google Scholar). In brief, HA (1 mg/ml) was adsorbed onto the bottom of 60-mm plastic Petri dishes that constituted the bottom of a parallel plate flow chamber (GlycoTech, Rockville, MD). The chamber was perfused with the cell suspension using a programmable syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) in withdrawal mode. Cells were accumulated at a shear force of 0.25 dyn/cm2, followed by exposure to increasing levels of fluid shear (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 dyn/cm2, each for 2 min). Cell movement was recorded by streamline acquisition of images using a digital camera (RS Photometrics, Trenton, NJ) attached to a Nikon Diaphot inverted phase-contrast microscope. To assess the strength of cell adhesion, the number of adherent cells was determined at the end of each 2-min flow period and expressed as a percentage of the number of adherent cells at the starting shear force (0.25 dyn/cm2). The ratio of rolling cells was expressed as the percentage of adherent cells that moved parallel with the fluid flow on the HA substrate (37Lesley J. English N.M. Gal I. Mikecz K. Day A.J. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26600-26608Google Scholar). The rolling velocity (microns/s) was also determined at each level of shear force. Images were collected and analyzed using a Metaview image analysis system (Universal Imaging). At least three fields of microscopic view and, for velocity measurements, at least 100 cells were analyzed at each shear force. In initial experiments, both mammalian (umbilical cord) and avian (Healon®, prepared from rooster comb) HA was used to coat culture dishes that constituted the bottom of the flow chamber. Although both HA preparations supported rolling, the CD44 transfectants attached more evenly to, and rolled more smoothly on, the surfaces coated with umbilical cord HA than on those coated with Healon®. For this study, therefore, HA of mammalian origin was chosen as a substrate for the cell rolling experiments. To rule out the possibility that the rolling interactions were mediated by contaminating proteins or chondroitin sulfate, which could be present in this preparation, specificity experiments were conducted. Attachment and subsequent rolling of CD44 transfectants on immobilized mammalian HA were completely abolished by digestion of the substrate with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (10 units/ml at 37 °C for 30 min) and were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by a soluble HA competitor (either mammalian HA or Healon®), but not by chondroitin sulfate. For example, at a concentration of 200 μg/ml, Healon® reduced the fraction of cells that bound to immobilized mammalian HA to 15%, whereas 99% of the cells attached to, and rolled on, the same substrate when chondroitin sulfate was present at 200 μg/ml. These results indicate that the rolling interactions are dependent on HA and not on contaminants in the immobilized substrate. The capacity of cells to bind HA is dependent on the amount of CD44 on the cell surface (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar). Because a change in the rolling properties of the cells transfected with mutant CD44 constructs could be caused by either the specific mutation or a change in cell surface CD44 density, the amount of CD44 expressed by each mutant cell line had to be “normalized” to CD44 expression in a wild type transfectant. This normalization was done for each set of experiments by pairing each mutant with a wild type counterpart that expressed a similar amount of CD44. Two strategies were employed to achieve this: 1) AKR1 cells transfected with mutant CD44 constructs were cultured on immobilized HA for several days prior to the rolling assays. Regular removal of non-adherent cells from the HA-coated dishes resulted in enrichment for a homogenous population of HA-binding cells with relatively high densities of CD44, comparable with CD44 expression in CD44WT transfectants. 2) Using the limiting dilution method, several subclones of AKR1/CD44WT cells were generated, each with a different amount of CD44 on the cell surface (see Fig. 2). Subclones with lower amounts of CD44WT served as “controls” for mutant lines in which high CD44 expression could not be achieved. For flow chamber experiments, transfectants were characterized for CD44 expression, and the results of rolling assays for each mutant line were compared with those of an AKR1/CD44WT clone with similar CD44 expression. All experiments were repeated at least three times under similar conditions. Although differences between mutant and wild type lines were consistently observed, the measured values showed a relatively large variation from experiment to experiment that could be ascribed to fluctuations in CD44 expression of wild type and mutant transfectants. Some measurements also had a statistically non-normal (left-skewed) distribution. Therefore, several statistical tests, including the paired Student's t test, repeated measures analysis of variance and the non-parametric Friedman test (SPSS, Chicago, IL), were employed to determine significant differences between mutant and wild type cells in their rolling parameters. Fig. 1 shows the schematic structure of WT CD44 (standard isoform) and seven CD44 mutants. “ERM” below the first boxed area in the cytoplasmic (CY) domain of the WT schematic in Fig. 1indicates the location of sequences (Arg292-Lys300) required for binding ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins (23Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Google Scholar, 24Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 705-708Google Scholar), and “Ank”below the second box indicates the location of sequences (Asn304-Leu318) reported to mediate ankyrin binding (25Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Google Scholar). P after Ank indicates the location of Ser325, which is constitutively phosphorylated and whose phosphorylation is required for CD44-mediated cell migration on HA (27Peck D. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1595-1601Google Scholar). The numbering of amino acids is according to that of a previous study (38Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 56: 1057-1062Google Scholar). Several deletion and substitution mutants (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar, 36Lesley J. English N. Charles C. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 245-253Google Scholar) were used to examine the importance of specific regions of the CD44 cytoplasmic domain in mediating cell rolling on HA. CD44G305 contains a cytoplasmic domain truncated at Gly305 and lacks the putative ankyrin binding motif (25Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Google Scholar). The CD44ΔCY (“tailless”) mutant lacks all amino acid residues distal to Cys295, resulting in loss of the ankyrin binding sequence together with one of the two clusters of positively charged amino acids reported to be necessary for ezrin (ERM) binding (24Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 705-708Google Scholar). In CD44Δ292–301, the entire ezrin binding site (24Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 705-708Google Scholar) has been deleted. CD44SG5N has 5 Ser-Gly repeats inserted between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, followed by the 6 membrane-proximal residues of the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 290–295). In CD44β5TM+CY the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of CD44 have been replaced by homologous domains of the human β5 integrin. In summary, the ERM binding region is absent or disrupted in all of the cytoplasmic domain mutants except CD44G305, the putative ankyrin binding region is absent in all of these transfectants except CD44Δ292–301, and all cytoplasmic tail mutants, except CD44Δ292–301, lack Ser325. Two mutants were used to examine the importance of features of the CD44 extracellular domain. CD44mArg41 has the Arg41 residue, which is located in the ligand binding domain and is critical for HA binding (40Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Google Scholar, 41Bajorath J. Greenfield B. Munro S.B. Day A.J. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 338-343Google Scholar), mutated to Ala. In CD44Δ161–244, 83 amino acids of the non-conserved membrane-proximal region of the CD44 ectodomain have been deleted (35He Q. Lesley J. Hyman R. Ishihara K. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1711-1719Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” for each series of rolling assays, AKR1/CD44WT cells were subcloned, and a WT clone was chosen as a control for each mutant line on the basis of similar amounts of CD44 expression. Binding of FL-HA was determined by flow cytometry, and the transfectants expressing mutant CD44 were compared with WT controls matched for CD44 expression (data not shown). With the exception of AKR1/CD44ΔCY, all of the cell lines expressing CD44 with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain bound FL-HA similarly to WT controls, consistent with previous reports (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar, 36Lesley J. English N. Charles C. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 245-253Google Scholar). As reported previously (29Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Google Scholar), the line expressing ΔCY (tailless) CD44, despite fairly high CD44 density on the cell surface, bound FL-HA very poorly (data not shown). Cells expressing CD44Δ161–244 with a deletion in the ectodomain bound FL-HA similarly to CD44WT controls, as reported before (35He Q. Lesley J. Hyman R. Ishihara K. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1711-1719Google Scholar). The mArg41 mutant did not bind HA at all, a finding that is also consistent with previous reports (40Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Google Scholar, 41Bajorath J. Greenfield B. Munro S.B. Day A.J. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 338-343Google Scholar). Although binding of FL-HA to the tailless transfectant increased dramatically in the presence of “inducing” mAb IRAWB14 (29Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Google Scholar, 42Lesley J. Kincade P.W. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1902-1909Google Scholar), no ligand binding to the mArg41 mutant could be induced by IRAWB14 treatment (results not shown). The cellular avidity of AKR1/CD44WT transfectants for soluble HA increases with increasing expression of the receptor on the cell surface (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar). To determine whether CD44 density also affects rolling behavior, we examined the rolling of CD44 WT transfectants expressing different amounts of CD44. Fig. 2 A shows CD44 expression and FL-HA binding (mean fluorescence intensity at saturating concentrations of mAb and FL-HA, respectively) for five AKR1/CD44WT subclones with different levels of CD44 expression. As shown previously (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar), the greater the amount of CD44 on the surface, the greater is the capacity of the cells to bind FL-HA. When these clones were exposed to increasing fluid shear forces, the fraction of AKR1/CD44WT cells that remained adherent to HA (Fig. 2 B) was roughly proportional to the amount of CD44 on the cell surface. At any given shear force, fewer cells with high than low CD44 density detached from the substrate. The percentage of adherent cells that rolled on HA (Fig.2 C) and the rolling velocity (Fig. 2 D) were inversely related to the level of receptor expression. Cells expressing the greatest amounts of CD44 only began to roll on HA at higher shear forces (at or above 1 dyn/cm2) and exhibited lower rolling velocities. Cells expressing the CD44G305 truncation mutant rolled in a manner similar to CD44WT transfectants at all shear forces tested (0.25–8 dyn/cm2) (Fig. 3 A). Two transfectants expressing CD44 with a cytoplasmic tail truncated more distally (Thr345 and Ser323 (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar)) also displayed rolling kinetics similar to cells expressing WT CD44 (results not shown). Although AKR1/CD44ΔCY cells bound soluble FL-HA very poorly (Refs.29Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Google Scholar, 34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Google Scholar, and 36Lesley J. English N. Charles C. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 245-253Google Scholar and data not shown), cells with WT and tailless CD44 rolled with similar kinetics on immobilized HA (Fig. 3 B), except for one consistent difference. At low shear forces, the fraction of AKR1/CD44ΔCY cells that rolled was greater than the fraction of AKR1/CD44WT cells that rolled (Fig. 3 B, middle panel), however, the rolling velocity of the mutant at any given shear force was not appreciably greater (Fig. 3 B,bottom panel). For both the AKR1/CD44Δ292–301 mutant with an internal (“loop-out”) deletion that encompasses the entire sequence of the ezrin binding motif, and the AKR1/CD44SG5N mutant, the interaction between CD44 and ezrin should be impaired (24Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 705-708Google Scholar). CD44SG5N lacks, in addition, the putative ankyrin-binding motif (25Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Google Scholar). The CD44β5TM+CY chimera, with all of the CD44 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain sequences replaced by the corresponding sequences of human β5 integrin, should not be able to interact with intracellular linker, adaptor, or signaling molecules in a CD44-specific manner. This chimera lacks all CD44-specific phosphorylation sites (26Legg J.W. Lewis C.A. Parsons M. Ng T. Isacke C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 399-407Google Scholar) as well as Cys286, which has been reported to have the potential to “bypass” a requirement for the CD44 cytoplasmic domain in binding HA by mediating CD44 dimerization via the transmembrane region (43Liu D. Sy M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1987-1994Google Scholar, 44Liu D.C. Sy M.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2702-2711Google Scholar). When matched with AKR1/CD44WT cells showing the same level of receptor expression, however, transfectants for all three of these mutants showed rolling behavior that was indistinguishable from that of the CD44WT transfectants (Fig."

Using real time interaction analysis with BIAcore, we evaluated the affinities and kinetics of the interactions of full-length members of the SRC/p160 coactivator family with estrogen receptor α (ERα) and ERβ bound to a variety of ligands. We substantiate that 17β-estradiol enhances the affinity of ER-SRC/p160 interactions, whereas 4(OH)-tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780 inhibit these interactions.

Moreover, our data indicate that the interaction affinities of the full-length SRC/p160s with ERs are significantly higher then those of the NR interaction domains of the same coactivators, indicating that portions of coactivator molecules distinct from NR interaction domains might participate in receptor-coactivator complex formation. Finally, the interaction kinetics of SRC/p160s with ERs are consistent with a bipartite model, involving initial rapid formation of an unstable intermediate complex, and a subsequent slower reaction leading to its stabilization. We interpret our results as evidence that hierarchical coactivator interaction affinities are an important source of diversity in NR-mediated signaling and that the complexity of receptor-coactivator cross-talk might be best understood in the context of full-length molecules.

Whereas coactivators often exhibit similar properties in in vitro assays, increasing evidence suggests that they are differentially utilized in vivo in cell type- and promoter-selective fashions. Moreover, their ubiquitous expression suggests that a spectrum of distinct potential interacting partners exists for a given receptor in a specific cell type. The formation of NR-coactivator complexes is principally a function of (i) the intracellular concentrations of the NR and coactivators and (ii) the inherent affinities of specific NR-coactivator interactions. The development of models within which the discrimination by NRs between this array of coregulators can be understood therefore requires the measurement not only of their expression levels in various tissues but also of the affinity of individual receptor-coactivator interactions. An area of increasing interest is the molecular basis of the complex tissue-specific pharmacology of natural NR ligands and their synthetic derivatives, the selective receptor modulators. Several studies support the notion that this tissue specificity may be attributed in part to selective coactivator recruitment. In the case of the ER, selective ER modulators induce distinct conformational changes (13Kraichely D.M. Sun J. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S.

Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by ERα and ERβ. Moreover, we have described a synthetic ligand (WAY164397) that binds to both ER isoforms but selectively enhances the interaction of ERβ with SRC-1 and SRC-3 while exhibiting little effect on ERα interaction with these proteins (15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the same study, genistein was shown to enhance the interaction of ER (α/β) with SRC-1 and SRC-3 but demonstrated a minimal effect on ER (α/β) interaction with vitamin D receptor-interacting protein 205 and CREB-binding protein (15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Strategies for characterizing receptor-coactivator interactions have relied in large part upon oligopeptide fragments corresponding to minimal coactivator NR interaction domains (16Norris J.D. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Chang C.Y. Huacani M.R. Fan D. Hamilton P.T. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Science. 1999; 285: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 17Giangrande P.H. Kimbrel E.A. Edwards D.P. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3102-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that NRs interact with isolated NR boxes with low (micromolar) affinity and that mutation of individual SRC/p160 NR boxes does not abrogate ligand-dependent ER-SRC/p160 interactions (15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These data suggest that distinct NR interaction domains can substitute for each other and that regions remote from these motifs also contribute energetically to supplement complex formation (9Darimont B.D.

Moreover, they indicate that analysis of the interactions of full-length molecules might place measurements of receptor-coactivator affinities in a more informative context. Mindful of these caveats, we have designed an assay system in which the interaction affinity and kinetics of full-length NRs and coactivators can be evaluated. Intact SRC-1, TIF2/SRC-2, and RAC3/SRC-3 were immobilized on the surface of a BIAcore sensor chip. Coactivator interactions with purified ERα and ERβ were studied over a range of ER concentrations in the absence and presence of the ER ligands 17β-estradiol, 4(OH)-tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780 using real time interaction analysis. Our data indicate that SRC/p160 proteins interact with liganded ERs with affinities higher than those of individual NR interaction domains. They show that ERα and ERβ have robust 17β-estradiol-induced affinity preferences for particular SRC/p160s and that formation of the ER-SRC/p160 complex involves a transitional intermediate. The BIAcore 2000 system, sensor chips CM 5 (certified), Tween 20, and amine coupling kit were obtained from BIAcore Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Purified recombinant human ERα and ERβ were obtained from PanVera Corp. (Madison, WI). 17β-Estradiol and 4(OH)-tamoxifen and FLAG reagents were obtained from Sigma. Raloxifene and ICI-182,780 were synthesized at Wyeth (Radnor, PA). The construction of the SRC-1 (20Liu Z. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), TIF2/SRC-2, and RAC3/SRC-3 (21Li J. O'Malley B.W. Wong J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) Xenopus expression vectors has been described previously. N-terminal FLAG fusions of SRC-1, TIF2/SRC-2, and RAC3/SRC-3 were expressed inXenopus oocytes by injection of in vitrosynthesized mRNA encoding FLAG-tagged SRC/p160s into 1000 stage VIXenopus oocytes (50 ng of mRNA/oocyte). Oocytes were lysed as previously described (20Liu Z. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The buffer used for all experiments was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol. FLAG protein immobilization on the BIAcore sensor chip surface was carried out as described previously (15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Suen C.S. Berrodin T.J. Mastroeni R. Cheskis B.J. Lyttle C.R. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27645-27653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Binding was measured in arbitrary response units (RU). A signal of 1000 RU corresponds to a surface concentration change of ∼1 ng/mm2 (15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG antibody was immobilized using an amine coupling kit, typically resulting in the binding of 8000–10,000 RU of antibody. CrudeXenopus lysates containing FLAG-tagged coactivators were then injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min over a surface coated with immobilized anti-FLAG antibody. Unprogrammed oocyte lysate was used in each run to establish background binding to the FLAG antibody-coated sensor chip and generate a baseline for each individual assay. To determine whether mass transport limitations might affect receptor-coactivator interactions, binding experiments were performed at the following rates: 5, 10, 30, and 50 μl/min. At flow rates of 10 μl/min and above, the values of kon and koff determined by analysis of interaction data using BIAevaluation software were independent of flow rates. All subsequent experiments except coactivator immobilization were performed with a constant buffer flow of 30 μl/min at 25 °C. Samples of receptor were injected across the surface using a sample loop. After the injection plug had passed the surface, complexes were washed with buffer for an additional 1000 s. Following each injection, the surface was regenerated with one 30-μl injection of 0.05% SDS. To remove immobilized FLAG coactivator, a 30-μl injection of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.0, was used. Data were collected at 1 Hz and analyzed using the BIAevaluation program 3.1 (BIAcore, Inc.) on a PC. This program uses a global fitting analysis method for the determination of rate and affinity constants for each interaction. Kinetic rate errors were determined during data analysis in which immobilized coactivator was subjected to multiple interaction cycles with ERα or -β at different receptor concentrations. Five or six binding cycles at different receptor concentrations were used to obtain the affinity and kinetic rates. Each titration experiment was repeated two or three times for each receptor-coactivator combination. Independent experiments were separately analyzed. The differences in affinity and kinetic rates did not exceed 10%. Refractive index differences for the ERs at different protein concentrations were adjusted using Sigma Plot 5.0 software. Western blotting analysis of theXenopus oocyte extracts expressing SRC-1, TIF2/SRC-2, and RAC3/SRC-3 is presented in Fig.1A. We have recently shown that FLAG-tagged SRC-1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes enhanced progesterone receptor transactivation in an in vitrotranscription assay (20Liu Z. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), indicating that SRC/p160s expressed in this system retain functionality. To evaluate the affinity and kinetics of the interactions between the full-length SRC/p160 family members and ERα and ERβ, we utilized real time interaction analysis with BIAcore. In this technology, one of the interacting molecules is immobilized onto a solid phase, the chip surface, while the interacting partner is injected into the flow cell. When a soluble macromolecule binds to the immobilized species, it leads to an increase in the macromolecule concentration at the sensor surface, generating a change in the refractive index, which is measured by BIAcore. Binding, measured in RU, is recorded in real time, and obtained data can be used to evaluate the kinetics and affinity of macromolecule interaction. Crude extracts prepared from SRC/p160 mRNA- programmedXenopus oocytes were directly injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min over flow cells coated with immobilized anti-FLAG antibody. The binding of SRC-1 (flow cell 1; Fig. 1B), TIF2/SRC-2 (flow cell 2; Fig. 1C), and RAC3/SRC-3 (flow cell 3; Fig.1D) to immobilized anti-FLAG antibody in a typical experiment is shown in Fig. 1. Each extract injection was followed by several washes with 10 μl of 0.05% SDS to strip SRC/p160s of any interacting proteins and to remove other proteins that bind nonspecifically to the surface. After washing, 1126 RU of SRC-1 was immobilized in flow cell 1 (Fig. 1B), 830 RU of TIF2/SRC-2 was immobilized in the flow cell 2 (Fig. 1C), and 971 RU of RAC3/SRC-3 was immobilized in flow cell 3 (Fig. 1D). Flow cell 4 was exposed to unprogrammed Xenopus oocyte extract and used as a control (data not shown). Binding of ERα and ERβ to anti-FLAG chips primed with unprogrammed Xenopus extract was consistently undetectable (data not shown). The ability of NR agonists to promote the interaction of NRs with coactivators and the ability of antagonists to block this interaction have been firmly established by previous studies. X-ray crystallographic analysis of ERα (23Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar), in addition to receptors for thyroid hormone (9Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R.

Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (25Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar), have shown this phenomenon to involve agonist- or antagonist-induced realignments of helix 12, respectively potentiating or attenuating AF-2-mediated functions. Accordingly, we first wished to confirm that immobilized SRC/p160s interacted in a ligand-dependent fashion with ERα and ERβ under the conditions of our assay. Fig.2 shows overlaid sensograms of injection of ERα (120 nm) (Fig. 2A) and ERβ (240 nm) (Fig. 2B) in the absence of ligand or the presence of 17β-estradiol, 4(OH)-tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780 over immobilized SRC-1. In their unliganded forms, both receptors interacted with SRC/p160 coactivators. As anticipated, the presence of 17β-estradiol significantly enhanced the binding of both ERs to SRC-1. Similar results were obtained with respect to the interaction of ERα and ERβ with TIF2/SRC-2 and RAC3/SRC-3. Surprisingly, whereas the abrogation of the interaction of ERβ with SRC/p160s in the presence of ICI-182,780, raloxifene, and tamoxifen was essentially complete (Fig. 2B), residual ERα binding in the presence of 4(OH)-tamoxifen (Fig. 2A) was consistently observed. We have previously described the effects of these ligands on ERα and ERβ binding to the NR interaction domain fragments of SRC/p160s (13Kraichely D.M. Sun J. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, ICI-182,780, raloxifene, and 4(OH)-tamoxifen also reduced binding of both receptors to the coactivator fragments but, as with the full-length SRC/p160s, did not completely abolish this binding. We next titrated immobilized SRC/p160s with ERα and ERβ in the presence of 17β-estradiol (1 μm) at receptor concentrations ranging from 1.12 to 360.5 nm for ERα (Fig. 3A) and from 3.12 to 420.0 nm for ERβ (Fig. 3B). Saturable interaction was detected for all three SRC/p160 family members, indicating specific binding of ERs to the coactivators. Saturation was also reached for the ERβ-SRC1 interaction. We then evaluated several possible interaction models for the ER-SRC/p160 binding. Fig. 4 shows the theoretical progress of receptor-coactivator binding following a Langmuir interaction model (Fig. 4A) and a two-state interaction model (Fig. 4A) upon which have been overlaid the experimental data obtained for ERα injection over SRC-1. As can be seen, the obtained data do not fit adequately into a simple Langmuir interaction model (A + B ↔ AB; Fig. 4A) but fit well into a model that describes a two-state reaction (A + B ↔AB* ↔ AB; Fig.4B). Kinetic analysis indicates that rapid initial ER binding (kon1 = 2–7 e5,m−1 s−1) leads to formation of an unstable transitional intermediate ER-SRC/p160 complex (koff1 = 0.03–0.05 s−1), which then assumes a more stable conformation (koff2 = 2–5 e−4s−1) at a significantly slower rate (0.02– 0.05 s−1). Similar kinetics, consistent with a bipartite reaction model, were observed for all other ER-SRC/p160 combinations (data not shown). Based on the two-step interaction model, affinity constants (Ka) were calculated for interactions between all ER-SRC/p160 combinations. Distinct affinities of ERα and ERβ for individual SRC/p160s were observed, indicating an interaction hierarchy for ERα of RAC3/SRC-3 > SRC-1 > TIF2/SRC-2 and for ERβ of SRC-1 > TIF2/SRC-2 > RAC3/SRC-3. This order of preference recapitulates that determined previously for the interactions between ERs and the NR interaction domain peptides of SRC/p160 family members (15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Significantly, however, full-length SRC/p160 family members exhibit affinities 3–5-fold in excess of those determined for the NR interaction domains of the corresponding SRC/p160s (see TableI).Table IAffinity constants (Ka) of ER interactions with full-length molecules (left column) and individual NR interaction domains (NRID, right column) for each SRC/p160 family memberSRC-1TIF2/SRC-2RAC3/SRC-3NRIDFull-lengthNRIDFull-lengthNRIDFull-lengthERα7.81 ± 0.31 × 1073.49 ± 0.24 × 1086.41 ± 0.21 × 1071.45 ± 0.09 × 1082.20 ± 0.21 × 1086.05 ± 0.78 × 108ERβ3.59 ± 0.24 × 1073.64 ± 0.24 × 1083.08 ± 0.45 × 1072.31 ± 0.10 × 1082.25 ± 0.25 × 1079.76 ± 1.76 × 107Ka values for ER interactions with SRC-1613–773, TIF2/SRC-2618–766, and SRC-3601–762 were determined using the two-state interaction model as described in Ref. 15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar. Open table in a new tab Ka values for ER interactions with SRC-1613–773, TIF2/SRC-2618–766, and SRC-3601–762 were determined using the two-state interaction model as described in Ref. 15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar. Current models of receptor-coactivator interactions have been based in large part upon interpretations of observations of molecular fragments made in a wide range of assays and experimental conditions. Whereas such studies have gone a long way toward shaping our understanding of mechanistic aspects of coactivator function, they are of more limited use in designing integrated models of the biology of these factors. For this reason, we sought to develop an approach in which kinetic and affinity measurements of NR-coactivator interactions could be made in the context of full-length molecules in a routine, controlled assay. In this study, we evaluated the affinities and kinetics of the interaction of full-length SRC/p160 family members with ERα and ERβ. Our results provide evidence that a well defined hierarchy governs interactions between ER isoforms and SRC/p160 family members, such that RAC3/SRC-3 is the partner of preference for ERα, and SRC-1 is the preferred interaction partner for ERβ. Factors such as the relative expression levels of coactivators, their subcellular localization, and their post-translational modification status probably modulate the inherent affinities of individual receptors and coactivators along a given signaling axis. These considerations notwithstanding, however, the fact that ER isoforms exhibit hierarchical affinities for potential binding partners is an intriguing facet of their pharmacology and one that will have an important bearing on the development of ER isoform-specific selective ER modulators. It remains to be seen whether such striking discrimination among coactivators is characteristic of other members of the NR superfamily and whether, on the basis of these data, accurate predictions can be made concerning the interactions of these molecules in cells. The affinities of full-length SRC/p160 interactions with ERs are appreciably higher in our assay than those of the NR interaction domains of the same coactivators (15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). At present, the exact reason for the observed difference is unclear, but it probably involves additional contacts made in the context of the complex between full-length coactivator and receptor. It has been consistently demonstrated that molecular determinants distinct from the LXXLL motifs are important influences on the affinity of NR-coactivator interactions (9Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar,18Hong H. Darimont B.D. Ma H. Yang L.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, the involvement of discrete domains in the C terminus of NRs in recruitment of coactivators has been noted in a number of crystallographic studies (25Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Taken together with these studies, our results reiterate that models based upon observations of individual NR box-containing peptides, by failing to account for steric aspects of interactions between full-length molecules, afford a less than complete perspective on fundamental aspects of coactivator biology. This assertion is borne out by our studies of the effect of the ligand on the interaction of ERs with full-length SRC/p160s. In our previous study using coactivator NR interaction domains, 17β-estradiol enhanced the affinity of receptor-NR box interaction, whereas 4(OH)-tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780 inhibited the interaction (15Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the current study showed that this inhibition was much more complete in the context of the full-length coactivators compared with the NR interaction domains. Moreover, 4(OH)-tamoxifen, when bound to ERα, was a less competent inhibitor of ER-SRC/p160 interactions compared with raloxifene and ICI-182,780. Our data indicate that interactions between full-length ERs and intact SRC/p160s are bipartite, involving an initial, rapid association of a transitional intermediate and a slower terminal phase. The bipartite interaction can be interpreted in at least two ways. First, it may reflect the dynamics sketched by Nolte and co-workers (25Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar), who postulated an initial docking between a glutamate/lysine NR charge clamp and ionic residues N- and C-terminal of the SRC-1/NCoA-1 NR box. This may be followed by an induced fit interaction between the leucine side chains of the NR box and the hydrophobic cavity in AF-2. Conceivably, the fast-slow interaction kinetics we have observed might be generated by an initial rapid compatibility between charged residues, followed by intricate conformational changes accompanying the apposition of two extended hydrophobic surfaces. An alternative model arising from the bipartite reaction kinetics described here requires consideration of the stoichiometry of the interaction between NRs and SRC/p160s. A model proposed for the interaction of SRC-1 with a heterodimer of the receptors for all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid suggests that binding of tandem NR boxes occurs in a cooperative manner (26Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Milburn M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Specifically, binding of the second NR box to the 9-cis-retinoic acid moiety is pursuant to a conformational change arising from the interaction of all-trans-retinoic acid receptor with ligand and recruitment of the first NR box. Whether such a scenario can be accommodated in the context of the interaction of a single SRC/p160 molecule with an ERα homodimer remains to be determined, but it can be envisaged that the slower phase we observed might correspond to the sterically induced binding of a second NR box. Significantly, this model admits a role for AF-1 in participating in coactivator binding, an event suggested by previous studies of several NRs (27Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E.

Evidence accumulated from our own and other laboratories has indicated that coactivators are organized in vivo into large multiprotein complexes (4Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 6Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P.

A. 1998; 95: 11697-11702Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this respect, it could be justifiably argued that our analysis of individually purified proteins might not be directly comparable with the complexities of transcriptional complexes in living cells. Evidence suggests, however, that contacts between NRs and other transcription factors in these complexes are discrete, typically occurring through only one or two adaptor subunits (30Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 31Rachez C. Gamble M. Chang C.P. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Freedman L.P.

Given that quantitative analysis of the dynamics of such complexes is technically challenging, we reasoned that a logical first step would be to evaluate the interactions between key components of these complexes and proceed to interpret this information in the context of the larger complex. Several studies have demonstrated the capacity of post-translational modifications of NRs and/or their coactivators to influence cyclicity of molecular interactions at transcriptionally active promoters (32Chen H.

For example, the acetylation of an activator of thyroid receptor/SRC-3 by p300/CREB-binding protein neutralizes the positive charges of two lysine residues adjacent to the core LXXLL motif and disrupts the association of activator of thyroid receptor/SRC-3 with promoter- bound ERs. In addition, coactivators have been shown to be substrates for several kinases (34Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 35Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and the notion is emerging that phosphorylation might influence coactivator affinities for NRs and other coregulators. We anticipate that future studies will determine whether the significance with which post-translation modifications have been invested is sustainable in the context of full-length receptor-coactivator interactions on DNA. In conclusion, we suggest that the discriminatory relationships we have identified may contribute to the combinatorial diversity by which NR-mediated signaling pathways are so clearly characterized."

M., and Crawford, N. (1988) Biochem. J. 250, 355–361). More recently, we have demonstrated that this antibody is specific for human SERCA3 (Poch, E., Leach, S., Snape, S., Cacic, T., MacLennan, D. H., and Lytton, J. (1998) Am. J. Physiol. 275, C1449–C1458). In this paper, we have extended the analysis of the PL/IM430-SERCA3 interaction. Using HEK293 cells to express human SERCA3a, we were able to measure both ATP-mediated, oxalate-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis activities due exclusively to SERCA3. Treatment with PL/IM430 inhibited both activities almost identically, with a maximal inhibition of 81 and 737 and a half-maximal concentration of 8.3 and 5.9 ॖg/ml, for Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis, respectively. We conclude that PL/IM430 does inhibit SERCA3 activity but does not uncouple Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis. Using a combination of partial proteolysis, GST fusion protein expression, and mutation of residues that differ between rat and human SERCA3, we have identified human SERCA3 amino acids Pro8 and Glu192 as essential to forming the PL/IM430 epitope. PL/IM430 thus recognizes a linearly noncontiguous set of amino acids within the actuator domain of human SERCA3. We propose that PL/IM430 inhibits SERCA3 activity by sterically preventing movement of the actuator domain into a catalytically critical position in the E2 conformation of the enzyme.

Ca2+ signaling involves complex spatial and temporal changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] that depend upon an increase mediated by release from intracellular storage sites in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) or by entry across the plasma membrane, and the subsequent decrease as Ca2+ is removed from the cytosol (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Google Scholar). The sarco/endoplasmic calcium ATPase pumps (SERCA) play a pivotal role in the maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by lowering the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and replenishing the ER/SR stores following release (2East J.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 189-200Google Scholar). Calcium pumps of the SERCA family are encoded by three distinct, but homologous, genes whose primary transcripts are alternatively spliced, yielding isoforms that differ at their C termini and are expressed in a tissue-dependent and developmentally regulated manner. The SERCA1 gene is expressed exclusively in fast twitch skeletal muscle, and alternative splicing yields two isoforms, SERCA1a (994 amino acids) and SERCA1b (1001 amino acids), present in adult and neonatal tissues, respectively (3Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3768-3774Google Scholar). The SERCA2 gene yields primary transcripts that are processed in a tissue-specific manner, giving rise to two isoenzymes, SERCA2a (997 amino acids), which is expressed in cardiac/slow twitch skeletal muscle, and SERCA2b (1046 amino acids), which is expressed ubiquitously (4Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Google Scholar, 5Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Greeb J. Shul G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15032-15040Google Scholar). SERCA3, the isoform of interest for this study, displays a selective tissue distribution. Alternative splicing of the SERCA3 gene results in five different isoforms, SERCA3a–SERCA3e, that are expressed abundantly in only a select number of adult tissue and cell types. SERCA3 is not expressed alone but is always accompanied by the expression of the ubiquitous SERCA2b. The highest level of SERCA3 expression is observed in cells of hematopoietic lineage (platelets and lymphoid cells), embryologically related endothelial cells, secretory epithelial cells (of the large and small intestine and the thymus), and Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum (6Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Google Scholar, 7Wu K.-D. Lee W.-S. Wey J. Bungard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Google Scholar, 8Anger M.

In addition, the expression of SERCA3 mRNA during ontogeny in the rat indicates a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated pattern in the cardiovascular system (11Anger M. Samuel J.L. Marotte F. Wuytack F. Rappaport L. Lompre A.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 539-550Google Scholar). Studies on SERCA3-deficient mice have indicated that lack of SERCA3 alters endothelium and epithelium-dependent relaxation in vascular smooth muscle (12Liu L.H. Paul R.J. Sutliff R.L. Miller M.L. Lorenz J.N. Pun R.Y. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kimura Y. MacLennan D.H. Hoying J.B. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30538-30545Google Scholar, 13Kao J. Fortner C.N. Liu L.H. Shull G.E. Paul R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L264-L270Google Scholar). Down-regulation of SERCA expression is suggested to be responsible for the impaired glucose responses in the islets of Langerhans in diabetic mouse and rat models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disease associated with abnormal insulin secretion (14Roe M.W., L.H., P. Frangakis C.J. Kuznetsov A. Mertz R.J. Lancaster M.E. Spencer B. Worley J.F. Dukes I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18279-18282Google Scholar). In humans, missense mutations in the SERCA3 gene are thought to render patients more susceptible to type II diabetes mellitus (15Varadi A. Lebel L. Hashim Y. Mehta Z. Ashcroft S.J. Turner R. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1240-1243Google Scholar). Antibodies developed against intracellular platelet membranes have been used widely as a tool to study the multi-SERCA system in platelets. One such antibody is PL/IM430 (plateletintracellular membrane 430), which recognizes all alternatively spliced SERCA3 isoforms (9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar). This antibody was reported to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into, but not ATP hydrolysis by, highly purified platelet intracellular membranes, suggesting that PL/IM430 was able to uncouple Ca2+transport from ATP hydrolysis in the SERCA3 protein (16Hack N. Wilkinson J.M. Crawford N. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 355-361Google Scholar). This observation, if confirmed, would be of fundamental importance for the further understanding of structure-function relationships involved in conformational coupling accompanying active ion transport. Identification of the PL/IM430 epitope is an essential key step toward this goal. In this paper, we have utilized recombinant human SERCA3 expressed in a heterologous mammalian system to extend the studies of the effect of PL/IM430 on human SERCA3 activity. We confirmed the previous observation that PL/IM430 inhibits human SERCA3 Ca2+ uptake activity but did not observe an uncoupling effect. Furthermore, we have identified the epitope for this inhibitory antibody. These data have important implications in understanding the conformational changes accompanying active Ca2+ transport mediated by the SERCA pumps. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins encoding different segments of the human SERCA3 protein were constructed in the vector, pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences), using PCR and/or restriction endonuclease digestion. The following four constructs were made by PCR amplification of human SERCA3 cDNA from a full-length SERCA3 template (clone hS3II (9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar), which corresponds to the alternatively spliced human SERCA3 (geneATP2A3) transcript, SERCA3a (17Dode L. De Greef C. Mountian I. Attard M. Town M.M. Casteels R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13982-13994Google Scholar)): amino-terminal domain (amino acids 11–369 and 1–364); nucleotide/phosphorylation domain (amino acids 369–626); carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 627–998); and actuator domain (amino acids 141–238). In addition, the rat SERCA3 cDNA (6Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Google Scholar) was used as the template for GST fusion constructs encoding amino acids 1–364 of rat SERCA3. PCR was conducted under the following stringent conditions in order to accommodate the GC-rich nature of the templates: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by a final cycle of extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI (sites incorporated into 5′-end and 3′-end primers, respectively), ligated between theBamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T1 vector, and transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The following GST fusion constructs were made by deleting segments from the 3′-end of the 1–364 human SERCA3 GST-construct using convenient restriction sites located within its sequence combined withXhoI digestion at the 3′-end and Klenow treatment before blunt-ended ligation. The restriction enzymes AccI,Kpn2I, SmaI, and SacI were used to create constructs encoding amino acids 1–293, 1–236, 1–143, and 1–39, respectively. A chimeric fusion construct, 1–39/144–236, was made by digesting the 1–236 construct with SacI andSmaI to remove the segment corresponding to amino acids 40–143, treating with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and blunt end-ligating the construct to generate the in-frame fusion that has an extra Gly residue at the junction site. The PCR overlap extension technique was used to create GST fusion constructs encoding amino acids 1–364 of human SERCA3 mutated at selected sites. The hS3II cDNA clone was used as the template, and the same primers used for the fusion construct encoding amino acids 1–364 were employed as outside primers. Two complementary internal primers containing mutations to introduce the desired amino acid change were then used in combination with the outside primers in a two-step protocol. All of the PCRs were set up as described above. The following nucleotides were mutated to create human SERCA3 constructs encoding the amino acid changes P8S (CCG → TCG), E192D (GAG → GAT), and the double change P8S/E192D. The converse mutations to those described above were introduced into the rat SERCA3 1–364 construct to create changes S8P, D192E, and the double change S8P/D192E. PCR products corresponding to the mutated constructs were cloned into pGEX-4T1. All of the above constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, performed using fluorescent dye terminators, and analyzed at the University of Calgary Core DNA Services Facility. For all GST fusion constructs, protein induction was carried out as described in the GST handbook from Amersham Biosciences. Briefly,E. coli were grown overnight in 2× YT medium containing 100 ॖg/ml ampicillin in a 37 °C shaker. Cultures were diluted 1:25 into 2× YT, and protein induction was carried out by the addition of 3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside when the cells reached an absorbance of 0.6–0.8 measured at 600 nm. Two hours following induction, whole cell lysates were prepared by sonication in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2). Aliquots of these lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using PL/IM430 and anti-GST antibodies. Constructs encoding full-length wild-type and mutated human and rat SERCA3a constructs were made in the mammalian expression vectors pMT2 (18Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Google Scholar) and pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen), respectively. Mutated human SERCA3a constructs were prepared by isolating the segments from their respective amino acid 1–364 GST fusion constructs using EcoRI andKpn2I digestion. These fragments were then ligated into the full-length pMT2-human SERCA3a construct (9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar) from which the corresponding wild-type segment had been removed. The wild-type and mutated rat SERCA3a constructs were prepared by first linearizing the corresponding GST fusion construct with EcoRI and then partially digesting with BamHI to isolate the 5′ fragments that contained the mutations. The 3′ part of the rat SERCA3 cDNA was isolated from the parent construct pBR.RK8–13 (6Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Google Scholar) usingBamHI and BglII digestion. These two isolated fragments were then inserted into EcoRI- andBamHI-digested pcDNA3.1(−) to create the full-length rat SERCA3a in a three-part ligation process. All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Microsomes or postnuclear nonionic detergent lysates were prepared from HEK293 cells 2 days following transfection with Qiagen-purified plasmid cDNA encoding the various wild-type and mutated rat or human SERCA3a proteins, as described previously (9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar, 19Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4115-4162Google Scholar). Briefly, for microsomes, the cells were swollen in hypotonic medium and lysed by homogenization using a Dounce homogenizer. The resulting cellular homogenate was separated by differential centrifugation to isolate a postmitochondrial particulate fraction enriched in endoplasmic reticulum that we refer to as 舠microsomes.舡 For postnuclear lysates, cells were incubated on ice in buffer containing 17 octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E8) and then sedimented in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 15,000 ×g to remove the nuclei. Protein concentration was determined using a Coomassie dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine γ-globulin as the standard. Microsome and postnuclear fractions were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. This assay was performed as described previously with some modifications (9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar). The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined at 23 °C using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay that utilizes a regenerative system, where hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH, which is measured as a decrease in absorption at 340 nm in a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. The reaction mixture was set up by adding 2 ॖl of microsomes isolated from transfected HEK293 cells to 98 ॖl of assay solution (120 mm KCl, 25 mm MOPS, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.32 mm NADH, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 ॖm ionophore A23187). The reaction was started with the addition of 90 ॖl of the microsomes/assay solution to a cuvette containing 10 ॖl of 4.5 mm CaCl2 and 5.0 mm EGTA, yielding a final free Ca2+concentration of 3 ॖm. The absorption at 340 nm was followed for 9 min. The reaction was then paused for a minute while a 10-ॖl aliquot of PL/IM430 (obtained from Research Diagnostics, Inc.) diluted in PBS was added and mixed well in the cuvette. Absorption was followed for another 20 min following antibody addition. Control experiments were conducted using microsomes from cells transfected with a control vector in which the SERCA3 coding region had been inserted in the reverse direction and by adding either 10 ॖl of PBS or 10 ॖl of monoclonal antibody R3F1 (which recognizes the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1, and not SERCA (20Porzig H. Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C748-C756Google Scholar)) in place of PL/IM430. The slopes of the linear portion of these traces were then determined by least square fit, and the slope after the antibody addition was reported as a percentage of the slope before antibody addition. The Ca2+ uptake activity of the SERCA3 protein was measured in an ATP-mediated, oxalate-dependent assay, as described previously, with slight modifications (9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out at 23 °C in a total volume of 110 ॖl. Microsomes from transfected HEK293 cells (2 ॖl) were preincubated for 5 min with different amounts of PL/IM430 diluted in 10 ॖl of PBS. The reaction was started by adding 98 ॖl of assay buffer (120 mm KCl, 23 mm MOPS, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.45 mm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+] = 3 ॖm), 5 mm potassium oxalate, pH 7.0, and 1 ॖCi/ml 45CaCl2). Following a 10-min incubation period, an aliquot of 90 ॖl was withdrawn from the assay mix, and the reaction was terminated by dilution into a 3-ml quench buffer solution (150 mm KCl, 1 mm LaCl3) on ice. The quenched reactions were filtered through PHWP-025 filters in a Millipore filtration manifold and washed with 5 ml of quench buffer. Filters were removed from the manifold, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Control experiments were carried out as described above. The 10-min time point was chosen because it was found to be in the linear portion of the uptake time course, as established in pilot experiments. Microsomes from SERCA3-transfected HEK293 cells were partially digested using trypsin. All reactions were performed on ice. 25 ॖg of microsomes were treated with 10 ॖg/ml trypsin in 100 ॖl of 160 mm KCl, 17 mm HEPES/KOH, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2. The reaction was terminated after 1 and 2 min by the addition of 30 ॖl of 100 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in isopropyl alcohol and 30 ॖl of 5.9 mg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor. Five micrograms of digested microsomes were then resolved on a 97 SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting. These conditions were arrived at empirically to produce an informative digestion pattern. The extent of proteolysis we observed was greater than that obtained previously (21Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Collins J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 93: 85-92Google Scholar), presumably because under these conditions proteolysis can continue following denaturation of the SERCA protein prior to and during electrophoresis (22Sweadner K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 130-135Google Scholar). All steps were conducted at 4 °C. Aliquots of postnuclear lysates from transfected HEK293 cells containing 500 ॖg of protein were diluted to 1 ml with 17 C12E8, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 140 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and precleared by incubating for 30 min with 20 ॖl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) followed by sedimentation at 3000 × gfor 2 min. The supernatant was then incubated with 5 ॖg of PL/IM430 antibody for 1 h followed by the addition of 20 ॖl of Protein A-Sepharose beads and a further incubation of 30 min. The beads were then washed three times with buffer containing 0.37 C12E8 and finally suspended in Laemmli gel sample buffer before loading on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Four different SERCA3 antibodies were used for immunoblotting experiments: the PL/IM430 monoclonal antibody (16Hack N. Wilkinson J.M. Crawford N. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 355-361Google Scholar) (obtained from Research Diagnostics Inc.) and three other SERCA-specific polyclonal antibodies, C4 (4Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Google Scholar, 9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar), PA-910 (9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar) (obtained from Affinity BioReagents Inc.), and N1. The last was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a purified amino-terminal hexa-His-tagged recombinant fragment of rat SERCA2 encompassing amino acids 362–704. This antibody recognizes both SERCA2 and SERCA3 products (data not shown). The anti-GST antibody employed was raised in a rabbit injected with a GST-Na+/Ca2+ + K+ exchanger fusion protein. The serum from this rabbit recognizes selectively the GST portion of the fusion protein and does not react with SERCA proteins. All immunoblotting procedures were carried out at room temperature. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 30 min with 57 dried skim milk dissolved in PBS containing 0.17 Tween 20 (PBS-T), followed by incubation with the primary antibody in PBS-T for 1 h. The membranes were washed three times in PBS-T for 5 min each and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min followed by washing as above. The immunoblots were then developed using ECL Super Signal Plus reagent from Pierce. To confirm the previously reported effect of PL/IM430 on human SERCA3 function (16Hack N. Wilkinson J.M. Crawford N. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 355-361Google Scholar), recombinant human SERCA3 was expressed transiently in HEK293 cells using the construct huS3-II, which encodes the SERCA3a protein (9Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, microsomes from HEK cells expressing human SERCA3a exhibited an ∼80-fold higher rate of ATP-mediated, oxalate-dependent Ca2+ uptake than microsomes from the control transfected cells. There was also an ∼20-fold increase in activity for Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis in SERCA3a-transfected cells when compared with the control transfected cells. That these measurements represented SERCA activity was confirmed by the effect of the specific SERCA inhibitor, thapsigargin (23Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Google Scholar). In all subsequent experiments, the activity of the control microsomes, corresponding to less than 107 of the activity of the microsomes expressing SERCA3a, has been subtracted. Thus, the HEK293 microsome system allows the measurement of SERCA activity corresponding unambiguously to the protein encoded by the transfected cDNA. SERCA3a-expressing microsomes were then treated with increasing amounts of purified PL/IM430 monoclonal antibody and the effect on Ca2+ uptake activity was determined. Fig.2A shows that PL/IM430 inhibited Ca2+ uptake with a maximal inhibition of 817 at a half-maximal concentration of 8.3 ॖg/ml antibody. The isotype-matched anti-Na+/Ca2+-exchange antibody, R3F1 (20Porzig H. Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C748-C756Google Scholar), was used as a control to demonstrate that the addition of IgG did not have an inhibitory effect on the assay itself. The effect of PL/IM430 on SERCA3a ATP hydrolysis activity was then tested using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay. As seen in Fig. 2B, the effect of PL/IM430 on ATP hydrolysis activity was essentially indistinguishable from that on Ca2+ uptake activity with a maximal inhibition of 737 at a half-maximal concentration of 5.9 ॖg/ml antibody. Thus, in the recombinant system, where activity of SERCA3a can be isolated from other components, PL/IM430 had a comparable inhibitory effect on both Ca2+uptake and ATP hydrolysis and did not appear to uncouple the two. Since the inhibitory effect of PL/IM430 on SERCA activity had been confirmed, the next objective was to identify the epitope for this antibody. The general location of the PL/IM430 epitope was determined by proteolytic fingerprinting using trypsin digestion of microsomes isolated from HEK293 cells transfected with human SERCA3a cDNA. The digests were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with PL/IM430 and other SERCA-specific antibodies directed against different parts of the SERCA3 protein: antibody C4 (directed against the fragment encompassing amino acids 17–215) and antibody N1 (directed against the fragment encompassing amino acids 362–704). The specific patterns of fragments recognized by PL/IM430 and C4 were very similar, whereas that of N1 was quite different (Fig.3). These results suggested that the PL/IM430 epitope was located within the same region as that of the C4 epitope (i.e. the amino-terminal 215 amino acids). The PL/IM430 epitope was further localized using GST fusion proteins encoding different regions of the SERCA3a protein. Consistent with the proteolysis data, the construct encoding the amino-terminal region (amino acids 1–364) of SERCA3 was PL/IM430-reactive, whereas those constructs encoding the nucleotide/phosphorylation domain loop (amino acids 369–626) or the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region (amino acids 627–998) were not reactive, as seen in Fig. 4. Whereas the 1–364 construct was positive for PL/IM430 reactivity, the construct encoding amino acids 11–369 was not, suggesting that the amino-terminal 10 amino acids were necessary for epitope recognition. When this region was expressed by itself in the 1–39 construct, however, reactivity was not observed, although the fusion protein was clearly expressed, as seen in the anti-GST panel(α-GST) of Fig. 4. Further experiments revealed that successive C-terminal deletions of the immunopositive 1–364 construct led to the loss of PL/IM430 reactivity between constructs 1–236 and 1–143, suggesting that the region between amino acids 144 and 236 was critical for the PL/IM430 epitope (Fig. 4). However, when this region was expressed alone in the 141–238 construct, reactivity was not observed, although the protein was expressed. Since two critical regions had been identified as necessary but not sufficient for creation of the PL/IM430 epitope, a construct combining these two regions was prepared. As seen in Fig. 4, the 1–39/144–236 construct encoded a protein that could be recognized by PL/IM430, suggesting that the complete epitope for PL/IM430 is a noncontiguous combination of two regions that come together in three-dimensional space. The plausibility of this result is confirmed by examining the three-dimensional crystal structure of rabbit SERCA1 (24Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar), which illustrates that the actuator domain comprises the amino-terminal 40 amino acids and amino acids 126–230, folded together into a stable structure (Fig. 5). To localize the epitope further, we utilized an important characteristic feature of the monoclonal antibody PL/IM430, that it is highly specific to human SERCA3 and does not recognize the rat SERCA3 isoform, although these proteins are about 977 identical. Sequence comparison between the two SERCA3 orthologs in the region encompassing the PL/IM430 epitope reveals that there are seven differences in the first 40 amino acids and three more between amino acids 144 and 236. The only pair of amino acids in these two regions that lie in three-dimensional proximity, based on the SERCA1 crystal structure, are Pro8 and Glu192 of human SERCA3, as seen in Fig. 5. Thus, these residues were mutated to the corresponding amino acids of rat SERCA3 to determine whether this would destroy PL/IM430 binding. The converse experiment, the conversion of the rat residues, Ser8 and Asp192, to their human counterparts, was done with the expectation that these changes would render rat SERCA3 PL/IM430- reactive. GST fusion constructs corresponding to these mutations were prepared,"

To determine the role of the conserved glutamate residue, Glu-603, on catalysis and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, we separately changed the residue to alanine, histidine, glutamine, and aspartate. Substitution of Glu-603 with alanine or histidine resulted in complete loss of L-CPTI activity. A change of Glu-603 to glutamine caused a significant decrease in catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Substitution of Glu-603 with aspartate, a negatively charged amino acid with only one methyl group less than the glutamate residue in the wild type enzyme, resulted in partial loss in CPTI activity and a 15-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. The mutant L-CPTI with a replacement of the conserved Arg-601 or Arg-606 with alanine also showed over 40-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity, suggesting that these two conserved residues may be important for substrate and inhibitor binding. Since a conservative substitution of Glu-603 to aspartate or glutamine resulted in partial loss of activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, it further suggests that the negative charge and the longer side chain of glutamate are essential for catalysis and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. We predict that this region of L-CPTI spanning these conserved C-terminal residues may be the region of the protein involved in binding the CoA moiety of palmitoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA and/or the putative low affinity acyl-CoA/malonyl-CoA binding site.

Mammalian tissues express two isoforms of CPTI, a liver isoform (L-CPTI) and a muscle isoform (M-CPTI), that are 62% identical in amino acid sequence (3Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J.

Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Google Scholar). As an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in β-oxidation, CPTI is regulated by its physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA (1Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar), the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, suggesting coordinated control of fatty acid oxidation and synthesis. Because of its central role in fatty acid metabolism, understanding the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the CPT system is an important first step in the development of treatments for diseases, such as myocardial ischemia and diabetes, and in human inherited CPTI deficiency diseases (9Prentki M.

We developed a novel high level expression system for human heart M-CPTI, rat L-CPTI, and CPTII in the yeast Pichia pastoris, an organism devoid of endogenous CPT activity (6Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 53-61Google Scholar, 12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G.

Arvidson D.N. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 310S-314SGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, by using this system, we have shown that CPTI and CPTII are active distinct enzymes and that L-CPTI and M-CPTI are distinct malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPTs that are reversibly inactivated by detergents. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that glutamic acid 3 and histidine 5 in L-CPTI are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding but not for catalysis (15Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Google Scholar, 16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar). For M-CPTI, our mutagenesis studies demonstrate that in addition to Glu-3 and His-5, Val-19, Leu-23, and Ser-24 are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding, in agreement with the differences in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed between M-CPTI and L-CPTI (17Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Google Scholar). In addition, our site-directed mutagenesis studies of conserved residues in the C-terminal domain of L-CPTI demonstrated that conserved arginine and tryptophan residues are important for catalysis (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar). In this report, our mutagenesis studies demonstrate for the first time that the conserved residues Arg-601, Glu-603, and Arg-606 in L-CPTI are important for catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. L-CPTI mutants were constructed by the overlap extension PCR procedure using the primers shown in Table I with the wild type plasmid DNA (pGAP-L-CPTI) as template (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Google Scholar, 19Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology: Current Innovations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 69-83Google Scholar). For example, to construct the E603Q mutant, the primers f-GWW3·r-E603Q and r-MDR2·f-E603Q were used to generate 900 bp and 600 bp PCR products, respectively, using the wild type L-CPTI cDNA as a template. The two PCR products were purified, mixed, and used as a template for a second-round PCR with the primers f-GWW3·r-MDR2. The 1.5-kb PCR product was digested withAvaI–SacI, and the DNA fragment was subcloned into AvaI–SacI-cut wild type L-CPTI cDNA in the pGAP expression vector. Bacterial colonies obtained upon transformation of the mutagenesis reactions were screened by PCR using the primer pair f-GWW3-r-E603QCK for Gln and f-GWW3-r-E603HCK for His and Asp. The R601A and R606A mutants were constructed as described previously (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab E603HCK is also used to check the introduction of E603D mutation. The expression plasmids were linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme BspEI and integrated into the His4 locus of P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation (16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar). Histidine prototrophic transformants were selected on YND (yeast nitrogen base with dextrose) plates and grown on YND medium. Mitochondria were isolated by disrupting the yeast cells with glass beads (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Google Scholar) and used to monitor activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. CPT activity was assayed by the forward exchange method using l-[methyl-3H]carnitine (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Google Scholar, 20Bremer J. Woldegiorgis G. Schalinske K. Shrago E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 9-16Google Scholar). The K m value for palmitoyl-CoA was determined by varying the palmitoyl-CoA concentration from 2.8 to 225 μm at a fixed molar ratio (6.1:1) of palmitoyl-CoA to albumin as described previously (16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar). The concentration of carnitine was fixed at 200 μm. The K m for carnitine was determined by varying the carnitine concentration from 11 to 472 μm at a fixed 111 μmpalmitoyl-CoA. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were developed by incubation with the L-CPTI-specific antibodies as described previously (16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar). Sources of other materials and procedures were as described in our previous publication (16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar). Preincubation of isolated mitochondria from the yeast strain expressing rat liver L-CPTI at room temperature with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a glutamate-specific modifying reagent (21Harrison M. Powell B. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7531-7537Google Scholar), resulted in an irreversible 50% loss in catalytic activity (data not shown). These preliminary chemical modification studies with DCCD provided evidence that a conserved glutamate residue(s) is important for maximal L-CPTI activity. Sequence alignment of the sequences of all carnitine and choline acyltransferases from different species showed the presence of two conserved glutamate (E) residues (Fig.1), Glu-590 and Glu-603. The conserved Glu-603 residue is flanked by two highly conserved arginine residues, Arg-601 and Arg-606, that we previously demonstrated were important for L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar). Construction of plasmids carrying substitution mutations E590A, E603A, E603H, E603Q, and E603D was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and for R601A and R606A as described previously (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar). P. pastoris was chosen as an expression system for L-CPTI and the mutants, because it does not have endogenous CPT activity (6Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch.

The P. pastorisexpression plasmids expressed L-CPTI under control of the P. pastoris glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Google Scholar, 22Waterham H.R. Digan M.E. Koutz P.J. Lair S.V. Cregg J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 16: 37-44Google Scholar). Yeast transformants with the wild type L-CPTI gene and the mutants were grown in liquid medium supplemented with glucose (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of wild type L-CPTI (88 kDa) and the mutants using a polyclonal antibody directed against a maltose-binding protein·L-CPTI fusion protein (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Google Scholar) is shown in Fig.2. For the wild type and the mutants E603A, E603Q, E603H, and E603D, proteins of predicted sizes were synthesized with similar steady-state levels of expression. Mutants R601A and R606A were also expressed at similar steady-state levels as reported previously (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Google Scholar). Substitution mutants E603A and E603H were inactive. A change of Glu-603 to Asp resulted in only a 33% loss in L-CPTI activity, but the mutant E603D exhibited a 15-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity as shown by the IC50 values in Table II. Substitution of Glu-603 with glutamine resulted in a 92% loss in L-CPTI activity and a 14-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity (Table II). We previously reported that mutation of the highly conserved arginine residues Arg-601 and Arg-606 to alanine resulted in >98 and 93% loss in L-CPTI activity, respectively (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar). The loss in activity observed with the R601A and R606A mutants was also accompanied by decreased sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar). Furthermore, our site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that mutants R601A and R606A have an over 40-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity compared with the wild type L-CPTI enzyme (Table II). In short, our studies identify for the first time three conserved residues in the C-terminal region of L-CPTI, Arg-601, Glu-603, and Arg-606, that are important for both catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity.Table IICPT activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity in yeast strains expressing wild type and mutant L-CPTIStrainActivityIC50nmol/mg·minμmRLCPT-I WT8.7 ± 0.492E603D5.9 ± 0.5130E603Q0.7 ± 0.2027.5E603HInactiveE603AInactiveR601A0.2 ± 0.1384R606A0.9 ± 0.1982Mitochondria (150 μg of protein) from the yeast strains expressing wild type L-CPTI, arginine, and glutamate substitution mutations were assayed for CPT activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments with different mitochondrial preparations. Open table in a new tab Mitochondria (150 μg of protein) from the yeast strains expressing wild type L-CPTI, arginine, and glutamate substitution mutations were assayed for CPT activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments with different mitochondrial preparations. Mutants E603D and E603Q exhibited normal saturation kinetics when the carnitine concentration was varied relative to a constant second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 3 A), a property identical to that of the wild type L-CPTI. The kinetic characteristics of mutants R601A and R606A with respect to carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA were as reported in our previous publication (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar). For mutants E603D, E603Q, and R606A, the calculatedK m values for carnitine were similar to the wild type as shown in Table III and Ref. 18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar. However, the V max for carnitine for the E603Q mutant was 10-fold lower compared with the wild type and the E603D mutant, indicating a major effect of the mutation on catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency as estimated byV max/K m for E603Q and E603D was decreased by 92.3 and 43.1%, respectively. With respect to the second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA, mutants E603D and E603Q exhibited normal saturation kinetics similar to the wild type (Fig.3 B) when the molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA to albumin was fixed at 6.1:1. The calculated K m values for mutants E603D and E603Q were 3- and 7-fold lower, and theV max values were 62 and 93.7% lower than the wild type, respectively. For the E603Q, the catalytic efficiency was 40.7% lower than the wild type, but the E603D mutant exhibited catalytic efficiency similar to the wild type. Thus, substitution of the conserved Glu-603 residue with glutamine and the conserved Arg-601 and Arg-606 residues with alanine (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar) caused a substantial loss in catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. In contrast, a conservative substitution of Glu-603 with aspartate significantly lowered malonyl-CoA sensitivity but had a minor effect on catalytic activity.Table IIIKinetic characteristics of yeast-expressed wild type and mutant L-CPTIsStrainCarnitinePalmitoyl-CoAK mV maxK mV maxμmnmol/mg·minμmnmol/mg·minRLCPT-I WT46.019.197.562.2E603Q38.81.214.03.7E603D73.013.231.924.2Isolated mitochondria (150 μg of protein) from the yeast strains expressing the wild type and glutamate substitution mutations were assayed for CPT activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. Values are averages of two independent experiments with different mitochondrial preparations. Open table in a new tab Isolated mitochondria (150 μg of protein) from the yeast strains expressing the wild type and glutamate substitution mutations were assayed for CPT activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. Values are averages of two independent experiments with different mitochondrial preparations. Our site-directed mutagenesis studies of conserved residues in the C-terminal region of L-CPTI demonstrated that substitution of Arg-601 and Arg-606 with alanine resulted in almost complete loss in activity and a significant decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Within the C-terminal peptide sequence -RTETVR- (Fig. 1), the two arginine residues are highly conserved in the family of acyltransferases, and the other four residues are also conserved. Glu-603 is a conserved residue within the family of CPT enzymes, while other acyltransferases have aspartate at this position. A change of Glu-603 to alanine or histidine resulted in complete loss in L-CPTI activity. Substitution of the highly conserved Glu-590 with alanine did not have a major effect on catalytic activity (data not shown). The site-directed mutagenesis study described here is aimed at elucidating the function of these conserved acidic and basic residues found at the proximity of the active site of L-CPTI. To determine the role of the conserved Glu-603 on catalysis and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, we separately changed the Glu-603 residue to alanine, histidine, glutamine, and aspartate (E603A, E603H, E603Q, and E603D, respectively) and determined the effect of the mutations on L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity in the yeast-expressed mutant enzyme. A change of Glu-603 to glutamine caused a significant decrease in catalytic activity. Since a conservative substitution of Glu-603 with aspartate, a negatively charged amino acid with only one methyl group less than the glutamate residue in the wild type enzyme, resulted in partial loss in CPTI activity, the presence of this negatively charged conserved residue Glu-603, is probably crucial for maintaining the configuration of the L-CPTI active site. The mutant L-CPTI with a replacement of Glu-603 with aspartate (E603D) or glutamine (E603Q) showed a 15-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity, while a change of Arg-601 or Arg-606 to alanine resulted in an over 40-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA inhibition of the mutant L-CPTI (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar). The loss in catalytic activity observed with the mutantl-CPTI (E603Q, E603D, R601A, and R606A) was in each case associated with a decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity, suggesting that these three conserved residues may be important for substrate and inhibitor binding. The effect of the mutations on activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity suggests that this region of L-CPTI spanning the conserved C-terminal residues -RTETVR- may be important for the substrate (palmitoyl-CoA) and the inhibitor (malonyl-CoA) binding, probably through the common CoA moiety present in both compounds. Although there was a substantial decrease inV max for both substrates (carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA) with the E603D, E603Q, and R606A mutants (18Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar), all the mutants showed an increase in the affinity for palmitoyl-CoA but not carnitine, suggesting that these residues are involved in binding palmitoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA but not carnitine. This region of the protein may thus be involved in binding the CoA moiety of palmitoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA and/or a low affinity acyl-CoA binding site. As a rate-limiting enzyme that transports long chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix, L-CPTI in the presence of carnitine catalyzes the conversion of long chain acyl CoAs to acylcarnitines (1Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar). Similar to other acyltransferases, L-CPTI contains a general acid/base, His-473, a highly conserved amino acid residue that may form a hydrogen bonding network or a salt bridge to a nearby conserved glutamate residue such as Glu-603 (23Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszaki L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36718-36726Google Scholar). We hypothesize that substitution of Glu-603 with alanine or histidine may disrupt a hydrogen bonding network or a salt bridge, perhaps to the highly conserved residue His-473 that is predicted to be at the active site of L-CPTI. The significantly reduced stability of the E603Q mutant implicates Glu-603 in the maintenance of active site architecture, suggesting substitution of Glu-603 with glutamine may also disrupt a hydrogen bonding network or a salt bridge to a residue like His-473 at the active site of L-CPTI. Furthermore, the site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that even a conservative substitution of Glu-603 to aspartate or glutamine resulted in partial loss of activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, suggesting that a change of Glu-603 to aspartate may result in the carboxylate being outside the hydrogen bond distance of His-473. Glu-603 may thus be required for L-CPTI stability and positioning of the imidazole ring of His-473 for efficient catalysis and inhibition, thus facilitating productive interaction with the substrates and the inhibitor (23Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszaki L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36718-36726Google Scholar). Mutation of the corresponding conserved residue in CPTII, Glu-500, to alanine resulted in 50% loss in activity (24Zheng G. Dai J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42219-42223Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the conserved Glu-603 of L-CPTI is required for the structural stability of the enzyme. Despite its similar size and potential for hydrogen bonding formation, a glutamine residue cannot substitute for glutamate, suggesting that the negative charge of Glu-603 and/or its ability to serve as a strong hydrogen bond acceptor is needed for optimal catalysis, maintenance of active site integrity, and malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding. The reduced L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed with the E603D mutant suggest that the loss of a methyl group may result in the carboxylate being outside the hydrogen bond distance of the conserved amino acid residue His-473, the predicted general acid/base at the active site. This suggests that the negative charge and the longer side chain of glutamate are essential for catalysis and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Also, since Glu-603 is located adjacent to Arg-601 and Arg-606, the negatively charged Glu-603 may be positioned to form hydrogen bonds and/or a salt bridge with the positively charged residues Arg-601 and Arg-606 that form the predicted CoA binding pocket. Disruption of the hydrogen bonding network or salt bridge may also cause loss of catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Since only a 15–42-fold loss in malonyl-CoA sensitivity was observed in these mutants compared with the more than 100-fold loss in inhibitor sensitivity that we reported with the N-terminal residue mutations, it is predicted that this C-terminal region may constitute the low affinity malonyl-CoA binding site in L-CPTI (16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar). Characterization of the wild type and R601A, E603A, E603H, E603Q, E603D, and R606A mutant enzymes has led to the identification of conserved residues in the C-terminal region of L-CPTI that are important for catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Since a mutation of any of these three conserved C-terminal residues (Arg-601, Glu-603, and Arg-606) substantially decreased catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, it is hypothesized that these residues are the major contact sites between L-CPTI and the CoA moiety of the substrate (palmitoyl-CoA) and the inhibitor (malonyl-CoA) and constitute the putative low affinity acyl-CoA/malonyl-CoA binding site in L-CPTI."
