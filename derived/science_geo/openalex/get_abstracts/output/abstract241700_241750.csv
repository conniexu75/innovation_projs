https://openalex.org/W2168909889,"We show that the distributions of both exploited and nonexploited North Sea fishes have responded markedly to recent increases in sea temperature, with nearly two-thirds of species shifting in mean latitude or depth or both over 25 years. For species with northerly or southerly range margins in the North Sea, half have shown boundary shifts with warming, and all but one shifted northward. Species with shifting distributions have faster life cycles and smaller body sizes than nonshifting species. Further temperature rises are likely to have profound impacts on commercial fisheries through continued shifts in distribution and alterations in community interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1972309850,"The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. Here we show that the bursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform interevent statistics. These findings have important implications from resource management to service allocation in both communications and retail."
https://openalex.org/W2049740824,"A fundamental question about the pathogenesis of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes is whether there are primary autoantigens. For type 1 diabetes it is clear that multiple islet molecules are the target of autoimmunity in man and animal models. It is not clear whether any of the target molecules are essential for the destruction of islet beta cells. Here we show that the proinsulin/insulin molecules have a sequence that is a primary target of the autoimmunity that causes diabetes of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. We created insulin 1 and insulin 2 gene knockouts combined with a mutated proinsulin transgene (in which residue 16 on the B chain was changed to alanine) in NOD mice. This mutation abrogated the T-cell stimulation of a series of the major insulin autoreactive NOD T-cell clones. Female mice with only the altered insulin did not develop insulin autoantibodies, insulitis or autoimmune diabetes, in contrast with mice containing at least one copy of the native insulin gene. We suggest that proinsulin is a primary autoantigen of the NOD mouse, and speculate that organ-restricted autoimmune disorders with marked major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of disease are likely to have specific primary autoantigens."

INMS in situ mass spectrometry has also provided evidence for atmospheric waves in the upper atmosphere and the first direct measurements of isotopes of nitrogen, carbon, and argon, which reveal interesting clues about the evolution of the atmosphere. The bulk composition and thermal structure of the moon's upper atmosphere do not appear to have changed considerably since the Voyager 1 flyby."

https://openalex.org/W2000796804,"The origin of the Andaman ""Negrito"" and Nicobar ""Mongoloid"" populations has been ambiguous. Our analyses of complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Onges and Great Andaman populations revealed two deeply branching clades that share their most recent common ancestor in founder haplogroup M, with lineages spread among India, Africa, East Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. This distribution suggests that these two clades have likely survived in genetic isolation since the initial settlement of the islands during an out-of-Africa migration by anatomically modern humans. In contrast, Nicobarese sequences illustrate a close genetic relationship with populations from Southeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2124712376,"Models for chemical mechanisms of hydrocarbon oxidation rely on spectrometric identification of molecular structures in flames. Carbonyl (keto) compounds are well-established combustion intermediates. However, their less-stable enol tautomers, bearing OH groups adjacent to carbon-carbon double bonds, are not included in standard models. We observed substantial quantities of two-, three-, and four-carbon enols by photoionization mass spectrometry of flames burning representative compounds from modern fuel blends. Concentration profiles demonstrate that enol flame chemistry cannot be accounted for purely by keto-enol tautomerization. Currently accepted hydrocarbon oxidation mechanisms will likely require revision to explain the formation and reactivity of these unexpected compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2149067994,"Polyglutamylation of tubulin has been implicated in several functions of microtubules, but the identification of the responsible enzyme(s) has been challenging. We found that the neuronal tubulin polyglutamylase is a protein complex containing a tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) protein, TTLL1. TTLL1 is a member of a large family of proteins with a TTL homology domain, whose members could catalyze ligations of diverse amino acids to tubulins or other substrates. In the model protist Tetrahymena thermophila, two conserved types of polyglutamylases were characterized that differ in substrate preference and subcellular localization."

https://openalex.org/W2096121701,"The Cassini Titan Radar Mapper imaged about 1% of Titan's surface at a resolution of approximately 0.5 kilometer, and larger areas of the globe in lower resolution modes. The images reveal a complex surface, with areas of low relief and a variety of geologic features suggestive of dome-like volcanic constructs, flows, and sinuous channels. The surface appears to be young, with few impact craters. Scattering and dielectric properties are consistent with porous ice or organics. Dark patches in the radar images show high brightness temperatures and high emissivity and are consistent with frozen hydrocarbons."

https://openalex.org/W2169941033,"The magnetic field signature obtained by Cassini during its first close encounter with Titan on 26 October 2004 is presented and explained in terms of an advanced model. Titan was inside the saturnian magnetosphere. A magnetic field minimum before closest approach marked Cassini's entry into the magnetic ionopause layer. Cassini then left the northern and entered the southern magnetic tail lobe. The magnetic field before and after the encounter was approximately constant for ∼20 Titan radii, but the field orientation changed exactly at the location of Titan's orbit. No evidence of an internal magnetic field at Titan was detected."
https://openalex.org/W2003392069,"The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS) observed the extinction of photons from two stars by the atmosphere of Titan during the Titan flyby. Six species were identified and measured: methane, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, diacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide. The observations cover altitudes from 450 to 1600 kilometers above the surface. A mesopause is inferred from extraction of the temperature structure of methane, located at 615 km with a temperature minimum of 114 kelvin. The asymptotic kinetic temperature at the top of the atmosphere determined from this experiment is 151 kelvin. The higher order hydrocarbons and hydrogen cyanide peak sharply in abundance and are undetectable below altitudes ranging from 750 to 600 km, leaving methane as the only identifiable carbonaceous molecule in this experiment below 600 km."
https://openalex.org/W1995076640,"Here we report the crystal structure of YqjM, a homolog of Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) that is involved in the oxidative stress response of Bacillus subtilis. In addition to the oxidized and reduced enzyme form, the structures of complexes with p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and p-nitrophenol, respectively, were solved. As for other OYE family members, YqjM folds into a (α/β)8-barrel and has one molecule of flavin mononucleotide bound non-covalently at the COOH termini of the β-sheet. Most of the interactions that control the electronic properties of the flavin mononucleotide cofactor are conserved within the OYE family. However, in contrast to all members of the OYE family characterized to date, YqjM exhibits several unique structural features. For example, the enzyme exists as a homotetramer that is assembled as a dimer of catalytically dependent dimers. Moreover, the protein displays a shared active site architecture where an arginine finger (Arg336) at the COOH terminus of one monomer extends into the active site of the adjacent monomer and is directly involved in substrate recognition. Another remarkable difference in the binding of the ligand in YqjM is represented by the contribution of the NH2-terminal Tyr28 instead of a COOH-terminal tyrosine in OYE and its homologs. The structural information led to a specific data base search from which a new class of OYE oxidoreductases was identified that exhibits a strict conservation of active site residues, which are critical for this subfamily, most notably Cys26, Tyr28, Lys109, and Arg336.

Therefore, YqjM is the first representative of a new bacterial subfamily of OYE homologs. YqjM from the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a member of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) 1The abbreviations used are: OYE, Old Yellow Enzyme; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; pHBA, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde; pNP, p-nitrophenol; SeMet, selenomethionine; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction; PETN, pentaerythritol tetranitrate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MR, morphinone reductase; OPR, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase. family of flavin oxidoreductases as inferred by sequence comparison and detailed biochemical investigations (1Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). OYE itself is an enzyme of significant historical importance, since studies performed with OYE revolutionized the whole field of enzymatic catalysis, thereby highlighting the importance of small vitamin-derived molecules that act as enzymatic cofactors or prosthetic groups. OYE was first isolated in 1932 from brewers' bottom yeast by Warburg and Christian (2Warburg O. Christian W. Naturwissenschaften. 1932; 20: 688Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and was found to contain a non-covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Hugo Theorell (3Theorell H. Biochem. Z. 1935; 275: 344-346Google Scholar, 4Theorell H. Nygaard A.P. Arkiv. Kemi. 1954; 7: 205-209Google Scholar, 5Theorell H. Nygaard A.P. Acta Chem. Scand. 1954; 8: 1104-1105Crossref Google Scholar) then went on to demonstrate that the reaction catalyzed by OYE is strictly dependent on this vitamin B2 (riboflavin) derivative. Consequently he postulated one of the main paradigms in biochemistry: neither apoprotein nor cofactor alone can catalyze the corresponding redox reaction, and only both together yield the active holoenzyme. Intensive studies on OYE spanning more than 70 years contributed greatly to enhancing the general understanding of flavoenzyme catalysis. More specifically, in the so-called reductive half-reaction, NADPH was established to serve as reductant of FMN (6Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cofactor is converted back to its original form in the oxidative half-reaction where flavin then acts as an electron donor reducing the substrate during this step. Despite detailed investigations of OYE, the natural substrates have remained elusive for a long time. Several studies, however, showed that quinones as well as a large variety of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones function as efficient oxidants of flavin, leading to the reduction of the olefinic bond (8Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, two-hybrid screen studies have suggested a possible role of one OYE isozyme, OYE2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in controlling the redox state of actin and thereby maintaining the proper plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton (10Haarer B.K. Amberg D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In fact, reactive oxygen species generated after oxidative stress have been shown to react with the actin sulfhydryl groups of Cys285 and Cys374. A disulfide bond is then formed, resulting in cross-linking of actin filaments (10Haarer B.K. Amberg D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This actin oxidation might be prevented by the action of OYE2 that seems to function as a flavin disulfide reductase. However, OYE3, another OYE isozyme from S. cerevisiae, failed to interact with actin, and therefore general functional conclusions for the whole OYE family cannot be drawn. The findings from Haarer and Amberg (10Haarer B.K. Amberg D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) do, however, confirm former observations that OYE serves as a detoxification enzyme in the antioxidant defense system and disarms a variety of reactive oxidative species. Among others, this has been also inferred by Fitzpatrick et al. (1Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that treatment with hydrogen peroxide or nitro compounds such as TNT induces the expression of YqjM, an OYE homolog, from B. subtilis. Data base searches have indicated that YqjM displays a high degree of sequence similarity to OYE1 from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and its homologs (1Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Pseudomonas putida XenA, a xenobiotic reductase, appears to be the closest homolog exhibiting 40% identity. Biochemical analysis of YqjM has shown that the enzyme shares some important common features with members of the OYE family (1Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For example, YqjM binds the FMN cofactor non-covalently and reduces the flavin in the reductive half-reaction at the expense of NADPH. Like other members of the family, YqjM transfers electrons from the reduced flavin to the double bond of a variety of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and accepts also electrophilic xenobiotics such as nitroglycerin, N-ethylmaleimide, and trinitrotoluene as substrates for the oxidative half-reaction. Finally, phenolic compounds such as p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (pHBA) bind tightly to this enzyme and form charge transfer complexes due to the overlapping π-electrons of the electron-rich phenolate ligand and the electron-deficient flavin isoalloxazine ring (1Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, on comparing YqjM with OYE, several important differences are apparent. For example, photoreduction of YqjM leads directly to the fully reduced state; whereas in the yeast and plant homologs the red flavin semiquinone is kinetically stabilized (1Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A further unique feature of YqjM is attributed to its oligomerization state. While all other OYE homologs are either monomeric or dimeric enzymes, YqjM is the only known family member that functions as a homotetramer (11Fitzpatrick T.B. Auweter S. Kitzing K. Clausen T. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggesting the evolution of particular residues involved in the interface formation between the protomers. This implies that the different modes of self-assembly within the OYE family may be correlated with a functional diversity. Finally, sequence comparisons have suggested significant changes in the active site of the enzyme. For example, Thr37 of OYE, which regulates the redox potential of the FMN cofactor (12Xu D. Kohli R.M. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3556-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is replaced by Cys26 in YqjM, whereas the OYE-Tyr375, which is essential for substrate and inhibitor binding, has no conserved counterpart in YqjM. The three-dimensional structures from OYE (13Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and several of its homologs (14Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C.E.

Phillips Jr., G.N. Markley J.L. Fox B.G. Proteins. 2005; 58: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been elucidated and point to the fundamental fold of YqjM. However, to determine the molecular basis of the unique properties of YqjM, we solved the structures of the oxidized and reduced holoenzyme and of complexes with the inhibitors pHBA and p-nitrophenol (pNP), respectively. The data presented here confirm that YqjM shares the overall fold of the OYE family. Also it demonstrates unequivocally that YqjM is in fact the first characterized representative of a new class of OYE homologs showing fundamental differences to the classical OYE enzymes. Materials—All materials used were of analytical grade. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Chromatographic columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Expression and Purification of the Native YqjM—The construct of pET21a (Novagen) with the open reading frame of yqjM was expressed and purified as described in Ref. 1Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar with the following modifications: purification was performed with an AEKTA-FPLC system from Amersham Biosciences using a HiPrep 16/10 DEAE FF column in the anion exchange step and a HiPrep 16/10 Phenyl FF column for the hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Additionally, a final gel filtration step was introduced using a HiLoad Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium chloride, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions containing YqjM were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration using Centriprep-30 (Amicon). Selenomethionine-labeled YqjM (SeMet-YqjM) was expressed from the met-Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3). The purification of SeMet-YqjM followed the same protocol as for the native enzyme. Protein Crystallization—Crystallization trials were performed at 19 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. After intensive screening, well diffracting crystals were obtained by mixing 3 μl of protein with 1.5 μl of a crystallization solution containing 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 3500, and 0.2 m sodium chloride. Crystal trials were set up in cryschem plates with a reservoir volume of 400 μl. After 5-7 days, crystal plates appeared that had the characteristic yellow color of the oxidized, enzyme-bound FMN cofactor. They belonged to the orthorhombic space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 51.5 Å, b = 185.2 Å, and c = 169.8 Å and contained two molecules per asymmetric unit corresponding to a solvent content of 54%. However the above-mentioned condition did not yield crystals of the SeMet-YqjM derivative. After a new screening round, a similar crystallization condition was found containing 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 3500, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, and 0.01 m strontium chloride. YqjM-SeMet crystals complexed with pHBA and pNP were obtained by cocrystallization using a ligand concentration of 3 mm. The presence of either pHBA or pNP resulted in a color change of the yellow YqjM crystals toward red. Reduction of YqjM crystals was achieved by soaking crystals of the oxidized enzyme in 100 mm NADPH until they turned colorless (approximately after 10 min). For cryo-measurements, crystals were transferred from the crystallization drop to the mother liquor supplied with 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as cryo-protectant and rapidly frozen in a 100 K stream of nitrogen gas. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Initial attempts to overcome the crystallographic phase problem by molecular replacement using several search models derived from other members of the OYE family failed. Therefore experimental phase information was required to determine the structure of YqjM. Phase information could be obtained by collecting a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data set from a single SeMet-YqjM crystal. SAD data of SeMet-YqjM and diffraction data of the complexes with pHBA and pNP were collected at the BW6 beamline at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchroton (Hamburg, Germany) using a MarCCD detector. Crystals of the oxidized and reduced YqjM were measured in house using a MarResearch imaging plate. All diffraction data were processed and scaled with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK from the CCP4 package (18Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the SAD experiment, an x-ray absorption spectrum was recorded in the vicinity of the selenium edge. Diffraction data up to 1.8 Å resolution were then collected at a wavelength corresponding to the peak of this spectrum (f ″ maximum, 0.9792 Å). Subsequently, difference Fourier analyses performed with SHELX (19Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part B. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 20Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar) enabled us to identify all 10 of the theoretical selenium sites. Refinement of heavy atom parameters and phase calculation were conducted with SHARP (21de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Carter Jr, C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 472-494Google Scholar) leading to a figure of merit of 0.68 for data between 20 and 1.82 Å resolution. Solvent flattening was performed with SOLOMON (22Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and resulted in an electron density map of excellent quality, in which the entire backbone model of YqjM was built in with ARP/wARP (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). Energy-restrained crystallographic refinement against the 1.3 Å resolution data set was carried out with maximum likelihood algorithms implemented in CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.L.D.W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Refinement, model rebuilding with the program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), and water incorporation proceeded smoothly via rigid body, positional, and later B-factor optimization. The entire structure was checked using simulated annealing composite omit maps. Finally, after the addition of the FMN cofactor molecules, the refinement converged at a R-factor of 18.9% (Rfree = 20.8%). All residues of YqjM could be traced in the electron density map and exhibited good stereochemistry (Table I). Also the FMN cofactor molecules were well defined by electron density as well as four sulfate ions, two of which were bound within the active sites and the other two stabilizing crystal lattice contacts. In the Ramachandran plot, 91% of the 674 residues were found in the most favorable, 8.6% in the favorable, 0.3% in the generously allowed, and no residue was found in the disallowed region. The data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. All parameter and topology files were created with the program XPLOR2D (27Kleywegt G. Jones T. Acta Crystallogr.

To perform a phylogenetic analysis, the amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW and the result saved in the NEXUS format. The program PAUP* 4.0b10 was used to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of the OYE/YqjM homologs. Enzyme Assays—The apparent steady state kinetic constants were determined as described in Ref. 1Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol.

Briefly, the assays were performed in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C in the presence of an oxygen-consuming system and followed by the oxidation of β-NADPH (100 μm) at 340 nm in a Uvikon spectrophotometer while systematically varying the substrate concentration. Overall Structure—The x-ray structure of native oxidized YqjM was solved by SAD and refined at 1.3 Å resolution to an R-factor of 18.9% (Table I). The monomer of YqjM is comprised of one compact domain representing the frequently observed (α/β)8-barrel or TIM barrel fold, where a cylindrical core of eight twisted β-strands is surrounded by eight helices (Fig. 1). Similar to other (α/β)8-structures, all of the turns at the NH2-terminal end of the barrel are composed of only three or four residues, while the loops at the COOH-terminal end are much longer and build up the active site. The numbering of these loops refers to the preceding β-strands, e.g. loop L6 follows strand 6 (see also Fig. 1B for nomenclature of secondary structure). The COOH-terminal loops range in length from 5 to 31 residues and harbor additional secondary structural elements, namely helices αB, αC, αD, and αE and strands βC and βD. In addition, YqjM has a 310-helix αA and two short antiparallel β-strands prior to β-strand 1 that close the barrel on its NH2-terminal side. A short 310-helix αF is present after the COOH-terminal helix 8. The overall structure of YqjM strongly resembles the structures of other OYE homologs (13Fox K.M. Karplus P.A.

The closest structural relative was found to be pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase from Enterobacter cloacae where 278 residues could be aligned with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) value of 1.29 Å, followed by morphinone reductase (MR) from P. putida (286 aligned Cα with an r.m.s.d. of 1.41 Å), 12-oxophytodienoate reductase (OPR) 1 from Lycopersicon esculentum (286 Cα, 1.46 Å) and OYE (282 Cα, 1.48 Å). A common feature among these oxidoreductases is the NH2-terminal β-hairpin structure that lids the β-barrel. Except for the loops L4 and L8, all COOH-terminal loops of the β-barrel adopt conformations that are distinct in the OYE flavoproteins. In general, these loops form the active site and provide substrate as well as reaction specificity. While other members of the OYE family show some similarities in the respective loop structures, YqjM exhibits unique structural features in the corresponding active site region. Especially the loops L3, L5, and L6 adopt different conformations and vary considerably in length. For example, the crystal structures of OPR1 (16Breithaupt C. Strassner J. Breitinger U. Huber R. Macheroux P. Schaller A. Clausen T. Structure. 2001; 9: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), PETN reductase (15Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and MR (14Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have shown that the loop L3 forms a part of the hydrophobic active site tunnel and seems to play a role in substrate discrimination. In these enzymes loop L3 is extended and folds as an additional two stranded β-sheet, which covers half of the active site. In contrast, the corresponding loop of YqjM is folded as a short 310-helix (αC), which is packed on the wall of the β-barrel. As a result, the YqjM active site is hardly protected by any loop structure and thus is remarkably wide and accessible for potential substrate molecules. Oligomerization State and Oligomer Interfaces—The oligomeric state of YqjM observed in the crystal is the same as in solution (11Fitzpatrick T.B. Auweter S. Kitzing K. Clausen T. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is a tetrameric enzyme, in which the subunits are organized with 222 (D2) point group symmetry (Fig. 2). The tetramer has overall dimensions of ∼84 × 92 × 47 Å3 and resembles a four-petaled cloverleaf with a central hole. The subunits are arranged in such a way that their active sites, defined by the bound FMN molecule, open up in different directions to solvent but are connected with each other by the central hole. In the C2221 crystal form, two of the 2-fold rotation axis coincide with the crystallographic a and b axis, respectively. The two monomers, which are present in the asymmetric unit (named A and B, their crystallographic symmetry mates C and D), are essentially identical and are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. As discussed below, the YqjM tetramer is organized as a dimer of active dimers, i.e. AB and CD, respectively. The (α/β)8-domains of the corresponding monomers interact extensively around the dimer 2-fold axis such that their barrel axis are approximately parallel to each other but open up into opposite directions. The dimer axis passes between helix 1 of the two monomers, where both elements come close together. Additionally, interaction of helix αE and the entire COOH terminus including helix αF with the neighboring counterpart contribute considerably to the binding energy of both subunits. The interaction sites α1/α1* and the αF/αF* are arranged in a perpendicular fashion and are stabilized by the formation of a large hydrophobic cluster involving residues Met27, Pro39, Phe40, Met42, Ala43, Ile46, Ile50, Pro314, and Phe315. This cluster is enclosed by a pronounced hydrogen bonding network formed by Ser29, His44, Arg48, Leu311, Arg312, Gln333, Tyr334, Arg336, Gly337, and Trp338. Most notably, the COOH-terminal end is directed by the latter interactions toward the active site of the neighboring subunit. One of the COOH-terminal residues Arg336* (the asterisk denotes the neighboring subunit) is even protruding as an arginine finger into the adjacent active site, where it forms a part of the substrate binding pocket (near the flavin dimethyl benzene ring). Thus the shared active site strongly suggests that the dimer is the active unit of YqjM. Its formation shields 1241 Å2 per monomer (9% of the entire monomer surface), while the other monomer-monomer contacts are considerably smaller. The contact area between A and C comprises 5% of the accessible monomer surface and the monomers A and D do not interact at all with each other. The contacts between the dimers AB and CD are mediated by the helix-loop-helix motifs of helices 6 and 7 and comprise mainly hydrophobic interactions involving Val260, Phe261, Pro262, Tyr264, Val266, Met285, and Met291.

Furthermore, uterine anandamide levels and blastocyst CB1 are coordinately down-regulated with the attainment of uterine receptivity and blastocyst activation prior to implantation as opposed to their higher levels in delayed implanting uterus and dormant blastocysts (6Paria B.C. Song H. Wang X. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. Bonner T.I. Zimmer A. Dey S.K. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 4188-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These results suggest that lower levels, but not higher levels, of anandamide and CB1 are beneficial to implantation. Indeed, while a low dose of anandamide stimulates blastocyst outgrowth in culture, a higher dose inhibits this event (9Wang J. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Armant D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This is further supported by our findings that anandamide within a very narrow range regulates blastocyst activation and implantation by differentially modulating MAP kinase signaling and Ca2+ channel activity via CB1 (10Wang H. Matsumoto H. Guo Y. Paria B.C. Roberts R.L. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14914-14919Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that endocannabinoid signaling involving uterine anandamide and embryonic CB1 is one of the signaling pathways that determine the fate of embryo implantation. However, the underlying mechanism by which differential uterine anandamide levels are spatiotemporally established under different pregnancy status remains unknown.The discovery of anandamide provoked intense investigation regarding its biosynthetic pathways (11Schmid H.H.O. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). One suggested route of anandamide synthesis is the direct N-acylation of ethanolamine by “anandamide synthase” activity (5Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Devane W.A. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6698-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, this N-acylation reaction has requirements for an alkaline pH and relatively high Km for both arachidonic acid and ethanolamine (12Devane W.A. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6698-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), questioning the physiological relevance of this pathway. The current consensus is that anandamide is released in vivo from hydrolysis of a phospholipid precursor N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) in the cell membrane by the NAPE-selective phospholipase D (13Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Recently, the Nape-pld gene encoding this enzyme was cloned in rodents and humans (14Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and overexpression of this gene in mammalian cell lines generates N-acylethanolamines including anandamide from NAPE (15Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Wang J. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. Ueda N. Biochem. J. 2005; (March 10, Epub ahead of print)PubMed Google Scholar). Once synthesized, anandamide is released from the cell into the extracellular space where it acts as an autocrine or paracrine factor. The effectiveness of anandamide depends on its concentration in the extracellular space, which is regulated by intracellular degradation by fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). It is suggested that embryonic and/or uterine FAAH is a major player in regulating uterine anandamide levels during implantation (16Maccarrone M. DeFelici M. Klinger F.G. Battista N. Fezza F. Dainese E. Siracusa G. Finazzi-Agro A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Paria B.C. Zhao X. Wang J. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Considering the low abundance of uterine FAAH in mice (17Paria B.C. Zhao X. Wang J. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we speculated that uterine anandamide levels are primarily regulated by changing anandamide synthetic status involving NAPE-PLD. Using molecular, biochemical and physiological approaches, we demonstrate here that uterine NAPE-PLD expression and activity change in a spatiotemporal manner determining anandamide levels at the implantation site and during various states of uterine receptivity for implantation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Treatments—Mice were housed at Vanderbilt Animal Care Facility according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines for laboratory animals. Adult CD-1 female mice (Charles River Laboratories) were mated with fertile or vasectomized males of the same strain to induce pregnancy and pseudopregnancy, respectively (day 1 = vaginal plug). Conditions of delayed implantation were induced by ovariectomizing the females on day 4 morning and maintained with daily subcutaneous injections of progesterone (P4, 2 mg/mouse) from days 5 to 7. To activate dormant blastocysts and initiate implantation, P4-primed mice were injected with estradiol-17β (E2, 25 ng/mouse). Implantation sites were visualized by an intravenous injection of Chicago blue dye solution (18Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Uterine tissues were processed for Northern and in situ hybridization, enzyme activity, and anandamide levels. To determine whether Nape-pld was regulated by E2 and P4, ovariectomized wild-type, PR(–/–) or ERα(–/–) mice were injected with oil (control), E2 (100 ng/mouse), P4 (2 mg/mouse), or a combination of E2 and P4. Mice were killed at the indicated times and uteri processed for mRNA analysis by quantitatiive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and progesterone receptor (PR) mutant mice were originally provided by Dennis Lubahn and Bert O'Malley, respectively.Analysis of Anandamide—Uteri pooled from three to five pregnant mice in each group (n = 5) were assayed for anandamide as described previously (19Kingsley P.J. Marnett L.J. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Wang H. Guo Y. Wang D. Kingsley P.J. Marnett L.J. Das S.K. DuBois R.N. Dey S.K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Enzyme Assay—NAPE-PLD activity was measured by the release of anandamide or N-palmitoylethanolamine from N-[14C]arachidonoyl-PE (NArPE) or N-[14C]palmitoyl-PE (NPPE), respectively, as described (14Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Uteri pooled from 10 to 12 mice in each group (n = 3–4) were homogenized, and the supernatants (800 × g) were extracted for NAPE-PLD assay. Assays were performed in three to five replicates for each sample.In Situ Hybridization—Frozen sections (10 μm) were hybridized with a 35S-labeled cRNA probe to mouse Nape-pld as described (21Das S.K. Wang X.N. Paria B.C. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1071-1083PubMed Google Scholar). Sections hybridized with the sense probes served as negative controls and showed no positive signals.Northern Hybridization—Poly(A+) RNA (2.0 μg) was denatured, separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon membranes. Cross-linked blots were prehybridized, hybridized, and washed as described previously (21Das S.K. Wang X.N. Paria B.C. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1071-1083PubMed Google Scholar). The hybrids were detected by autoradiography.Quantitative RT-PCR—RT reaction was performed using Super-Script II RT kit (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in the Bio-Rad iCycler using iQTM SYBR Green Supermix according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primers used were: mGAPDH (5′-GCC TTC CGT GTT CCT ACC C-3′ and 5′-TGC CTG CTT CAC CAC CTT C-3′) and NAPE-PLD (5′-GTC CTC ATC AGT CAC AAC C-3′ and 5′-AGC TCA ATC ACG TTC TCG-3′). mGAPDH served as the reference gene for analyzing the relative abundance of NAPE-PLD mRNA.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNape-pld Shows Spatiotemporal Expression in the Periimplantation Uterus—As described above, endocannabinoid signaling is primarily mediated by interactions between uterine anandamide and embryonic CB1, directing embryo development and implantation in a stage and dose dependent manner in mice. However, it remains unknown how appropriate anandamide levels are spatiotemporally created for synchronizing preimplantation embryo development and uterine receptivity for implantation. The objective of this study was to explore the cell-specific uterine expression of Nape-pld prior to, during, and after embryo implantation. As shown in Fig. 1A, in situ hybridization shows that Nape-pld is primarily expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelia with lower levels of expression in the stroma on days 1–4 of pregnancy, indicating that the epithelium is the major source of uterine anandamide prior to implantation. With the initiation and progression of implantation and decidualization on days 5–7, the expression is primarily restricted to the luminal and glandular epithelia located at the interimplantation region (Fig. 1A), albeit at low levels in the stroma and deciduum at the implantation site. However, on day 5 with the onset of implantation, we observed an interesting expression pattern; while Nape-pld expression is very low in the luminal epithelium close to the implanting blastocyst, the expression is much higher in the luminal epithelium further to the blastocyst within the same implantation chamber and as expected at the interimplantation site (Fig. 1A). These observations suggest a potential role of implanting embryo in regulating uterine Nape-pld expression and anandamide levels. This dynamic expression pattern of Nape-pld in the periimplantation uterus is consistent with our Northern blot experiments, showing lower levels of expression at the implantation sites in contrast to higher expression at the interimplantation sites on days 5–7 (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that NAPE-PLD is a major player in regulating the dynamic levels of anandamide in the uterus during early pregnancy. Thus, we next examined NAPE-PLD activity and anandamide levels in the periimplantation uterus.NAPE-PLD Activity Correlates with Uterine Anandamide Levels during Implantation—As shown previously (7Schmid P.C.

A. 1997; 94: 4188-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), uterine anandamide levels fluctuate with the state of pregnancy with higher levels at the interimplantation site but lower at the site of implantation (Fig. 1C). Because levels of FAAH expression are very low in the mouse uterus (17Paria B.C. Zhao X. Wang J. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we speculated that NAPE-PLD activity primarily contributes to create an anandamide gradient in the uterus during early pregnancy. Indeed, consistent with the gene expression pattern on days 5–7, NAPE-PLD enzymatic activity, as measured by the release of anandamide or N-palmitoylethanolamine from 14C-labeled NArPE or NPPE, respectively (14Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), exhibited a similar pattern showing higher activity at the interimplantation site but lower activity at the implantation site (Fig. 1D).Although these results are consistent with our previous findings regarding the pattern of fluctuating uterine anandamide levels during early pregnancy, we were surprised to see that overall levels of uterine anandamide are much lower in pregnant CD1 mice that we currently use at Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN) compared with our previous observation of very high levels of uterine anandamide in the same strain of mice at Kansas University Medical Center (Kansas City, KS) about a decade ago (7Schmid P.C.

These changes are not due to procedural differences in measuring anandamide levels, since comparable low levels of uterine anandamide were also detected in Vanderbilt-housed mice in the laboratory of Harald Schmid, a co-author of the present and earlier report (8Paria B.C. Ma W. Andrenyak D.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H. Moody D.E. Deng H. Makriyannis A. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1490-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The major changes between these two animal facilities include differences in mouse diets, caging and bedding systems, environmental conditions, viral load, and presumably water quality. More importantly, mice at Vanderbilt are housed in a pathogen-free environment as compared with the conventional environment that prevailed a decade ago at Kansas University Medical Center. Although we do not know whether higher uterine anandamide levels would have correlated with elevated NAPE-PLD activity in our earlier studies, it is possible that NAPE-PLD expression and/or activity are sensitive to varying experimental and environmental conditions. Nonetheless, our current results provide direct molecular and biochemical evidence that NAPE-PLD is a major determinant of uterine anandamide levels during implantation. This tight regulation of NAPE-PLD in the uterus perhaps contributes to the biphasic anandamide signaling during implantation (7Schmid P.C. Paria B.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4188-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Wang H. Matsumoto H. Guo Y. Paria B.C. Roberts R.L. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). To better understand the physiological relevance of differential anandamide gradients during early pregnancy, we asked whether uterine NAPE-PLD is regulated by these steroids.Estrogen and Progesterone Down-regulate Uterine Nape-pld Expression—Since steroid hormonal profiles are complex during early pregnancy in mice, we surmised that the expression of this gene is influenced by ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen, and P4 singly or in combination. To address this question, we examined Nape-pld expression in a defined system, i.e. in ovariectomized mice after steroid hormone treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of total uterine RNA was performed to determine the expression of Nape-pld in response to E2 and/or P4. We observed that E2, P4, or a combined injection of E2 plus P4 down-regulates the expression of Nape-pld both at 6 and 24 h, albeit little less inhibition by P4 alone (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that ovarian steroid hormones individually or in combination influence the expression of Nape-pld.Fig. 2Estrogen and progesterone down-regulate uterine Nape-pld expression via their nuclear receptors. Steroid hormonal regulation of uterine Nape-pld expression in ovariectomized wild-type (A) and ERα(–/–) and PR(–/–) (B) mice were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. The data presented as fold induction are relative to oil treatment and are mean ± S.E. of three independent RNA samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our next goal was to examine whether P4 and estrogen regulation of Nape-pld is mediated via their cognate nuclear receptors. We used mice lacking nuclear ERα or progesterone receptor PR to further address this question. While the inhibitory effects of P4 remained unaltered in ERα(–/–) mice, the down-regulation of Nape-pld that we observed in E2-treated wild-type mice remained virtually unaltered (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, down-regulation of Nape-pld expression was not observed when the ovariectomized PR(–/–) females were given an injection of P4; however, down-regulation by E2 persisted in PR(–/–) females (Fig. 2B). These results provide genetic evidence that Nape-pld is regulated by ovarian steroid hormones via their nuclear receptors.Uterine Nape-pld Expression and Activity Are Correlated with Uterine Receptivity for Implantation—In mice, the prereceptive, receptive, and nonreceptive phases of the uterus during pregnancy or pseudopregnancy are sequentially programmed by ovarian P4 and estrogen (22Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). During normal pregnancy, blastocysts implant only in the receptive uterus within a limited time span known as the “window” of uterine receptivity for implantation. In mice, the P4-primed uterus becomes receptive on day 4 when it is superimposed with preimplantation ovarian estrogen secretion (18Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The receptive uterus then automatically proceed to the nonreceptive state on day 6 when blastocysts fail to implant (18Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 23Song H. Lim H. Paria B.C. Matsumoto H. Swift L.L. Morrow J. Bonventre J.V. Dey S.K. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2879-2889PubMed Google Scholar). Various factors including cytokines, growth factors, transcription factors, and lipid signaling molecules participate in these processes through autocrine, paracrine, and/or juxtacrine manner (22Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). With respect to endocannabinoid signaling, we provided evidence that down-regulation of anandamide levels is associated with uterine receptivity, while its up-regulation is correlated with uterine refractoriness to embryo implantation (6Paria B.C. Song H. Wang X. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. Bonner T.I. Zimmer A. Dey S.K. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 4188-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we also noted in the present study that uterine anandamide levels on day 6 of pseudopregnancy are significantly higher than those on day 4 (Fig. 3A), reinforcing the idea that the regulation of anandamide levels correlate with uterine receptivity and implantation. We then asked whether alteration in uterine Nape-pld expression accounts for the fluctuated anandamide levels during various states of uterine receptivity. As shown in Fig. 3B, Nape-pld mRNA levels, as assessed by Northern hybridization, were higher in the nonreceptive uterus on day 6 compared with the levels in the receptive uterus on day 4 of pseudopregnancy. Furthermore, this up-regulated Nape-pld expression in the nonreceptive uterus was translated into higher NAPE-PLD activity. For example, a significantly higher activity was detected in the uterus on day 6 as opposed to day 4 of pseudopregnancy (Fig. 3C). This correlation of NAPE-PLD expression, activity, and anandamide levels with the receptive and nonreceptive uterine phases further emphasizes that NAPE-PLD is an important determinant of uterine anandamide signaling during early pregnancy.Fig. 3Expression and activity of NAPE-PLD are coordinated with uterine receptivity and blastocyst activation.A–C, Nape-pld expression and NAPE-PLD activity correlate, showing elevated NAPE-PLD uterine anandamide levels in the nonreceptive uterus on day 6 of pseudopregnancy compared with those in the receptive uterus on day 4 (unpaired t test; **, p < 0.005).

Our recent observation shows that uterine anandamide within a very narrow range regulates blastocyst function and implantation by differentially modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and Ca2+ channel activity (10Wang H. Matsumoto H. Guo Y. Paria B.C. Roberts R.L. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14914-14919Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is also suggested that embryonic and/or uterine FAAH, which is activated by an unidentified embryo-derived lipid molecule, plays roles in creating optimal levels of anandamide beneficial to implantation (16Maccarrone M. DeFelici M. Klinger F.G. Battista N. Fezza F. Dainese E. Siracusa G. Finazzi-Agro A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Paria B.C. Zhao X. Wang J. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether the implanting embryo influences anandamide synthesis via NAPE-PLD. Our results showing absence of Nape-pld expression in the luminal epithelium adjacent to the implantation site (Fig. 1A) suggest that this gene is locally regulated in the uterus by implanting blastocysts. Thus, we further examined the expression of this gene in a physiologically relevant delayed implantation model. In the delayed implanting uterus, blastocysts undergo dormancy and fail to implant. However, this condition is terminated by an estrogen injection with activation of dormant blastocysts, attainment of uterine receptivity, and implantation (18Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We observed that Nape-pld expression is much higher in the luminal epithelium surrounding the dormant blastocyst (Fig. 3D), whereas reactivation of blastocysts by estrogen significantly down-regulates the expression in the adjacent luminal and stromal cells with the initiation of implantation (Fig. 3D). This finding is consistent with our results during normal implantation on day 5 (Fig. 1A).Collectively, the present work provides molecular, biochemical, and physiological evidence that uterine anandamide levels conducive to implantation are primarily regulated by dynamic expression and activity of NAPE-PLD. Thus, an aberrant uterine NAPE-PLD activity may cause implantation failure or defective implantation. This is clinically relevant, since high peripheral anandamide levels due to low FAAH activity are associated with spontaneous pregnancy loss in women (24Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N.

The γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) permease (GabP) of Escherichia coli has been found in this study to be affected both topologically and kinetically by membrane lipids. Using single cysteine accessibility methods with viable E. coli strains of natural lipid composition and those lacking phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), we have shown that the N-terminal hairpin of GabP is inverted relative to the membrane in PE-lacking cells, with a hinge point in transmembrane domain III. The rate of GABA transport is reduced by more than 99% in PE-lacking cells. The Michaelis constant for GABA transport is not greatly affected nor is the dependence of transport on energy. However, “transport specificity ratio” analysis demonstrated a clear transition state stability difference for GABA and nipecotic acid between the protein in PE-containing and PE-lacking cells. The patterns of observed effects are similar to those seen with the phenylalanine transporter of E. coli (Zhang, W., Bogdanov, M. Pi, J. Pittard, A. J., and Dowhan, W. (2003) J. Biol.

(2002) EMBO J. 21, 2107–2116), a major facilitator superfamily member.

Therefore, by extending the studies of similarities and differences in lipid responses among and between family groups, we may identify elements within the proteins that facilitate lipid responsiveness. Membrane lipid composition clearly affects protein structure and function, and local or temporal changes in lipid composition have been suggested as potential regulators of cellular processes (1Dowhan W. Mileykovskaya E. Bogdanov M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the precise changes in protein structure as a function of lipid environment, particularly in whole cells, have only recently been probed (2van Klompenburg W.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that although the protein sequence contains the primary topogenic signals that define transmembrane (TM) domains and topological organization of membrane proteins, membrane lipid composition is also a determinant of the orientation of TM domains with respect to the plane of the membrane. Initial studies were carried out on lactose permease (LacY), which is the most widely studied member of the large major facilitator superfamily. Major facilitator superfamily transporters are 12 TM domain spanning single component uni-, sym-, or antiporters of sugars, amino acids, drugs, and other low molecular weight solutes; LacY belongs to a six-member subfamily of oligosaccharide:H+ symporters (6Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LacY either reconstituted in proteoliposomes containing PE or expressed in E. coli with wild type phospholipid composition carries out active transport of substrate against a concentration gradient. However, LacY in either whole cells (7Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 732-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or proteoliposomes lacking PE (8Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) only carries out energy-independent facilitated transport of substrate. The bioenergetic properties of cells and proteoliposomes are independent of the presence or absence of PE (7Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 732-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The level of functional LacY and total amount of LacY, as measured by the initial rate of facilitated transport and Western blotting, respectively, are also the same in both cases (7Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 732-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Even more dramatic than the alteration in functional properties is the change in the organization of LacY when assembled in cells lacking PE. A major topological inversion of the N-terminal six-TM helical bundle of LacY occurs with respect to the membrane bilayer, whereas the C-terminal helical bundle, excepting TM domain VII, retains wild type topological organization (4Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Reintroduction of PE after assembly of LacY triggers a conformational change resulting in a lipid-dependent restoration of active transport function and recovery of normal topology of at least one LacY subdomain (4Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The dependence on PE for proper topological organization and function is not restricted to LacY. A similar requirement for PE was observed with the phenylalanine permease (PheP) of E. coli (3Zhang W. Bogdanov M. Pi J. Pittard A.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50128-50135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Assembly in the absence of PE resulted in an inversion with respect to the membrane bilayer of the first two N-terminal TM domains and their adjacent cytoplasmic and periplasmic extramembrane domains. PheP expressed in cells lacking PE exhibited a 5-fold increase in Km and 5-fold decrease in Vmax for active phenylalanine transport. Because both Vmax and Km were affected, one can rule out that lack of PE simply causes loss of activity for the majority of PheP molecules. Introduction of PE after assembly of PheP in PE-lacking cells restored full active transport and the topology of the inverted N-terminal hairpin. These results demonstrate that membrane phospholipid composition is a determinant of the topological organization of some TM domains and that once TM domain orientation is established during assembly, a change in phospholipid composition can effect a change in topological organization. Although in vitro evidence for several secondary transport proteins has shown a dependence on PE for function (8Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Driessen A.J. Zheng T. In't Veld G. Op den Kamp J.A. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11van der Heide T. Stuart M. C.A. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7022-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the above results are the first to demonstrate a dependence of function on in vivo membrane lipid composition. LacY and PheP structural and functional dependence on PE are similar, but the details of structural organization and function are significantly different. LacY contains a large N-terminal helical bundle, and PheP contains a small N-terminal hairpin structure that depends on PE for proper topological organization. LacY is absolutely dependent on PE for active transport, whereas the lack of PE adversely affects the kinetics of PheP active transport. Because LacY and PheP belong to different families of secondary transport proteins, we wished to address whether, first, the above general dependence on PE is exhibited by other transport proteins and, second, whether the details of the dependence are similar within members of the same subfamily of transporters. The γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) permease (GabP) of E. coli belongs to the same amino acid/polyamine/organocation family of transporters as PheP (12Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We report herein that lack of PE during assembly of GabP results in an inversion of the N-terminal TM hairpin similar to that observed for PheP. In the absence of PE, transport activity remained active with a dramatically reduced Vmax but a similar Km for GABA. By determining a difference in the “transport specificity ratio” (TSR) for GABA and nipecotic acid (NA) as substrates (13King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) for GabP between PE-containing and PE-lacking cells, we established that lack of PE did not simply inactivate the majority of permease molecules, but affected intrinsic kinetic characteristics. These results further broaden the number of secondary transporters whose topological organization and function are dependent on PE and suggest that closely related members of the same subfamily of transporters may share common topogenic signals that respond to membrane lipid composition.

Single cysteine replacements in putative extramembrane domains of a Cys-less GabP (native cysteines at positions 158, 251, 300, and 443 replaced by alanine) were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded DNA from phage-mid, pSCK-GP11 (encoding Cys-less GabP), as described previously (14King S.C.

Unless otherwise indicated, cells carrying these plasmids were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Expression of plasmid-borne gabP was induced during growth in exponential phase by the addition of 0.24 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 2.5 h unless otherwise indicated.Table IPlasmids and E. coli strainsPlasmidsRelevant genotype or commentsSource or Ref.pSCK-380ampr lacIq tacO+P+36King S.C.

Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in which GABA transport was measured were prepared by transforming AL95 (PE-lacking) or AL95/pDD72GM (PE-containing) by plasmid pSCK-380-CL-Hx10 (Cys-less GabP) by the method of Chung et al. (15Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). In short, cells are harvested at ∼0.2 A600, resuspended in 0.1 volumes of 10% (w/v) either polyethylene glycol-3350 or polyethylene glycol-8000, 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 50 mm MgCl2 in LB medium. Aliquots were frozen at –80 °C. Cells were transformed with plasmid DNA by a 5–60-min incubation on ice, followed by a 1 h recovery in LB supplemented with 50 mm MgCl2 and 20 mm glucose. Transport Assays—Transport of [3H]GABA was measured in intact E. coli cells by standard methods (16Hu L.A. King S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20162-20167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. E. coli strains expressing the Cys-less GabP from pSCK-380-CL-Hx10 were cultured at either 30 °C (PE-containing: AL95/pDD72GM) or 37 °C (PE-lacking: AL95) in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and 5 mm glucose. IPTG (1.0 mm) was added during the final 2 h of logarithmic growth to induce GabP expression. The cells were washed twice and resuspended to an A600 of 6.0 in ice-cold assay buffer, 20 mm MOPS, 120 mm KCl, 50 mm MgCl2,5mm glucose (pH 7.0) (MKM buffer), and supplemented with 80 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Washed cells (100 μl) at room temperature were rapidly combined with substrate mixture (11 μl) containing varying amounts of [3H]GABA in MKM buffer. Reactions were stopped by transfer of 100 μl of cell mixture into 1 ml of ice-cold MKM buffer supplemented with 20 mm HgCl2. Reactions were terminated at 15 s for PE-containing cells and 2 min for PE-lacking cells, conditions that were established to reflect initial velocities. The sample was applied to a GF/F filter, which was then washed with 3 ml of ice-cold MKM supplemented with 5 mm HgCl2. Filters were dissolved in Ultima Gold™ scintillation mixture, and 3H radioactivity was quantified using a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was added to a final concentration of 50 μm by 1:100 dilution from an ethanol stock solution 1–2 min prior to beginning the assay, where indicated. Vmax and Km values were determined by direct fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Kaleidagraph. Activity over a range of GABA concentrations was measured at least three times, each a separate culture from freshly transformed cells. Parallel experiments performed with PE-containing and PE-lacking strains carrying empty vector plasmids were used to correct for the background uptake of [3H]GABA in all cases. Competitive Uptake and Transport Specificity Ratio Analysis—Dual-label competitive uptake assays were performed as described previously (14King S.C. Brown-Istvan L. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 633-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. E. coli strains expressing the Cys-less GabP from pSCK-380-CL-Hx10 were cultured at either 30 °C (PE-containing, AL95/pDD72GM) or 37 °C (PE-lacking, AL95) in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and glucose (0.4% w/v). IPTG was added during the final 2 h of logarithmic growth to induce GabP expression. The cells were washed by centrifugation, resuspended (A600 = 6.7) in ice-cold MKM buffer supplemented with chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml), and held on ice until used. Washed cells (90 μl), prewarmed to 30 °C, were rapidly combined with a prewarmed substrate mixture (10 μl) containing 70 μm [3H]NA (4.2 μCi/ml) and 30 μm [14C]GABA (0.6 μCi/ml) in MKM buffer and then stopped at times indicated in the figure legends by the addition of ice-cold MKM buffer supplemented with 20 mm HgCl2. The sample was applied to a type hemagglutinin filter, which was then washed with 3 ml of ice-cold MKM supplemented with 5 mm HgCl2. Filters were dissolved in Ultima Gold scintillation mixture, and 3H and 14C radioactivity (disintegrations) was analyzed with a Packard BioScience Tri-Carb 2900 TR liquid scintillation spectrometer using stored Ultima Gold™ quench curves and automatic quench compensation. Parallel experiments were performed with PE-containing and PE-lacking strains lacking the GabP expression plasmid and were used to correct for the background uptake of [14C]GABA and [3H]NA. The TSR was obtained by analyzing the results of dual-label competitive uptake with Equation 1 (13King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), TSR=vGABAvNA[NA][GABA] (Eq. 1) where vGABA and vNA are the initial transport velocities for [14C]GABA and [3H]NA, respectively, competing at the GabP active site. The TSR analysis is highly informative, because of the algebraic equivalencies indicated in Equation 2 (13King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), TSR=(kcat/Km)GABA(kcat/Km)NA=e(−ΔΔGb/RT) (Eq. 2) which reveals that TSR for any given pair of substrates is a constant, reflecting intrinsic molecular properties of the transporter-substrate interaction that are independent of all reagent concentrations, including the transporter expression level (13King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the specificity parameter, (kcat/Km), is an apparent second-order rate constant (units m–1 s–1) that reflects transition state stability, which is the energetic distance between the free reactants (i.e. Transporter + Substrate) and the transition state complex. The transition state stability in turn reflects the degree to which intrinsic substrate binding energy, ΔGb, is realized in the transition state transporter conformation. Thus, the TSR parameter (a constant, characteristic of a particular transporter molecule and a pair of substrates) quantifies the change in binding energy (ΔΔGb) that is because of the structural difference between two competing substrates (e.g. GABA versus NA). Therefore, any measured change in the TSR parameter requires an underlying change in the transition state binding affinity for at least one member of the substrate pair (13King S.C. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Competitive Inhibition—The PE-containing (AL95/pDD72GM) and PE-lacking (AL95) E. coli strains harboring pSCK-380-CL-Hx10 (encodes Cys-less GabP) were cultured and processed for transport as described in the previous section. The PE-containing and PE-lacking strains were induced, respectively, with 2 μm and 200 μm IPTG to obtain comparable initial transport velocities. Prewarmed cells were exposed for 45 s (initial rate) to 10 μm [14C]GABA (0.2 μCi/ml) plus 10–12 different inhibitor concentrations, spanning approximately a 500-fold range centered on the titration midpoint. Parallel experiments were performed with strains lacking the GabP expression plasmid to account for background [14C]GABA uptake. GraphPad Prism™ software was used to fit the resulting data by Equation 3 (17Motulsky H.J. Analyzing Data with GraphPad Prism. GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA1999: 174-175Google Scholar), %Control=1001+10log[I]−log(IC50) (Eq. 3) where [I] is the inhibitor concentration, and IC50 is the inhibitor concentration at the titration midpoint where activity is 50% of the noninhibited control. The program extracts KI, the inhibitor dissociation constant, based on the relationship in Equation 4 (18Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar), IC50=KIKm(Km+[GABA]) (Eq. 4) wherein measured Km (GABA) values of 12.2 μm and 6.7 μm have been specified for the PE-containing and PE-lacking strains, respectively. Chemical Labeling of Cys Residues—A 50-ml culture of cells carrying a pSCK-380-X#Y-Hx10 plasmid was induced for GabP expression, grown to a final A600 of 0.5–0.6, and resuspended after harvesting to an A600 of 25 in 1 ml of buffer A (100 mm K+-HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm KCl). Exposed reactive groups on whole cells were biotinylated by adding MPEOB to a final concentration of 100 μm followed by incubation for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 20 mm, followed by two cycles of centrifugation and resuspension in buffer A containing 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. To expose Cys residues facing the cytoplasm to external solvent, cell suspensions were vortexed vigorously with 0.5% (v/v) toluene for 1 min and subjected to labeling as described above. Labeled cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then solubilized and immunoprecipitated as described below. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—After MPEOB labeling, cells were lysed by addition of an equal volume of 0.2 m NaOH, vortexed, incubated for 15 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with 4 m KCl and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and then solubilized by resuspension in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, followed by vigorous vortexing for 40 min at room temperature and incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were diluted by adding 1.4 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Lubrol (immunoprecipitation buffer 1; IP1), and immunoprecipitated with anti-GabP polyclonal antibody by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The antibody complex was isolated by addition of 50 μl of a suspension of Pansorbin reconstituted in IP1 according to the supplier's instructions. The samples were gently rocked at 4 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation the pellet was washed once with 1 ml of IP1, twice with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The final precipitates were solubilized in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged, and the solubilized proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 12% gels. The samples were transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (19Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Avidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:50,000 dilution of 2 mg/ml stock solution) and conventional ECL reagents were used to visualize biotinylated proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Bio-Rad Fluor-S Max imager was used to record the results. Direct Western blots were also performed. Cells were lysed by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and membrane transfer, the anti-GabP polyclonal antibody was used at a dilution of 1:2000, with detection by an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with (horseradish peroxidase) and imaging as above. Direct Transformation of PE-lacking Cells—We initially generated GabP-overexpressing PE-lacking cells for transport assay and topological determination by transforming PE-containing cells (AD93/pDD72 or AL95/pDD72GM) with the plasmids expressing GabP, followed by effecting loss of pDD72 or pDD72GM by growth of cells at 42 °C (5DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, expression levels of GabP in PE-lacking cells declined over time following curing as determined by Western blotting with an antibody directed at GabP (data not shown). Therefore, we examined several methods that have been established for making competent wild type E. coli cells to find a method for direct transformation of PE-lacking cells (AL95). Repeated washing of cells in cold 50 mm CaCl2, or in 50 mm CaCl2 plus 50 mm MgCl2 resulted in a low number of transformants (10"

https://openalex.org/W2128574930,"CD39 (ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1; E-NTPDase1) is a plasma membrane ecto-enzyme that regulates purinergic receptor signaling by controlling the levels of extracellular nucleotides. In blood vessels this enzyme exhibits a thromboregulatory role through the control of platelet aggregation. CD39 is localized in caveolae, which are plasma membrane invaginations with distinct lipid composition, similar to dynamic lipid microdomains, called rafts. Cholesterol is enriched together with sphingolipids in both rafts and caveolae, as well as in other specialized domains of the membrane, and plays a key role in their function. Here, we examine the potential role of cholesterol-enriched domains in CD39 function. Using polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and caveolin-1 gene-disrupted mice, we show that caveolae are not essential either for the enzymatic activity of CD39 or for its targeting to plasma membrane. On the other hand, flotation experiments using detergent-free or detergent-based approaches indicate that CD39 associates, at least in part, with distinct lipid assemblies. In the apical membrane of MDCK cells, which lacks caveolae, CD39 is localized in microvilli, which are also cholesterol and raft-dependent membrane domains. Interfering with cholesterol levels using drugs that either deplete or sequester membrane cholesterol results in a strong inhibition of the enzymatic and anti-platelet activity of CD39. The effects of cholesterol depletion are completely reversed by replenishment of membranes with pure cholesterol, but not by cholestenone. These data suggest a functional link between the localization of CD39 in cholesterol-rich domains of the membrane and its role in thromboregulation."

Synaptic vesicle cycling, the process of exocytosis, membrane retrieval,and formation and recruitment of new vesicles at the release site, isextremely important in maintaining effective transmission during sustainedsynaptic activity. Repetitive action potential activity in the presynapticneuron causes changes in the strength of the postsynaptic response in a time-and activity-dependent manner; this can lead to facilitation, depression, or amixture of both forms of short-term plasticity(1Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). Synaptic strength dependson both the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles and therelease probability of individual vesicles following an action potential. Inaddition to the readily releasable pool, there is a large reserve pool ofvesicles that have a lower release probability and are not thought to beprimed for immediate release(2Richards D.A. Guatimosim C. Betz W.J. Neuron. 2000; 27: 551-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In cultured mammaliancentral nervous system synapses, only a small number of readily releasablevesicles that are refilled via the fast endocytic pathway are reused duringrapid stimulation (“tetanic rundown”)(3Harris K.M. Sultan P. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,4Schikorski T. Stevens C.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This recycling pool is asmall fraction of the total and exchanges slowly with the reserve pool at lowand moderate frequencies of stimulation. Synaptic vesicle replenishment isessential for ongoing synaptic transmission. Under repetitive releaseconditions such as high frequency stimulation, vesicles in the reserve poolare rapidly recruited to the release sites for continued transmitterrelease. The maintenance of efficient neurotransmitter release depends upon theinteraction of numerous protein complexes that determine the life cycle ofsynaptic vesicles and the recycling of the SNARE-based release machinery(5Rothman J.E.

It is characterized by a fast response with a very shortdelay between excitation and secretion and by limited release of a smallpercentage of docked vesicles upon Ca2+ influx. Considerableevidence indicates that mechanisms that modulate presynaptic activity,specifically those that change release probability and vesicle recyclingkinetics, play a role in synaptic heterogeneity(25Rettig J. Neher E. Science. 2002; 298: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 26Rosenmund C. Sigler A. Augustin I. Reim K. Brose N. Rhee J.S.

SNAP-29 has recently been reported as a candidate molecule regulating thedisassembly of the SNARE complex(29Su Q. Mochida S. Tian J.H. Mehta R. Sheng Z.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14038-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SNAP-29 was initiallyisolated by yeast two-hybrid selection using syntaxin-3 as the bait and waslocalized predominantly to the intracellular membrane structures intransiently transfected normal rat kidney cells(30Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M. Yu S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Due to its intracellularmembrane association in non-neuronal cells and its interactions with mostmembers of the syntaxin family, SNAP-29 has been proposed to be a ubiquitouscytoplasmic SNARE protein involved in general membrane trafficking(31Hohenstein A.C. Roche P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our previous studiesdemonstrated that SNAP-29 is present at synapses and regulates recycling ofthe SNARE complexes by competing with α-SNAP for binding to the SNAREsand consequently inhibiting disassembly of the SNARE complex invitro. Introduction of SNAP-29 into presynaptic superior cervicalganglion neurons (SCGNs) in culture significantly reduces neurotransmitterrelease in an activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, the activity-dependentinhibition by SNAP-29 could be reversed by co-injection of α-SNAP,consistent with our in vitro observation that SNAP-29 andα-SNAP compete for the binding to the SNARE complex(29Su Q. Mochida S. Tian J.H. Mehta R. Sheng Z.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14038-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the function ofSNAP-29 in synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity in the centralnervous system has not yet been examined. In the present study, weoverexpressed SNAP-29-EGFP or knocked-down endogenous SNAP-29 expression incultured rat hippocampal neurons, and we examined the functional role forSNAP-29 in synaptic vesicle turnover, using an approach that combines dualpatch clamp whole-cell recording, FM dye imaging, and immunocytochemicalassays. Our findings suggest a novel inhibitory role for SNAP-29 in synapticvesicle recycling. Construction of SNAP-29-EGFP Construct—Human SNAP-29 cDNAwas amplified by PCR using the forward primer5′-GATTCTGCAGTCATGTCAGCTTACCCTAAAAGC-3′ (PstI) and the reverseprimer 5′-CGGTGGATCCGAGTTGTCGAACTTTTCTTTC-3′ (BamHI). Theconstruct was then subcloned into the vector pEGFP-N3 (Clontech), and thesequence was confirmed. Hippocampal Cell Culture and Electrophysiology—Primaryhippocampal neuron mixed cultures were prepared from embryonic Sprague-Dawleyrat (age, embryonic day 17–18), according to the procedures describedpreviously (32Zhang J. Wang H. Ye C. Ge W. Chen Y. Wu C.P. Poo M. Duan S. Neuron. 2003; 40: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Cultures weretransfected at DIV 6–8 with SNAP-29-EGFP or EGFP control vector usingLipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the modified version of publishedprotocols (33Lao G. Scheuss V. Gerwin C.M. Su Q. Mochida S. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Neuron. 2000; 25: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Allelectrophysiological recordings were performed 12–36 h aftertransfection. Dual patch clamp recordings were performed with whole-cellconfiguration at room temperature. Postsynaptic currents and potentials wereacquired and measured using an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier driven byPatchMaster software, version 1.05 (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Datawere analyzed by Igor Pro version 4.04 and Origin Pro version 7.0.Extracellular recording solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 3mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 2mm MgCl2, and 8 mm d-glucose (pH7.3) (310 mosm). Patch pipettes with resistance of 4–8megaohms were used and backfilled with 105 mm K-gluconate, 30mm KCl, 9.0 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm ATP-Mg, 10mm HEPES, and 0.2 mm EGTA (pH 7.3) (310mosm). Transfected neurons (detected under a fluorescencemicroscope) forming synapses with untransfected neurons were selected forexperiments. To control the timing for PSC measurements, synaptic contactbetween neurons was confirmed by 5–10 test stimuli, each separated by30-s intervals. Following the test stimuli, a 3-min rest period was appliedbefore data collection began to ensure that all fusion and recycling machineryhad reset to resting levels. Membrane capacitance and series resistance werecompensated electronically. Signals were filtered at 10 kHz. Only recordingswith access resistance below 20 megaohms and leak current below 100 pA wereincluded in the analysis. Brief depolarization of the transfected neuronselicited action potentials in the axon of presynaptic neurons and,consequently, neurotransmitter release. PSCs were recorded after a shortsynaptic delay on the untransfected postsynaptic neuron. A hyperpolarizingcurrent (-75 mV, 40 ms) was injected at the end of each trial of stimulationto monitor the steady state of input resistance. FM Dye Imaging—FM dye imaging was performed on hippocampalcultures 24–48 h after transfection. Presynaptic terminals were loadedwith the fluorescent styryl dye FM4-64 (15 μm) by incubating theculture plate for 1 min in high K+ solution containing 58mm NaCl, 90 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 3mm CaCl2·2H2O, 8 mmglucose, and 2 mm MgCl2·6H2O (pH 7.3).The culture plate was then washed in calcium-free solution for 10 min toreduce nonspecific staining. The nerve terminals of the transfected neuronwere identified under a confocal microscope (Olympus IX71 inverted microscope)using an oil immersion UPLAPO ×40 objective lens (Zeiss) by tracing theoptically distinguishable axon expressing EGFP or SNAP-29-EGFP. ThoseEGFP-labeled terminals capable of dye uptake were considered functionalrelease sites. Fluorescence of EGFP and FM dye was excited at 448 and 543 nm,respectively. Only the fluorescent puncta of FM4-64 with an area of ∼1.5× 1.5 μm2 were included in the analysis. During thetime-lapse imaging of fluorescence change, consecutive frames were acquired in5-s intervals, with constant PMT (800 v), HeNe G (12.1%), Gain (1.0), andOffset (0). After 10–20 s of steady-state recording, high K+solution (containing 10 μm 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and50 μm d(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopetanoic acid) waslocally perfused to destain FM4-64 dye. All data were acquired and analyzed byFluoview 500 software. Immunocytochemistry—24–48 h after transfection, thehippocampal cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in 0.1mm PBS) for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2%Triton X-100 for 10 min, and then washed three times with 0.01 mmPBS. The neurons were then pre-incubated with 10% bovine serum albumin(diluted in 0.1 mm PBS) for 1 h at room temperature to blocknonspecific binding with the primary antibody. Monoclonal antibody forsynaptophysin (Chemicon) was diluted (in 0.1 mm PBS) to 1:1000 andapplied to the culture plate. After incubation at 4 °C overnight, theneurons were washed again with PBS and incubated in the dark for 1 h withsecondary antibody, CY3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:600; JacksonImmunoResearch). Neurons were washed with PBS, mounted with anti-fade mountingmedium, and imaged. Small Interfering RNA Preparation and Transfection—To designa target-specific siRNA duplex, five sequences unique to SNAP-29 were selectedfrom the open reading frame of the rat SNAP-29 sequence and subcloned intopRNAT-H1.1/neo (GenScript), an siRNA expression vector containing a cGFP geneunder a separate promoter for tracking transfected neurons. Transfection ofsiRNA was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000. Following transfection, cellswere cultured for an additional 96 h before immunocytochemistry andelectrophysiological recordings. For studies in COS-7 cells, the SNAP-29-EGFPconstruct was co-transfected into COS-7 cells with either the siRNA expressionconstructs or vector backbone alone. The effect of siRNA on the expression ofheterologous SNAP-29-EGFP in COS-7 cells was assessed by immunoblot withlysates (10 μg of total proteins) from the cells harvested 4 days aftertransfection. Sequential blots with anti-GFP and β-tubulin antibodiesfrom the same membrane tracked the transfection efficiency and assured equalprotein loading in each gel lane. SNAP-29 Inhibits the Efficacy of Synaptic Transmission under RepetitiveStimulation at 0.1 Hz—To evaluate the effect of SNAP-29 on synaptictransmission, we first examined the distribution of SNAP-29-EGFP in culturedrat hippocampal neurons. Whereas SNAP-29-EGFP demonstrated a diffuse patternof green fluorescence in both soma and dendrites, it expressed as a punctatepattern along the axonal processes and co-localized with the synaptic vesiclemarker synaptophysin at synapses (Fig.1). The distribution profile of SNAP-29-EGFP is similar to that ofendogenous SNAP-29 in cultured hippocampal neurons(29Su Q. Mochida S. Tian J.H. Mehta R. Sheng Z.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14038-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating thatexogenously expressed SNAP-29-EGFP, like the endogenous protein, is targetedto and localized at synapses. We performed whole-cell dual patch clamp studies only on selected pairs ofneurons formed between SNAP-29-EGFP-transfected neurons, which show EGFPsignal within the cell body and long axonal processes, and untransfectedneurons, which lack EGFP signal (Fig.2A). Synaptic connections between the selected twoneurons were further confirmed by electrophysiological tests. Presynapticneurons transfected with SNAP-29-EGFP were repetitively stimulated for 15 minat 0.1 Hz. For all synapses tested (n = 9), amplitudes of the PSCsremained steady during the first 80 s (normalized mean PSC, 87 ± 3.7%,mean ± S.E.) and then decreased suddenly to about 60% of the initialamplitude. This low level was maintained throughout the period of recording(15 min) (Fig. 2, B andC). As a control, synapses formed by untransfected orEGFP vector-transfected neurons showed no significant reduction in theefficacy of transmission during the 15-min recording under stimulation at 0.1Hz (Fig. 2, B andC), suggesting that any effect on synaptic transmissionby the transfection procedure is unlikely. The reduced normalized mean PSCmeasured from the synapses of the SNAP-29-EGFP group (62 ± 4.3%) wassignificantly smaller than that of the EGFP group (94 ± 4.1%) anduntransfected group (108 ± 10.0%) (p < 0.01, Wilcoxonrank-sum test, SAS version 8.0) during the stimulation period from 120 to 240s and remained significant until the end of the 15-min recording(Fig. 2D). To assessthe possibility that SNAP-29 inhibited basal synaptic transmission, weaveraged postsynaptic currents recorded from 16 pairs of neurons transfectedwith SNAP-29-EGFP and 12 pairs of neurons transfected with EGFP vector at thesame developmental age (Fig.2E). There was no significant difference in PSCamplitudes (p > 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test)(Fig. 2F), suggestingthat overexpression of SNAP-29-EGFP in neurons does not affect the function ofthe basic release machinery. We next determined the density of release sites along axonal processes bymeans of FM dye staining. Presynaptic terminals were visualized with confocalmicroscope in axons, which can be identified easily in low density culturesafter low efficiency transfection with EGFP constructs(Fig. 1). All functionalpresynaptic terminals were loaded with the membrane-bound styryl dye FM4-64under stimulation with 90 mm KCl. The FM4-64-loaded release siteswere counted only if the FM4-64 puncta could be unloaded by anotherapplication of high KCl solution (Fig.3A) and co-localized with EGFP fluorescence along theaxons of transfected neurons (Fig.3B). The density of the FM dye-loaded synapses wasexpressed as the number of release sites per micrometer of axonal process. Atotal of 7175-μm length of axons was counted from 17 neurons expressingSNAP-29-EGFP and a total of 9821-μm length of axons was counted from 17neurons transfected with EGFP. Analysis by Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed thatthe density of FM dyeloaded release sites in neurons expressing SNAP-29-EGFP(0.12 ± 0.018/μm) is not significantly different from that inneurons transfected with EGFP (0.11 ± 0.019/μm; p >0.05, Fig. 3C). Toexclude any possibility that SNAP-29 affects the structural maintenance ofsynapses, we further determined the density of synapses by immunocytochemicalstaining of the synaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin after transfection(Fig. 3D). A total of10 neurons transfected with SNAP-29-EGFP and 13 neurons transfected with EGFPwere counted (Fig.3E). Our statistical analysis indicates that expressionof SNAP-29-EGFP has no significant effect on the density of either FMdye-loaded or synaptophysin-positive synapses along axons. Overexpression of SNAP-29 in Neurons Impairs Synaptic VesicleTurnover—One possible explanation for the effects of SNAP-29 onsynaptic transmission observed (Fig.2D) is interference with the recycling of synapticvesicles by SNAP-29 (34Galli T. Haucke V. Sci.STKE. 2001; 88: RE1Google Scholar). Wetested this possibility by delivering a set of stimulations to the transfectedpresynaptic neuron. A 20-Hz train of 80-mV, 2-ms stimuli was given for 500 ms,followed by a test stimuli (80 mV, 2 ms) after various intervals, to allow forvesicle retrieval (Fig.4A). Postsynaptic currents were rapidly depressed underthe train of high frequency stimulation. Recovery ability is expressed as the“recovery ratio” or the ratio of the PSC induced by the teststimulus to the PSC induced by the first stimulus of the 20-Hz train(Fig. 4, B andC). This provides an index for the efficiency of vesiclepool turnover. In the case of 5-s interval, both untransfected andEGFP-transfected synapses showed a complete recovery (99 ± 2.2%(n = 8) and 104 ± 3.4% (n = 7), respectively),whereas the recovery ratio for the SNAP-29-EGFP group was significantly lower(89 ± 1.3% (n = 9); p < 0.01). For all timeintervals (0.5, 1, and 3 s, p < 0.05; 5 s, p < 0.01)tested for recovery, neurons transfected with SNAP-29-EGFP exhibitedsignificantly impaired ability, as compared with the EGFP group, to retrievesynaptic vesicles after depletion (Fig.4C). However, given an extended time interval to 8 s, analmost complete recovery was observed in neurons transfected with SNAP-29-EGFP(98 ± 7.7%, n = 12), suggesting that the inhibitory role ofoverexpressed SNAP-29 in synaptic transmission could be fully rescued whenrecycling synaptic vesicles become available for future rounds of priming andfusion. The Effect of Overexpressed SNAP-29 Varies with Different Frequenciesof Synaptic Activity—Previous studies on synapses formed betweencultured SCGNs indicated that microinjection of SNAP-29 inhibited synaptictransmission in an activity-dependent manner, whereas the inhibition caused bySNAP-25 peptides was activity-independent(29Su Q. Mochida S. Tian J.H. Mehta R. Sheng Z.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14038-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These results suggestthat SNAP-29 has a role in modulating the recycling of synaptic vesicles orSNARE release machinery, rather than as a competitor with SNAP-25 for SNAREcomplex assembly. To address whether the effect of SNAP-29 on synaptictransmission in cultured hippocampal neurons is similarly activity-dependent,we applied various stimulation paradigms using different frequencies. We founda gradual reduction in PSC amplitudes under repetitive stimulations at 1 Hzfor 30 s in neurons transfected with SNAP-29-EGFP (n = 10)(Fig. 5A), which issimilar to that observed under 0.1-Hz stimulation. However, PSCs of theEGFP-transfected group remained constant under the 1-Hz train for 30 s(n = 10). In contrast, the inhibitory effect of SNAP-29 was absentunder 0.05-Hz repetitive stimulations (Fig.5B). When the last two (at 1 Hz) or five (at 0.05 Hz)PSCs were normalized with the initial two or five PSCs induced by thecorresponding repetitive stimuli, a significant difference was observedbetween the 1- and 0.05-Hz stimulations (p < 0.01) in the synapsespresynaptically transfected with SNAP-29-EGFP, but not in the synapsespresynaptically transfected with EGFP (p > 0.05)(Fig. 5, C andD). To determine the possible role of SNAP-29 in synaptic transmission underhigh frequency stimulation, we examined the effect of SNAP-29 on the responseto a 10-Hz, 2-s stimulation train. The ratio of PSC changes (mean initialperiod PSCs/mean late period PSCs) in both groups under 10-Hz stimulation wascalculated and plotted contemporarily with those under 1-, 0.1-, and 0.05-Hzstimulations (Fig.5E). Whereas the ratio of PSC changes was significantlydifferent between groups overexpressing SNAP-29 and EGFP under 1- and 0.1-Hzstimulation (p < 0.05), the ratio was similar under higher (10-Hz)or lower (0.05-Hz) repetitive firing. Taken together, our results on smallcentral synapses suggest that the effect of SNAP-29 on synaptic transmissionoccurs in an activity-dependent manner with a preferred frequency window forits inhibitory role. This inhibitory role likely occurs in a pattern morecomplicated than that we previously observed in synapses formed betweenSCGNs. Overexpression of SNAP-29 Does Not Change Vesicle ReleaseProbability—It has been hypothesized that the proteins regulatingthe formation of the SNARE core complex and release machinery in presynapticterminals modify short-term plasticity(25Rettig J. Neher E. Science. 2002; 298: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Vesicles with differentrelease probabilities may undergo fusion and recycling through differentmechanisms (35Gandhi S.P. Stevens C.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Our previousbiochemical studies demonstrated that SNAP-29 is involved in the disassemblyof the SNARE complex. Thus, examining any potential effect of SNAP-29 onvesicle release probability is of great interest. In contrast to low andmoderate frequency stimulation (Fig. 5,A and B), PSCs from synapses transfected witheither SNAP-29-EGFP or EGFP showed a similarly marked depression during 10-Hz,2-s repetitive stimulation (Fig. 6,A and B). No significant difference was observedin the inverted half-decay time between the two groups (p > 0.05,Fig. 6C), suggestingthat the kinetics of vesicle release under intense synaptic activity were notaffected by overexpression of SNAP-29. Furthermore, paired pulse test(36Stevens C.F. Wang Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 795-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) at different frequencies(5, 10, and 50 Hz) also showed similar depression tendency curves in synapsesformed by neurons transfected with SNAP-29-EGFP or EGFP control(Fig. 6D). To furtherconfirm our electrophysiological results, we next monitored synaptic vesiclefusion and measured the unloading kinetics of the styryl dye FM4-64(37Ryan T.A. Reuter H. Wendland B. Schweizer F.E. Tsien R.W. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) using confocalmicroscopy. All functional presynaptic terminals were loaded with FM4-64 understimulation with 90 mm KCl followed by unloading with the same highKCl solution (Fig.3A). T"
https://openalex.org/W2053894585,"We recently demonstrated that the chemokine CXCL16 is expressed in aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC) and induces ASMC adhesion and proliferation (Chandrasekar, B., Bysani, S., and Mummidi, S. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 3188–3196). Here we reort that interleukin (IL)-18 positively regulates CXCL16 transcription in rat ASMC. We characterized the cis-regulatory region of CXCL16 and identified a functional activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding motif. Deletion or mutation of this site attenuated IL-18-mediated CXCL16 promoter activity. Gel shift, supershift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed AP-1-dependent CXCL16 expression. CXCL16 promoter-reporter activity was increased by constitutively active c-Fos and c-Jun and decreased by dominant negative or antisense c-Fos and c-Jun. Src kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, Akt inhibitor, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125, antisense JNK and dominant negative MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1, IRAK4, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase expression all attenuated IL-18-mediated AP-1 binding and reporter activity, CXCL16 promoter-reporter activity, and CXCL16 expression. Thus IL-18 induced CXCL16 expression via a MyD88 → IRAK1-IRAK4-TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) → c-Src→ PI3K → Akt → JNK → AP-1 pathway. Importantly, IL-18 stimulated ASMC proliferation in a CXCL16-dependent manner. These data provide for the first time a mechanism of IL-18-mediated CXCL16 gene transcription and CXCL16-dependent ASMC proliferation and suggest a role for IL-18-CXCL16 cross-talk in atherogenesis and restenosis following angioplasty.

Most of the IL-18 effects in atherogenesis are thought to be mediated via the induction of IFN-γ (6Tenger C. Sundborger A. Jawien J. Zhou X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

It was recently reported that intraperitoneal administration of IL-18 can induce the expression of the chemokine CXCL16 in atherosclerotic lesions and spleens of SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency)/apoE null mice (6Tenger C. Sundborger A. Jawien J. Zhou X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CXCL16, a recently discovered transmembrane chemokine (11Matloubian M.

Unlike other members of this subgroup, it is structurally similar to CX3CL1 (fractalkine (13Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J.

As a transmembrane protein it acts as an adhesion molecule, and upon cleavage by ADAM10 (14Abel S. Hundhausen C. Mentlein R. Schulte A. Berkhout T.A. Broadway N. Hartmann D. Sedlacek R. Dietrich S.

It attracts CXC receptor 6 (CXCR6) expressing T, NK, and NKT cells to the sites of inflammation and injury (16Shashkin P. Simpson D. Mishin V. Chesnutt B. Ley K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Blood. 2002; 100: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). CXCL16 also functions as a scavenger receptor for phosphatidylserine and oxidized lipoprotein (hence, the name SR-PSOX (21Shimaoka T. Kume N. Minami M. Hayashida K. Kataoka H. Kita T. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40663-40666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar)). By enhancing the uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein, CXCL16 promotes foam cell formation. We recently demonstrated that CXCL16 induces SMC proliferation (22Chandrasekar B. Bysani S. Mummidi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3188-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). SMC proliferation is a hallmark of atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty (23McBride W. Lange R. Hillis L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 24Austin G.E. Ratliff N.B. Hollman J. Tabei S. Phillips D.F. J. Am. Coll.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (9909) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a positive correlation was shown between mutations in CXCL16 gene and the severity of coronary artery stenosis (27Lundberg G.A. Kellin A. Samnegard A. Lundman P. Tornvall P. Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Hamsten A. Hansson G.K. Eriksson P. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 257: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that CXCL16 may play a causal role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Taken together, these studies suggest that IL-18 may induce SMC proliferation through a CXCL16-mediated mechanism. In this study we tested this hypothesis directly and delineated the mechanisms by which IL-18 induces CXCL16 expression in SMC. IL-18 induced CXCL16 expression through an AP-1-dependent mechanism, and this induction involves MyD88, IRAK, TRAF6, c-Src, PI3K, Akt, and JNK. More importantly, IL-18 induced SMC proliferation in a CXCL16-dependent manner. IL-18-mediated CXCL16 expression was independent of the classical inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. These results ascribe a previously unrecognized role for IL-18 in SMC proliferation and suggest that IL-18 and CXCL16 cross-talk may lead to the amplification of an inflammatory cascade in vessel wall-promoting atherosclerosis. Cell Culture—Non-transformed rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC) were a generous gift from Dr. Sergei N. Orlov (University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada) and have been previously described (28Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). ASMC were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were passaged when confluent. For cytokine stimulation experiments, ASMC were grown until 70–80% confluent, then the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After overnight culture recombinant rat IL-18 (rrIL-18; #521-RL-025/CF, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added at the indicated doses and for the indicated time periods. Cytokine Stimulation—Recombinant IL-18 preparations contained <1.0 enzyme units/μg of endotoxin as determined by the LAL method (manufacturer's technical data sheet, R&D Systems). To determine any possible contribution of endotoxin to the IL-18-mediated effects, ASMC were treated simultaneously with 10 μg/ml polymyxin B (#P4932, Sigma). In the inhibition studies, before the addition of IL-18 ASMC were treated with either 100 nm wortmannin or 20 μm LY294002 for 1 h (PI3K inhibitors), 1 μm 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate for 1 h (Akt inhibitor), 1 μm 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1′-naphthyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP1), or 1 μm 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) for 30 min (selective inhibitors of the Src-family of tyrosine kinases), 1 μm 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP3) for 30 min (negative control for PP1 and PP2), and 20 μm anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one 1,9-pyrazoloanthrone (SP600125) for 30 min (JNK inhibitor). Control cells received the vehicle (Me2SO) alone. To determine whether p38 MAPK and ERK play a role in IL-18-mediated CXCL16 expression, ASMC were pretreated with 1 μm SB203580 for 30 min (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or 10 μm PD98059 for 1 h (ERK1/2 inhibitor) or Me2SO alone before the addition of IL-18 for 2 h. The above inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem and Axxora, LLC. (San Diego, CA). Antisense Oligonucleotide and siRNA Treatment—To determine whether IL-18-induced CXCL16 expression is a direct mechanism or is mediated via induction of IL-1β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ, ASMC were transfected with 10 μm phosphorothioated-modified antisense (AS) oligonucleotides (ODN (29Schroeder R.A. Gu J.S. Kuo P.C. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) for TNF-α (5′-CTG ACT GCC TGG GCC AGA GGG CTG ATT AG-3′; phosphorothioated on three nucleotides on each end of the molecule), IL-1β (5′-CAG GAT GAG GAC ATG AGC ACC-3′), or IFN-γ (5′-TAC TGC CAC GGC ACA GTC ATT GAA-3′) before the addition of IL-18. Transfections were carried out using the Oligofectamine™ reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After 16 h, cells were treated with IL-18 at the indicated times and doses. IFN-γ expression was also knocked down using 150 nm rat IFN-γ siRNAs (5′-GGC ACA CUC AUU GAA AGC Ctt; 5′-GGA CGG UAA CAC GAA AAU Att-3′; 5-GGA UGC AUU CAU GAG CAU Ctt-3′; Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). To verify whether release of preformed cytokines mediates IL-18-induced CXCL16 expression, ASMC were incubated with 5 μg/ml neutralizing antibodies to rat TNF-α (#AF-510-NA), IL-1β (#AF-501-NA), or IFN-γ (#AF-585-NA) (R&D Systems) 1 h before the addition of IL-18. Normal goat IgG served as a control. Efficacy of these neutralizing antibodies was verified as previously described in transient transfection assays using NF-κB (pNF-κB-Luc) and IFN-γ-activating sequence (pGAS-Luc) reporter constructs (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA (30Chandrasekar B. Vemula K. Surabhi R.M. Li-Weber M. Owen-Schaub L.B. Jensen L.E. Mummidi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20221-20233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)). The vector pEGFP-Luc served as a negative control. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated for 1 h with the neutralizing antibodies followed by the addition of respective recombinant proteins (100 pg/ml rrIL-1β, 100 pg/ml rrTNF-α, or 10 ng/ml rrIFN-γ). After 7 h of incubation, the cells were harvested for the dual-luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Akt1 and -2 expression was also targeted by siRNAs (Signal Silence™ Akt siRNA, #6211, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA (31Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Claycomb W.C. Mestril R. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4553-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). Sense siRNA (5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTdT-3′; #1022076, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) served as a negative control. Cell Death Assays—To investigate IL-18-induced apoptosis, ASMC were cultured in complete medium until ∼70% confluent. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. IL-18 was added at 25 ng/ml and incubated for 24 h. Cells were harvested, and the presence of mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasm was assayed by enzyme-linked immunoassay (Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit, Roche Applied Science (30Chandrasekar B.

As a positive control, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, #487910, EMD Biosciences, Inc., La Jolla, CA) was added to a final concentration of 500 μm for 24 h (28Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death was also analyzed using the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA). Floating cells were collected and added to the scraped adherent cells for the assay. Cells were counterstained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell Proliferation Assays—Cell proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation (31Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Claycomb W.C. Mestril R. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4553-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of CXCL16 in IL-18-mediated ASMC proliferation, ASMC were transfected as above with a mixture of CXCL16 siRNAs (5′-AGU UGC UAC UGU GAU CGU Att-3′, 5′-GUU UUC ACC ACC AAA AAC Att-3′, 5′-AAC CUC CAG A CA CAA GCA Ctt-3′) and incubated for 48 h before the addition of IL-18. 5′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′ RACE)—The 5′ ends of rat CXCL16 mRNA transcripts were determined by 5′ RACE using ASMC total RNA. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase to eliminate any genomic DNA contamination. We used the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to amplify complete CXCL16 transcripts following the manufacturer's instructions. Successive PCR was carried out using the rat CXCL16-specific antisense primers, 5′-TCA TCT GTC TGT CTG CTG GTT TGT-3′ and 5′-TTC CTC TGG CTC CAA GAT GCT TTC-3′, and the sense primers provided in the kit. The products of the second PCR amplification were gel-purified and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the nucleotide sequence of four independent clones was determined. Cloning of the 5′-Flanking Sequence of Rat CXCL16 and Vector Construction—A blast search of the GenBank™ data base identified rat CXCL16 gene sequences in GenBank™ (NW_047334). This contained in tandem the open reading frame of CXCL16 and the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) sequences that we identified by 5′-RACE. Approximately ∼1.2 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region of the gene was amplified from rat genomic DNA using the sense primer 5′-CTG ACA TAA GGA CTC AGG TCT CT-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TCA GTA GGA TCC AGT CAC ATG G-3′ and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector. A series of nested deletions was generated using the sense primers 5′-gag ctc GGA AAG TGG ATA TTT AGG GTT-3′, 5′-gag ctc AAA GGC TTG CTG AGA AAG GTA-3′, and 5′-gag ctc CAC AGC TCA TAA CTT CAG TGG-3′. All the sense primers contained a SacI restriction site at the 5′ end (lowercase). The antisense primer (5′-ctc gag TCA GTA GGA TCC AGT CAC ATG-3′) contained an XhoI restriction site. The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic reporter vector (Promega). The deletion construct S5 was generated by annealing sense (5′-gag ctc CAG TCC TGG GGA TTT GTT TGA CTG CTT CAC CTT GGC CAT GTG ACT GGA TCC TAC TGA ctc gag) and complimentary antisense oligonucleotides, digesting with SacI and XhoI, and inserting into pGL3-Basic. The 5′-flanking sequence of the CXCL16 gene was analyzed by MatInspector Professional® software to identify the potential binding sites for various transcription factors. The nucleotide sequences of the rat CXCL16 5′-flanking region and the mRNA have been deposited with the GenBank™ under the accession numbers DQ025527 and DQ025528, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutation of the AP-1 binding site in the S2 reporter vector construct was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), the sense primer 5′-ACAAAACTCAATGACTtgAATCCTAAAATGCG-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-CGCATTTTAGGATTcaAGTCATTAGTTTTGT-3′ (mutated nucleotides are in lowercase). Mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Cell Transfection and Reporter Assays—ASMC were transfected with 3 μg of the CXCL16 reporter constructs and 100 ng of the control Renilla luciferase vector pRL-TK (Promega) using Lipofectamine® (22Chandrasekar B.

After incubation for the indicated time periods, the cells were harvested for the dual-luciferase assay. Data were normalized by dividing firefly luciferase activity with that of the corresponding Renilla luciferase. The transfection efficiency of rat ASMC (∼32%) was determined using pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech (28Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)). All plasmids were purified using EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). To determine whether IL-18 induces AP-1 activation in ASMC, we used pAP-1-Luc (PathDetect® AP-1 Cis-reporting System, Stratagene), an inducible AP-1 reporter vector containing seven repeats of the AP-1 enhancer element. ASMC were co-transfected with pAP-1-Luc and pRL-TK and after 24 h of incubation were treated with the indicated dose of IL-18. pEGFP-Luc, a vector that encodes a fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein and luciferase under the regulation of the CMV promoter (Clontech) served as the control. In addition to the pharmacological inhibitors described above, ASMCs were transfected with rat MyD88 siRNA (siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA, #M-099508-00, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), dominant negative (dn) IRAK1 in pCI-Neo, dnIRAK4 (1–191) in pcDNA4/HisMaxC (Invitrogen), dnTRAF6 in pRK5 (TRAF6-(289–522)-FLAG), and dnPI3K in pcDNA3 as described previously (30Chandrasekar B.

The corresponding empty vectors served as controls. Inhibition of JNK activation was also achieved by treating ASMC with antisense oligonucleotides against JNK1 (5′-CTC TCT GTA GGC CCG CTT GG-3′) and JNK2 (5′-GTC CGG GCC AGG CCA AAG TC-3′). Scrambled sequences (JNK1, 5′-CTT TCC GTT GAA CCC CTG GG-3′) and JNK2 (5′-GTG CGC GCG AGC CCG AAA TC-3′) served as controls (32Potapova O. Gorospe M. Bost F. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24767-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of c-Fos and c-Jun was achieved by transfecting cells with constitutively active c-Fos or c-Jun expression vectors (33Okada S. Obata S. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pcDNA3 served as a control. Expression of c-Fos was inhibited by transfecting the cells with dn-c-Fos in CMV500 (a kind gift from Dr. C. Vinson, Laboratory of Metabolism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). CMV500 served as a control. Expression of c-Fos was also inhibited by treating the cells with phosphorothioated c-Fos antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (5′-GAA CAT CAT GGT CGT-3′ (34Quercia S. Chang S.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 209: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)). Sense (5′-ACG ACC ATG ATG TTC-3′) as well as scrambled mismatched oligonucleotides (5′-TGC TGG TAC TAC AAG-3′) served as controls. c-Jun expression was also targeted using phosphorothioated c-jun-specific antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CGT TTC CAT CTT TGC AGT-3′ (35Zhang S. Liu J. MacGibbon G. Dragunow M. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)). Sense oligonucleotides (5′-ACT GCA AAG ATG GAA ACG-3′) served as controls.

Supershift EMSA was performed as above, except that the nuclear extracts were preincubated for 1 h with 1 μg of rabbit antibodies to either c-Jun (sc-45X), c-Fos (sc-52X), JunB (sc-46X), or JunD (sc-74X) (TransCruz Gel Supershift reagents; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Isotype-matched rabbit polyclonal antibodies served as controls. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ASMC were cultured in complete medium in 100-mm dishes until ∼70% confluent. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated overnight. IL-18 was added at the indicated dose and incubated for 1 h. The cells were then fixed by the addition of 280 μl of 37% formaldehyde (Sigma) to 10 ml of culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C, harvested, and processed for immunoprecipitation using a commercially available kit (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay kit, #17-295; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and following the manufacturer's protocol. Immune complexes were eluted, reverse cross-linked using 5 m NaCl, and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. Ethanol-precipitated DNA pellets were redissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer. The supernatant of an immunoprecipitation reaction carried out in the absence of c-Fos antibody was purified and used for the total input DNA control. The supernatant DNA was diluted 1:100 before PCR analysis. PCR was carried out on 1 μl of each sample using sense primer, 5′-CTT GAG GTA AGA TCT ACA TAG GAA-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CAA ATT TAC CTT TCT CAG CAA-3′, which amplified a 239-bp segment of the rat CXCL16 gene from –1094 to –845 relative to the transcription start site.

https://openalex.org/W2134647594,"Cellular glycosphingolipid (GSL) storage is known to promote cholesterol accumulation. Although physical interactions between GSLs and cholesterol are thought to cause intracellular cholesterol “trapping,” it is not known whether cholesterol homeostatic mechanisms are also impaired under these conditions. ApoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) is a key regulator of cellular cholesterol balance. Here, we show that apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux was inhibited (by up to 53% over 8 h) when fibroblasts were treated with lactosylceramide or the glucocerebrosidase inhibitor conduritol B epoxide. Furthermore, apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts derived from patients with genetic GSL storage diseases (Fabry disease, Sandhoff disease, and GM1 gangliosidosis) was impaired compared with control cells. Conversely, apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts and cholesterol-loaded macrophage foam cells was dose-dependently stimulated (by up to 6-fold over 8 h) by the GSL synthesis inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP). Unexpectedly, a structurally unrelated GSL synthesis inhibitor, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, was unable to stimulate apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux despite achieving similar GSL depletion. PDMP was found to up-regulate ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression, thereby identifying a contributing mechanism for the observed acceleration of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. This study reveals a novel defect in cellular cholesterol homeostasis induced by GSL storage and identifies PDMP as a new agent for enhancing cholesterol efflux via the ABCA1/apoA-I pathway.

Conversely, apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts and cholesterol-loaded macrophage foam cells was dose-dependently stimulated (by up to 6-fold over 8 h) by the GSL synthesis inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP). Unexpectedly, a structurally unrelated GSL synthesis inhibitor, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, was unable to stimulate apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux despite achieving similar GSL depletion. PDMP was found to up-regulate ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression, thereby identifying a contributing mechanism for the observed acceleration of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. This study reveals a novel defect in cellular cholesterol homeostasis induced by GSL storage and identifies PDMP as a new agent for enhancing cholesterol efflux via the ABCA1/apoA-I pathway. Previous work has established that cellular cholesterol trafficking and storage are linked to glycosphingolipid (GSL) 1The abbreviations used are: GSL, glycosphingolipid; SLSD, sphingolipid storage disease; LacCer, lactosylceramide; CBE, conduritol B epoxide; DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; LDL, low density lipoprotein; PDMP, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol; NB-DNJ, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin; HDL, high density lipoprotein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; MDM, monocyte-derived macrophage; acLDL, acetylated low density lipoprotein; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PLVs, phospholipid vesicles; MBCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B, type I; CTxB, cholera toxin B; SM, sphingomyelin; LXRα, liver X receptor-α; GM1, Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4[NeuNAc2-3]Galβ1-4Glc-Cer; GM2, GalNAcβ1-4[NeuNAc2-3]Galβ1-4Glc-Cer; GM3, NeuNAc2-3Galβ1-4Glc-Cer. metabolism (1Puri V.

A clear example of this relationship is the demonstration that the cellular GSL storage detected in fibroblasts derived from patients with a variety of sphingolipid storage diseases (SLSDs) is accompanied by accumulation of endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol (1Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in human macrophage foam cells and fibroblasts indicated that GSL accumulation induced either by exogenously added lactosylceramide (LacCer) or by the glucocerebrosidase inhibitor conduritol B epoxide (CBE) results in concomitant accumulation of cholesterol (2Garner B.

The factors that control the accumulation of cholesterol with GSLs remain to be identified. Puri et al. (1Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat.

Although the endosomal/lysosomal location of GSL and cholesterol in SLSDs is well known, it is becoming increasingly clear that cellular membrane composition is also altered when lysosomal storage of GSL/cholesterol occurs. Recent detailed studies by te Vruchte et al. (5te Vruchte D. Lloyd-Evans E. Veldman R.J. Neville D.C. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. van Blitterswijk W.J. Sillence D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26167-26175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) revealed that the accumulation of both GSL and cholesterol in ordered lipid microdomains commonly referred to as lipid rafts or, because of their relative resistance to detergent solubilization, detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs) may contribute directly to lysosomal accumulation by altering endosomal transport pathways. These observations are consistent with previous proposals that alterations to membrane DRM structure could contribute to sphingolipidosis (6Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20961-20970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is not known to what extent other pathways that regulate cellular cholesterol homeostasis are affected by GSL storage. Previous work has suggested that cholesterol that accumulates as a result of GSL storage may not be available to the sensing pathways that normally control intracellular cholesterol balance. Specifically, we have shown that macrophages induced to store cholesterol by treatment with LacCer or CBE down-regulate their apoE secretion (2Garner B. Mellor H.R. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the predicted up-regulation of apoE secretion in response to cholesterol loading (9Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J. Joseph S.B. Wilpitz D.C. Kast H.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Similarly, Puri et al. (4Puri V. Jefferson J.R. Singh R.D. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20961-20970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression is up-regulated when fibroblasts accumulate cholesterol as a consequence of LacCer treatment, again in contrast to the response predicted by Brown and Goldstein (10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1975; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The pathways that contribute to GSL-induced cellular cholesterol accumulation clearly require further study. A key pathway regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis relies on the apoA-I-mediated efflux of cholesterol from cells via ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) (11Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Cells from patients with genetic defects in ABCA1 leading to Tangier disease exhibit impaired cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and increased cellular cholesterol accumulation (12Bodzioch M. Orso E. Klucken J. Langmann T. Bottcher A. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Barlage S. Buchler C. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Kaminski W.E. Hahmann H.W. Oette K. Rothe G. Aslanidis C. Lackner K.J. Schmitz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that cellular GSL storage promotes cholesterol accumulation, it is not known whether alterations in the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux pathway are affected by GSL status. In this study, we therefore examined the impact of cellular GSL accumulation or depletion on apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. Materials—[1,2-3H]Cholesterol and [methyl-3H]choline chloride (specific activities of 44 and 79 Ci/mmol, respectively) were from Amersham Biosciences. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), and CBE were from Sigma. LacCer was from Calbiochem. Human apoA-I was isolated from human high density lipoprotein (HDL) by ultracentrifugation and anion exchange chromatography (13Kockx M. Rye K.A. Gaus K. Quinn C.M.

Cell Culture—Human foreskin fibroblasts from a “control” subject and patients with GM1 gangliosidosis, Sandhoff disease, and Fabry disease (cell line identification numbers AG01518, GM10919, GM00203A, and GM004390, respectively) were obtained at passages 4–8 from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ) and grown under standard culture conditions at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin G, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were subcultivated by trypsinization at a 1:4 ratio and transferred to 35-mm plastic Petri dishes (Costar) for use in experiments. Fibroblasts were routinely used from passages 14 to 20. Human monocytes were isolated from donor buffy coats using Ficoll-Paque as described previously (14Garner B. Li W. Roberg K. Brunk U.T. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 27: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Monocytes were allowed to differentiate into macrophages for 1 week in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin as above before further treatments. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Lipoprotein Preparation—LDL was isolated from normolipidemic plasma of 12-h fasted healthy subjects by ultracentrifugation (15Garner B. Dean R.T. Jessup W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After purification, LDL was acetylated using an established method (16Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using HPLC methods, we have shown that this protocol results in an approximate doubling of cellular LacCer levels (2Garner B. Mellor H.R. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These compounds were added to cells in complete growth medium containing 10% (v/v) serum except where MDMs were also loaded with acLDL, in which case 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-depleted serum was used. Cholesterol and Phospholipid Efflux Assays—Cells were labeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 72 h as described (13Kockx M. Rye K.A. Gaus K. Quinn C.M. Wright J. Sloane T. Sviridov D. Fu Y.

[3H]Cholesterol labeling was initiated when fibroblasts were 60% confluent or after 7 days differentiation for MDMs. Cells were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) to allow equilibration of [3H]cholesterol in all cellular pools. Equilibrated [3H]cholesterol-labeled cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 2 ml of efflux medium containing either DMEM (fibroblasts) or RPMI 1640 medium (MDMs) and 0.1% BSA with or without 25 μg/ml apoA-I. Where indicated, efflux was also assessed using phospholipid vesicles (PLVs; 200 mg/ml total phospholipid), prepared using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine and repeated sonication and extrusion as described previously (18Johnson W.J.

At the times specified (up to 8 h), 50-ml aliquots of the media were removed and analyzed by scintillation counting. A similar approach was used to measure 3H-phospholipid efflux after labeling with [3H]choline as described previously (13Kockx M. Rye K.A. Gaus K. Quinn C.M. Wright J. Sloane T. Sviridov D. Fu Y.

Directly after equilibration, replicate wells were harvested in 800 μl of 0.2 m NaOH, and samples were analyzed by scintillation counting either directly (for cholesterol) or after removal of choline (for phospholipids) (13Kockx M.

These cell lysates served as a check for the effect of the various treatments on [3H]cholesterol and 3H-phospholipid loading/labeling and were used to calculate lipid efflux to the medium as a percentage of total counts present at t = 0 h. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Analysis of ABCA1 Expression by Western Blotting and Real-time PCR—Fibroblast ABCA1 expression was measured by Western blotting and real-time PCR (20Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Quinn C.M. Kagedal K. Terman A. Stroikin U. Brunk U.T. Jessup W. Garner B. Biochem.

Samples were separated on SDS-7% polyacrylamide gels using a Mini-PROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad) and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Loading equivalence and transfer efficiency were monitored by Ponceau S staining. The membranes were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human ABCA1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Novus Biologicals), followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (catalog no. P0448, Dako Corp.). Where indicated, the blots were stripped and reprobed using goat anti-human β-actin polyclonal antibody (1: 1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences); the membranes were exposed to Fuji x-ray film, developed, and scanned; and signal intensity was quantified using NIH Image software. Cells were also harvested for total RNA using TriReagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that 1-bromo-3-chloropropane was substituted for chloroform. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an ABI 7700 sequence detector and analyzed using ABI PRISM sequence detector software (Version 1.6.3, PE Biosystems). IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions using gene-specific primers for ABCA1 (forward, 5′-GCACTGAGGAAGATGCTGAAA-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGTTCCTGGAAGGTCTTGTTCAC-3′), with annealing at 60 °C normalized to that of a housekeeping gene, porphobilinogen deaminase (forward, 5′-GAGTGATTCGCGTGGGTACC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGCTCCGATGGTGAAGCC-3′), with annealing at 55–60 °C (21Quinn C.M.

Melting curve analysis was performed to confirm production of a single product in these reactions. Cell-surface Biotinylation—Cell-surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (22Witting S.R. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40121-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, fibroblast cells were grown in 10-cm diameter Petri dishes to confluency. They were washed with ice-cold PBS and treated with 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C on a platform mixer. The biotinylation treatment was stopped with two washes of ice-cold quench buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl), followed by a wash with ice-cold PBS. Cells were collected by scraping, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and left on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, mixed with 100 μl of UltraLink-immobilized NeutrAvidin gel (Pierce), and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a platform mixer. The gel was pelleted by centrifugation and washed five times with lysis buffer. 55 μl of loading dye (60 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 350 mm mercaptoethanol) was added to the pellet, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The resulting protein sample was analyzed by Western blotting for ABCA1 (as described above) or for scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) using a rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Novus Biologicals) that cross-reacts with human SR-BI. Cellular GSL Expression—The GSL profiles of fibroblasts were analyzed as described previously (2Garner B. Mellor H.R. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Briefly, cells grown to confluency in 75-cm2 flasks were rinsed three times with PBS and extracted in 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol. The GSL fractions were isolated by silicic acid chromatography, and the glycan moiety was released by ceramide glycanase addition (23Wing D.R. Garner B. Hunnam V. Reinkensmeier G. Andersson U. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The GSL glycans were then fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzamide and analyzed by normal phase HPLC as described previously (24Garner B. Merry A.H. Royle L. Harvey D.J. Rudd P.M. Thillet J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22200-22208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Glycan peaks was identified by calculation of glucose units, derived from a partially hydrolyzed dextran standard, and comparison with previously published glucose units (2Garner B. Mellor H.R.

Cell-surface GSL expression levels were assessed by measuring the binding of fluorescently labeled cholera toxin B (CTxB) to cell-surface GM1 (10 min at 4 °C). Alexa Fluor 448-conjugated CTxB (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled cells were rinsed five times with PBS and lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and a 200-ml aliquot was analyzed at Ex485 nm/Em530 nm in a CytoFluor multiwell plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). Other Methods—The cellular content of detergent-insoluble cholesterol was analyzed as described previously (3Sillence D.J. Puri V. Marks D.L. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Pagano R.E. Platt F.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Ledesma M.D. Brugger B. Bunning C. Wieland F.T. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1761-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol and equilibrated as described above. The cells were then cooled on ice and extracted in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were carefully removed from the insoluble pellets. The pellets were then dissolved in 0.2 m NaOH, and aliquots of the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by scintillation counting to calculate the proportion of cholesterol in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Estimation of cellular acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was achieved by analyzing the proportion of esterified [3H]cholesterol present as a percentage of the total cellular [3H]cholesterol by thin-layer chromatography to separate cholesterol from cholesterol esters in 1:1 (v/v) heptane/ethyl acetate. Standards of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters were identified by charring at 100 °C in 10% CuSO4 and 8.5% H3PO4. Protein concentrations were calculated using the bicinchoninic acid assay and BSA as a standard (Sigma). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed t test for unpaired data. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. LacCer, CBE, and SLSDs Inhibit Cholesterol Efflux to ApoA-I—Previous studies have shown that fibroblasts derived from patients with SLSDs accumulate GSL and cholesterol (1Puri V. Watanabe R.

This accumulation of cholesterol with GSL storage can be reproduced in vitro by treating cells with LacCer or the glucocerebrosidase inhibitor CBE (2Garner B. Mellor H.R. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A.

Here, we investigated the impact of such treatments on the ability of fibroblasts to efflux cholesterol to apoA-I, as this is a key regulator of cholesterol homeostasis (26Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of human fibroblasts with 40 mm LacCer inhibited apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux while having no effect on the low levels of basal efflux observed in the presence of albumin (Fig. 1A). At the 8-h time point, apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux was inhibited by 40% (8.9 ± 0.3% versus 5.3 ± 0.5%, mean ± S.E., n = 3; p < 0.05). Increasing the LacCer concentration to 70 μm resulted in a further 13% reduction in apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux at 8 h. 2W. S. Kim, E. N. Glaros, C. M. Quinn, W. Jessup, and B.

https://openalex.org/W2071109113,"Abstract The peptide hormone angiotensin II (AngII) binds to the AT1 (angiotensin type 1) receptor within the transmembrane domains in an extended conformation, and its C-terminal residue interacts with transmembrane domain VII at Phe-293/Asn-294. The molecular environment of this binding pocket remains to be elucidated. The preferential binding of benzophenone photolabels to methionine residues in the target structure has enabled us to design an experimental approach called the methionine proximity assay, which is based on systematic mutagenesis and photolabeling to determine the molecular environment of this binding pocket. A series of 44 transmembrane domain III, VI, and VII X → Met mutants photolabeled either with 125I-[Sar1,p′-benzoyl-l-Phe8]AngII or with 125I-[Sar1,p″-methoxy-p′-benzoyl-l-Phe8]AngII were purified and digested with cyanogen bromide. Several mutants produced digestion patterns different from that observed with wild type human AT1, indicating that they had a new receptor contact with position 8 of AngII. The following residues form this binding pocket: L112M and Y113M in transmembrane domain (TMD) III; F249M, W253M, H256M, and T260M in TMD VI; and F293M, N294M, N295M, C296M, and L297M in TMD VII. Homology modeling and incorporation of these contacts allowed us to develop an evidence-based molecular model of interactions with human AT1 that is very similar to the rhodopsin-retinal interaction."

In the first step, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase activates glutamate by ligating it to tRNAGlu (UUC) (6Huang D-D. Wang W.-Y. Gough S.P. Kannangara C.G.

Nature. 1986; 322: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This step of ALA production is identical to glutamate activation for protein biosynthesis (8O'Neill G.P. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the next step, the activated glutamate is converted to glutamate 1-semialdehyde (GSA) by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GTR) in a NADPH-dependent reaction (9Kannangara C.G. Gough S.P. Oliver R.P. Rasmussen S.K. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1984; 49: 417-437Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This process probably involves transfer of the glutamate moiety to the active site Cys of GTR before reduction of the carboxyl group. In the final step, GSA is rearranged to ALA by glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (GSAT) (10Hoober J.K. Kahn A. Ash D.E. Gough S. Kannangara C.G. Carlsberg Res.

Comm. 1989; 54: 99-108Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This instability could lead to degradation of the intermediate as well as the generation of toxic products within the cells. One way of minimizing the exposure of an unstable biochemical intermediate to the intracellular medium, and also to minimize the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, is to physically channel the intermediate from one enzyme to the next through specific protein-protein interactions (12Geck M.K. Kirsh J.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8032-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Computer-aided modeling, based on x-ray crystallographic structures of GTR from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri and GSAT from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. 6301, has been used to predict that the two enzymes could interact to facilitate channeling of GSA (13Moser J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).In this study, we investigated interactions between GTR and GSAT using purified recombinant enzymes from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and specific polyclonal antibodies against each protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and sucrose gradient centrifugation results provided in vitro evidence that GTR and GSAT form a complex. In vivo cross-linking results indicate the existence of a high molecular mass complex in C. reinhardtii cells that contains both GTR and GSAT. Kinetic results showing that inactive mutant GSAT inhibits ALA formation from glutamyl-tRNA in assays containing GTR and wild-type GSAT support the conclusion that GSA is channeled between GTR and GSAT. Additional evidence for specific interaction between the two enzymes is that GSAT specifically stimulates glutamyl-tRNA-dependent NADPH oxidation catalyzed by GTR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESC. reinhardtii Enzymes and Antibodies to the Enzymes—A full-length cDNA clone encoding GSAT was previously isolated and cloned into pBSIISK+ plasmid (14Matters G.L. Beale S.I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The GSAT open reading frame without the predicted 30-residue transit peptide (14Matters G.L. Beale S.I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was recloned into expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using the BamHI and SacI restriction sites and transformed into an Escherichia coli expression host SG13009 (pREP4) (Qiagen). Expression of recombinant GSAT containing N-terminal His6 tag was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. The product was purified under native conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). GSAT protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA using 50 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The purified GSAT was used for generation of polyclonal anti-GSAT antibodies (Animal Pharm Services, Cloverdale, CA).A catalytically active expression construct of GTR corresponding to the open reading frame encoded by exon 2 of the GTR gene and containing a C-terminal His6 tag was previously described (15Srivastava A. Lake V. Nogaj L.A. Mayer S.M. Willows R.D. Beale S.I. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of this construct was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 15 h at 26 °C. The product was purified under native conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose and used for the generation of polyclonal anti-GTR antibodies as described above for GSAT (Animal Pharm Services).Site-directed Mutagenesis of GTR—The conserved active site cysteine residue occurs at position 48 in C. reinhardtii GTR (13Moser J.

This residue was replaced with an alanine residue by PCR, using 5′-GGTGCTGTCGACGGCCAATCGCATGGAGC-3′ and its complement as forward and reverse primers and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR products were transformed into E. coli expression strain SG13009 pREP4. The K273A GSAT was sequenced, overexpressed, and purified using Ni-NTA as described.

This residue was replaced with an alanine residue by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using 5′-CCACCATGGGCGCGGTCATTGGTGGCGG-3′ and its complement as forward and reverse primers and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The PCR products were handled as described above.Co-immunoprecipitation—Purified GTR and GSAT proteins were incubated with anti-GTR or anti-GSAT antibodies in 0.5 ml of reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (w/v) glycerol) for 3 h at 4 °C in silicone-coated 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (USA Scientific, Ocala, FL). After addition of 20 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma), the proteins were incubated for an additional 1 h as described (18Kim W.J. Lee H. Park E.J. Park J.K. Park S.D.

The immunocomplexes were precipitated and washed with ice-cold reaction buffer three times, resuspended in loading buffer, and resolved on SDS-PAGE. Protein complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting.Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Recombinant GTR and GSAT proteins were sedimented through a 5-ml continuous 15–35% (w/v) sucrose gradient formed in 50 mm Tricine, pH 7.9, 15 mm MgCl2. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 22 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated by puncturing the centrifuge tubes at the bottom and collecting 0.2-ml fractions. Molecular mass standard proteins (MW-GF-200; Sigma) were co-sedimented on identical gradients during each centrifugation. Proteins in gradient fractions were measured by a dye binding assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar).In Vivo Cross-linking—C. reinhardtii CC124 cells grown in continuous light were used. Small aliquots (1 ml) of cell suspension were centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in assay buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 7.9, 1 m glycerol, 15 mm MgCl2) containing various concentrations of glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature with constant mixing. Cross-linking reactions were stopped by repeated centrifuging and resuspending the cells in ice-cold assay buffer. After the final wash, cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in 50 mm Na2CO3, and the proteins were resolved on a 6% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel. Cross-linked proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-GTR and anti-GSAT antibodies.Determination of GSAT Activity—GSAT was incubated in 0.5 ml of assay buffer supplemented with 2 mm GSA, synthesized as described (11Gough S.P. Kannangara C.G. Bock K. Carlsberg Res. Comm. 1989; 54: 99-108Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), 5 mm levulinic acid, 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and 20 mm pyridoxal-P, for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were started by adding GSA from a concentrated acidic stock solution. The reaction was stopped by adding, with mixing, 25 μl of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min on ice. The chilled mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was decanted into 150 μl of Na3PO4. ALA was converted to ALA-pyrrole by adding 25 μl of ethyl acetoacetate and mixing, heating the solution at 100 °C for 10 min, and then cooling on ice. An equal volume of freshly made Ehrlich-Hg reagent (21Urata G. Granick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the cooled solution, with mixing. ALA (as the Ehrlich salt of ALA-pyrrole) was determined by measuring the A553 with a Cary 213 spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and using ϵ553 = 7.2 × 104 m–1 (22Mauzerall D. Granick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 435-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of GTR Activity by ALA Formation—GTR activity was assayed as ALA formation from glutamyl-tRNA (generated in situ) in a coupled enzyme assay carried out in 96-well microtiter plates in 0.1 ml of assay buffer supplemented with 40 μg of purified recombinant C. reinhardtii GSAT, 80 units of E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Sigma), 0.01 units of E. coli tRNAGlu (Sigma), 5 mm ATP, 5 mm levulinic acid, 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm pyridoxal-P. Reactions were started by adding tRNA. The assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped and ALA was determined as described above for GSAT but scaled down 5-fold. Light absorption was measured on a VMax Kinetic microplate reader driven by SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The light absorption was measured at 562 nm, which was as close to the 553-nm absorption maximum as the instrument could attain. From the absorption spectrum of a solution of the Ehrlich salt of ALA-pyrrole and the published ϵ553 = 7.2 × 104 m–1 (22Mauzerall D. Granick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 435-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a value of ϵ562 = 5.8 × 104 m–1 was calculated.Determination of GTR Activity by NADPH Oxidation—GTR activity was assayed as glutamyl-tRNA-dependent NADPH oxidation in 0.5 ml of assay buffer supplemented with 400 units of E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, 0.04 units of E. coli tRNAGlu, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm levulinic acid, 1 mm glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm pyridoxal-P. The reaction mixture was preincubated for 5 min at room temperature to generate glutamyl-tRNA. The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μl of 10 mm NADPH. The NADPH concentration was determined every 30 s for 15 min by measuring the A340 using an HP5402 diode-array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA).RESULTSCo-immunoprecipitation of GTR and GSAT—Specific polyclonal antibodies against recombinant C. reinhardtii GTR and GSAT were used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Each antibody was able to precipitate both proteins when added to mixtures of GTR and GSAT (Fig. 2). Neither antibody precipitated the noncognate protein when the cognate protein was absent, and the GTR-GSAT protein mixture was not precipitated in the absence of antibody.Fig. 2Co-immunoprecipitation of GTR and GSAT.

Linear regression interpolation from the sedimentation data indicated an apparent native molecular mass of 101 kDa for GTR and 124 kDa for GSAT. Although these values differ somewhat from the calculated molecular masses of native dimeric GTR (105 kDa) and dimeric GSAT (92 kDa), it is clear that both proteins sediment as dimers rather than monomers or higher multimers. When GTR and GSAT were preincubated together before sucrose gradient sedimentation, both proteins sedimented to a position corresponding to a molecular mass of 173 kDa. The calculated molecular mass for a 1:1 complex of native GTR and GSAT dimers is 197 kDa. These results indicate that native GTR and GSAT form a 1:1 complex of native dimers that is stable to sedimentation.Fig. 3Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Recombinant GTR and GSAT proteins were incubated separately or together in an assay buffer supplemented with pyridoxal-P and dithiothreitol and subjected to sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the punctured bottoms of the centrifuge tubes, and their protein content was determined by a dye binding assay. A, elution profiles are shown for GTR (circles), GSAT (squares), and the mixture of GTR and GSAT (triangles). B, peak elution volumes are shown for GTR (circle), GSAT (square), the mixture of GTR and GSAT (triangle), and the reference proteins (X), which were carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa). The values shown are averages for six replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GTR and GSAT Are Part of a Large Complex in Vivo—C. reinhardtii cells grown in continuous light were treated with varying concentrations of glutaraldehyde. Immunoblots show that as the glutaraldehyde concentration was increased, bands corresponding to GTR and GSAT subunit polypeptides disappeared (Fig. 4). At increasingly higher glutaraldehyde concentrations, there was increasing intensity of a band that reacted to both anti-GTR and anti-GSAT at a molecular mass >200 kDa. On immunoblots that were simultaneously probed with both anti-GTR and anti-GSAT antibodies, a single band was observed at the position that corresponded to the >200-kDa band observed in the blots that were probed with the individual antibodies. A weak band was observed in untreated control samples at a position just below that of the glutaraldehyde-induced >200-kDa band, but this band disappeared at higher glutaraldehyde concentrations as the >200-kDa band appeared. This band was also observed on Coomassie Blue-stained gels (data not shown) and is likely because of an abundant protein that reacts nonspecifically with the antibodies. A prominent 130-kDa band was visible in all lanes of all blots and is of unknown cause, but it is unlikely to be attributable to a GTR·GSAT complex because it was also observed in control samples that were not treated with glutaraldehyde. It should be noted that in this experiment in which whole cells were treated with glutaraldehyde, most of the proteins would be expected to be cross-linked nonspecifically and most of the cross-linked products would appear as smears of undefined molecular mass or be lost from the analysis as large insoluble aggregates. Therefore, the discrete bands observed on the immunoblots should be considered to represent only the small fraction of the total proteins that reacted specifically.Fig. 4In vivo cross-linking of C. reinhardtii cells. Cells were grown in continuous light. Culture aliquots (1 ml) were centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in various concentrations of glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with ice-cold assay buffer and lysed in 50 mm Na2CO3, and the proteins were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE. Cross-linked proteins were detected by immunoblot with either anti-GSAT antibody, anti-GTR antibody, or both antibodies as indicated. The glutaraldehyde concentrations were: lane 1, 0%; lane 2, 0.01%; lane 3, 0.03%; lane 4, 0.05%; lane 5, 0.10%; and lane 6, 0.20% (all w/v). On the left is an identical SDS-PAGE gel containing marker proteins of the indicated molecular mass in kDa, stained with Coomassie Blue.

This difference suggests that there is a greater molar abundance of GSAT over GTR in the cells and is consistent with relative abundance results obtained from quantitative immunoblots (data not shown).The >200-kDa molecular mass band that contained GTR and GSAT was probed for the presence of two other proteins. FLP is a C. reinhardtii membrane-associated protein that interacts with GTR in vitro (23Falciatore A. Merendino L. Barneche F. Ceol M. Meskauskiene R. Apel K. Rochaix J-D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana protein FLU that is a negative regulator of ALA synthesis (24Meskauskiene R. Apel K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Meskauskiene R. Nater M. Goslings D. Kessler F. op den Camp R. Apel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12826-12831Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii chloroplast-specific glutamyl-tRNA synthetase has been reported to form a complex with GTR in vitro under certain conditions (26Jahn D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of extracts from control and glutaraldehyde-treated cells were probed with antibodies to C. reinhardtii FLP and to barley chloroplast glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (27Bruyant P. Kannangara C.G. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1987; 52: 99-109Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FLP and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase were both detected in whole cell extracts of control incubations, but neither was detected in the >200-kDa band that contained GTR and GSAT in extracts of glutaraldehyde-treated cells (data not shown).GSAT Stimulates NADPH Oxidation by GTR—Because the GTR reaction involves oxidation of NADPH, it is possible to measure GTR activity in a NADPH oxidation assay that does not depend on the conversion of the reaction product, GSA, to ALA by GSAT. NADPH was slowly oxidized in the absence of any enzyme (Fig. 5). The same low background level of NADPH oxidation was observed when wild-type or K273A GSAT was added to assay mixtures in the absence of GTR. In assay mixtures containing GTR but without GSAT, the rate of NADPH oxidation was approximately twice the background level; this rate difference over the background rate was constant over the 15-min assay time. Addition of either wild-type or K273A GSAT to assay mixtures containing GTR stimulated NADPH oxidation ∼2.5-fold over the level in the presence of GTR alone. In complete assay mixtures containing inactive C48R GTR instead of wild-type GTR, only background levels of NADPH oxidation occurred. In control experiments, in assay mixtures containing GTR and GSAT but with glutamate omitted, there was very little NADPH oxidation. Assay mixtures with tRNA omitted had a slight increase in NADPH oxidation rate above the background level. However, addition of RNase A to the reaction mixture brought the NADPH oxidation rate to background level. Therefore, this increase of NADPH oxidation rate by GTR in the absence of tRNA suggests that some tRNA co-purified with GTR and that this tRNA could sustain a low rate of NADPH oxidizing activity. The ability of GSAT to stimulate GTR activity supports the hypothesis that the two enzymes interact during catalysis.Fig. 5Effect of GSAT on GTR activity as measured by the rate of glutamyl-tRNA-dependent NADPH oxidation. A, the time course is shown for the change in A340 of unsupplemented assay mixture (diamonds) and assay mixtures supplemented with GTR alone (squares) or with GTR plus wild-type (triangles) or inactive K273A (circles) GSAT. B, the change in A340 is shown between 0 and 900 s for assay mixtures containing the indicated additions or omissions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GTR Does Not Affect GSAT Activity—The ability of GSAT to stimulate GTR activity suggested the possibility that a complementary stimulation of GSAT activity by GTR might also occur. The conversion of GSA to ALA by GSAT was determined in the presence and absence of GTR or an unrelated protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). Neither wild-type GTR, inactive C48R GTR, nor BSA had any effect on GSAT activity when present in assay mixtures in amounts equal to that of GSAT (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Influence of GTR on GSAT activity. The control (100%) activity was 5.8 nmol of ALA formed in 30 min in 0.5-ml incubations containing 6 μg of wild-type GSAT. Each bar represents the mean and S.D. of the results of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Inactive K273A GSAT on ALA Formation from Glutamyl-tRNA—The rate of ALA production from glutamyl-tRNA was measured in a coupled enzyme assay containing approximately equimolar amounts of purified recombinant wild-type GTR and GSAT. Addition of inactive K273A GSAT to the assay mixture decreased the formation of ALA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7). In contrast, supplementation of the assay mixture with additional wild-type GSAT resulted in a small increase in ALA production. Addition of the unrelated protein BSA had no effect on ALA production.Fig. 7Effects of inactive K273A GSAT on formation of ALA from glutamyl-tRNA. The control (100%) activity (bar 1) was 108 pmol ALA formed in 30 min in 0.1-ml incubations in microtiter plates containing 40 μg of GTR and 40 μg of GSAT. For bar 2, K273A GSAT was substituted for wild-type GSAT. For bar 3, an equal weight of BSA was substituted for GSAT. A, B, and C, excess wild-type GSAT, K273A GSAT, or BSA, respectively, were added to assay mixtures identical to that for bar 1. D, excess wild-type GSAT was added to assay mixtures identical to that for bar 2. A–D, the bars, reading from left to right, are for assays supplemented with the indicated component at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.5 times the weight of GSAT in the unsupplemented assay mixture. Each bar represents the mean and S.D. of the results of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If the decrease of ALA production from glutamyl-tRNA in the coupled enzyme assay is due to competition between wild-type and K273 GSAT for binding to GTR in a substrate-channeling scenario, then it would be expected that addition of increasing amounts of wild-type GSAT would reverse this inhibition. To test this hypothesis, excess wild-type GSAT was added to assay mixtures"

In Saccharomycescerevisiae, Snf1p (Cat1p) is one of the key regulators of carbohydratemetabolism, and cat1 (snf1) mutants fail to grow withnon-fermentable carbon sources. In Candida albicans, Snf1p is anessential protein and cells depend on a functional Snf1 kinase even withglucose as carbon source. We investigated the CaSnf1p complex aftertandem affinity purification and mass spectrometric analysis and show that thecomplex composition changes with the carbon source provided. Three subunitswere identified, one of which was named CaSnf4p because of itshomology to the ScSnf4 protein and the respective CaSNF4gene could complement a S. cerevisiae snf4 mutant. The other twoproteins revealed similarities to the S. cerevisiae kinase βsubunits ScGal83p, ScSip2p, and ScSip1p. Both genescomplemented the scaffold function in a S. cerevisiae gal83,sip1,sip2triple deletion mutant and were named according to their scaffold function asCaKIS1p and CaKIS2p. Matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization peptide mass fingerprint analysis indicated that CaKis2pis N-terminal myristoylated and the incorporation of CaKis2p in theSnf1p complex was reduced when compared with cells grown with glucose as acarbon source. To verify the different complex assemblies, a stable isotopelabeling technique (iTraq™) was employed, confirming a 3-fold decreaseof CaKis2p with ethanol.

Candida albicans is a widely distributed commensal fungus that iscarried as a part of the human microbial flora. However, it is also anopportunistic pathogen that can cause serious infections, particularly inimmunocompromised individuals(1Odds F. Candida andCandidiosis. 2nd Ed. Leicester University Press, Leicester, UK1988: 279-313Google Scholar). In C. albicans,Snf1p (CaSnf1p, NCBI accession number 46437276) seems to be essentialfor growth; moreover, CaSnf1p has the ability to complement thesnf1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(2Petter R.

In Candidatropicalis, a close relationship of CtSnf1p (86% identity toCaSnf1p) mRNA levels and cell growth was demonstrated(4Kanai T. Ogawa K. Ueda M. Tanaka A. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that may relateCtSnf1p to more fundamental cellular processes, but to date no directinteraction partners of the essential CaSnf1p have beenidentified. In the model yeast S. cerevisiae, the ScSnf1p kinase is ahomologue to the highly conserved AMP-activated serine/threonine kinases thatare found in plants, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, mammals, andfungi (for review see Ref. 5Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar)).These kinases seem to be essential components of cascades that function asmetabolic sensors in eukaryotic cells and are activated under conditions ofnutrient stress. Additionally, they were reported to be involved inpathogenesis and the treatment of several human diseases, including type 2diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer(6Kemp B.E. Stapleton D.

In S. cerevisiae, the ScSnf1p kinase complex contains acatalytic α subunit encoded by ScSNF1(23Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) comprising 633 aminoacids with a catalytic N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. The firsthalf of the regulatory domain in the remaining part down-regulates the kinaseactivity under nutrient-rich conditions(24Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamble J. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol.

It associates with theβ subunit by a consecutive interaction, and it binds to theautoinhibitory domain of ScSnf1p (as previously mentioned), releasingits catalytic domain. Under glucose-limited conditions, phosphorylation ofThr210 in the ScSnf1p C-terminal loop promotes kinaseactivity (28McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol.

The upstreamactivating Snf1p kinases in S. cerevisiae were recently identified asScPak1p, ScTos3p, and ScElm1p(29Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The transmission of a wide range of biological signals depends upon directphysical interaction of specific cellular proteins(33Alberts B. Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). To study theseinteractions we used the tandem affinity purification (TAP) method(34Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar) to purify the Snf1pkinase complex from the human pathogen C. albicans. A strainexpressing only the TAP-tagged fusion protein was chosen, which allowed thetest for functionality to be close to physiological concentrations by forminga complex with endogenous components. Because the deletion of CaSnf1pis lethal, it was interesting whether the TAP tag would interfere with thephysiological function. After deletion of the second copy, the cells showed nophenotypical change on either glucose or ethanol. The combination of twodifferent affinity tags greatly reduced the binding of nonspecific proteins tothe complex. We could identify the ScSnf4 homologue protein fromC. albicans and two scaffold subunits, which we namedCaKis1p and CaKis2p. The protein interactions within theSnf1p kinase complex were also confirmed using yeast two-hybrid analysis. Inaddition, a transcriptional activator domain in CaSip2p could beidentified. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were of analytical grade. PlasmidConstructs and Genetic Manipulation—Established protocols formolecular biology were followed(35Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

All genetic modifications of the C. albicans genome were performedvia homologous recombination using PCR products with 60-bp short flankinghomologies to the CaSNF1 gene(37Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). The CaURA3-TAPtag cassette was amplified by PCR using primers (supplemental Table II)homologous to both the CaURA3-TAP cassette and CaSNF1(CaSNF1-TAP-S1/CaSNF1-TAP-S2) and pPK335 as a template. After transformationof C. albicans RM1000 using the CaURA3-TAP tag cassette,correct integration in uridine prototrophic colonies was verified bydiagnostic PCR. In the resulting strain, CPK140–6, the secondCaSNF1 allele was deleted using CaHIS1 as a selectionmarker.

Spectra were externally calibrated with a Sequazyme™ peptide massstandards kit (ABI). Between 1000 and 2000 laser shots were accumulated foreach mass spectrum. All spectra were smoothed, noise-filtered, and deisotopedusing the Data Explorer (Version 4.3; ABI). Deisotoped peaks were labeled bythe software, and the 100 most intense peaks were used for data basesearching. Autolytic tryptic peptides or peptides resulting from theidentified protein were used for internal calibration(45Aivaliotis M. Corvey C. Tsirogianni I. Karas M. Tsiotis G. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 3468-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein Data Base Queries—Proteins were identified usingSpectrum Mill (Version 3.0; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany)installed on a local server using the current NCBI data base. For peptide massfingerprint (PMF) data, the 100 most intense peaks were submitted to SpectrumMill using a search tolerance of 25 ppm. For nano-LC MS/MS data the masstolerance for the precursor ion was 1.5 Da and the fragment ion mass tolerancewas 0.8 Da. iTRAQ™ Labeling—The final eluate of each sample afterTAP was precipitated, washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in 40μlof 0.5 m triethylammonium bicarbonate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Theproteins were reduced with 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine andalkylated with 10 mm methyl methane-thiosulfonate followed byovernight digestion using trypsin. The dried sample was resuspended in 100μl of labeling buffer (0.25 m triethylammonium bicarbonate, 75%(v/v) ethanol). The corresponding label was added and incubated (1 h at roomtemperature). Residual reagents were quenched by adding 300 μl of water andincubated another 30 min. Prior to strong cation exchange chromatography thesample was dried. Strong Cation Exchange Chromatography—The combined mixturewas separated by strong cation exchange chromatography on an HP 1100 HPLCsystem (Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) using a PolySulfoethyl A column(4.6 × 100 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å). Sample was dissolved in 1 ml ofstrong cation exchange loading buffer (25% (v/v) ACN, 10 mmKH2PO4 adjusted to pH 3 with phosphoric acid), loaded,and washed for 20 min at 1 ml/min. Peptides were eluted in a two-step gradient(0–500 mm KCl (25% (v/v) ACN, 10 mmKH2PO4 adjusted to pH 3 with phosphoric acid)) over 15min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with fractions collected from 20 minonward. HPLC MS—All LC MS/MS experiments were performed in positiveion mode using either an XCT ion trap (Agilent Technologies) or a QTrap 2000hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (ABI MDS Sciex, Ontario, Canada) connected toa nano-LC (Agilent Technologies). A linear gradient was applied ranging from3–97% (v/v) ACN/0.1% (v/v) FA. Samples were trapped on a Zorbax 300 SBprecolumn (0.3 × 5 mm, 5 μm, Agilent Technologies) with a flow rateof 20 μl/min and a solvent composition of H2O/ACN/FA (97/3/0.1v/v/v). Separation was performed on a Zorbax C18 column (75 μm × 150mm, Agilent Technologies) using 0.1% (v/v) FA in water as solvent A and 0.1%(v/v) FA in ACN as solvent B at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Cells were harvested and washedonce with KPP (potassium-phosphate) buffer (pH 6.5, 4 °C). After washing,cells were resuspended in 500 μl of KPP buffer, glass beads were added, andthe mixture was vortexed for 90 s at 4 °C. 1 ml of cold KPP was added, andcell debris were separated by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min). Proteinconcentration was determined using a microbiuret assay. β-Galactosidasewas assayed according to Ref.46Miller J.H. A Short Course inBacterial Genetics.

Construction of C. albicans SNF1-tagged Strain—For theanalysis of the CaSnf1p kinase complex assembly, a TAP tag cassettewas chromosomally fused to the C terminus of CaSnf1p(Fig. 1A). To show thefunctionality of the CaSNF1-TAP construct and to avoid any influenceof CaSnf1p, the remaining wild-type gene CaSNF1 wasadditionally deleted, resulting in strain CPK141–28 (supplemental TableI, Fig. 1B). Correctintegration of the TAP cassette and the deletion of the second allele wereshown using Southern hybridization (Fig.2A). Strain CPK141–28 showed wild-type growth onglucose and on ethanol, which proved that the recombinant taggedCaSNF1 gene, transcribed from its native promoter, was fullyfunctional (data not shown). Western blot analysis following SDS-PAGEseparation (using the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase antibody directed against theprotein A part of the TAP tag) (Fig.2B) showed an apparent molecular mass of the fusionprotein of 90 kDa. The observed value fits well with the calculated value ofCaSnf1p (69 kDa) fused to the calmodulin binding peptide (5 kDa) andprotein A (16 kDa) separated by a TEV cleavage site.Fig. 2Southern and Western blot analysis of CaSNF1 TAP-taggedstrains. A, genomic DNA of the corresponding strains was digestedwith PvuII and, following gel electrophoresis, was transferred to a nylonmembrane. 586-bp CaSNF1 DNA fragment was amplified by PCR (primersCaSNF1-P1/-P2) and used as a probe after labeling with [32P]dCTP.Lane 1, RM1000 (CaSNF1/CaSNF1); lane 2,CPK140–6 (CaSNF1::TAP-CaURA3/CaSNF1);lane 3, CPK141–28,(CaSNF1::TAP-CaURA3/Casnf1::CaHIS1).B, Western blotting was carried out using the peroxidase-conjugatedanti-peroxidase antibody against the protein A domain of the fusion protein.Extracts from RM1000 and CPK141–28 were separated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tandem Affinity Purification of the CaSnf1p KinaseComplex—To identify the interaction partners of CaSnf1p weperformed tandem affinity purifications of the TAP-tagged protein from cellsgrown on different carbon sources. Following TAP, the protein complexes wereseparated via SDS-PAGE, and the corresponding band patterns were compared(Fig. 3A).Subsequently, all gels were entirely sliced and subjected to an in-geldigestion protocol. Proteins were identified via PMF and nano-LC MS/MS. Whencells were grown on glucose, the complex displayed three intense bands and onefaint band (Fig. 3A,lane 1), whereas cells grown on ethanol displayed three intense bands(Fig. 3A, lane2). In both experiments we could identify the most intense band (band2) as the bait (CaSnf1p) fused to the calmodulin-binding protein(Figs. 3B and4A). The protein hadan apparent molecular mass of 74 kDa, which fits well to the calculated valueof CaSnf1p (69 kDa) fused to the calmodulin binding peptide (5kDa).Fig. 4Nano-LC MS/MS analysis of TAP-purified proteins. Separated proteinsfrom Fig. 3A weredigested and further analyzed using nano-LC MS/MS. The base beak chromatogramis displayed on the left, with the arrow indicating theelution time of the corresponding fragmented precursor ion (right).Fragment ions were labeled according to Roepstorff-Fohlmann-Biemannnomenclature (10Biemann K.

Fragmentation patterns, withrespect to amino acid sequence, are also displayed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using both PMF and nano-LC MS/MS analysis, all four bands could beunambiguously assigned to C. albicans proteins. Band 4 could beassigned to hypothetical protein CaO19.13191 (NCBI accession number 46439783).The migration behavior of CaO19.13191 during SDS-PAGE fits to the calculatedmolecular mass of 41 kDa (Fig.3A, band 4). After PMF, 45% of the amino acidsequence could be covered, and subsequent LC MS/MS analyses enhanced thesequence coverage to 56% with well assigned peptide sequences. As arepresentative example, the MS/MS spectrum of a very hydrophobic peptide(1672.99 Da), which elutes at 56 min (42% (v/v) ACN), is shown(Fig. 4B). From thenearly complete y- and b-ion fragmentation series of the parent ion, thepeptide sequence LINVYEAVDILALVK could be determined with a Spectrum Millscore >15 and a scored peak intensity >70%, (scores >15 lie withinthe category of highest confidence). The identified hypothetical proteinCaO19.13191 shows 64% identity to the γ subunit Snf4p from S.cerevisiae and is now named CaSnf4p(Fig. 5). Protein band 3 (Fig.3A) with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa could beidentified as CaO19.4084 (NCBI accession number 46435808) with a calculatedmolecular mass of 46 kDa. Using PMF, 24% of the amino acid sequence wascovered, which was enhanced to 29% using high quality MS/MS data(Fig. 4C). Thisprotein shows striking similarities to the S. cerevisiae βsubunits ScGal83p and ScSip2p, having 49 and 45% homology,respectively (Fig.5C). With this degree of similarity it was not possibleto clearly attribute CaO19.4084 to one of the S. cerevisiae proteins.Furthermore, CaO19.4084 also showed homologies to the ASC and KIS domains ofthe third S. cerevisiae β subunit, ScSip1p, being 27%identical and 43% similar in the respective regions. Protein band 1 (Fig.3A) migrating at 100 kDa was identified as CaO19.12464(NCBI accession number 46444282) with a calculated molecular mass of 81 kDa.Usin"

Theseresults shed light on a basic aspect of the enzyme-substrate interaction inthe entire family of trypsin-like serine proteases. Serine proteases catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds using the triadHis-57/Asp-102/Ser-195 (chymotrypsinogen numbering)(1Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar,2Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Binding of substrate to theactive site is stabilized by a network of H-bonds, five of which are highlyconserved and ensure the efficient hydrolysis of amide bonds. Of theseH-bonds, two stabilize an anti-parallel β-sheet between Gly-216 and theP3 residue of substrate, whereas the other three involve the backbone N and Oatoms of the P1 residue of substrate. The N atom engages the backbone O atomof Ser-214, often referred to as the “fourth” member of thecatalytic machinery (3Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBOJ. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The Oatom of the P1 residue, on the other hand, makes two H-bonding interactionswith the backbone N atoms of the catalytic Ser-195 and Gly-193 in theso-called “oxyanion hole.” The role of this region of the enzymeis to stabilize the developing negative charge on the O atom of substrateduring formation of the tetrahedral intermediate(4Birktoft J.J. Blow D.M. J.Mol. Biol. 1972; 68: 187-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The lack of a side chainat position 193 allows correct positioning of the amido hydrogen to form therequisite H-bond with the oxyanion substrate. Indeed, Gly is highly conservedat position 193 in serine proteases, but few exceptions do exist and areassociated with perturbed substrate hydrolysis and resistance to inhibition(5Timm D.E. ProteinSci. 1997; 6: 1418-1425Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Katona G. Berglund G.I. Hajdu J. Graf L. Szilagyi L. J. Mol.

Previous studies have addressed the important question of the energeticinvolvement of the oxyanion hole in substrate recognition. In subtlisin, oneof the H-bonding group in the oxyanion hole is provided by the side chain ofAsn-155 (9Robertus J.D. Kraut J. Alden R.A. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4293-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Mutation ofAsn-155 to the isosteric Leu, devoid of H-bonding capabilities, produces aderivative with reduced kcat/Km due toa significant (200-fold) decrease of kcat(9Robertus J.D. Kraut J. Alden R.A. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4293-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar,10Bryan P. Pantoliano M.W. Quill S.G. Hsiao H.Y. Poulos T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1986; 83: 3743-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The absence of effect onKm has been interpreted as supporting the role of theH-bonding network of the oxyanion hole in stabilization of the transitionstate. In Escherichia coli type I signal peptidase, one of theH-bonding group in the oxyanion hole is the hydroxyl of Ser-88(11Carlos J.L. Klenotic P.A. Paetzel M. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7276-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser-88 toAla drastically impairs the kcat/Kmdue to a significant (>2000-fold) decrease ofkcat.Asfor subtilisin, the effect onKm is minimal and suggests that the H-bonding contributionof the oxyanion hole stabilizes predominantly, if not exclusively, thetransition state. In the case of serine proteases such as trypsin andchymotrypsin, the two H-binding donors of the oxyanion hole are backbone Natoms, and it is not possible to perturb them directly as in the case ofsubtilisin and E. coli type I signal peptidase. Any substitution atSer-195 would result in an inactive enzyme, and mutations of Gly-193 mayaffect other properties of the active site beyond the H-bonding interactionprovided by this residue backbone. Hence, for trypsin-like enzymes, noconclusive evidence currently exists about the role of the oxyanion hole instabilizing exclusively the transition state. In the case of clotting factorIXa, the mutant G193E shows perturbation of both Km andkcat (8Schmidt A.E. Ogawa T. Gailani D. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29485-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar),suggesting a role for Gly-193 in stabilization of both the ground andtransition states. However, no energetic estimate of the role of Gly-193 inthese interactions has been reported thus far. In the case of subtilisin, thecontribution to transition state stabilization was estimated to be 3.7kcal/mol (10Bryan P. Pantoliano M.W. Quill S.G. Hsiao H.Y. Poulos T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1986; 83: 3743-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, theabsence of effect on ground state stabilization was inferred from the valuesof Km, which may not be an accurate measure of theequilibrium binding constant Kd(12Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hence, even forsubtilisin, questions persist on the role of the oxyanion hole instabilization of the ground state. Given the central importance of the transition state stabilizationhypothesis in the mechanism of substrate hydrolysis by serine proteases(2Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar) and the preeminent roleplayed by trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like enzymes in biological processes inhealth and disease (13Perona J.J. Craik C.S. J.Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), wehave decided to explore the role of Gly-193 in thrombin and trypsin usingdetailed kinetic and structural analysis. Perturbation of the H-bondingcontribution from Gly-193 was achieved with two mutations, G193A and G193P.The Ala mutant was made as reference to establish the effect of introducingthe smallest chiral center on the H-bonding capability of residue 193. The Promutant was made to completely abrogate the H-bonding capability of residue193. In each case, we have resolved the individual rate constant defining thecatalytic mechanism of substrate hydrolysis and the equilibrium parameters ofsubstrate binding to better identify the origin of perturbation caused by themutations. In the case of thrombin, we have also solved the crystal structuresof the G193A and G193P mutants to directly gauge the extent of structuralperturbation produced by the mutations on the oxyanion hole. The combinationof kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural data offers a quantitativeassessment of the role of Gly-193 and the oxyanion hole in substraterecognition. Construction of the Trypsinogen Vector—The pPICZαvector containing anionic rat trypsinogen was constructed using theribocloning technique (14Barnes W.M. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: ALaboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring HarborLaboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 441-449Google Scholar).The trypsinogen gene was amplified from a plasmid present in the laboratory bystandard PCR using the following primers:5′-TTTCCCGTGGATGATGATGACAAGATCGTTGGAGG-3′ and5′-CTAGTTGGCAGCAATTGTGTCCTGAATCCAGTC-3′. The gene was prepared forinsertion into the pPICzα vector immediately downstream of theα-factor signal sequence using two riboprimers and two“band-aid” primers. KlenTaq long and accurate DNA polymerase(14Barnes W.M. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: ALaboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring HarborLaboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 441-449Google Scholar) was used at pH 9.2 forthe PCR. The pPICzα “target” was prepared using tworiboprimers, which amplified with an insertion gap for the trypsinogen gene.Following PCR, DpnI was added to eliminate parent DNA. The amplified productswere precipitated with polyethylene glycol and washed with 70% ethanol. Afterresuspension in DNA buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1mm EDTA, pH 7.9) RNase A (Ambion) was added to cut the plasmid/geneat the ribobases, resulting in sticky ends on the target plasmid and theamplified trypsinogen gene. RNase A was digested by addition of proteinase K(Sigma). The prepared pPICz target and the prepared trypsinogen gene insertwere mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio in DNA buffer with 0.5 m NaCl andannealed by heating at 75 °C for 4 min, followed by slow cooling to 25°C over 60 min. The product was then transformed directly into XL1 Bluecells (Stratagene) and plated on low-salt LB media containing 25 μg/mlZeocin (Invitrogen) for selection. Plasmid DNA was isolated and purified fromsingle colonies using Maxipreps from Qiagen. The G193A and G193P mutants wereconstructed with the QuikChange system (Stratagene) using thepPICZα/trypsinogen plasmid as a template. Transformation and plasmidpurification were done in the same manner as described for wild-type. Expression and Purification of Trypsin Mutants in Pichiapastoris— The plasmid containing the zymogen coding region wasdigested with PmeI (New England Biolabs) to cut at a unique site at the5′ AOX1 gene. The linearized plasmid was then transformed into P.pastoris GS115 cells using the EasyComp™ method from Invitrogen.Verification of plasmid recombination into the P. pastoris genome wasachieved by PCR. Transformed cells were grown on YPDS plates containing 100μg/ml Zeocin for selection. Individual colonies were screened formut+/S phenotype by plating on both MDH (minimal dextrose) and MMH(minimal methanol) media and comparing the 2-day growth with mut+and mutS standards. All selected mutants were of themut+ variety. A freshly streaked colony was used to inoculate 25 mlof buffered complex media containing glycerol in a 250-ml baffled flask at 30°C overnight. The cells were spun down and resuspended in 100–200 mlof buffered complex media containing 2% methanol (2% MeOH) in a 1-literbaffled flask to a final A600 of 0.6–1.0 for2–3 days at 30 °C. Every 24 h, sterile methanol was added to a finalconcentration of 2% to account for consumption and evaporation. Cells werepelleted by centrifugation, and the media containing trypsinogen werediafiltered/concentrated against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, using theQuixstand system from Amersham Biosciences with a 10-kDa hollow fibercartridge. Trypsinogen was activated by addition of CaCl2 to 10mm and pre-purified bovine enterokinase (Sigma), followed byincubation at 37 °C overnight. Activated trypsin was purified using anSBTI-Sepharose affinity column followed by dialysis against 1 mmHCl for storage at –80 °C.

Bothmutants were inhibited by PPACK at a molar ratio of 1:10 and incubated at roomtemperature for 1 h. Crystallization was achieved at 25 °C by vapordiffusion, with each crystallization well containing 1000 μl of reservoirsolution. Equal volumes of the protein sample and reservoir solution (1 μlof each) were mixed to prepare the hanging drops. The reservoir solution forboth mutants was composed of 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 msodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, and 0.2 m zinc acetate. Diffractionquality crystals for each mutant were grown after 14 days. Each crystal wascryoprotected in a solution similar to its reservoir solution but containing25% glycerol prior to flash-freezing. X-ray diffraction data were collected atthe Advanced Photon Source (beamline Biocars 14-BMC, Argonne NationalLaboratory) and processed using the HKL2000 package(17Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

In the G193Pstructure, an additional stretch of residues in the 70 loop (Ser-72 to Glu-77)was not included in the model due to weak electron density.

Open table in a new tab Determination of Individual Kinetic Rate Constants for SubstrateHydrolysis—The accepted kinetic mechanism of substrate hydrolysisby serine proteases starts with the binding of substrate S into the activesite of the enzyme E, with a second-order rate constantk1. After formation of the enzyme-substrate complexES, the substrate can either dissociate back into the solution with arate constant k–1 or become acylated to the activesite Ser-195 with a rate constant k2. The portion ofsubstrate distal to the scissile bond, P′, is released at this stage.The acyl intermediate EP is subsequently hydrolyzed with theassistance of a water molecule to release the portion of substrate proximal tothe scissile bond, P″, with a rate constant k3. Theseries of events leading to substrate hydrolysis can be depicted as follows.E+S⇄k−1k1ES→k2EP+P'→k3E+P“(Eq. 1) The Michaelis-Menten parameters s =kcat/Km and kcataccessible to direct experimental measurements are composite functions of theindividual kinetic rates in Equation1. Specifically,s=k1k2k−1+k2(Eq. 2) kcat=k2k3k2+k3(Eq. 3) The parameters have a similar form, but s does not depend on thedeacylation rate, whereas kcat does not depend onsubstrate diffusion into the active site and dissociation. The fourindependent individual rate constants defining s andkcat can be resolved from measurements of theMichaelis-Menten parameters as a function of temperature(22Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The relevant expressionsare as follows:s=k1k2exp{−E1+E2R(1T−1T0)}k−1exp{−E−1R(1T−1T0)}+k2exp{−E2R(1T−1T0)}(Eq. 4) kcat=k2k3exp{−E2+E3R(1T−1T0)}k2exp{−E2R(1T−1T0)}+k3exp{−E3R(1T−1T0)}(Eq. 5) where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature,and all ks refer to the reference temperature T0= 298.15 K. The Es are the Arrhenius terms defining the activationenergies associated with each step of the catalytic mechanism. The eightindependent parameters in Eqs. 4 and 5 can be resolved from measurementscarried out as a function of temperature, provided the Arrhenius plots ofs and kcat show curvature(22Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This was always the casefor s. However, thrombin and its mutants did not show appreciablecurvature in the plot of kcat, thereby proving that thedeacylation step in the catalytic conversion of FPR remains much faster thanacylation over the entire temperature range studied, unlike what was observedwith trypsin and its mutants. The values of s andkcat for FPR hydrolysis were measured in the temperaturerange from 5 °C to 45 °C, under experimental conditions of 5mm Tris, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0.The pH was precisely adjusted at room temperature to obtain the value of 8.0at the desired temperature. Tris buffer has a pKa = 8.06at 25 °C and a temperature coefficient ofΔpKa/ΔT = –0.027(23Stoll V.S. Blanchard J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These properties ensuredbuffering over the entire temperature range examined. Unlike trypsin, thrombinis a Na+-activated enzyme(24Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and its catalyticproperties are enhanced by Na+ binding. The experimental conditionsused in this study refer to the Na+-bound, fast form of thrombin(12Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,22Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The values of k1 determined from the temperaturedependence of s and kcat for FPR hydrolysis werechecked from independent measurements of the rate of inactivation by thesuicide inhibitor PPACK, which is the noncleavable analog of FPR. Progresscurves of FPR hydrolysis were run in the presence of increasing concentrationsof PPACK and fit to the expression[P]=[P]∞(1−exp(−k1[I]1+[S]Kmt))(Eq. 6) where P is the p-nitroaniline resulting from cleavage of FPR, S, inthe presence of PPACK, I, and t is time. The energetics of substrate binding and catalysis were interpretedaccording to the transition state theory(25Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar,26Fersht A.R. Shi J.P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Carter P. Waye M.M. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) using the individual rateconstants determined from the temperature experiments. According to thistheory, enzyme and substrate can form two complexes, ES andES‡, that represent the ground and transition states,respectively. The free energy of formation of ES is given by theequilibrium expressionΔGgs=RT lnk−1k1=RTlnKd(Eq. 7) whereas the free energy of formation of ES‡ is given byΔGts=RT lnkThs=RT lnkThk−1+k2k1k2(Eq. 8) where k is Boltzmann's constant, and h is Planck's constant.The two terms differ in sign, with ΔGgs always beingnegative, and ΔGts always being positive, andreflect the energetic balance of enzyme-substrate interaction before thecomplex is processed for catalysis. It is important to notice that both termsdo not depend on the deacylation rate k3, which on theother hand enters the definition of Km (see Equations2 and3). Hence, assessment of theproperties of the ground state from measurements of Km arepotentially problematic, especially when k3 is not muchfaster than k2 and when k2 iscomparable to k–1(22Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of s and kcat forthe hydrolysis of FPR by thrombin and trypsin is shown inFig. 1. Accurate measurementsof both parameters were possible over the entire temperature range, enablingresolution of the relevant kinetic rate constants and activation energies. Forboth enzymes, the G193A mutant revealed properties closer to wild-type thanthe G193P mutant. Notably, thrombin always showed a linear Arrhenius plot forkcat, implying that acylation was rate-limiting for thisenzyme. On the other hand, wild-type and G193A trypsin showed a curved plotfor kcat, documenting a deacylation rate comparable toacylation.

Open table in a new tab In the case of thrombin, the wild-type binds FPR with a very fastk1 (12Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)that approaches the diffusion-limited rate for macromolecules in aqueoussolutions (27van Holde K.E. Biophys.Chem. 2002; (249–254): 101-102Google Scholar). Thekcat is defined entirely by k2 becausethe Arrhenius plot is linear, and k3 ≫k2 over the entire temperature range studied. Alareplacement of Gly-193 produces a notable change in k1(18-fold) and k2 (4.3-fold), resulting in a 25-folddecrease in s due to an increase in Km and adecrease in kcat. Perturbing the residue in the oxyanionhole therefore changes substrate binding both in the transition state (effecton kcat) and in the ground state (effect onKd). It should be pointed out that Kmfor FPR hydrolysis by thrombin is not a valid measure ofKd or substrate binding(Table II) and should not beused to assess effects in the ground state. The Kd for FPRbinding in the ground state changes from 64 nm in the wild-type to760 nm in the G193A mutant. Hence, the effect of Ala mutation ofGly-193 on substrate binding in the ground state (12-fold reduction) iscomparable to the effect on the transition state (25-fold reduction). TheG193A mutation has no significant effect on the rate of substratedissociation, k–1, and on the Arrhenius activationenergies for substrate binding, dissociation, and acylation. Notably, thevalue of E2 for wild-type and G193A is within experimentalerror of the estimated 18 kcal/mol derived from ab initio QM/MMelectronic calculations (28Ishida T. Kato S. J. Am.Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12035-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).The replacement of Gly-193 with Pro is far more deleterious on substratehydrolysis, but qualitatively, the results are similar to those seen for theG193A mutant. There is a drastic effect on substrate binding in both theground and transition states, with k1 decreasing>800-fold and k2 decreasing 28-fold. Again, the effecton k–1 is more modest, and the resulting increase inKd is >150-fold. Unlike the Ala substitution, thepresence of Pro at position 193 also influences the energetics of substratebinding and hydrolysis. Specifically, the energy barrier for substrate bindingdoes not change, but the activation energies for substrate dissociation andespecially substrate acylation change drastically. The effect onE2 is particularly noticeable inFig. 1, where the temperaturedependence of log kcat is almost flat. In the case of trypsin, the effects of Ala and Pro substitutions of Gly-193mirror those observed for thrombin. The dominant effect is seen on the valuesof k1 and k2. These changes are notlinked to significant energetic consequences for the Ala mutant, but they arelinked to significant energetic consequences for the Pro substitution. Anotable difference from thrombin is that the Arrhenius plot ofkcat is significantly curved in the wild-type and G193Amutant of trypsin. This enables accurate measurements ofk3 and E3. The rate of deacylation isonly >3-fold faster than acylation in the wild-type and 7-fold faster thanacylation in the G193A mutant. Because the rate of acylation for these enzymesis comparable to that of the thrombin enzymes, we conclude thatk3 for FPR hydrolysis by thrombin must be much faster thanthe value obtained for wild-type trypsin. The value of E3is practically zero, signaling energetic neutrality for dissociation of theacyl enzyme. Again, this result is in striking"

The images reveal a halo of variable ENA emission about Titan's nearly collisionless outer atmosphere that fades at larger distances as the exospheric density decays exponentially.

Molecular recognition and specific association of protein ligands and protein targets are central to most biological processes. Understanding the molecular basis of these interactions is critical for engineering novel protein-protein interactions. In particular, understanding how protein ligands bind with high affinity to only a subset of closely related receptors may help to design ligands with novel selectivities.A number of studies have been carried out to identify the sites used by protein ligands to bind to several related receptors. These sites were shown to be composed of a core formed by conserved hot spot residues together with target-specific residues (1Ménez A. Servent D. Gasparini S. Ménez A.

In many cases the molecular determinants responsible for protein ligand discrimination remain to be identified.Toxins from sea anemones and scorpions that block currents through Kv1 voltage-gated potassium channels are particularly appropriate to investigate the molecular basis of selectivity of protein-protein interactions since each toxin binds to only a subset of Kv1 channel subtypes (6Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We have previously studied in detail BgK, a 37-amino acid peptide isolated from the sea anemone Bunodosoma granulifera (7Cotton J. Crest M. Bouet F. Alessandri N. Gola M. Forest E. Karlsson E.

These sites share three critical residues (Lys-25, Tyr-26, and Ser-23), conserved in all Kv1-blocking toxins from sea anemones, which have also been shown to be functional in ShK, another sea anemone toxin (for review, see Ref. 10Gasparini S. Gilquin B. Menez A. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, these three residues form the functional core of Kv1-blocking sea anemone toxins. Similarly, a comparison of the functional sites of Kv1-blocking scorpion toxins αKTx1-3 (11Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D.

Furthermore, comparison of the functional cores of Kv1-blocking sea anemone and αKTx1-3 scorpion toxins revealed that they commonly contain a pair of residues formed by a lysine and a hydrophobic residue (for review, see Ref. 10Gasparini S.

Servent D. Gasparini S. Ménez A. Pespectives in Molecular Toxinology.

Toxicon. 2004; 43: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, as suggested by a study with a cone snail toxin (13Al-Sabi A. Lennartz D. Ferber M. Gulyas J. Rivier J.E. Olivera B.M. Carlomagno T. Terlau H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8625-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this binding mode may not be the only one adopted by Kv1-blocking toxins.Recently, structural models of the complex BgK·S5-S6 region of Kv1.1, based on distance restraints derived from double-mutant cycles (9Gilquin B. Racape J. Wrisch A. Visan V. Lecoq A. Grissmer S. Ménez A. Gasparini S. J. Biol.

In particular, these models emphasized the importance of Kv1.1 residue 379, a variable position in Kv1 channels that is critical for binding of external tetraethylammonium ion (14Kavanaugh M.P.

These models provide a detailed description of the interactions involving the residues of the BgK functional core. Interestingly, one of these interactions, involving the carbonyl of a glycine residue from the channel selectivity filter, appears to be common to the different binding modes used by toxins whether or not they contain a functional dyad. Furthermore, our model strengthens the putative importance of Kv1.1 residue 379. We have investigated the importance of this residue using binding and electrophysiology experiments on different Kv1 channels mutated at position 379. Our results show that mutations at position 379 are sufficient to abolish or enhance sensitivity to toxins, indicating that this single position critically controls the affinity of BgK and other sea anemone and scorpion toxins for Kv1 channel subtypes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESModeling of the Complex BgK·S5-S6 Region of Kv1.1—BgK was docked onto a structural model of Kv1.1 using distance restraints derived from double-mutant cycles (9Gilquin B.

Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar) as a template. In addition to the six previously used distance restraints (BgK(Ser-23)-Kv1.1(Tyr-379), BgK(Phe-6)-Kv1.1(Tyr-379), BgK(Tyr-26)-Kv1.1(Ser-357), BgK(Tyr-26)-Kv1.1(Asp-361), BgK(Asn-19)-Kv1.1(Ser-357), BgK-(Tyr-26)-Kv1.1(Tyr-379)) (9Gilquin B. Racape J. Wrisch A. Visan V. Lecoq A. Grissmer S. Ménez A. Gasparini S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37406-37413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), two other restraints were used, BgK(Lys-25Nζ)-Kv1.1(Tyr-375O) and BgK(Phe-6)-Kv1.1(Asp-361). As previously, ambiguous restraints arising from the 4-fold symmetric channel structure were used, but the effective distance was calculated as the distance to the nearest of four equivalent residues (18Eriksson M.A. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2595-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) instead of using 1/r6 sum averaging. The distance restraints were classified as follows: strong, BgK-(Lys-25Nζ)-Kv1.1(Tyr-375O), BgK(Ser-23)-Kv1.1(Tyr-379), and BgK-(Phe-6)-Kv1.1(Tyr-379); medium, BgK(Tyr-26)-Kv1.1(Ser-357), BgK(Tyr-26)-Kv1.1(Asp-361), and BgK(Asn-19)-Kv1.1(Ser-357); weak, BgK(Tyr-26)-Kv1.1(Tyr-379) and BgK(Phe-6)-Kv1.1(Asp-361). A harmonic potential with a flat bottom was used. The upper-bound distances were set to 3, 5, and 6 Å for the strong, medium, and weak restraints, respectively.The channel was positioned such that the cavity was centered at z = 0 and the pore was aligned with the z axis, the extracellular side on the positive side. The atoms of all channel residues for which z < 10 were kept fixed. For the other channel residues the backbone atoms were restrained relative to the initial model using a harmonic potential. The strength of the backbone restraints was progressively decreased from 100 to 6 kcal/mol. For the turret residues (residues 345-359), the strength was reduced and decreased from 50 to 0.5 kcal/mol. An energy restraint allowing complete rotation and translation was applied to the toxin backbone (100 kcal/mol) and to the Cβ (10 kcal/mol).The docking procedure started from a random position and orientation of the toxin. In a first step hydrogen atoms were not included, and electrostatic interactions were ignored. The best structures in terms of van der Waals interaction energy were refined. In a second step hydrogen atoms were introduced, and the system was annealed from 800 to 400 K in 10,000 steps. During these two steps distance restraint force constants were set to 20, 10, 2 kcal/mol for the strong, medium, and weak constraints, respectively. In a final step the structures were refined by slow cooling from 800 to 300 K in 8000 steps during which the distance restraint force constants were reduced to 5, 2, and 0.5 kcal for the strong, medium, and weak constraint, respectively. The equations of motion were integrated using a time step of 2 fs, and the length of all the bonds involving hydrogen atoms were kept rigidly fixed using SHAKE (20Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16544) Google Scholar). The structures with high levels of energy restraint (>40 kcal/mol) were rejected. The best structures in terms of van der Waals interaction energy were selected. For these structures the ΔΔGint from double-mutant cycles were back-calculated using a continuous implicit solvent model based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (18Eriksson M.A. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2595-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This equation was solved numerically using the PBEQ module (21Im W. Beglov D. Roux B. Comput. Phys.

A set of atomic Born radii, calibrated and optimized to reproduce the electrostatic free energy of the 20 amino acids in molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water molecules, was used (23Nina M. Beglov D. Roux B. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 5239-5248Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar).

Membranes were saturated overnight at 4 °C with TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), washed once with TBS-Tween (0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), and incubated 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit antibody specific for Kv1 subtypes (Sigma) in TBS-Tween buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. After 3 washes, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and after three wash steps, the peroxidase reaction was initiated by the addition of 3,3′ diaminobenzidine (Sigma) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% (v/v) H2O2 to visualize the hybridized probes.

After centrifugation (4 min at ∼500 × g), the cell pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. The intracellular solution consisted of 100 mm potassium gluconate, 40 mm KCl, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Amphotericin B (Sigma A-4888) was prepared as a 40 mg/ml solution in Me2SO and diluted to 0.13 mg/ml into the internal solution. BgK was prepared in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline.Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 currents were recorded at room temperature using the IonWorks HT (Molecular Devices) multichannel whole-cell voltage clamp instrument (24Schroeder K. Neagle B. Trezise D.J. Worley J. J. Biomol. Screen. 2003; 8: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Hole resistances in the planar 384-well electrode array were ∼3 megaohms. Electrical access to the cytoplasm was achieved by perforation in 0.13 mg/ml amphotericin B for 4 min. The test pulse consisted of a 150-ms step from a holding potential of -80 mV to +50 mV for Kv1.4 currents and of a 100-ms step from a holding potential of -80 mV to +50 mV followed by 50 ms at -40 mV for Kv1.5 currents. In both cases the pulse was performed before and after 5 min of incubation with BgK, during which the cells were not voltage-clamped, and leak conductances were measured during a 160-ms step from -80 mV to -70 mV preceding the test pulse. Only cells with membrane resistances of >70 megaohms were included in the analysis. Data were acquired at 10 kHz. For mutated Kv1.4 channels, the amplitude of the peak currents in the presence of BgK was normalized to the peak current in control plotted against peptide concentration and fit to the Hill equation of the form Inormalized = 1/[1 + ([L]/IC50)], where [L] is the peptide concentration, and IC50 is the peptide concentration resulting in 50% inhibition.RESULTSRefined Model of the BgK·Kv1.1 Complex—It has been previously shown that values of coupling free energies, ΔΔGint, from double-mutant cycles can be calculated from structural models of complexes using a continuum solvent approximation (18Eriksson M.A. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2595-2609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here, to refine the previous structures of the complex BgK·S5-S6 region of Kv1.1 (9Gilquin B. Racape J. Wrisch A. Visan V. Lecoq A. Grissmer S. Ménez A. Gasparini S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37406-37413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we implemented a procedure that uses back-calculation of ΔΔGint from double-mutant cycles to screen the model structures (see “Experimental Procedures”).1300 structures were obtained in 9 runs. The best 70, in term of van der Waals interaction energy, were selected. For these structures values of ΔΔGint from double-mutant cycles (9Gilquin B. Racape J. Wrisch A. Visan V. Lecoq A. Grissmer S. Ménez A. Gasparini S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37406-37413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were back-calculated and compared with the experimental values (Table I). The S.D. between the calculated and measured ΔΔGint varied from 0.6 to 1 kcal/mol. Because of the limited flexibility of the turret region, the distance restraints between BgK(Asn-19)-Kv1.1(Ser-357), BgK(Tyr-26)-Kv1.1(Ser-357), and BgK(Tyr-26)-Kv1.1(Asp-361) were not satisfied, and thus, the values of the corresponding ΔΔGint were close to 0. This reinforces the previous suggestion (25Wrisch A. Grissmer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39345-39353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that the conformation of the turret in the KcsA structure does not reflect the conformation of Kv1 channel turrets. Therefore, we focused on the interactions between Kv1.1(Tyr-379) and BgK residues, for which the S.D. between calculated and experimental ΔΔGint values varied from 0.6 to 1.5 kcal/mol.Table IComparison of experimental and back-calculated values of ΔΔGint for 23 structuresStructuresDouble-mutant cycleaExperimental results are from Gilquin et al.

These structures share several characteristics. First, BgK(Lys-25Nζ) is located between the potassium binding sites S0 and S1 (19Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R.

The r.m.s.d. for BgK(K25.Cα) and BgK(Lys-25Nζ) are equal to 0.8 and 0.5 Å, respectively. Second, the two aromatic rings of BgK residues Tyr-26 and Phe-6 are located between two Kv1.1(Tyr-379) residues from adjacent subunits (r.m.s.d. of Cα position of Tyr-26 and Phe-6 is equal to 0.6 and 1.3 Å, respectively). For 5 structures (1-2, 4-5, and 8, Table I), the χ1 of Phe-6 is unchanged, and the value of ΔΔGint for the cycle BgK(F6A)-Kv1.1(Y379H) is positive, as is the experimental value (9Gilquin B. Racape J.

For 2 structures (3 and 7), the χ1 is changed, the BgK(Phe-6) side chain is not in close contact with Kv1.1(Tyr-379), and the value of ΔΔGint for the cycle BgK(F6A)-Kv1.1(Y379H) is negative or zero. Third, in the NMR structures of unbound BgK (12Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C.L. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Menez A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2077710242,"Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) is a biotin-dependent mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of propionyl-CoA to d-methylmalonyl-CoA. PCC consists of two heterologous subunits, α PCC and β PCC, which are encoded by the nuclear PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively. Deficiency of PCC results in a metabolic disorder, propionic acidemia, which is sufficiently severe to cause neonatal death. We have purified three PCCs containing pathogenic mutations in the β subunit (R165W, E168K, and R410W) and one PCCB polymorphism (A497V) to homogeneity to elucidate the potential structural and functional effects of these substitutions. We observed no significant difference in Km values for propionyl-CoA between wild-type and the variant enzymes, which indicated that these substitutions had no effect on the affinity of the enzyme for this substrate. Furthermore, the kinetic studies indicated that mutation R410W was not involved in propionyl-CoA binding in contrast to a previous report. The three mutant PCCs had half the catalytic efficiency of wild-type PCC as judged by the kcat/Km ratios. No significant differences have been observed in molecular mass or secondary structure among these enzymes. However, the variant PCCs were less thermostable than the wild-type. Following incubation at 47 °C, blue native-PAGE revealed a lower oligomeric form (α2β2) in the three mutants not detectable in wild-type and the polymorphism. Interestingly, the lower oligomeric form was also observed in the corresponding crude Escherichia coli extracts. Our biochemical data and the structural analysis using a β PCC homology model indicate that the pathogenic nature of these mutations is more likely to be due to a lack of assembly rather than disruption of catalysis. The strong favorable effect of the co-expressed chaperone proteins on PCC folding, assembly, and activity suggest that propionic acidemia may be amenable to chaperone therapy.

Four different biotin-dependent carboxylases are known to play a central role in mammalian metabolic pathways, such as oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids, catabolism of branched amino acids, fatty acid synthesis, and gluconeogenesis. One of these is propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC, 1The abbreviations used are: PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; BN, blue native; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; scPCC, Streptomyces coelicor PCC; MMCoA, methylmalonyl-CoA; TC12S, transcarboxylase 12 S subunit; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; BN, blue native; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; scPCC, Streptomyces coelicor PCC; MMCoA, methylmalonyl-CoA; TC12S, transcarboxylase 12 S subunit; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. EC 6.4.1.3), which catalyzes the conversion of propionyl-CoA to d-methylmalonyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix (1Fenton W.A. Gravel R.A. Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 2165-2204Google Scholar). This enzyme consists of two nonidentical subunits, α and β, encoded by two different nuclear genes, designated PCCA and PCCB, respectively. Structural studies of the human enzyme have indicated that α PCC is 72 kDa in size, whereas β PCC is 54 kDa. Overall, PCC has an α6β6 structure (1Fenton W.A. Gravel R.A. Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R.

Biochem. 1984; 140: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mutations in either gene result in an autosomal recessive disease, propionic acidemia (MIM 606054), which usually presents as a life-threatening ketoacidosis in the neonatal period with protein intolerance, vomiting, failure to thrive, lethargy, and profound metabolic acidosis symptoms. This disease can result in mental retardation and can be sufficiently severe to cause neonatal death (1Fenton W.A. Gravel R.A. Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 2165-2204Google Scholar).The cDNAs for α and β subunits have been cloned (accession numbers X14608 and X73424, respectively) and the structure of the genes has been elucidated (3Ohura T.

With the sequence information available, it has been possible to identify mutations from propionic acidemia patients (8Tahara T. Kraus J.P. Ohura T. Rosenberg L.E. Fenton W.A. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Lamhonwah A.M. Troxel C.E. Schuster S. Gravel R.A. Genomics. 1990; 8: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Ugarte M.

Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Perez B. Desviat L.R. Rodriguez-Pombo P. Clavero S. Navarrete R. Perez-Cerda C. Ugarte M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Currently, ∼52 and 53 mutations have been reported in the PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively (for a continuously updated list of all reported PCC mutations see uchsc.edu/cbs/pcc/pccmain.htm). However, how these mutations affect the enzyme has not yet been established and how each mutation accounts for the patients' phenotype is difficult to determine because most of the propionic acidemia patients are compound heterozygotes. This poor correlation between genotype and phenotype presents a problem in understanding this disease. Our interest is in elucidating the structural and functional consequences of mutations.Because PCC has been expressed in our laboratory in a chaperone-assisted bacterial expression system (13Kelson T.L. Ohura T. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), several other studies have been carried out employing different expression systems and using crude cell extracts to address the effect of variations on stability and/or activity of the enzyme. A large number of PCCB mutations have been studied in the bacterial expression system (14Chloupkova M. Ravn K. Schwartz M. Kraus J.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Chloupkova M. Maclean K.N. Alkhateeb A. Kraus J.P. Hum.

Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1638: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the effect of some PCCB mutations on the α-β heteromeric and β-β homomeric subunit assembly have been studied by a mammalian two-hybrid expression system (19Muro S. Perez B. Rodriguez-Pombo P. Desviat L.R. Perez-Cerda C. Ugarte M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Muro S. Perez B. Desviat L.R. Rodriguez-Pombo P. Perez-Cerda C. Clavero S. Ugarte M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).In our previous expression study (15Chloupkova M. Maclean K.N. Alkhateeb A. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we identified PCCB mutants (R165W, E168K, D178H, P228L, and R410W) that are PCC activity deficient in patient-derived fibroblasts but were found to be capable of expressing wild-type level PCC activity when assembled in our chaperone-assisted E. coli expression system. This result indicated that these mutations exert their pathogenic effect because of an inability to assemble correctly in patients' cells. In this paper, three mutations from this group, R165W, E168K, and R410W, have been chosen for verifying this assumption. The interspecies alignment of the β PCC subunit from different organisms shows that the residues affected by the patient-derived mutations are completely conserved in all homologous proteins studied (18Perez-Cerda C. Clavero S. Perez B. Rodriguez-Pombo P. Desviat L.R. Ugarte M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1638: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting their critical roles in proper protein function and structure (14Chloupkova M. Ravn K. Schwartz M. Kraus J.P. Mol.

Leon-del-Rio A. Italiano I. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar), appears to be the most common disease-causing mutation in Japan (3Ohura T. Narisawa K. Tada K. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Tahara T. Kraus J.P. Ohura T. Rosenberg L.E. Fenton W.A. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). E168K, an allele prevalent in the Spanish and Latin American populations (6Rodriguez-Pombo P. Hoenicka J. Muro S. Perez B.

Genet. 1998; 63: 360-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestation in patients, ranging from severe to mild in both the homozygous and compound heterozygous conditions.Crystal structure of fully assembled PCC is not available as yet. Over 20 years ago, Haase and co-workers (2Haase F.C. Beegen H. Allen S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Haase F.C. Henrikson K.P. Treble D.H. Allen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11994-11999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested, based on electron micrographs of PCC from Mycobacterium smegmatis, that six spherical α subunits on the periphery are attached to a large central hexameric core (β6). Recently, crystal structures of Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase 12 S hexameric subunit (TC-12S) (23Hall P.R. Wang Y.F. Rivera-Hainaj R.E. Zheng X. Pustai-Carey M. Carey P.R. Yee V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2334-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and of Streptomyces coelicor β PCC (scPCC) were reported (24Diacovich L. Mitchell D.L. Pham H. Gago G. Melgar M.M. Khosla C. Gramajo H. Tsai S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14027-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In both cases the β subunits, in the absence of α-subunits, form homohexamers (β6).The R165W mutation is close to the position of E168K. The structural analysis with a β PCC homology model indicated that Arg-165 and Glu-168 form a salt bridge with each other, and contribute to a local hydrogen-bonding network (23Hall P.R. Wang Y.F. Rivera-Hainaj R.E. Zheng X. Pustai-Carey M. Carey P.R. Yee V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2334-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A497V was found to result in some improved characteristics in enzymatic catalysis (15Chloupkova M. Maclean K.N. Alkhateeb A. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is relatively frequent among Spanish patients and was previously thought to be because of a single nucleotide polymorphism (6Rodriguez-Pombo P. Hoenicka J. Muro S. Perez B. Perez-Cerda C.

Here, we present results using our bacterial expression system from which we can obtain ample quantities of PCC enzyme by successfully purifying mutant forms of PCC to homogeneity to define biochemical and structural properties of the mutant proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Protogel acrylamide solution was acquired from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). [14C]NaHCO3 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Purification of Recombinant Human PCC Enzymes from E. coli— Construction of the pPCCAB expression plasmid carrying both PCCA and PCCB sequences was described previously (13Kelson T.L. Ohura T. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Derivatives of this expression construct containing the desired mutations, the conditions for the growth of bacterial cultures, cell harvesting, and preparation of the cell lysate were described previously (14Chloupkova M. Ravn K. Schwartz M. Kraus J.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Chloupkova M. Maclean K.N. Alkhateeb A. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cell debris and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g at 4 °C and the supernatant fractions were further centrifuged for 35 min at 40,000 × g at 4 °C. The final supernatant thus generated was labeled crude extract.Bacterial crude extracts were loaded onto a DEAE DE52 column (5 × 12.5 cm) (Whatman) previously equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, followed by 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5. PCC was eluted with 70 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5. The eluate was concentrated on Amicon using XM50 membranes (Millipore) and then adjusted with 10× PBS buffer to a final concentration of 1× PBS solution. This solution was loaded onto a monomeric avidin column (2.5 × 10 cm) (Pierce) previously equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4. Recombinant PCC was incubated on the affinity column for 30 min and then eluted with 0.5 mm biotin in PBS, pH 7.4, after washing with PBS, pH 7.4. The protein was concentrated on Amicon with XM50 membranes to ∼1–2 ml, and loaded onto a HR Sephacryl™ S-400 size-exclusion column (1.5 × 95 cm) (Amersham Biosciences). One main protein peak was collected. There was a small but much broader peak after this main peak in some of the variants containing primarily free α subunit. The purity of the preparations was ≥95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then stored at a final concentration of 5–10 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, or PBS, pH 7.4, at -80 °C.Protein and Enzyme Assays—PCC activity was assayed as described previously with some modification (25Kalousek F. Darigo M.D. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm ATP, 125 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm propionyl-CoA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, PCC enzyme (∼10 μg of crude extract or 0.1 μg of purified PCC), and 10 mm [14C]bicarbonate (specific activity 2 μCi/μmol) in a final volume of 50 μl, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min and 50 μl of supernatant was dried in a scintillation vial in a heating block at 80 °C for 50 min. The dry residue was dissolved in 0.15 ml of H2O and 4 ml of OPTI-Fluor scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The samples were counted in Beckman LS 3801 scintillation counter. A blank containing the assay mixture without propionyl-CoA was subtracted. Protein was determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of PCC activity is defined as the fixation of 1 μmol of bicarbonate per min at 37 °C into trichloroacetic acid-soluble material.Steady State Kinetics—Kinetic constants were determined in reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 125 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 10 mm [14C]HCO3− with propionyl-CoA concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 9 mm. Reactions were run at 37 °C and reaction velocity was determined by the product amount produced at several time points. Kinetic constants and their standard errors were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation,V=Vmax[S]/(KM+[S])eq.1 using Origin 6.1 software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA).Protein Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) using a 9% separating gel with a 4% stacking gel. Blue native-polyacrylamide gels (BN-PAGE) were prepared as described previously (28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 29Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) with some modification. Samples were loaded onto and run through a 5–13% gradient polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C for about 6–7 h. A high molecular weight calibration kit for electrophoresis (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the protein standard for BN-PAGE. The gels were stained with Simple Blue (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Western blotting transfer and detection conditions were as described previously (14Chloupkova M. Ravn K. Schwartz M. Kraus J.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The PCC antiserum was affinity purified according to the method of Smith and Fisher (30Smith D.E. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar).Far UV Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra were determined with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) at 4 °C using a fused quartz cuvette with 1-mm path length from 200 to 260 nm. Enzyme samples were at concentrations of 0.4–0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5. Data were collected at 0.2-nm increments. The results are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity, [θ]MRE (deg cm2 dmol-1),[θ]MRE=[θ]obs×10−3×(100/[P]nl)eq.2 where [θ]obs is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, [P] is the molar concentration of protein (αβ dimer), n is the number of residues per mol of protein molecule (αβ dimer), and l is the path length in centimeters. The percentages of α-helix and β-sheet were calculated using a prediction program, K2D algorithm (31Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 32Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Moran F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Thermal denaturation experiments were carried out using a Peltier IR cell temperature controller and monitoring the CD changes at 222 nm with the changing temperature. The scans were conducted with protein at about 0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and the temperature was increased at a ramping rate of 1 °C/min from 20 to 90 °C. The data were analyzed according to Pace and Scholtz (33Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1997: 229-321Google Scholar).HPLC Analytical Size-exclusion Chromatography—HPLC analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a BioSep-SEC-S 4000 size column (300 × 7.8 mm, Phenomenex) using a Beckman Gold HPLC system with the following mobile phase: PBS, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was calibrated using the protein standards purchased from Bio-Rad.Thermostability—Thermostability studies of the variant PCCs were carried out in two different ways. In the first case, enzymes (0.01 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C and small aliquots were removed at specific time intervals for activity assays. In the second case, enzymes (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated at three temperatures, 27, 37, and 47 °C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, samples were taken for PCC activity assay and a 6.5-μg aliquot was applied to BN-PAGE. The gels were stained with Simple Blue (Invitrogen).Molecular Modeling—Sequence alignments of human β PCC, five Mycobacterium β PCC from the NCBI data base, TC-12S, and scPCC show similar degrees of sequence conservation of ∼50–70% over the entire polypeptide chain, strongly suggesting similar structures. Additionally, the individual segments that include the mutations are totally conserved among all four sequences. Specifically, these segments are in human β PCC residues 163–169 GARIQEG, residues 407–410 GIIR, and 496–497 AA. Furthermore, the TC-12S crystal structure that was determined first was used to solve the scPCC crystal structure. A homology model of the PCC β6 hexamer was constructed using the TC-12S crystal structure (Protein Data Base code 1ON3) (23Hall P.R. Wang Y.F. Rivera-Hainaj R.E. Zheng X. Pustai-Carey M. Carey P.R. Yee V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2334-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as a template and the InsightII software package (MSI). The amino acid substitutions for the mutations and polymorphism were modeled using O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and molecular figures prepared using Molscript (35Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (36Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression and Purification of the Wild Type and Variant PCCs—The wild-type and variant forms of PCC were overexpressed using our previously described E. coli expression system (13Kelson T.L. Ohura T. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and were purified to near homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). With the exception of the enzyme containing the A497V polymorphism, all of the PCC variants exhibited significantly reduced yield, typically 25% of that obtained for wild-type PCC (Table I). The relative activities of the variant enzymes compared with the wild-type greatly improved after purification. The A497V polymorphism demonstrated 30% higher specific activity than the wild-type enzyme, whereas the three mutants had comparatively lower specific activity, about 30–40% of wild-type PCC.Table ISpecific activity and yield of purified wild-type and mutant PCCsCrude extractPurified proteinYieldSpecific activityRelative activitySpecific activityRelative activityU/mg proteinaU, the fixation of 1 μmol of bicarbonate per min at 37 °C,bThe values of specific activity are expressed as a mean ± S.E. and the values of relative activity represent mean activity compared to wild type PCC% of wild-typebThe values of specific activity are expressed as a mean ± S.E. and the values of relative activity represent mean activity compared to wild type PCCunits/mg proteinaU, the fixation of 1 μmol of bicarbonate per min at 37 °C,bThe values of specific activity are expressed as a mean ± S.E. and the values of relative activity represent mean activity compared to wild type PCC% of wild-typebThe values of specific activity are expressed as a mean ± S.E. and the values of relative activity represent mean activity compared to wild type PCCmg PCC/liter of cultureWild-type0.6610023.35 ± 1.111003.8A497V0.1218.332.34 ± 0.10138.53.1R165W0.0913.89.93 ± 0.3742.50.6E168K0.069.37.54 ± 0.0932.31.0R410W0.0710.29.95 ± 2.2142.611.3a U, the fixation of 1 μmol of bicarbonate per min at 37 °Cb The values of specific activity are expressed as a mean ± S.E. and the values of relative activity represent mean activity compared to wild type PCC Open table in a new tab Kinetic Properties of the Variant PCCs—The steady state kinetic constants of the variants compared with those of wild-type PCC are shown in Table II. We did not observe a significant difference in the Km values for propionyl-CoA among these enzymes. Although the A497V polymorphism had a higher Vmax value compared with the wild-type enzyme, the catalytic efficiency of this polymorphism was not changed based on the kcat/Km ratios. On the other hand, the Vmax and the catalytic efficiency of the three mutants were reduced to about 50% of wild-type PCC.Table IISteady state kinetic constants of wild-type and mutant PCCs The values are expressed as a mean ± S.E., and each experiment was repeated 3–7 times.EnzymeKm(propionyl-CoA)Vmaxkcat/Kmmmunits/mg proteinmm-1 s-1Wild-type0.41 ± 0.0625.4 ± 3.8135.9 ± 7.7A497V0.59 ± 0.0736.6 ± 5.8139.3 ± 26.6R165W0.33 ± 0.067.5 ± 0.654.3 ± 12.3E168K0.28 ± 0.077.2 ± 1.459.0 ± 10.7R410W0.54 ± 0.1016.2 ± 4.261.0 ± 10.4 Open table in a new tab Structural Studies of the Variant PCCs—The next step in our characterization of the variant enzymes was to look for changes in structure of these proteins.

The spectra of the mutant variant PCCs were quite similar to that of wild-type. Based on statistical t tests, there were no significant differences in either α helical content or β sheet content between the variants and wild-type, which were on average about 29 and 18%, respectively (Table III). These results suggest that the substitutions have no significant effect on the secondary structure of mutant PCC proteins.Fig. 2Circular dichroism spectra of wild-type and mutant PCCs. The protein concentrations were 0.5 mg/ml and the path length of the cell was 1 mm. Buffer for CD determination was 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and determinations were performed at 4 °C, 3–6 times for each enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIIApparent molecular mass (m), percentages o"
https://openalex.org/W2002643808,"CAD is a multifunctional protein that initiates and regulates mammaliande novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The activation of the pathwayrequired for cell proliferation is a consequence of the phosphorylation of CADThr-456 by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Although most of the CAD inthe cell was cytosolic, cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy showedthat Thr(P)-456 CAD was primarily localized within the nucleus in associationwith insoluble nuclear substructures, including the nuclear matrix. CAD inresting cells was cytosolic and unphosphorylated. Upon epidermal growth factorstimulation, CAD moved to the nucleus, and Thr-456 was found to bephosphorylated. Mutation of the CAD Thr-456 and inhibitor studies showed thatnuclear import is not mediated by MAP kinase phosphorylation. Two fluorescentCAD constructs, NLS-CAD and NES-CAD, were prepared that incorporated strongnuclear import and export signals, respectively. NLS-CAD was exclusivelynuclear and extensively phosphorylated. In contrast, NES-CAD was confined tothe cytoplasm, and Thr-456 remained unphosphorylated. Although alternativeexplanations can be envisioned, it is likely that phosphorylation occurswithin the nucleus where much of the activated MAP kinase is localized.Trapping CAD in the nucleus had a minimal effect on pyrimidine metabolism. Incontrast, when CAD was excluded from the nucleus, the rate of pyrimidinebiosynthesis, the nucleotide pools, and the growth rate were reduced by 21,36, and 60%, respectively. Thus, the nuclear import of CAD appears to promoteoptimal cell growth. UMP synthase, the bifunctional protein that catalyzes thelast two steps in the pathway, was also found in both the cytoplasm andnucleus.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24809-24817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Stimulation of resting cells by growth factors, such as EGF andplatelet-derived growth factor, activates the MAP kinase (Erk1/2) cascade andtriggers the transition to the proliferating stage(13Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). An important MAP kinasetarget is CAD. Phosphorylation of CAD Thr-456 by MAP kinase, just prior toentry into the S phase of the cell cycle, increases PRPP activation andconverts UTP from an inhibitor to an activator(14Sigoillot F.D. Berkowski A.J. Sigoillot S.M. Kotsis D.H. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3403-3409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The activity of CPSaseis thus stimulated, and the flux through the pathway increases, providingprecursors for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the glycoproteins needed formembrane biosynthesis. As the cells emerge from S phase, Thr-456 isdephosphorylated, and Ser-1406 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A(14Sigoillot F.D. Berkowski A.J. Sigoillot S.M. Kotsis D.H. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3403-3409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As a consequence, theresponse to PRPP reverts to the basal level, and the pathway isdown-regulated. Thus, the growth-dependent up- and down-regulation of thepathway is governed by the sequential phosphorylation of CAD by the MAP kinaseand cAMP-protein kinase A cascades. In accord with this interpretation, thepyrimidine pathway is persistently activated in MCF7 breast cancer cells(15Sigoillot F.D. Sigoillot S.M. Guy H.I. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as a consequence ofelevated MAP kinase activity that results in the continuous phosphorylation ofCAD Thr-456, whereas CAD Ser-1406 remains unphosphorylated. Immunofluorescence microscopy using CAD-specific antibodies(16Chaparian M.G. Evans D.R. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2982-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that CAD in BHKcells was primarily localized in the cytoplasmic compartment where it had agranular appearance, suggestive of association with subcellular structures. Inhuman spermatozoa (17Carrey E.A. Dietz C. Glubb D.M. Loffler M. Lucocq J.M. Watson P.F. Reproduction. 2002; 123: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), someof the cytoplasmic CAD appeared to be associated with the cytoskeleton and tocolocalize to some extent with the mitochondria. Moreover, small but significant amounts of the protein have been observedto be present in the nucleus of BHK cells(16Chaparian M.G. Evans D.R. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2982-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,17Carrey E.A. Dietz C. Glubb D.M. Loffler M. Lucocq J.M. Watson P.F. Reproduction. 2002; 123: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and spermatozoa.Furthermore, histochemical assays of ATCase, one of the components of thebifunctional CAD homolog in yeast, showed that this protein is also partiallynuclear. Following adenovirus infection of HeLa cells, the viral preterminalprotein needed for replication of its genome was found to be anchored in acomplex with CAD to the nuclear matrix near the sites of active replication(18Angeletti P.C. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these experimentswere carried out with fixed cells, but recently a construct encoding CAD fusedto a green fluorescent protein variant was transfected into BHK cells(14Sigoillot F.D. Berkowski A.J. Sigoillot S.M. Kotsis D.H. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3403-3409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CAD was initiallylocalized in the cytoplasm but was translocated to the nucleus during the Sphase of the cell cycle of synchronized transfectants. Although the presence of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes in the nucleusduring S phase to replenish the small, rapidly turning-overdeoxyribonucleotide pools is an attractive idea, the other pathway enzymes,DHOdhase and UMP synthase, are thought to be localized outside the nucleus, anobservation that undermines the logic of this hypothesis. Thus, anunderstanding of the physiological significance of nucleocytoplasmictranslocation of CAD has been elusive. The studies described in this reportshowed that CAD Thr(P)-456 binds to nuclear substructures, that MAPkinase-mediated phosphorylation is not required for nuclear import, that afraction of UMP synthase is nuclear, and that the initial steps of thepyrimidine pathway can occur within the nucleus. Cell Culture—BHK21 cells, a baby hamster kidney cell line,and BHK165-23 (19Wahl G.M. Padgett R.A. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8679-8689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aBHK21-derivative cell line that overproduces CAD 100-fold, were grown in DMEM(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 2 μg/mlgentamicin (Invitrogen). Urd–A cells, a uridine auxotrophlacking CAD (20Patterson D. Carnright D. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 5: 483-495Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), were grownin DMEM/F-12, 8% bovine serum, 30 μm uridine, 2 μg/mlgentamicin. The MCF breast cell lines were a generous gift of Drs. SamuelBrooks, Stephen Santner, and Robert Pauley (Karmanos Cancer Institute,Detroit, MI). MCF10A cells derived from normal breast tissue and MCF7, amalignant breast cancer cell line, were grown as described previously(15Sigoillot F.D. Sigoillot S.M. Guy H.I. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transformed humanembryonic kidney cells (HEK293) (ATCC) were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 2 μg/mlgentamicin. Human mesothelioma CRL2081 cells (a kind gift from ProfessorJean-Jacques Duron, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtriè, Paris,France) were grown in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and 2μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were grown by seeding 1–2 ×106 cells in 75-cm2 T flasks containing 25 ml of media.The media were changed every 2 days. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer,and viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. Preparation and Fractionation of Cell Extracts andOrganelles—All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwiseindicated. Cells were washed twice with PBS (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.2mm PMSF (Sigma) and removed from the growing surface by scraping.The cells from each flask were resuspended in 4 ml of PBS with 0.2mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). After centrifugation at5000 × g for 5 min, the packed cells were resuspended at aconcentration of 3 × 106 cells/0.2 ml of a lysis bufferconsisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF supplemented with a1× mixture of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma). The celllysate was centrifuged 30 min at 23,000 × g. The supernatantwas designated the soluble fraction, and the pellet was resuspended inone-half volume of lysis buffer, sonicated twice for 5 s, incubated withrocking for 20 min, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 23,000 ×g. This supernatant was designated the insoluble fraction. The pelletfrom this second centrifugation step did not contain significant amounts ofCAD or phosphorylated CAD. Nuclei were isolated following a protocol published previously(21Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Ten T75 flaskscorresponding to 1–2 × 108 cells were scraped andrinsed with PBS supplemented with 0.2 mm PMSF and removed byscraping. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 7,000 ×g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of 10mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF and thencentrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet wasresuspended in 3 volumes of the same buffer, incubated on ice for 15 min, andthen lysed in a Wheaton A Dounce using an A pestle (10 strokes). Cell lysiswas monitored by trypan blue staining. The nuclei were isolated bycentrifuging the cell lysate at 4000 × g for 10 min. Thepresence of the nuclear markers lamin B and C23/nucleolin was verified byusing specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The isolated nuclei wereshown to be free of contaminating mitochondria by assaying the DHOdhaseactivity (22Loffler M. Becker C. Wegerle E. Schuster G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thedehydrogenase was found only in the insoluble cytoplasmic fraction containingthe mitochondria. The supernatant obtained after pelleting the nuclei was centrifuged at16,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was designated thesoluble cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was extracted with lysis buffer, andthe insoluble cytoplasmic fraction was prepared as described above. Theisolated nuclei were washed once in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT,0.2 mm PMSF and resuspended in lysis buffer, and the soluble andinsoluble nuclear fractions were prepared as described for the correspondingfractions of the total cell extract. The nuclear matrix was isolated asdescribed previously (18Angeletti P.C. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the isolation of the mitochondria(23Mattoon J. Balcavage W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 135-142Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 1 × 108cells were washed as described above and removed from the growing surface withtrypsin. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 ×g for 10 min, washed with 134 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 2.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1× protease inhibitormixture, and then resuspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold swelling bufferconsisting of 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cellsuspension was lysed by 10 strokes in a Wheaton A Dounce homogenizer with an Apestle. Lysis was monitored by trypan blue staining. A 5× sucrosesolution was immediately added to the lysate to give a final concentration of330 mm sucrose, 6 mm EDTA, and 8.6 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 2600 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant fractions containing the mitochondria werepooled and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Themitochondrial pellet was washed once in a 1× sucrose buffer consistingof 330 mm sucrose, 6 mm EDTA, and 8.6 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and resuspended in Lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl,pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.2mm PMSF supplemented with a 1× mixture of phosphatase andprotease inhibitors). As expected, the isolated mitochondria had DHOdhaseactivity, but no lamin or nucleolin was detected, indicating that thepreparation was not contaminated by nuclei. Construction of Recombinant Plasmids and Mutants—The plasmidpECFP-CAD encoding the entire CAD polypeptide with an enhanced cyanfluorescent protein appended to the amino end(14Sigoillot F.D. Berkowski A.J. Sigoillot S.M. Kotsis D.H. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3403-3409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) served as the parentconstruct. Two new recombinants were engineered in an attempt to localize CADin the nuclear compartment or confine it to the cytosol. The constructpECFP-NLS-CAD included three tandem repeats of the nuclear localization signalsequence from the large T antigen of SV40(24Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar,25Lanford R.E. Kanda P. Kennedy R.C. Cell. 1986; 46: 575-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides encodingcomplementary strands of the NLS targeting sequence were synthesized(Invitrogen) as follows: NLS forward,5′-ccggagatccaaaaaagaagagaaaggtagatccaaaaaagaagagaaaggtagatccaaaaaagaagagaaaggtaggat-3′,and NLS reverse,5′-ccggatcctacctttctcttcttttttggatctacctttctcttcttttttggatctacctttctcttcttttttggatct-3′.The construct pECFP-NES-CAD included the highly active nuclear export sequencefrom human MAP kinase kinase(26Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The nucleotides used inthis construction were NES forward,5′-ccggaaacctggtggacctccaaaagaagctggaggagctggagctggacgagcagcagt-3′,and NES reverse,5′-ccggactgctgctcgtccagctccagctcctccagcttcttttggaggtccaccaggttt-3′.The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl,pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA by heating at 95 °Cfor 15 min and then allowed to gradually cool to room temperature. The5′ ends of the double-stranded fragments were phosphorylated using T4polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and 1 mm ATP and then purifiedwith MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen). For both constructs, thedouble-stranded coding sequences were inserted into the BspEI site that liesbetween the sequences encoding ECFP and CAD of pECFP-CAD. The pECFP-CAD vectorwas cleaved with BspEI; the singly cut plasmid was isolated anddephosphorylated with thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) andrepurified using the PCR purification kit. Ligations were carried out using 20fmol of dephosphorylated linear pECFP-CAD and 200 fmol 5′ ends of eitherNLS or NES double-stranded fragments. The ligation mixture was transformedinto competent subcloning efficiency DH5α Escherichia colicells, and the fidelity of the constructs was verified by restrictiondigestion and sequencing. Human DHOdhase and UMP synthase coding sequences were amplified by PCRusing as templates the ATCC clones ATCC79564 (pPYRD) and MGC-4244,respectively, and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR products wereinserted into the entry vector, pENTR/S.D./D-TOPO (Gateway System,Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. Fidelity was verified bynucleotide sequencing. The DHOdhase entry recombinant was subcloned intopcDNA-DEST47 for mammalian expression as a fusion protein upstream of the GFPsequence. The UMP synthase entry recombinant was subcloned into pcDNA-DEST53for mammalian expression as a fusion protein with GFP on the amino end. PCR site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) andthe full-length CAD clone as a template was used to replace the Thr-456 codon(ACA) in the CAD MAP kinase site with alanine (GCA) and glutamate (GAA). Transfection—The E. coli transformants werecultured overnight in Luria Broth/100 μg/ml kanamycin, and the plasmidswere purified using the plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen). BHK21 orUrd–A cells were transiently transfected with LipofectaminePlus reagents (Invitrogen) using 2 μg of the DNA following themanufacturer's protocol. After 8 h, the transfection medium was replaced withDMEM complete media. The expression of the recombinant proteins was monitoredby fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting using CAD rabbit polyclonalantibodies. The recombinant proteins were fluorescent and had the expectedsize on calibrated SDS gels. Stably transfected cell lines were obtained by plating 0.5 ×106 Urd–A cells into 6-well plates and allowed togrow for 24 h in DMEM/F-12, 8% bovine serum, 30 μm uridine, 2μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were transfected using 1 μg of the plasmidspECFP-CAD, pECFP-NLS-CAD, and pECFP-NES-CAD as described above for thetransient transfections. The cells were allowed to grow in medium with uridinefor 48 h and passed into T75 flasks in medium without uridine. Cellsexpressing CAD were able to grow in the absence of uridine. After threesubpassages, total protein extracts were prepared, and Western blot analysisusing CAD and Aequorea victoria epitope antibodies (detects GFP,Clontech) revealed the presence of the fusion proteins of the appropriatemolecular weights. Immunoblotting—The following antibodies were used forimmunoblotting: diphospho-Erks (anti-Thr-202/Tyr-204 phosphorylated p44/p42,Cell Signaling Technology) mouse monoclonal antibodies; horseradish peroxidase(Cell Signaling Technology) rabbit polyclonal antibodies; green fluorescentprotein (Clontech) rabbit polyclonal antibodies; CAD Thr(P)-456 antibodies(Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and rabbit polyclonal CAD antibodies made in thelaboratory (27Grayson D.R. Lee L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-gelelectrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels(28Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting werecarried out as described previously(11Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—For fixed cells, 0.5–1.0× 106 BHK21 or Urd–A cells were plated in6-well plates containing glass coverslips and grown as described above for24–48 h at 37 °C to obtain exponentially growing cultures. Allfurther steps were carried out at room temperature. The cells were fixed with10% formalin (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min and then permeabilized by incubationwith 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min. The cells were washed threetimes with PBS for 5 min without shaking and then incubated with 1% bovineserum albumin in PBS for 90 min. The cells were then incubated with CAD rabbitpolyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution) or CAD Thr(P)-456 mouse polyclonalantibodies (1:200 dilution) for 2 h. After three 5-min washes with PBS, thesecondary antibody, either goat anti-rabbit γ-globulin conjugated toAlexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence, 1:4000-fold dilution, Molecular Probes)or goat anti-mouse γ-globulin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (redfluorescence, 1:3000-fold dilution, Molecular Probes), in 1% bovine serumalbumin/PBS solution was added, and the cells were allowed to incubate for 1 hand then washed with gentle shaking three times for 5 min with PBS. For someexperiments, the DNA stain, Hoechst 33342 (bisbenzimide trihydrochloride,Sigma), and Mitotracker Red CM-H2Xros (Molecular Probes) were addedat 10 μg/ml and 250 ng/ml final concentration, respectively, 15 min priorto the final washing steps. The coverslips were drained and then mounted onglass slides with 1 drop of Mowiol (2.4 g of Mowiol (Calbiochem) and 6 g ofglycerol in dissolved 6 ml of sterile water and then diluted with 12 ml ofTris-HCl, pH 7.5). The slides were allowed to dry at room temperatureovernight in the dark. Live cells were visualized directly using a waterimmersion lens. Fluorescence microscopy of both fixed and live cells wascarried out using a Zeiss Axiophot upright epifluorescent digital microscope(Karmanos Confocal Imaging Facility). Photographs were obtained using a SPOTRT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) coupled to a Macintosh personalcomputer with the SPOT software version 3.0. Overlays of the micrographs wereprepared using Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.). Confocal Microscopy—The specimens for confocal microscopywere prepared following essentially the same protocol except that fixation wasfor 10 min in methanol/acetone (7:3, v/v) at 20 °C; the fixed cells wereincubated for 90 min with the primary antibodies; and each antibody, bothprimary and secondary, was diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2% fetal calfserum. The specimens were examined with a Leica TCS4D laser-scanning confocalmicroscope (Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtriè, Paris, France).Cells incubated with only the secondary antibodies served as a control toassess background fluorescence levels.

Intracellular Distribution of CAD—Immunoblots probed withCAD antibodies (Fig.1A) showed that following centrifugation most of the CADin BHK165-23 cell extracts was soluble, but a significant fraction could beextracted from the insoluble material in the pellet. In contrast, immunoblotsprobed with CAD Thr(P)-456-specific antibodies showed that whereas thephosphorylated protein was present in relatively small amounts in the solublefraction, most of the phosphorylated protein was found in the insolublefraction. The BHK165-23 cell line overproduced CAD as a consequence ofextensive duplication of the gene; however, the observed partitioning of theprotein was not peculiar to this cell line. The same distribution of CAD andphosphorylated CAD (Fig.1B) was also observed in the normal breast cell lineMCF10A, the tumorigenic breast cell line MCF7, human mesothelioma cellsCRL2081, human embryonic kidney cells 293, and in baby hamster kidney cellsBHK21.

ApoE4 differs from the two other common isoforms (apoE2 and apoE3) by its lower resistance to denaturation and greater propensity to form partially folded intermediates. As a first step to determine the importance of stability differences in vivo, we reengineered a partially humanized variant of the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE (T61R mouse apoE) to acquire a destabilized conformation like that of apoE4. For this process, we determined the crystal structure of wild-type mouse apoE, which, like apoE4, forms a four-helix bundle, and identified two structural differences in the turn between helices 2 and 3 and in the middle of helix 3 as potentially destabilizing sites. Introducing mutations G83T and N113G at these sites destabilized the mouse apoE conformation. The mutant mouse apoE more rapidly remodeled phospholipid than T61R mouse apoE, which supports the hypothesis that a destabilized conformation promotes apoE4 lipid binding.

ApoE3 has a cysteine at position 112 and a arginine at 158, and apoE2 has cysteines and apoE4 has arginines at both positions (14Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9077-9083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sequence differences result in structural and biophysical properties that alter function and hence likely affect disease. In apoE4, the two modular domains interact in a unique manner known as domain interaction (15Dong L.-M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol.

Arg-112 in apoE4 causes the Arg-61 side chain to adopt a different conformation than it has in apoE2 and apoE3, allowing it to form a putative salt-bridge with Glu-255 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (16Dong L.-M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of apoE4 is the least resistant to chemical and thermal denaturation and that of apoE2 is most resistant (20Morrow J.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Knapp M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of apoE4 also most readily forms partially folded intermediates that have characteristics of a molten globule state (21Morrow J.A. Hatters D.M. Lu B. Höchtl P. Oberg K.A. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50380-50385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that molten globules are common and mediate a wide variety of physiological processes, including translocation across membranes, increased affinity for membranes, binding to liposomes and phospholipids, protein trafficking, extracellular secretion, and cell cycle regulation (23Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As one explanation for functional differences among the isoforms in vivo, we and others have suggested that partially folded intermediates provide apoE with greater conformational adaptability to bind to phospholipids (21Morrow J.A.

Previously, our laboratory introduced domain interaction into mouse apoE. Gene targeting was used to replace the threonine at the mouse equivalent of position 61 with an arginine (T61R), which resulted in an apoE4-like lipoprotein binding preference (25Raffaï R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), a characteristic of domain interaction. However, unlike apoE4, T61R mouse apoE folds highly cooperatively and lacks apparent folding intermediates. To gain in-sight into how differences in isoform stability affect phenotype and disease, we sought to introduce into T61R mouse apoE the reduced folding stability characteristic of apoE4. The objective here was to further humanize mouse apoE by replacing residues with those from apoE4 that destabilize the conformation. An empirical approach was taken to change the urea-denaturation curve of T61R mouse apoE to resemble that of apoE4. The crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of wild-type mouse apoE was determined to identify potential structural differences between apoE4 and mouse apoE that might result in packing differences leading to differences in the urea denaturation curves. Protein Expression and Purification—cDNAs corresponding to the amino-terminal domains of human and mouse apoE were cloned into pET32a as an amino-terminal thioredoxin-his-tag fusion. Mutants were generated with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and DNA sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as described (26Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After expression of a 6-liter culture, the cells were resuspended in 30 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.0005% sodium azide (TBS). The cells were frozen, thawed, and lysed by sonication, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) powder (1.8 g) was added to the cell lysate, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 24 °C and dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with two buffer changes. The fusion protein was cleaved by adding 1 mg of bovine α-thrombin, and the mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature. The apoE·DMPC complexes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation: 0.3265 g/ml KBr was added to the lysate and overlaid with 1.48 m potassium bromide, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, in a Beckman/Coulter Quick-Seal tube; centrifugation was at 55,000 rpm for 12 h in a Beckman Ti60 rotor at 15 °C. The floated pellet was collected by slicing the tube. The DMPC·apoE fraction was dialyzed exhaustively against 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized, delipidated, and purified by gel filtration as described (26Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For crystallization, a final anion-exchange chromatography step involved DEAE-resin and a linear salt gradient. Protein concentrations were determined with the Lowry assay with bovine serum albumin as the mass standard. Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—Crystals were grown by the hanging drop technique with 1.9 mg/ml of mouse apoE and 42.5% saturated sodium malonate, pH 7.2, 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.7. Diffraction data were collected at beam line 7-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The data collection statistics are summarized in Table I.

The urea concentration was determined by measurement of the refractive index as described (31Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were collected of the apoE 22-kDa fragment (0.5 mg/ml) in 0-8 m urea, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Samples were preincubated overnight at 4 °C before the spectroscopic analysis, and data were collected at 24 °C using a 1-mm path length cuvette and an Applied Biophysics π-180 or Jasco J-720 CD spectrometer with a 1000-ms acquisition time. Ellipticity at 222 nm served as an indicator of secondary structure (which is predominately α-helical in the folded state), and data were adjusted to the fraction unfolded assuming that the protein is 100% unfolded in 8 m urea. DMPC Turbidity-clearance Assays—Samples of the apoE 22-kDa fragment (1 mg/ml) were prepared in 1 mm Tris-carboxyethylphosphine and 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0 (buffer A). DMPC was prepared at 5 mg/ml in buffer A, incubated at 42 °C for 20 min, and extruded through a 100-nm pore filter (Lipex pressure extruder). The resulting large unilamellar vesicles were diluted to 1 mg/ml in buffer A. The vesicles, protein samples, and spectrophotometer cuvette holding block were pre-equilibrated at 26 °C overnight. Samples of apoE or buffer A (200 μl) were mixed rapidly with vesicles (400 μl), and turbidity was monitored by absorbance at 325 nm for 20 min at 26 °C. Cuvettes were pre-equilibrated at 26 °C for 10 min before use. Differences in the Urea Denaturation Curves of the Amino-terminal Domain of Mouse and Human ApoE—Urea denaturation studies showed that the amino-terminal domain of apoE4 has a lower apparent conformational stability than apoE3 and apoE2 and a greater tendency to form partially folded intermediates, as revealed by a less cooperative transition from the folded state to the unfolded state (21Morrow J.A. Hatters D.M. Lu B. Höchtl P. Oberg K.A. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50380-50385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The denaturation curve of T61R mouse apoE displayed greater cooperativity than apoE3 and apoE4 and unfolded at urea concentrations more similar to that at which apoE3 unfolds than apoE4 (Fig. 1). Wild-type mouse apoE had a denaturation curve similar to that of T61R mouse apoE (Fig. 1). Structural Comparison of the Amino-terminal Domain of Mouse and Human ApoE—The crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of wild-type mouse apoE was determined to a resolution of 2.1 Å and used to find clues for packing differences with apoE4 that may influence folding and stability. The x-ray diffraction data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Excluding the eight additional amino-terminal residues of human apoE, the amino-terminal domains of mouse apoE and apoE4 differ at 35 sequence positions, corresponding to 81% sequence identity (Fig. 2). The overall fold of the amino-terminal domain of wild-type mouse apoE is similar to apoE4 (Fig. 3 (32Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar)). Except for residues 9-11, 166-172, and 186-191, the residues of the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE are clearly visible in the final electron density map.Fig. 3Stereo image of an overlay of the crystal structures of the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE and apoE4. The α-carbon traces of apoE4 (blue) and mouse apoE (orange) are shown. The backbone deviation between helices 2 and 3 in each crystal form is 0.5-1.0 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE, like that of apoE4, forms a four-helix bundle, there are structural differences. Alignment of the mouse and human structures along helices 1 and 2 shows that relative to apoE4 helices 3 and 4 (of the amino-terminal domain) of mouse apoE are shifted in a direction roughly parallel to the helical axis of helix 3. In addition, helices 1, 2, and 4 are longer in mouse apoE than in apoE4. A crystal contact at residue 20 in mouse apoE likely stabilizes the extension of helix 1; in apoE4 no such contact occurs. A crystal contact at residue 126 of mouse apoE, which is not seen in apoE4, likely influences the structure of the loop between helices 3 and 4 (residues 120-130). Two Structural Differences at Positions 83 and 113 Are Mediated by Sequence Differences—After exclusion of the crystal contact sites, two key structural differences result from the sequence differences. The loop between helices 2 and 3 (residues 81-86) forms a tight turn in mouse apoE but is more extended and relaxed in all crystal structures of human apoE (33Segelke B.W. Forstner M. Knapp M. Trakhanov S.D. Parkin S. Newhouse Y.M. Bellamy H.D. Weisgraber K.H. Rupp B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This difference reflects the cis conformation of Gly-83 in mouse apoE, which cannot be sterically accommodated by Thr-83 in apoE4 (Fig. 4A). In mouse apoE, helix 2 has one more helical turn than apoE4, and the dipoles of helices 2 and 3 are less parallel (Fig. 4B). The other major difference is at residue 113, where mouse apoE contains asparagine, and apoE4 contains glycine (Fig. 4, B and C). Asn-113 in mouse apoE lies in a straight portion of helix 3, but the Gly-113 in apoE4 lies at a pronounced kink and cannot form the same hydrogen bond with Arg-112 that is formed by Asn-113 in mouse apoE (Fig. 4C). The result is a reduced local hydrogen bond network (Fig. 4C and Table II). In addition, because glycines have high configurational entropy, localized flexibility in the middle of helix 3 caused by Gly-113 may account for the lower stability and greater propensity of apoE4 to form partially folded intermediates. The net effects of both sequence differences at positions 83 and 113 are a greater stabilization of helix 3 and a more parallel alignment of the dipoles of helices 2 and 3 in mouse apoE than in apoE4 (Fig. 4B). Thus, these data suggest that these two sequence differences contribute to the differences in the human and mouse urea denaturation curves.Table IIPotential hydrogen bonds in mouse apoE and human apoE4 near 112MouseApoE4DistanceResidueDistanceResidueÅÅArg-112NH13.53W2 OH2.94109 OE1Arg-112NH13.68W1 OHArg-112NH22.36T61 OG13.29W 38 OH2aNot shown in picture.Arg-112NE3.35N113 OD13.23T 57 OArg-113ND23.44W1 OHa Not shown in picture. Open table in a new tab Introducing ApoE4 Residues at Positions 83 and 113 Destabilizes T61R Mouse ApoE—Thr-83 and Gly-113 of apoE4 were introduced into T61R mouse apoE with the prediction that they would destabilize the global conformation. The urea denaturation curves showed that the mutants unfolded in urea more readily than T61R mouse apoE and that the mutations had additive effects in destabilizing the conformation (Fig. 5A). The triple mutant mouse apoE (T61R, G83T, N113G) and apoE4 displayed similar denaturation curves in the range of 0-4.5 m urea, suggesting that the mutations at position 83 and 113 account for the largest effects on the differences in stability between T61R mouse E and apoE4 (Fig. 5B). Seven more mutants were made to probe the influence of other structural differences. We introduced apoE4 residues at Q52L and/or H123Q, which occur at sites of crystal contacts, or apoE4 residues M114L and M149L together, which correlate with differences in the packing of the core into T61R mouse apoE. These mutations had only marginal effects on the urea denaturation curves (data not shown). Three other mutants were made with the T61R, G83T, N113G backbone that introduced nonconservative sequence differences, all with minimal effects on stability. Introducing the apoE4 residues G94S and N120G or the group of residues N23G, G94S, N120G, P25R, G116V, and Q28L slightly reduced folding cooperativity and stability (Fig. 5B). Introduction of all apoE4 residues (i.e. the apoE4 sequence without the first eight amino acids) yielded a urea denaturation curve similar to that of apoE4 (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the additional eight residues in apoE4 play a minor role in stability. In contrast to mutations G83T and N113G, this collection of seven group mutations have minor effects on the urea denaturation curve. Destabilizing Mutations, G83T and N113G, Increase Lipid Binding of T61R Mouse ApoE—Because stability differences in the amino-terminal domains of human apoE isoforms correlate inversely with lipid binding (21Morrow J.A.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1688-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we examined the lipid binding of destabilized mouse apoE. Lipid binding was assessed with a standard apolipoprotein lipid binding assay that examines the ability of apoE to remodel large unilamellar vesicles of DMPC (35Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Upon binding to DMPC vesicles, apoE forms smaller apoE·DMPC particles, thereby decreasing the turbidity of the solution (36Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40723-40729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Of the human isoforms, apoE4 clears the turbidity fastest, followed by apoE3 and apoE2 (21Morrow J.A. Hatters D.M. Lu B. Höchtl P. Oberg K.A. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50380-50385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of apoE4 cleared the turbidity in an exponential decay-like manner and much faster than T61R mouse apoE (Fig. 6). The destabilizing mutations, G83T and N113G, each cleared faster than T61R mouse apoE, and both mutations together further increased the clearance rate (Fig. 6). Our objective in this study was to introduce instability into the mouse apoE mutant (T61R) that displays domain interaction, making it more apoE4-like. Based on a comparison of the x-ray crystal structures of the amino-terminal domains of human apoE4 and wild-type mouse apoE, we identified two potential structural differences in the loop connecting helices 2 and 3 (position 83) and the middle of helix 3 (position 113) that likely would affect stability. Although there are several other differences between human and mouse apoE, we found that introduction of human residues G83T and N113G into the loop between helices 2 and 3 and the middle of helix 3 were all that was required to mimic the unfolding behavior of apoE4 (Fig. 7). The destabilized T61R mouse apoE has increased lipid binding properties, demonstrating an analogous functional switch from apoE3-like to apoE4-like. It is interesting that stability of the apoE isoforms (apoE4 < apoE3 < apoE2) parallels the relative susceptibility of carriers of these isoforms to Alzheimer disease. This new model of apoE4 will be useful for testing and exploring the cooperative or additive effects of both domain interaction and a lower stability. Furthermore, because T61R introduces domain interaction into wild-type mouse apoE, a mouse model specific for apoE4-reduced stability but without domain interaction can be made by the mutation E255A (16Dong L.-M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For several other proteins, mutations or conditions that destabilize the native conformation also facilitate the formation of aggregates with properties of amyloid fibrils, which consist of an ordered polymer of β-strands (37Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B.

Thus, the destabilization of the compactly folded state of apoE, although advantageous for lipid binding, may predispose misfolding into amyloid fibrils. This could provide a basis for amyloid formation because amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer patients show apoE immunoreactivity (40Namba Y. Tomonaga M. Kawasaki H. Otomo E. Ikeda K. Brain Res. 1991; 541: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 41Wisniewski T. Lalowski M. Golabek A. Vogel T. Frangione B. Lancet. 1995; 345: 956-958Abstract PubMed Google Scholar). The apoE isoforms differ in their ability to promote amyloid formation by Aβ. In vitro, co-incubation of purified apoE with Aβ, promotes Aβ fibrillization, and the fibrils are coated with apoE (42Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Russell S.J. Mahley R.W. Huang D. Saunders A. Schmechel D. Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Roses A.D. Strittmatter W.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). ApoE4 facilitates the formation of a more extensive matrix of Aβ fibrils than does apoE3, as assessed by electron microscopy (42Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Russell S.J. Mahley R.W. Huang D.

In mouse models of Alzheimer disease (i.e. mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein and human apoE isoforms) apoE4 is more effective in promoting the deposition of Aβ than apoE3 (45Bales K.R.

Furthermore, in apoE knock-out mice expressing human apoE isoforms, apoE4 drives the nucleation and aggregation of immunopositive Aβ deposits to a greater extent than apoE3 (50Dolev I. Michaelson D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13909-13914Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Differences in the co-aggregation of the apoE isoforms with Aβ may provide a mechanism for the acceleration of Aβ nucleation, polymerization, and plaque formation. The enhanced lipid remodeling properties of a destabilized apoE could also influence cellular functioning and result in pathologic effects. ApoE4, but not apoE3, potentiates Aβ-induced lysosomal leakage in cultured neuronal cells, suggesting that apoE4 destabilizes lysosomal membrane integrity cooperatively with Aβ (51Ji Z.-S.

Our results support the hypothesis that the greater phospholipid binding ability of destabilized variants apoE accounts for greater permeabilization of phospholipid membranes. A mouse model of apoE4 conformational stability will be a valuable tool for studying potential mechanisms. In addition, this system will provide a unique model for exploring the role of conformational stability in protein function and pathology directly in vivo.

Trends Biochem.Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). PP5 (also termed PPT infungi) was identified in 1994 by three independent groups(2Becker W. Kentrup H.

PP5 appears to be ubiquitous ineukaryotes (5Andreeva A.V. Kutuzov M.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recent yearshave seen a steadily increasing number of publications addressing the ways ofPP5 regulation and its roles in intracellular signaling. A variety ofPP5-interacting proteins has been reported; interestingly, all knowninteractions require the TPR domain of PP5. A significant proportion of PP5 in the cell is bound to a molecularchaperone Hsp90 and is a component of glucocorticoid receptor-Hsp90heterocomplexes (6Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,7Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Chen M.S. Owens-Grillo J.K. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.Chem. 1999; 272: 16224-16230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Hsp90-associated PP5 wasfound to regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of glucocorticoid receptors(8Dean D.A. Urban G. Aragon I.V. Swingle M. Miller B. Rusconi S. Bueno M. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Another function ofHsp90-associated PP5 is suggested by the finding that it negatively modulatesmaturation of the Hsp90-dependent heme-regulated eIF2α kinase(9Shao J. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6770-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whereas PP5 was initially reported to be predominantly nuclear, laterstudies established that it is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm(reviewed in Ref. 4Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently,the ability of PP5 to translocate to the nucleus during apoptosis has beenreported (10Shinoda S. Skradski S.L. Araki T. Schindler C.K. Meller R. Lan J.Q. Taki W. Simon R.P. Henshall D.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2065-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PP5 has anatypical nuclear localization signal in its C-terminal extension(11Borthwick E.B. Zeke T. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic PP5 has beenfound to interact with the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein and tocolocalize with both cytoplasmic dynein and microtubules(12Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Murphy P.J. Chinkers M. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Zhang M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13602-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Copurification of PP5with microtubules has also been documented, as well as its ability todephosphorylate a microtubule-associated protein tau in vitro(13Gong C.X. Liu F. Wu G. Rossie S. Wegiel J. Li L. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J.Neurochem. 2004; 88: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); physiological relevanceof the latter observation has not yet been demonstrated. PP5 participates in the regulation of the cell cycle in a dual way. (i) Itbinds to CDC16 and CDC27, two subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex, andis thought to maintain it in an inactive dephosphorylated state(14Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32011-32018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). (ii) It regulatestranscriptional induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 (a universal inhibitor ofcyclin-dependent protein kinases), presumably by directly controllingphosphorylation status of p53(15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recentstudy (16Urban G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Cowsert L. Cooper S.R. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol.Chem. 2003; 278: 9747-9753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) has suggested alink between glucocorticoid receptor activation and the phosphorylation statusof p53 that regulates expression of p21WAF1/Cip1. Therefore, PP5appears to control two distinct steps of the signaling pathway that linksglucocorticoid receptor activation and cell growth arrest. A link between PP5 and G protein-coupled signaling has recently been found.PP5 directly interacts with and is stimulated byGα12/Gα13(17Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1353-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, underredox stress PP5 associates with and inhibits apoptosis signal-regulatingkinase 1 (ASK1) (18Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBOJ. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,19Zhou G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol.

Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol.Chem. 1998; 273: 27816-27823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Potential interplaybetween PP5, Gα12/Gα13, and ASK1 is furthercomplicated by the fact that Gα12(21Vaiskunaite R. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46088-46093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and PP5 (see above) bothinteract with Hsp90. In addition to the above findings, which already suggest PP5 involvement inelaborate signaling pathways, interaction of this phosphatase with a number ofother proteins has been reported although functional significance of theseinteractions is less clear. Interaction of PP5 with atrial natriuretic factorreceptor (ANP) has been detected using yeast two-hybrid screening(4Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There is extensive butindirect evidence for the involvement of PP5 in regulation of K+channels (reviewed in Ref. 4Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).PP5 has also been reported to associate with both isoforms of chryptochromes(blue light photoreceptors) and to be stimulated by at least one of them(22Zhao S. Sancar A. Photochem.Photobiol. 1997; 66: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, adistantly related plant PPP phosphatase PP7, which has no TPR domain butshares with PP5 a common atypical nuclear targeting signal(23Andreeva A.V. Kutuzov M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2001; 4: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), has recently beenimplicated in signaling downstream of cryptochromes(24Møller S.G. Kim Y.S. Kunkel T. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because animal and plantchryptochromes are thought to have evolved from DNA photolyases independently(25Cashmore A.R. Jarillo J.A. Wu Y.J. Liu D.M. Science. 1999; 284: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), this may suggestconvergent evolution not only of these photoreceptors but also of thesignaling mechanisms they trigger. PP5 has also been found to interact withscaffold proteins, such as calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteinscopines (26Tomsig J.L. Snyder S.L. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10048-10054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the A subunitof the protein phosphatase PP2A(27Lubert E.J. Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38582-38587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another protein thatinteracts with both PP5 and PP2A is G5PR, homologous to B″ subunit ofPP2A (28Kono Y. Maeda K. Kuwahara K. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Yonezawa K. Takagi K. Sakaguchi N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Functionalsignificance of these interactions remains to be tested. In contrast to the wealth of data about interactive partners of PP5,relatively little is known about its potential regulation by low molecularweight compounds or second messengers. Arachidonic acid and otherpolyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as phospholipids, were found to stimulatePP5 via its TPR domain (6Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,29Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol.

Whereas polyunsaturatedfatty acids are known to exert physiologically relevant effects, theirconcentrations required for PP5 stimulation in vitro are higher thanthose thought to occur in vivo. Ramsey and Chinkers(31Ramsey A.J. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5625-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have recently found thatlong chain fatty acid-CoA esters (with acyl chain length of 12–20 carbonatoms, saturated or not) are more potent stimulators of PP5 thanpolyunsaturated fatty acids and suggested that these compounds may bephysiological stimulators of this phosphatase. Natural polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are ubiquitouscations found in almost any living organism, which are able to bind to nucleicacids and to acidic phospholipids in the membranes(32Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Polyamines are involvedin diverse functions such as control of cell cycle and apoptosis, DNAconformation and stability, regulation of transcription, ion channelregulation, and protein phosphorylation(32Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 33Williams K. Biochem.J. 1997; 325: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 34Thomas T.

Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).Because of the role of polyamines in regulation of cell proliferation,polyamine analogs have been envisaged as possible anti-cancer drugs(36Thomas T.

Although only a limitednumber of proteins are known that are specifically regulated by polyamines, atleast on one occasion polyamines have been shown to act as signaling molecules(38Aizenman C.D. Muñoz-Elias G. Cline H.T. Neuron. 2002; 16: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We report here that PP5 is strongly inhibited by micromolar concentrationsof a polyamine spermine. We demonstrate that polyamine levels modulateactivation of ASK1, thought to be a physiological substrate of PP5 and affectASK1-induced apoptotic signaling in vivo. This implicates polyamines,emerging intracellular signaling molecules, as potential physiologicalregulators of PP5. Our findings also suggest a novel mechanism of theanti-apoptotic action of a decrease in polyamine levels via de-inhibition ofPP5 and accelerated dephosphorylation and deactivation of ASK1. Expression in Escherichia coli and Purification of RecombinantPP5—pET15b-PP5 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. Chinkers(University of South Alabama). PP5 was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS E.coli cells (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions,except that expression was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 13 °C overnight.Cells from 1 liter of culture were harvested by centrifugation and resuspendedin a lysis buffer, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, and a mixture of proteaseinhibitors (Sigma). After sonication, lysate was centrifuged in an SS-34 rotor(Sorvall) at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, supernatant mixed with a suspension of 5ml of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), and incubated on a shaker for 1 h at 4 °C.Suspension was then poured into a column, gel washed with the lysis buffer,and proteins eluted by a stepwise gradient of imidazole of up to 250mm. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and if necessary dilutedwith lysis buffer without imidazole and rechromatographed on Ni-NTA. For finalpurification, fractions eluted from Ni-NTA agarose were diluted to decreaseNaCl concentration to 30 mm, and applied on a 3-ml DEAE-Sepharose(Sigma) column. Proteins were eluted by a stepwise NaCl gradient in 20mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractionscontaining PP5 were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation in Centriconunits (Millipore) to yield 10 mg/ml protein concentration. Purified PP5 wasstored in aliquots at –80 °C. PP5 and ASK1 Immunoprecipitation from COS-7 Cells—ConfluentCOS-7 cells on a 10-cm plate were transfected with 2 μg of pCMV6-FLAG-PP5(kindly provided by Dr. M. Chinkers) or pcDNA-3-HA-ASK1(20Berestetskaya Yu V. Faure M.P. Ichijo H. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol.Chem. 1998; 273: 27816-27823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitationof activated ASK1, 1 mm H2O2 was added to thegrowth medium 15 min prior to cell collection. Cells were solubilized in 2 mlof 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5%lubrol, 1:200 dilution of proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) by passingthrough a 25-gauge needle. Debris was pelleted, supernatants supplemented with5 μg of M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or F-7 HA antibody (Santa CruzBiotechnology) and 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose suspension (Santa CruzBiotechnology), and rotated for 5 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beadswere pelleted and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice withthe same buffer without lubrol. PP5 was eluted with 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide(Sigma) in lysis buffer without lubrol for 15 min at room temperature. ASK1and PP5 preparations were stored at –20 °C in a 1:1 mixture ofglycerol and lysis buffer without lubrol. Phosphatase Assays—Phosphatase assays withp-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) were performed as follows.PP5 was diluted to 50–100 nm (final concentrations) with 40mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 nm bovine serum albumin, andvarying concentrations of spermine. Reactions were started by addition ofpNPP to 1.25 mm (final concentration) from a stocksolution (25 mm) adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.5. Reaction wascontinuously monitored by measuring absorption at 410 nm. Reaction rates werecalculated from the linear parts of the plots using a molecular absorptioncoefficient of 15 × 103 mol liter–1cm–1. Colorimetric phosphatase assays with phosphocasein(Sigma C5890) were performed using the procedure of Ekman and Jäger(39Ekman P. Jäger O. Anal.Biochem. 1993; 214: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For In vitro ASK1 dephosphorylation assays, ASK1 isolated fromCOS-7 cells as described above was autophosphorylated in a buffer containing20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 8μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) for 15 min at roomtemperature, beads were washed three times in the same buffer without ATP, andstored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol. Autophosphorylated ASK1 wasincubated at room temperature with PP5 isolated from COS-7 cells underconditions indicated in the figure legends. Dephosphorylation reaction wasstarted by addition of [γ-32P]ASK1 and stopped by addition oftrichloroacetic acid and bovine serum albumin to 15% and 0.2 mg/ml,respectively. Proteins were precipitated by centrifugation, and phosphatereleased into supernatants was quantitated by scintillation counting. PP5 Suppression using PP5 siRNA—siRNA-mediated suppressionof PP5 was performed essentially according to Ref.19Zhou G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46595-46605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar. siRNA for PP5 suppression(PP5TG2) and mismatched control (PP5TG2MM) were synthesized by Invitrogen. In Vivo ASK1 Phosphorylation Assay—Cells were grown in24-well plates and subjected to oxidative stress by addition of 1mm H2O2 (final concentration). After variousincubation times, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-bufferedsaline, resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 25mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, lysedby addition of a standard Laemmli SDS buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Celllysates were separated on 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels andproteins transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Osmonics).Membranes were probed with phospho-ASK1(Thr845) polyclonal antibody(Cell Signaling Technology) and developed using ECL Plus reagents (AmershamBiosciences). Densitometry of ASK1 bands was performed on scanned images usingNIH Image 1.63 software. Data were normalized to total ASK1 content inrespective samples. For data normalization, membranes were reprobed with ASK1monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), recognizing ASK1independently of its phosphorylation state. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-induced ASK1 dephosphorylation wascalculated for each time point as the difference between the amounts ofASK1(pThr845) in DFMO-treated and -untreated samples, normalized tountreated samples. To assess the effects of PP5 inhibition on DFMO-inducedASK1 dephosphorylation, time points were chosen where the effect of DFMO wasmaximal without PP5 inhibition. DFMO-induced ASK1 dephosphorylation was thencalculated at corresponding (or adjacent if greater, see figure legends) timepoints in the cells treated with okadaic acid or subjected to siRNA-mediatedPP5 depletion. If DFMO-induced dephosphorylation in the PP5-inhibited sampleswas negative (i.e. the amount of ASK1(pThr845) was greaterin the DFMO-treated than in untreated cells) it was taken as 0. The valueswere expressed as a percentage of those in the respective control cells. Apaired two-tailed Student's t test was used to assess statisticalsignificance. In the experiments involving PP5 depletion by siRNA, the extentof depletion was tested using PP5 monoclonal antibody (Cell SignalingTechnology) and equal loading was checked with α-tubulin andβ-actin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). Because the film response may notbe linear with the ECL signal and with the amount of antigen, quantitation wasperformed from more than one exposure for each experiment to ensure theconsistency of the results. Caspase-3 activation was assessed in a dual way using colorimetric assayand by detection of cleaved caspase-3 by immunoblotting. Caspase-3 substrateN-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA) waspurchased from Sigma. Colorimetric assay was performed according tomanufacturer's instructions. Activated caspase-3 was detected byimmunoblotting using an antibody specifically recognizing the cleaved form ofthe enzyme (Cell Signaling Technology). PP5 Is Highly Sensitive to Inhibition by Spermine—Asubstantial body of evidence points to the ability of several phosphatases ofthe PPP family to be regulated by polycations. PP1 is thought to be regulatedby polyamine levels in vivo(40Tung H.Y. Pelech S. Fisher M.J. Pogson C.I. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 41Swärd K. Pato M.D. Nilsson B-O. Nordström I. Hellstrand P. Am. J.

Hellstrand P. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2002; 176: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).PP2A regulation by polyamines in vitro was reported(40Tung H.Y. Pelech S. Fisher M.J. Pogson C.I. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although in this caseeffective polyamine concentrations may be above the physiological range. PlantPP7, although not tested with polyamines, was found to be regulated bymicromolar concentrations of hexalysine and was suggested to possess apolycation binding site(44Kutuzov M.A. Evans D.E. Andreeva A.V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of polyamines on PP5 activity. Purifiedrecombinant PP5, assayed with pNPP, was found to be highly sensitiveto inhibition by spermine (Fig.1A). Scatchard analysis(Fig. 1A,inset) gave an estimate for the Kd of ∼4μm. Another naturally occurring polyamine, putrescine, was muchless potent, inhibiting PP5 by only ∼30% at 1 mm concentration(data not shown). To ensure that the observed effect was not an artifact ofbacterial expression of PP5, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged PP5 in COS-7 cells,isolated it by immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody, and examined the effectof spermine on its activity. Similar to bacterially expressed PP5, stronginhibition by spermine was observed for PP5 expressed in mammalian cells(Fig. 1B). Dephosphorylation of Protein Substrates by PP5 Is Inhibited bySpermine—Whereas pNPP is convenient because it permits usto follow the reaction course in real time, observations with this lowmolecular weight substrate may not adequately reflect regulation ofphosphatase activity toward protein substrates(44Kutuzov M.A. Evans D.E. Andreeva A.V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,45Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol.Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Therefore, we testedwhether dephosphorylation of a protein substrate by PP5 would also be affectedby spermine. PP5 activity tested with phosphocasein was also stronglyinhibited by spermine (Fig. 2).Although apparent Kd (∼30 μm) forspermine with phosphocasein was higher than that observed with pNPP,it was still within the supposed physiological range of spermineconcentrations (see “Discussion”) and is similar to that reportedfor PP1 (40 μm, Ref.40Tung H.Y. Pelech S. Fisher M.J. Pogson C.I. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results indicatedthat PP5 may be regulated by physiological concentrations of intracellularpolyamines. In Vitro Dephosphorylation of ASK1, a Physiological Substrate of PP5,Is Inhibited by Spermine—As the next step to validate thephysiological relevance of PP5 regulation by spermine, we examined its effecton dephosphorylation of ASK1, a MAPKK kinase, which is thought to be aphysiological substrate of PP5(18Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBOJ. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,19Zhou G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46595-46605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ASK1 is activated byautophosphorylation on Thr845 and inactivated by dephosphorylationof this residue by PP5(18Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBOJ. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recombinant PP5 purified from E. coli was found to be unable todephosphorylate ASK1, suggesting that either its folding differs from that ofthe native enzyme or that an additional factor absent in E. coli isrequired for efficient dephosphorylation of ASK1. This is in line withobservations by Morita et al.(18Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBOJ. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) that the GST-PP5 fusionprotein expressed in E. coli was unable to dephosphorylate ASK1unless activated with arachidonic acid. However using polyunsaturated fattyacids or fatty acyl-CoA (which are more efficient activators of PP5, Ref.31Ramsey A.J. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5625-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) would not be possible inour experiments, because spermine would presumably neutralize theseexogenously added acidic compounds. Therefore, we tested whether PP5 expressed in COS-7 cells was able todephosphorylate ASK1. FLAG-tagged PP5 was purified from COS-7 cells byimmunoprecipitation (see above and Fig.1B) and eluted with FLAG peptide. These PP5 preparationswere found to efficiently dephosphorylate 32P-labeled ASK1,prepared by autophosphorylation in vitro. In the absence of spermine, the release of phosphate from ASK1 was linearfor at least up to ∼25% release of total Pi(Fig. 3A). In thepresence of spermine (100 μm), an initial stimulation of ASK1dephosphorylation was observed during the first minutes of incubation,followed by inhibition (Fig.3B). This biphasic kinetics of ASK1 dephosphorylation wasobserved with three independent PP5 preparations, although the extent of theinitial stimulation varied. The initial stimulation by spermine followed byinhibition was also observed when (i) ASK1 autophosphorylated in vivoupon H2O2 treatment, (ii) isolated byimmunoprecipitation was dephosphorylated in vitro by purified PP5, or(iii) ASK1 dephosphorylation was assessed in a mixture of crude lysates ofCOS-7 cells expressing ASK1 and PP5 (data not shown). Because in theseexperiments ASK1 dephosphorylation was followed usingphospho-Thr845-specific ant"

Mice were handled in accordance with approved protocols through theInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of CincinnatiSchool of Medicine. SP-A Purification—Human SP-A was isolated from patients withpulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a lung disease associated with theaccumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins. Briefly, SP-A was purified bythe method of Suwabe (6Suwabe A. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) fromthe cell-free surfactant pellet of bronchoalveolar lavage by serialsedimentation and resuspension in buffer containing 5 mm Tris, 150mm NaCl, and 1 mm Ca2+, release by incubationwith 2 mm EDTA, and adsorption of the recalcified supernatant tomannose-Sepharose affinity columns. SP-A was eluted from the carbohydrateaffinity column using 2 mm EDTA. The purified proteins weredialyzed for 2 days against daily changes of 2,000 volumes of 5 mmTris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl and for 1 day against 2,000 volumes of 5mm Tris (pH 7.4), and stored at -20 °C. The EDTA content of allprotein samples used was measured by the method of Kratochvil, withmodifications as previously reported(4Kuzmenko A.I. Wu H. Bridges J.P. McCormack F.X. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The average final EDTAconcentration was 5 μm, and was less than 25 μm inall SP-A reagents used. Membrane Vesicle Preparation—Model surfactant lipids wereused as substrates for lipid oxidation. Unsaturated liposomes (UL) wereprepared by the method of Gregoriadis(7Gregoriadis G. Ryman B.E. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In brief, an unsaturatedlipid mixture (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,cholesterol, egg l-phosphatidylcholine, 18:0–18:2 PC(1:1:0.15:0.15, w/w/w/w)) was dissolved in CHCl3/methanol (85:15,v/v). The organic solvents were evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporatorunder an N2 atmosphere at 20 °C and the lipid film was hydratedin 5 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 3% Chelex-treated buffer (pH7.5). Multilamellar liposomes were generated by vigorous vortexing for 5min. Assays of Protein Oxidation—Human SP-A was oxidized bycoincubation with copper-treated UL. Stock solutions of 10 mmCuSO4 were freshly prepared daily. Reaction mixtures composed of0.02 mg/ml UL, 2 μm CuSO4, and proteins or controlswere prepared in 3% Chelex-treated saline (0.9% NaCl) or phosphate-bufferedsaline for 24 h at 20 °C. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in ashaking water bath for 24 h(4Kuzmenko A.I. Wu H. Bridges J.P. McCormack F.X. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Control reactions thatincluded UL only, or CuSO4 only were also performed. Oxidation wasmonitored by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, using a methodadapted from Gelvan and Saltman(8Gelvan D. Saltman P. Biochim.Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Samples andmalondialdehyde standards were developed by the addition of a solutioncomposed of 0.375% thiobarbituric acid, 15% trichloroacetic acid, and 0.25n HCl at a volume ratio of 1:2 of sample/developer. Followingincubation at 95 °C for 30 min and centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 15 min, an aliquot was read in a spectrophotometer using a540-nm filter. An absorption scan (500–570 nm) of both themalondialdehyde/thiobarbituric acid adducts and the lipid/aldehydethiobarbituric acid adducts indicated that the absorbance at 540 nm wasrepresentative of the peak obtained at the thiobarbituric acid absorptionmaximum at 532 nm (not shown). Analysis of Escherichia coli Cell Wall Permeability—Theeffect of the SP-A on E. coli cell wall integrity was assessed bydetermining permeability to cleavage activated, fluorescent alkalinephosphatase substrate, ELF97. E. coli (A600 nm =∼0.5 absorbance units) in 100 μl of 5 mm Tris and 150mm NaCl was incubated with 100 μm ELF97 phosphatasesubstrate at 37 °C with 50 μg/ml SP-A from 20 to 90 min. The changes influorescence intensity were measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of355 and 535 nm, respectively. Assays of Protein-associated Carbonyls—Oxidativemodification of SP-A was determined by Western blot analysis (Oxyblot) usingan antibody to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP)-derivatized carbonyl groups.SP-A was incubated with DNP to modify protein-associated carbonyls. After sizefractionation by 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis underreducing conditions, protein species were electrophoretically transferred tonitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were sequentially incubated with arabbit anti-DNP IgG and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbitIgG. Blots were developed by horseradish peroxidase-dependent oxidation of achemiluminescent substrate and visualized using autoradiography. Hyperoxic Treatment—Adult male and female C3H/HeN mice(n = 15 per group) were exposed either to 90% O2 or toroom air for 48 or 96 h. Mice were housed in sealed plastic chamber-cages withfree access to food and water. The ambient oxygen tension was maintained at90% by gas flow through the chamber at 5 liters of O2/min and wasmeasured using a MiniOx-I oxygen analyzer (MSA Medical Products, Pittsburgh,PA). After various intervals of O2 exposure, animals were lavagedand analyzed for SP-A, GSH, and protein-SH. A small aliquot of lavage was usedto determine total protein content. Assays of Total Protein SP-A Concentration—Total proteinconcentrations were analyzed by the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce).Absorbance was read at 570 nm against a sample blank. SP-A levels in lavage were determined with a rabbit polyclonal IgG againstrat SP-A using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously reported(9McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J.

Reduced Glutathione and Protein ThiolMeasurements—Contents of GSH and protein thiols in the lavage fluidof mice were measured using the thiol-specific fluorophore, ThioGlo1(3McCormack F.X. Gibbons R.

Low molecular weightsubstances were separated from lavage by filtering through Microcon YM-3 MWCO3,000 Millipore centrifugal filter devices. A 10-μl aliquot of lavagefiltrate or lavage in 100 μl of Hepes-buffered saline solution wasincubated with 10 μm ThioGlo1 in the absence or presence of theprotein denaturing agent SDS, respectively. The GSH and thiol-containingproteins were detected using a fluorescent plate reader with excitation andemission wavelengths of 405 and 535 nm, respectively. Thiol-containingproteins were quantified by subtracting fluorescence because of releasedglutathione (i.e. signal obtained from the lavage filtrate in theabsence of SDS) from total fluorescence (i.e. signal obtained fromlavage in the presence of SDS). Assays of Surfactant Pellet Preparation—After trachealcannulation, lungs were lavaged 3 times with 1 ml of sterile 5 mmTris and 150 mm NaCl. Lavages from four to five mice were pooledand centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to sedimentthe cells. Surfactant was separated from the cell-free supernatant bycentrifugation at 45,000 × g for 6 h at 4 °C in thepresence of 2 mm CaCl2. Proteins bound to the surfactantpellet in a calcium-dependent manner were released by incubation with 2mm EDTA. Radial Diffusion Assay of E. coli Viability—Inhibition ofbacterial growth was assessed using a radial diffusion method(10Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Szklarek D. Harwig S.S. Daher K. Bainton D.F. Lehrer R.I.

Molten SeaKem LE-agarose(0.8–1.0%) (FMC Bioproducts) in 16 ml of buffer containing 10mm sodium phosphate and 1.0% LB medium was mixed with 150 μl ofE. coli (A600 0.3 absorbance units) at atemperature of 40 °C and allowed to harden by cooling. Agar composed oftryptone (40 g/liter), yeast extract (20 g/liter), and agarose (1%) waslayered on top. Albumin, lysozyme (0.1 and 1.0 mg/ml), or concentrated lavage(1 mg/ml) were added to 5-μl wells bored in the agar. After overnightincubation at 37 °C, the plates were visually inspected for clearingaround the wells. Preparation of Human Neutrophils—Heparinized blood fromhealthy volunteers was separated by discontinuous density-gradientcentrifugation (11Newman S.L. Gootee L. Gabay J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to obtainneutrophils. The granulocyte-enriched material at the interface was collected,centrifuged, and washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4).Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis, and the washedneutrophils were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Exposure of SP-A to Neutrophil ROS—Neutrophils (2 ×105 cells) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were prewarmed to37 °C for 5 min and luminol (1 mm) was added to a total volumeof 0.1 ml. The oxidative burst was assessed by measurement ofchemiluminescence (12Saeed F.A. Castle G.E. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 740-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using aVictor II plate reader chemiluminometer (Turku, Finland). SP-A (100 μg/ml)was incubated with 2 × 105 neutrophils in 0.1 ml ofDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2and the samples were analyzed for oxidative damage by immunoblot-basedassessment of protein-associated carbonyls, proteolytic degradation using ananti-human SP-A antibody (9McCormack F.X.

Statistical Analysis—The analysis of variance test was usedfor comparisons between experimental groups. All data are presented as mean± S.E. unless otherwise noted. Antimicrobial Activity of Calcium-dependent Binding Proteins from theSurfactant Pellet of SP-A+/+ and SP-A-/-Mice—Experiments were performed to determine the direct effectof alveolar lavage fluids isolated from SP-A+/+ and SP-A-/- mice on E.coli growth using a radial diffusion method and the results are shown inFig. 1. SP-A is intimatelyassociated with surfactant phospholipids in the airspace, such that less than1% of protein is found in the unbound state in the aqueous phase. Surfactantpellets were prepared from mice in the presence of calcium, in a manner thatpreserves the association between SP-A and sedimented phospholipid.Calcium-dependent binding proteins released from the surfactant pellet ofSP-A+/+ mice (total protein 6.3 μg/well) produced dose-dependent zonalclearing; considerably more than the same concentration of protein eluted fromthe pellet of SP-A-/- mice. The EDTA containing, protein-free filtrate(molecular weight cutoff of 10,000) from the surfactant pellet of SP-A+/+ micehad little effect on E. coli growth. The data indicate thatcalcium-dependent surfactant-binding proteins in SP-A+/+ mice have greaterantibacterial activity than those from SP-A-/- mice. Permeabilizing Activity of Lavage and Calcium-dependentSurfactant-binding Proteins—We have previously reported thatpulmonary collectins induce protein leak in E. coli(2Wu H. Kuzmenko A. Wan S. Schaffer L. Weiss A. Fisher J.H. Kim K.S. McCormack F.X. J. Clin.Investig. 2003; 111: 1589-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). A technique was developedto more rapidly assess cell wall permeability, using an impermeant,fluorescent substrate (ELF97) for the periplasmic enzyme, alkalinephosphatase. We tested the physiological role of SP-A in induction of E.coli membrane permeability using this technique and airspace proteinsisolated from genetically engineered mice. Concentrated lavage from SP-A+/+mice increased the permeability of the E. coli cell wall in adose-dependent fashion (Fig.2). At 1 mg/ml lavage protein, lavage from SP-A+/+ mice inducedthe permeability of the E. coli cell wall 14.8-fold (p <0.001) compared with 3.6-fold (p > 0.05) for lavage from SP-A-/-mice (Fig. 3A). Therewas also a dose-dependent increase in the initial rate of membranepermeabilization by lavage proteins from the SP-A-sufficient mouse strains,which was greater than that produced by lavage from SP-A-/- mouse strains(Figs. 2B and3B). To further definethe role of SP-A in permeabilization, we tested the antimicrobial activity ofcalcium-dependent surfactant-binding proteins from SP-A+/+ and SP-A-/- mice.We found that the EDTA eluate from the surfactant pellet of SP-A+/+ mice (0.2mg/ml total protein) permeabilized E. coli to an extent that was3.8-fold greater than untreated E. coli (p < 0.05),compared with 1.3-fold (p > 0.05) for the proteins eluted from thesurfactant pellet from SP-A-/- mice (0.2 mg/ml total protein)(Fig. 4A). There wasalso a significant increase in the initial rate of membrane permeabilizationby proteins from the surfactant pellet of SP-A+/+ versus SP-A-/- mice(Fig. 4B). Takentogether, these data are consistent with a role for SP-A in the permeabilizingactivity of alveolar lavage fluid.Fig. 3Lavage fluid isolated from SP-A+/+ mice increases the permeability ofthe E. coli cell wall to a greater extent than lavage of SP-A-/-mice.

SP-A was then oxidized using both chemical andcellular free radical sources and tested for antimicrobial activity. Oxidativedamage of human SP-A was first assessed by a Western blot analysis techniquethat detects carbonyl adducts(13Levine R.L. Wehr N. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar). Human SP-A had adetectable level of carbonyls at baseline, as previously reported(14Wang G. Bates-Kenney S.R. Tao J.Q. Phelps D.S. Floros J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4227-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Exposure of human SP-Ato oxidizing conditions further increased the content of protein-associatedcarbonyls (Fig. 5C),to a greater extent when the protein was exposed to lipid peroxidation fromincubation with 2 μm CuSO4 plus UL than toCuSO4 alone. There was no effect of UL alone on the carbonylcontent of SP-A. The ability of human SP-A to increase the permeability of the E.coli cell membrane was blocked by pre-exposure of SP-A to lipidperoxidation (Fig. 5, A andB). There was no effect of pre-exposure of human SP-A tolipids alone, or CuSO4 alone (at 4 μm), on thekinetics (Fig. 5A) orend point (Fig. 5B) ofSP-A-induced membrane permeability. The data shown inFig. 5 also indicate that, inthe absence of human SP-A, there was no effect of incubation of the bacteriawith lipids alone, CuSO4 alone, or lipids plus CuSO4 onintracellular penetration of alkaline phosphatase substrate. The effect of physiological levels of ROS produced by activatedgranulocytes on SP-A antimicrobial function was next examined.Neutrophil-generated ROS oxidize the luminol substrate and cause emission ofchemiluminescence in a time-dependent manner(Fig. 6A). Exposure ofSP-A to ROS produced by human neutrophils resulted in an increase inprotein-associated carbonyls, consistent with oxidative damage(Fig. 6B). Previousstudies have shown that exposure of SP-A to high concentrations of oxidizingagents results in SP-A fragmentation(15Haddad I.Y. Ischiropoulos H. Holm B.A. Beckman J.S. Baker J.R. Matalon S. Am. J.Physiol. 1993; 265: L555-L564PubMed Google Scholar). We found minor amounts(≈7% by densitometry) of proteolytic degradation(Fig. 7) in the presence ofhuman neutrophils. Exposure of SP-A to activated macrophages has been reportedto result in nitration (16Zhu S. Basiouny K.F. Crow J.P. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1025-L1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).There was no evidence of nitrotyrosine formation (data not shown) in ourneutrophil exposure experiments, however. Pre-exposure of SP-A to neutrophilsdecreased the permeabilizing effects of the protein compared with sham exposedSP-A (Fig. 8A). Theinitial rate of E. coli membrane permeability induced byneutrophil-exposed SP-A was considerably less than sham exposed SP-A(Fig. 8B). Theseresults are consistent with a significant effect of oxidation of SP-A. Wecannot exclude the possibility that the minor amounts of proteolysis seencontributed significantly to the loss of permeabilizing activity.Fig. 7ROS produced by human blood neutrophils cause minor fragmentation ofhuman SP-A.

SP-A+/+mice were exposed to air or to 90% oxygen for 96 h. These hyperoxic conditionswere sufficient to cause consumption of glutathione(Fig. 9A, p< 0.01), a 3.5-fold decrease in protein thiols(Fig. 9B, p< 0.02), a 7.5-fold increase in the accumulation of total protein(Fig. 9C, p< 0.01), and marked increase in airway protein-associated carbonyl moieties(Fig. 10). The enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay-quantified concentrations of SP-A in the lavage fluid pre-and post-oxygen exposure were unchanged (29.5 ± 5.2 and 27.6 ±2.4 ng/ml, respectively). Exposure of mice to hyperoxia did not result innitration of lavage proteins, as assessed by immunoprecipitation followed byWestern blot analysis with nitrotyrosine antibody (data not shown). Thepermeabilizing activity of lavage fluid isolated from the oxygen-exposedanimals was markedly decreased compared with the control (air exposed) mice asshown by kinetic profile (Fig.11A) and initial rate of E. coli cell wallpermeabilization (Fig.11B).Fig. 10Exposure of SP-A+/+ mice to 90% O2 for 96 h increased thecontent of lavage protein-associated carbonyls as determined by Westernanalysis using an antibody to DNP-derivatized carbonyl moieties.

Under these conditions,protein inhibitors might interfere with the activity of SP-A. We found thatthe loss of permeabilizing activity of lavage fluid was not because of seruminhibitors of permeabilization because a 1:1 mixture of lavage fromoxygen-exposed and sham treated animals was as active as a 1:1 mixture ofbuffer and lavage from sham treated animals(Fig. 12). In this study, we examined the relative physiologic importance of SP-A inthe membrane permeabilizing activity of alveolar lavage fluid, and the effectof oxidation on SP-A antimicrobial function. We found that lavage from SP-A-/-mice was much less disruptive to E. coli membranes than lavage fromSP-A+/+ mice, suggesting that SP-A is an important microbial permeabilizingprotein in lavage. The permeabilizing activity of SP-A was dose dependent, andwas blocked by oxidative damage to SP-A, in vivo and invitro. We conclude that oxidative stress inhibits the antibacterialactivity of SP-A by a mechanism that includes oxidative modification andfunctional inactivation of the protein. The innate immune defense system of the lung consists of a variety ofantimicrobial molecules and phagocytic cells(1McCormack F.X. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), including peptides andproteins that opsonize and permeabilize bacteria(2Wu H. Kuzmenko A. Wan S. Schaffer L. Weiss A. Fisher J.H. Kim K.S. McCormack F.X. J. Clin.Investig. 2003; 111: 1589-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and fungal microorganisms(3McCormack F.X. Gibbons R. Ward S.R. Kuzmenko A. Wu H.

Several lines of evidencesuggest that oxidative damage to surfactant components have critical effectson surfactant biophysical function, but less is known about the consequencesof oxidative stress for collectin-mediated host defense(4Kuzmenko A.I.

In this study, thedemonstration that lavage from SP-A+/+ mice has greater permeabilizing andantiproliferative effects than that from SP-A-/- mice suggests anantimicrobial role for the protein, in vivo. Furthermore, asignificant fraction of the permeabilizing activity of lavage fluid segregatedwith the surfactant pellet (and SP-A) upon centrifugation, rather than in theaqueous phase, which contains the non-phospholipid interacting antimicrobialpeptides like lysozyme and defensins. The relative physiologic importance ofthe direct antimicrobial activities of the collectins versus theiropsonic and macrophage modifying functions are important questions that werenot addressed in this study. Our results indicate that oxidative damage of surfactant proteins by lipidperoxidation or ROS generated by inflammatory cells in vitro inhibitsthe permeabilizing activity of SP-A. The changes in protein function wereassociated with oxidative modification of SP-A as assessed by carbonyl adductformation, but not with detectable nitration of the protein. A minor amount ofproteolytic degradation occurred upon exposure of SP-A to human bloodneutrophils. A small amount of proteolysis can be associated with loss ofprotein function, especially for oligomeric proteins, and the degree ofproteolysis can be underestimated because small fragments may not interactwith the antibody. Nonetheless, loss of permeabilizing activity upon oxidationexposure is generally consistent with our previous observations regarding thefunctional consequences of SP-A oxidative modification on lipid proteininteractions (4Kuzmenko A.I. Wu H. Bridges J.P. McCormack F.X. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Next we studied the in vivo effect of hyperoxic exposure onantibacterial properties of lavage from SP-A+/+ mice. Exposure of SP-A+/+ miceto 90% oxygen for 4 days resulted in significant decreases in permeabilizingactivity of lavage, despite a 7.5-fold increase in total protein content. Thisloss of antimicrobial activity was not attributed to inhibitors ofpermeabilization that may have leaked into the airspace from the serumcompartment. We speculate that similar oxygen tensions used to treatrespiratory failure in patients may inactivate antimicrobial proteins such asSP-A in the alveolar lining fluid and render subjects more susceptible toinfection. In summary, the data in this study indicate that SP-A is aprincipal permeabilizing protein in lavage and that oxidative stress as invitro and in vivo results in protein damage and functionalinactivation of antibacterial properties of SP-A.

Detailed studies of Csk and Chk function in breast cancer cellssupport this possibility. In normal and cancerous breast cells, Csk is highlyexpressed and fully active(19Bougeret C. Jiang S. Keydar I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33711-33720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

Theincreased expression level of Chk correlates to suppression of Src, althoughconstitutively expressed Csk fails to suppress Src in these cells(19Bougeret C. Jiang S. Keydar I. Avraham H. J. Biol.

The specific ability ofChk to suppress Src correlates to the binding of the Chk SH2 domain to thereceptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 on pTyr1248(4Kim S. Zagozdzon R. Meisler A. Baleja J.D. Fu Y.

Side-by-side experimentsdemonstrate that the Csk SH2 domain does not bind to ErbB2 onpTyr1248 (19Bougeret C. Jiang S. Keydar I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33711-33720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).These studies suggest that the Csk and Chk SH2 domains bind to different setsof pTyr-containing proteins, which may distinguish the cellular function ofCsk and Chk. The SH2 domain is a ∼100-residue protein module that binds topTyr-containing proteins (20Pawson T.

For example, Src family kinases contain ninemembers, and the SH2 domains of all tested Src family kinases prefer to bindto the sequence of pYEEI (24Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G.

Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar).Structural, mutagenic, and binding studies on the Src SH2 domain reveal a“two-socket” binding mechanism, in which pTyr and Ile of thephosphopeptide respectively bind to two cavities of the SH2 domain(30Bradshaw J.M. Grucza R.A. Ladbury J.E. Waksman G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9083-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Bradshaw J.M. Waksman G.

In the current study, we investigated functional and structural divergencebetween the Csk and Chk SH2 domains in relation to Src regulation. Thesestudies revealed that the Chk SH2 domain shared a higher functional similarityto the Src SH2 domain than to the Csk SH2 domain. Furthermore, structural andmutational studies demonstrated that the functional comparison among the Csk,Chk, and Src SH2 domains was largely determined by one key residue. Thesestudies shed new light on the functional comparison between Csk and Chk andthe general structure-function relationships of the SH2 domainarchitecture. Reagents and Chemicals—All reagents used for bacterialculture and protein expression were purchased from Fisher. Chromatographicresins were purchased from Sigma. A human fetal brain cDNA library wasobtained from Stratagene. DNA primers were synthesized by Integrated DNATechnologies. Phosphopeptides were synthesized by solid phase synthesis andpurified by HPLC, and their molecular weights were confirmed by electrospraymass spectrometry. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—Human Chk andCsk coding sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a fetalbrain cDNA library (33Ayrapetov M.K. Lee S. Sun G. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 29: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,34Sun G. Budde R.J. Anal.Biochem. 1995; 231: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the chicken Src SH2domain coding sequence was amplified from chicken Src cDNA(35Jove R. Kornbluth S. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1987; 50: 937-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The SH2 domains andother fragments were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathioneS-transferase in DH5α using pGEX-2th(36Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). The inserted DNAfragments were sequenced to verify that the sequences were correct. Forexpression of the fusion proteins, bacterial cells containing recombinantplasmids were used to inoculate 600 ml of Luria-Bertani culture medium.Bacterial cell culture, induction of fusion protein expression, cell lysis,and protein purification were performed as previously described(34Sun G. Budde R.J. Anal.Biochem. 1995; 231: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All purification stepswere carried out at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined byBradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. GST-Csk SH2and GST-Src SH2 fusion proteins were used as the Csk and Src SH2 domains. TheGST-Chk SH2 domain fusion protein was extensively degraded during recombinantexpression and purification, and the GST-Chk SH3+SH2 fusion was used as theChk SH2 domain. Fluorescence Polarization Assay and KdDetermination—To determine the binding of a phosphopeptide to anSH2 domain, fluorescein was coupled to the phosphopeptide at the N terminusand purified by HPLC. The fluorescence polarization (FP) binding assay wasperformed as described previously(37Lynch B.A. Loiacono K.A. Tiong C.L. Adams S.E. MacNeil I.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluoresceinatedphosphopeptide at a fixed concentration (80 nm) and varyingconcentrations of the SH2 domain were incubated in 50 mm Tris-Cl,pH 8.0 (in a 500-μl fluorescence cuvette), for about 1 min, and thefluorescence polarization was then recorded using PerkinElmer Life SciencesLS55 luminescence spectrometer at 25 °C. The excitation and emissionwavelengths for the fluorescence polarization measurement were 485 and 530 nm,respectively. The fluorescence polarization value with no SH2 domain presentwas used as a background and subtracted from the FP values in the presence ofthe SH2 domain. The increase in FP value as a function of the SH2 domainconcentration was fitted into the following equation: FP = FPmax× [SH2]/(Kd + [SH2]), where FPmax was themaximum fluorescence polarization value when all the fluoresceinatedphosphopeptide was bound to the SH2 domain, and Kd is thedissociation constant of the phosphopeptide binding to the SH2 domain. Datafitting was performed with a curve-fitting software, LabFit(www.extension.hpg.com.br). To determine the binding of an unlabeled phophopeptide to an SH2 domain,the fluorescence polarization of 80 nm Flu-GpYEEI in the presenceof 700 nm SH2 domain and varying concentrations of the unlabeledphosphopeptide was determined. The fluorescence polarization as a function ofthe total unlabeled phosphopeptide concentration was curve-fitted using thefollowing equation: FP = A × ([SH2]t ×[Probe]t × Kd2)/(Kd1× Kd2 + Kd1 ×[Pept]t + [SH2]t × Kd2), whereKd1 was the dissociation constant of Flu-GpYEEI binding tothe SH2 domain, which was pre-determined by the direct binding assay, andKd2 was the dissociation constant of unlabeled peptidebinding to the SH2 domain. A is a conversion factor between theconcentration of probe-SH2 complex and the fluorescence polarization value.[SH2]t and [probe]t were total concentrations of the SH2domain and the fluorescent probe, Flu-GpYEEI, respectively. [Pept]twas the total concentration of the unlabeled phosphopeptide. All bindingassays were performed in duplicates and repeated at least twice with similarresults. Phosphopeptide Screening to Determine the Optimal Ligand for the ChkSH2 Domain—To determine the optimal Chk SH2 domain phosphopeptideligand, a phosphopeptide library was synthesized and screened. The librarycontained a basal phosphopeptide, GpYAAA, and three groups of phosphopeptides.Each group contained 17 individual phosphopeptides, substituting one of theAla with 17 other standard residues. Cys and Trp were not included in thescreening to avoid complications in peptide synthesis. All phosphopeptideswere individually synthesized and purified. The binding of each phosphopeptideto the Chk SH2 domain was determined by the fluorescence polarizationcompetition assay. The binding of each phosphopeptide was measured by thedecrease in FP of Flu-GpYEEI caused by the presence of 50 μmphosphopeptide. Residue preference for each position was calculated bycomparing the binding of a phosphopeptide carrying a particular residue at thegiven position with that of GpYAAA. The Chk and Src SH2 Domains Have Similar BindingPreferences—The optimal phosphopeptides for the Src and Csk SH2domains have been previously reported to be pYEEI(24Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar) and pYTKM(25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), respectively. Theoptimal pTyr peptide for the Chk SH2 domain has not been reported. To comparethe binding of these SH2 domains to pTyr peptides, two fluoresceinatedphosphopeptides, Flu-GpYEEI and Flu-GpYTKM, were synthesized. Binding of thesepeptides to each of the SH2 domains was determined using fluorescencepolarization assay. As shown in Fig.1A, Flu-GpYEEI bound to the Src SH2 domain tightly, withan apparent Kd of 0.13 ± 0.01 μm.This affinity is similar to a previous report(37Lynch B.A. Loiacono K.A. Tiong C.L. Adams S.E. MacNeil I.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This peptide also boundto the Chk SH2 domain, with a Kd of 3.3 ± 0.2μm. In contrast, the peptide did not bind to the Csk SH2 domainunder identical conditions, with 10 μm Csk SH2 domain resultingin an increase of fluorescence polarization of <0.005. Binding of these three SH2 domains to Flu-GpYTKM was then determined. Toour surprise, Flu-GpYTKM did not bind to the Csk SH2 or the other two SH2domains to any significant extent (data not shown). To ensure that our Csk SH2domain fusion protein was not defective in some way, we generated an SH3+SH2domain and full-length Csk, but neither of them bound to Flu-GpYTKMsignificantly. In an attempt to find a phosphopeptide that binds to Csk SH2domain as a potential probe, we also synthesized Flu-AMpYSSV, a phosphopeptidethat mimicked the pTyr314 phosphorylation site of CBP that wasknown to bind to the Csk SH2 domain(5Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, thisphosphopeptide also failed to bind to the Csk SH2 domain, SH3+SH2 fragment, orfull-length Csk significantly in the direct binding assays. One possibleexplanation for the discrepancy between these observations and previouslyreported binding is that previous reports did not determine the bindingaffinity (5Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar,25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). It is possible that thesepeptides bind to the Csk SH2 domain too weakly to be determined by the directbinding assay in the current study, which is limited by the concentration ofthe Csk SH2 domain that can be used in the assay. To test this possibility, we determined the activation of Csk kinaseactivity by the two phosphopeptides (Fig.2). It has been previously demonstrated that CBPpTyr314 phosphopeptide binds to the Csk SH2 domain and activatesCsk activity (39Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Indeed,both the CBP peptide and GpYTKM activated Csk ∼78% withKd values of 166 ± 17 μm for CBPpeptide and 39 ± 3 μm for GpYTKM. The CBP phosphopeptideactivation data are consistent with the previous report(39Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both theKd values were significantly higher than the highestconcentration of the Csk SH2 domain (10 μm) used in the FPassay. These data together indicated that these phosphopeptides did bind tothe Csk SH2 domain, but not strongly enough to be determined by the direct FPassay. The similarity between the Chk and Src SH2 domains in binding to Flu-GpYEEIwas intriguing. To determine whether the similarity in the Chk and Src SH2domains in binding to Flu-GpYEEI would extend to a physiologicalphosphopeptide, we synthesized and tested a fluoresceinated phosphopeptidemimicking pTyr1248 of ErbB2, Flu-NEPEpYLGLDV (FlupY1248)(14Zrihan-Licht S.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33711-33720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation siteis responsible for ErbB2 binding to the Chk SH2 domain(14Zrihan-Licht S. Deng B. Yarden Y. McShan G. Keydar I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4065-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Flu-pY1248 bound to boththe Chk and Src SH2 domains (Fig.1B), with Kd values of 17.9 ±3.7 μm and 0.8 ± 0.06 μm, respectively. Incontrast, the Csk SH2 domain did not bind to Flu-pY1248 to any significantextent. This result is consistent with a previous study that demonstrates thatthe Chk SH2 domain but not the Csk SH2 domain binds to ErbB2 onpTyr1248 (19Bougeret C. Jiang S. Keydar I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33711-33720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).However, tight binding of Flu-pY1248 to Src SH2 domain has not been previouslyreported and is rather surprising because the peptide bears only minorsimilarity to the Src SH2 optimal peptide, pYEEI. Although Src binding,through its SH2 domain, to autophosphorylated ErbB2 is well established(40Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I. Horsch K. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar,41Sheffield L.G. Biochem. Biophys.Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation siteon ErbB2 for this binding has not been determined to our knowledge. The tightbinding of Flu-pY1248 to the Src SH2 domain makes pTyr1248 a primecandidate for this function. Taken together, these binding studies suggested afunctional similarity between the Chk and Src SH2 domains and a functionaldivergence between the Csk and Chk SH2 domains. Tertiary Structural Comparison Suggests Potential Structural Bases forthe Inability of the Csk SH2 Domain to Bind GpYEEI—The functionalsimilarity between the Chk and Src SH2 domains and the functional divergencebetween the Csk and Chk SH2 domains are intriguing. The Chk SH2 domain shares61% sequence identity with the Csk SH2 domain but has only 40% sequenceidentity with the Src SH2 domain. The lack of correlation between functionalsimilarity and the overall sequence identity raises the possibility that a fewcritical residues, rather than the overall sequence similarity, dictatebinding properties of these SH2 domains. To investigate this possibility, wecompared the tertiary structures of the Chk (Protein Data Bank accession code1JWO) and Csk SH2 domains (Protein Data Bank accession code 1K9A)(42Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S. Nakagawa A. Nada S. Okada M. Tsukihara T. J. Biol.

Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), using K2 structuralalignment program (43Szustakowski J.D. Weng Z. Proteins. 2000; 38: 428-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thisprogram seeks the best alignment between two protein structures by minimizingthe difference of distance matrices using a genetic algorithm. By suchstructural alignments, we were able to compare the binding surfaces of the Cskand Chk SH2 domains with that of the Src SH2 domain. Although the K2 programdoes not recognize the phosphate moiety in pTyr, it superimposes the rest ofthe phosphopeptide (PQpYEEIP) in the conformation bound to the Src SH2 domainonto the Csk or Chk SH2 domain. We were particularly interested in identifyingany residues in the Csk SH2 domain that might clash with PQpYEEIP, thuspreventing its binding. The alignment revealed that the Csk and Src SH2domains shared a similar overall tertiary structure(Fig. 3A), but the CskSH2 domain contained two residues that would clash with the phosphopeptide.Asn111 would sterically clash with the pTyr residue from thephosphopeptide, with Asn111 side chain essentially occupying thebinding pocket for the phosphate of the phosphopeptide(Fig. 3B).Glu127 would sterically and electrostatically clash with Glu at theY+1 position of PQpYEEIP (Fig.3C). In contrast, the Chk SH2 domain did not contain asingle residue that would clash with the phosphopeptide (data not shown). Theresidues corresponding to Csk Asn111 and Glu127 in theSrc SH2 domain are Thr179 and Lys200, respectively.Thr179 side chain points away from the phosphate-binding pocket,and the positively charged side chain of Lys200 is located rightnext to the negatively charged side chain of Glu at the Y+1 position inPQpYEEIP. These structural analyses suggested that Asn111 and/orGlu127 prevented the Csk SH2 domain from binding to Flu-GpYEEI. Wewere aware of the limitations of this rigid-body structural alignment. Forexample, binding to a ligand might result in conformational changes to the SH2domain overall as well as individual side chains. In addition, whereas thisalignment had the potential to identify residues that grossly clash with aligand, it could not identify residues that subtly affected ligand binding.Nevertheless, we felt that the alignment could provide clues to putativeresidues in the Csk SH2 domain that prevented its binding to GpYEEI. Csk Glu127/Chk Ile167/SrcLys200 Is Critical in Controlling the SH2 DomainFunction—To test whether Asn111 and/or Glu127were indeed responsible for the inability of the Csk SH2 domain to bind toFlu-GpYEEI, two Csk SH2 domain mutants were generated, individually mutatingAsn111 to Gly and Glu127 to Lys, respectively. The N111Gmutation removed the interfering side chain of Asn111, whereasmutation of Glu127 to Lys replaced the Csk residue with the Srccounterpart. Mutation of N111G did not alter the binding, but E127K mutationsignificantly improved the binding of the Csk SH2 domain to Flu-GpYEEI, with aKd of 1.8 ± 0.18 μm(Fig. 4A). This resultindicated that Glu127 of Csk was indeed a key residue preventingthe Csk SH2 domain from binding to Flu-GpYEEI. This residue is located at thethird position of β-sheet D (βD3). The fact that Asn111was not responsible for preventing the binding suggested that a conformationalchange at this residue occurred during ligand binding. The Chk residue equivalent to Csk Glu127 is Ile167,but this hydrophobic side chain doe"

The αIIbβ3 antagonists arecapable of inhibiting platelet adhesion and aggregation and formation ofplatelet thrombi at the site of plaque rupture or plaque fissure(10Lefkovits J. Plow E.F. Topol E.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1553-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Because platelet-richrather than fibrin-rich thrombosis was found to be responsible for many acutecomplications of angioplasty, the blockade of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIareceptor was appreciated as valuable in interventional cardiology. Currentlythere are three integrin αIIbβ3 antagonistsused clinically, abciximab(11Tam S.H. Sassoli P.M. Jordan R.E. Nakada M.T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), tirofiban(12Lefkovits J. Topol E.J. Eur.Heart J. 1996; 17: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and eptifibatide(13Scarborough R.M. Kleiman N.S. Phillips D.R. Circulation. 1999; 100: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Abciximab is a chimericFab created based on a murine monoclonal antibody 7E3. Its mechanism of actionis thought to be a spatial hindrance of the receptor as opposed to the RGDbinding site. Eptifibatide is a synthetic heptapeptide, and tirofiban is anon-peptide antagonist, both mimicking the structure of RGD. All exhibit highaffinity binding to integrin αIIbβ3, inhibitex vivo platelet aggregation, and have proven useful clinically(14Topol E.J. Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. Lancet. 1999; 353: 227-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the in vitro anti-plateleteffect and binding property of 3C7, a novel monoclonal antibody against thecomplex of integrin αIIbβ3 raised with CHOcells expressing an activated integrin αIIbβ3mutant as the immunogen. We found that 3C7 inhibited fibrinogen-mediatedplatelet aggregation induced by ADP or thrombin. It blocked platelet adhesionto immobilized fibrinogen but not to fibronectin or collagen. The binding offibrinogen to platelets was partially blocked by 3C7. More interestingly, 3C7bound to both non-activated and activated platelets. The binding and affinityincreased significantly when platelets were activated by ADP/thrombin oroccupied by ligands for the integrin. To our knowledge, 3C7 is the firstanti-LIBS monoclonal antibody specific for the complex ofαIIbβ3. Materials—Lipofectamine reagent, pcDNA 3.1(–) Zeovector, antibiotics G418 sulfate, and Zeocin were purchased from Invitrogen.The RGDS peptide was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. mAb SZ21(anti-β3) and SZ22 (anti-αIIb) were fromJiangsu Institute of Hematology (Suzhou, China). The mAb PAC-1 (anti-activatedαIIbβ3) was purchased from BD Biosciences.The mutant BEST kit was from TaKaRa (Dalian, China). Immobilized protein G,sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG,and chemiluminescent substrate kit were from Pierce. Fluorescein-conjugateddonkey anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). The TMBperoxidase substrate was the product of KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). The CHO cellsexpressing integrin αvβ3 were a generous giftfrom Dr. Kieffer (Luxembourg). Construction and Transfection of Mutant Integrinβ3 cDNA—β3Δ717 wasintroduced into pcDNA 3.1(–) by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesisusing pcDNA 3.1(–)/wt-β3 as a template. Primers for PCRwere as following: sense-5′-GCTGGGATCCCAGTGTGAGTGC-3′ with a BamHIsite andantisense-5′-GAATTCTTTTCGGTCGTGGATGGTGATGAGTTATTCC-3′containingthe mutation and an EcoRI site. The PCR-amplified cassette was digested byEcoRI and BamHI, purified, and inserted into pcDNA3.1(–)/wt-β3 with the corresponding sequence deleted.β3Y178A and β3Y178I were introduced into pcDNA3.1(–) by using the mutant BEST kit according to the manufacturer'sinstructions using sense primers(5′-GCCCTCGAGAACCCCTGCGCTGATATGAAG-3′ and5′-GCCCTCGAGAACCCTGCATTGATATGAAG-3′). The antisense primer forβ3Y178A and β3Y178I was5′-CTCTGGTGGGGAGATATACATGA-3′. Introduced mutations were confirmedby DNA sequencing. Mutant β3 constructs were transfected intoCHO cells or CHO cells already expressing human αIIb subunitusing Lipofectamine. Positive colonies were isolated by cylinder cloning andfurther subcloned by limiting dilution. Expression of individual subunitsαIIb or β3 was monitored by flow cytometryand Western blot using mAb SZ21 (anti-β3) and SZ22(anti-αIIb). Production and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibody—TheCHO cell line expressing αIIbβ3Δ717 wasused to immunize BALB/c mice. The splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice werefused with mouse myeloma FO cells as described previously(15Jennings L.K. Phillips D.R. Walker W.S. Blood. 1985; 65: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridoma culturesupernatants were screened for antibodies reactive with integrinαIIbβ3 using cellular enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay. One positive hybridoma, named 3C7, was subcloned twice bylimiting dilution. The monoclonal antibody was then produced in mouse asceticfluid and purified with immobilized protein G. The 3C7 subtyping was performedusing a mouse immunoglobulin subtype identification kit (Hycult Biotech, Uden,Netherlands). The affinity of 3C7 for αIIbβ3of intact platelets was measured essentially as described previously(5Kouns W.C. Wall C.D. White M.M. Fox C.F. Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20594-20601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with an exception that 3C7was labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin instead of 125I. Briefly,platelets were isolated and washed as described previously(16Ruiz C. Liu C.Y. Sun Q.H. Sigaud-Fiks M. Fressinaud E. Muller J.Y. Nurden P. Nurden A.T. Newman P.J. Valentin N. Blood. 2001; 98: 2432-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Then washed platelets (3× 108/ml) were incubated with increasing amounts of labeled3C7 at room temperature for 1 h. In some cases, platelets were exposed to 1mm RGDS or 0.1 mm ADP before addition of 3C7. Todetermine the amount of total 3C7 binding, the free 3C7 in the supernatant wasmeasured with a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using avidincoated on microtiter wells and subtracted from the total amount added.Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 50-fold excess ofunlabeled antibody. The Kd value was obtained using theScatchard Plot. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Forimmunoprecipitation, cell lysates were first incubated overnight at 4 °Cwith 3C7 or SZ21 and then with protein A-Sepharose beads for another 2 h. Thebeads were washed with the lysis buffer six times and then boiled in the SDSsample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 25 g/ml bromphenol blue in 15.63mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8). For Western blot analysis, platelet or celllysates were first centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C beforetheir protein concentrations were determined. Lysates or immunoprecipitateswere applied for a 7.5% SDS-PAGE under both non-reducing and reducingconditions and then transferred to a Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane. Themembrane was blocked and probed for 2 h at room temperature with SZ21 andSZ22. After several washes, the membrane was incubated with the secondary goatanti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and finally developedusing the chemiluminescence ECL kit. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Binding of antibodies to plateletsand CHO cells expressing integrins were analyzed by flow cytometry as previousdescribed (16Ruiz C. Liu C.Y. Sun Q.H. Sigaud-Fiks M. Fressinaud E. Muller J.Y. Nurden P. Nurden A.T. Newman P.J. Valentin N. Blood. 2001; 98: 2432-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In brief,washed platelets (1×106/ml) or cells(5×105/ml) were incubated with the primary antibody for 30min at 4 °C followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouseIgG and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). For some experiments, washedplatelets were exposed to different treatments prior to incubation with 3C7.To assess the effect of the separate subunit (αIIb orβ3), CHO cells expressingαIIbβ3 were firstly treated by incubationwith 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C or room temperature for 30 min. Tostudy the effect of the activation state ofαIIbβ3, washed platelets were pretreated with0.1 mm ADP or 0.5 units/ml thrombin at room temperature for 20 min.To study the effect of ligand occupation, washed platelets were incubateddirectly with 1 mm RGDS at room temperature for 20 min or withfibrinogen or PAC-1 for 45 min after platelets were activated with 0.1mm ADP or 0.5 units/ml thrombin before addition of 3C7. Finally, toinvestigate the effect of 3C7 on fibrinogen binding, platelets were activatedwith 0.1 mm ADP, then incubated with 300 μg/ml FITC-fibrinogenin the presence of various concentrations of 3C7 for 15 min at 37 °C andanalyzed by flow cytometry(17Pasquet J.M. Dachary-Prigent J. Nurden A.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Platelet Aggregation and Adhesion—Platelet aggregation wasperformed using citrated platelet-rich plasma. After incubation at 37 °Cfor 5 min with various concentrations of 3C7, aggregation was initiated byadding 10 μm ADP or 0.35 units/ml thrombin. The maximal plateletaggregation within 5 min was recorded using an aggregometer. Platelet adhesionto immobilized ligand was done as described previously(18Shadle P.J. Barondes S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with one modification;platelets were labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin instead of 51Cr.Briefly, 2 × 107 labeled platelets were incubated withvarious concentrations of 3C7 and then added to each well coated withfibrinogen, fibronectin, or collagen and allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 1h. The non-adherent platelets were aspirated off before the addition ofhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin to be developed with the TMBsubstrate. The extent of adhesion at each concentration of 3C7 was detected bycomparison with the standard curve and expressed as the percentage of thecontrol in which platelets were not preincubated with 3C7. Generation and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibody—Monoclonal antibodies were produced by fusing FO cells with splenocytes frommice immunized with CHO cells expressingαIIbβ3Δ717, anαIIbβ3 mutant with an active conformation(19Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Ten days after fusion,80% of hybridoma supernatants were positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay against CHO/αIIbβ3Δ717 cells.Specific clones were further screened for their reactivity withαIIbβ3. The antibody produced by a positiveclone (named 3C7) was identified as IgG2bκ-immunoglobulin andpurified by an affinity column of protein G. Flow cytometry analysis revealedthat 3C7 had no binding to CHO cells expressing either β3 orαIIb alone, or αVβ3. Incontrast, 3C7 recognized αIIbβ3 expressed onCHO cells or platelets (Fig.1). 3C7 was unable to probeαIIbβ3 reduced or non-reduced in Western blot(data dot shown). 3C7 Is Specific forαIIbβ3Complex—Because β3 is required for thepost-translation process of αIIb(20Duperray A. Troesch A. Berthier R. Chagnon E. Frachet P. Uzan G. Marguerie G. Blood. 1989; 74: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the lack of 3C7 bindingto αIIb transfected CHO cells(Fig. 1B) isinsufficient to conclude that 3C7 does not recognize αIIb.Therefore, we used immunoprecipitation to confirm this property of 3C7. Asshown in Fig. 2, althoughanti-β3 mAb SZ21 precipitated β3 from thelysate of CHO/αVβ3, 3C7 failed to precipitateαIIb or β3 using the lysate ofCHO/αIIb or CHO/αVβ3,suggesting that it was not against αIIb orαV. By contrast, two bands corresponding toαIIb and β3 were found in the 3C7immunoprecipitation against the lysate of platelets orCHO/αIIbβ3(Fig. 2). Additionally, 3C7 wasconfirmed to be specific for intact αIIbβ3using EDTA chelating. The CHO cells expressing the complex ofαIIbβ3 were firstly treated with 5mm EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min, which was proved to dissociate thecomplex of αIIbβ3(21Shattil S.J. Brass L.F. Bennett J.S. Pandhi P. Blood. 1985; 66: 92-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and then binding of 3C7was assayed by flow cytometry. As a control, the cells were preincubated with5 mm EDTA at room temperature for 30 min, which is known not toaffect the structure of the complex. As shown inFig. 3, the binding of 3C7 tothe cells pretreated with 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C was diminished tothe level of background. In contrast, binding of 3C7 to the control cells wasnot affected as compared with the cells without any treatment.Fig. 3The reactivity of 3C7 with the integrin complex. CHO cellsexpressing αIIbβ3 complex were pretreatedwith buffer (C) or 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C (B) orat room temperature (D) for 30 min and then incubated with 3C7followed by FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG. The cells stained directlywith FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (A) were the negativecontrol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 3C7 Recognizes a LIBS Epitope on IntegrinαIIbβ3 inPlatelets—Because 3C7 was raised by immunizing mice with CHO cellsexpressing the activated state of αIIbβ3(αIIbβ3Δ717), its binding properties toactivated platelets were therefore consequently investigated. First, usingplatelets activated by ADP or thrombin, 3C7 binding was increased by more than5-fold (Fig. 4A).Second, 3C7 binding was also increased after the addition of RGDS, fibrinogenor PAC-1 (Fig. 4B).The binding affinity of 3C7 to platelets was also measured in the presence ofdifferent platelet ligands. The Kd for resting plateletsand for platelets activated by ADP or occupied with RGDS were 4.60 ±2.13, 1.11 ± 0.99, and 1.30 ± 1.22 nm (n =3), respectively. These data indicated that 3C7 recognized a LIBS epitope. Itwas reported that certain anti-LIBS antibodies activatedαIIbβ3 and promoted fibrinogen binding toplatelets (22Frelinger III, A.L. Du X.P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Mazurov A.V. Khaspekova S.G. Byzova T.V. Tikhomirov O.Y. Berndt M.C. Steiner B. Kouns W.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, 3C7 was not anactivating antibody (Fig. 4, C andD). Platelet Aggregation Initiated by ADP or Thrombin Was Blocked by3C7—3C7 inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP or thrombinin a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 5.6 μg/ml forADP and 0.05 μg/ml for thrombin, respectively(Fig. 5). Platelet Adhesion to Immobilized Fibrinogen Was Inhibited by3C7—αIIbβ3 is critical forplatelet adhesion to immobilized ligands. 3C7 inhibited platelet adhesion toimmobilized fibrinogen in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of0.9 μg/ml (Fig. 6). Incontrast, 3C7 had no effect on platelet adhesion to either immobilizedfibronectin (Fig. 6) orcollagen (data not shown). 3C7 Inhibited Fibrinogen Binding to Platelets—UsingFITC-labeled fibrinogen, binding of fibrinogen to ADP-stimulated platelets wasmeasured with FACS in the presence of 3C7. The IC50 was measured as0.3 μg/ml for ADP, and the maximum inhibition (65%) was obtained at 1.0μg/ml that was a considerably low concentration for an antibody antagonist(Fig. 7). β3Y178 Was Involved in the Antigen Epitope for3C7—It is known that the Cys177–Cys184loop of β3 is important for c7E3 (abciximab) binding as wellas ligand binding (24Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Aftercarefully examining sequences of the Cys177–Cys184loop from different species, we found that Tyr178 was absolutelyconservative. Therefore, Tyr178 was mutated(β3Y178A and β3Y178I) and co-expressed withαIIb in CHO to investigate the possibility of the loop alsobeing the epitope for 3C7. As shown in Fig.8, the expression of β3 was monitored using SZ21(specific for β3) and was unaffected by the mutation ofβ3Y178A or β3Y178I. However, 3C7 had a fullbinding to αIIbβ3Y178I and nearly no bindingto αIIbβ3 Y178A, indicating that theCys177–Cys184 loop of β3 waslikely to be the epitope for 3C7, and the hydrophobicity of Y178 was crucialfor its function. Three types of anti-LIBS antibodies against αIIb orβ3 are described in the literature (a) with no effecton platelet aggregation (PMI-1, αIIb-specific)(25Ginsberg M.H. Lightsey A. Kunicki T.J.

It has a higher affinity for activeplatelets and inhibits both platelet aggregation and adhesion. Moreover, itsbinding to platelets is enhanced by additional ligand binding. These differences may be attributed to our new approach, which used CHOcells expressing activated αIIbβ3 as theimmunogen. This was based on the assumption thatαIIbβ3 with different conformations could beexpressed on CHO cells where it functioned similar to its counterparts inplatelets. Our data confirmed that deletion of the β3cytoplasmic domain induced conformational changes in the extracellular part ofαIIbβ3 and an exposure of neoepitope LIBS(19Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 3C7recognized the complex of αIIbβ3 exclusivelyand did not react with αIIb or β3. This wasdemonstrated by EDTA chelating, which caused dissociation of the complex. Ourstrategy allowed recognition of epitopes not exposed or inaccessible on theresting integrin. In contrast, all other anti-LIBS or activation-dependentmAbs were produced using either whole platelets(27Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

Inaddition, a single-chain variable fragment specific for activatedαIIbβ3 was obtained using phage displayagainst activated platelets(30Jacobin M.J. Laroche-Traineau J. Little M. Keller A. Peter K.

Efforts to raise activation-dependent antibodies using whole plateletsactivated prior to immunization encountered a number of techniquedifficulties. Our experiments demonstrated an effective approach to solve theproblem. First, transfected cells preserve native conformations of theintegrin. Second, it allows production of antibodies against differentconformations of the integrin specifically made with site-directedmutations. The disulfide-bonded loop (Cys187–Cys193 ofβ1, Cys169–Cys176 ofβ2, and Cys177–Cys184 ofβ3) laying on the upper surface of the β I domain andprojecting from the surface containing sites adjacent to a metal ion-dependentadhesion site (31Xiong J.P.

The mutation ofβ1 integrin (T188I) at this loop promotes cell spreading inhuman SCC4 keratinocyte (33Evans R.D. Perkins V.C. Henry A. Stephens P.E. Robinson M.K. Watt F.M. J.

Moreover, ligandbinding sites are found close to or overlapping with residues at this loop byepitope mapping with ligand mimetic mAbs(24Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol.

In thisreport, we have demonstrated that theCys177–Cys184 loop of β3 is alsoimportant for 3C7 recognizing a unique epitope for the complex ofαIIbβ3. It further confirms the structuralimportance of this disulfide-bonded loop for its role in antibody and ligandbinding. 3C7 preferentially binds to platelets stimulated by ADP or thrombin invitro. Under the condition of our assay, platelet aggregation stimulatedby ADP or thrombin was inhibited with a very different IC50. BothADP (36Dorsam R.T. Kunapuli S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and thrombin(37Brass L.F.

This mayexplain the discrepant IC50 of 3C7 for its inhibitory effect on ADPor thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. 3C7 inhibits platelet adhesion toimmobilized fibrinogen but not to fibronectin or collagen. This may be becauseof the fact that platelet adhesion to fibronectin and collagen is alsomediated by other integrins such as αVβ3,α3β1, α5β1,and α2β1(39Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear how ligands interact withαIIbβ3, it is suggested that native ligands(e.g. fibrinogen) or ligand-mimetic antibodies may directly contactdiscontinuous binding sites at both subunits, which may constitute a ligandbinding pocket (24Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Threehuman αIIbβ3-specific mAbs (PAC-1(27Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A.

Blood. 1987; 70: 475-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) have the RYD sequencethat mimics RGD in their CDR3 regions, indicating that the RYD sequence mayoccupy the same space as RGD does(42Prammer K.V. Boyer J. Ugen K. Shattil S.J. Kieber-Emmons T. Receptor. 1994; 4: 93-108PubMed Google Scholar). Although 3C7 inhibitsfibrinogen binding to platelets, its binding to platelets is promoted bypretreatment of fibrinogen or RGDS. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of 3C7seems not because of a direct occupancy of the RGDS binding site. However,when 3C7 binds, it blocks fibrinogen binding to platelets probably because ofits spatial effect. αIIbβ3 antagonists currently availableeither bind to the resting integrin or induce a transition ofαIIbβ3 from a resting to ligand competentstate (43Peter K. Schwarz M. Ylanne J. Kohler B. Moser M. Nordt T. Salbach P. Kubler W. Bode C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3240-3249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has beenimplicated in thrombocytopenia occasionally reported after administration ofsuch antagonists including abciximab in man(44Blankenship J.C. Am. HeartJ. 1999; 138: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,45Joseph J.E. Machin S.J. Blood Rev. 1997; 11: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus,activation-dependent mAbs would be of great interest to develop fortherapeutic use. Previous studies suggested that agents recognizingαIIbβ3 with high affinity and selectivity forthe activated rather than resting integrin possess a high therapeuticpotential for thromboembolic events(46Bednar R.A. Gaul S.L. Hamill T.G. Egbertson M.S. Shafer J.A. Hartman G.D. Gould R.J. Bednar B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1317-1326PubMed Google Scholar). Activation-dependentantibodies mimicking fibrinogen may also alleviate certain adverse effectssuch as increased risk of bleeding encountered with abciximab in a clinic(44Blankenship J.C. Am. HeartJ. 1999; 138: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additionally, antibodiespreferentially recognizing ligand-occupied conformations may be of value indiagnosis. In comparison with abciximab, 3C7 is comparable for its bindingaffinity and inhibitory activity to platelets but is highly specific for thecomplex of αIIbβ3. The clinical potential ofthe unique specificity of 3C7 needs to be evaluated in vivo withanimal studies, because αVβ3, the sparetarget of abciximab, is widely distributed in diverse tissues and involved inmany physiological and pathological events.

IP3 plays a major role in mediating the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular storage, thereby regulating numerous physiological processes in the cell (2Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar, 3Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 437-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is an intracellular Ca2+ channel that releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, an internal calcium store, by various stimuli such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors (4Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar). IP3Rs are encoded by three different genes and variably expressed in different cell types (5Joseph S.K. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). IP3R forms a tetramer with each subunit being composed of an N-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD), an intervening regulator, and a C-terminal channel (6Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 7Jiang Q. Thrower E.C. Chester D.W. Ehrlich B.E. Sigworth F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3575-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The type 1 IP3R (IP3R1) is mainly expressed in the brain (8Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), whereas the type 3 IP3R (IP3R3) is the major isoform found in the intestine, kidney, and pancreatic islets (9Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two Ca2+-binding sites were identified in the LBD of IP3R1 (11Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ binding to the LBD of IP3R3 has not been reported, the inhibition of free Ca2+ on the IP3 binding of LBD of the type 3 receptor suggests that the domain also has an intrinsic Ca2+-binding property (12Vanlingen S. Sipma H. De Smet P. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 275-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IP3R3 shows distinct properties of Ca2+ signaling upon stimulation in the cell as observed in other subtypes (13Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 14Hattori M. Suzuki A.Z. Higo T. Miyauchi H. Michikawa T. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11967-11975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For instance, DT 40 cells expressing only IP3R3 exhibit a single Ca2+ peak upon stimulation of the B-cell receptor, whereas type 1 or type 2 generates Ca2+ oscillation with the same signal (13Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In IP3R1-knock-down, COS-7 cells, expressing primarily the type 3 receptor, also exhibited a single Ca2+ peak, whose amplitude was reduced relative to that of the untreated cell (14Hattori M. Suzuki A.Z. Higo T. Miyauchi H. Michikawa T. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11967-11975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ is an important modulator of the Ca2+ channel activity of IP3Rs (15Taylor C.W. Laude A.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence on the channel activity of IP3R3 is, however, still controversial. Study with vesicles from RIN-5F cells mainly expressing IP3R3 revealed that external Ca2+ did not inhibit Ca2+ release of IP3R3 (16Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas the Ca2+ channel activity of IP3R3 was shown in other studies to be biphasically modulated by Ca2+ (17Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Mak D.D. Mcbride S. Foskett J.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A study using a microsome purified from COS-7 cells expressing IP3R3 (17Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and a patch clamping with Xenopus oocyte demonstrated the biphasic dependence of the channel activity by Ca2+ (18Mak D.D. Mcbride S. Foskett J.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The reason for the difference in Ca2+ effect for IP3R3 is unclear, although it is likely that the sample preparations and membrane compositions are different. The specificity of IP3R3 function is largely unknown. We observed that BALB/c (BC) mice exhibited a higher defecation than C57BL/6J (B6) mice under stress conditions (19Kim S. Lee S. Ryu S. Suk J. Park C. Behav. Process. 2002; 60: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been known in Caenorhabditis elegans that IP3R regulates the defecation rhythm (20Dal Santo P. Logan M.A. Chisholm A.D. Jorgensen E.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, it might be intriguing to speculate that the defecation behavior is associated with the functional polymorphism of IP3R3 found in BC and B6 mice. On the other hand, the major subtype of mammalian IP3R in the intestine is known to be the type 3 receptor (9Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we discovered a polymorphism of IP3R3 causing a change in amino acids, and thus we investigated the functional consequences of receptor alteration in terms of IP3 and Ca2+ bindings. The results indicate that functional difference exists between receptor variants when tested with their ligand binding domains as well as the whole receptor. Mice—Inbred strains of mice, BC and B6, were purchased from Daehan Biolink Co. Ltd. (Korea). All mice were raised in housing with five per cage in a specific pathogen-free and temperature-controlled facility at 22 °C under a 12-h light-dark cycle with light on at 07:00. Humidity was maintained at 55% with food and water freely available. Male mice at the age of 5–10 weeks were used for this study. All experimental procedures with animals followed the National Institutes of Health Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Full-length Nucleotide Sequences of Mouse IP3R3—The full-length sequences of mouse IP3R3 cDNA were obtained from plasmid, G431004L16 (RIKEN). Based on the nucleotide sequences obtained, we designed specific primers for mouse IP3R3. The entire coding sequences of IP3R3 were compared between BC and B6 mice by RT-PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted mouse brain followed by reverse transcription. After PCR amplification of an ∼2–3 kb DNA fragment with specific primers, the DNA fragments were sequenced on an ABI 3700 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Ratio of Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—The ratio of semi-quantitative RT-PCR was conducted as described previously with minor modifications (21De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Henning R.H. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Gijsens A. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). After 2 μg of total RNA were purified from whole brains and intestine, first strand cDNAs were synthesized by using the total RNA as template. PCR amplification was performed with the first cDNAs as templates. PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 27 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min (for subtypes of I/III), 52 °C for 1 min (for subtypes of II/III), or 72 °C for 1 min. The oligonucleotides used for PCR were as follows: for type I/III, 5′-GT(C/G)ATCATCGACACCTTTGC-3′ and 5′-GCT(G/C)ACCAGGGACATGGC-3′; and for type II/III, 5′-T(C/T)ATCGTCATCATCATCG-3′ and 5′-C(G/T)TGATCATCTGAGCCAC-3′. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and then transferred to nylon membranes. Blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled type-specific oligonucleotide probes (type I, 5′-AGGGAAAGAAACCTTGAT-3′, type II, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGACCCGAC-3′, or type III, 5′-CCGAGTCAAGAACAAGAC-3′). To test the specificity of the oligonucleotide probe, plasmids containing the PCR product of each subtype were used as positive and negative controls. The control plasmids were constructed by ligating PCR products amplified with primer pairs, I/III or II/III, into the pGEM-T Easy vector. For normalizing the IP3R signals, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified with specific primers (forward primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′), and then glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signals detected by Southern blot analysis were used as standard. The radioactivity of the membrane was analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Fuji). Construction of pGEX-LBD and pET-LBDHis Vector—The cDNA encoding the N-terminal 605 amino acids of the mouse Pro335IP3R3 was amplified by PCR with the forward primer ATCCCGGGAATGAATGAAATGTCCAGC and the reverse primer GCGAATTCTTAAAGCTTCCGGTTGTTGCAG, by using plasmid G431004L16 (from RIKEN) as a template, and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. As there is an insertion mutation in the 1588th nucleotide position of the clone, G431004L16, a DNA fragment containing this region (nucleotide position, 1189–1815) was changed with a DNA fragment that was amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from brains of B6 mice. For construction of pGEX-P335LBD, the SmaI and EcoRI fragment from pGEM-T-P335LBD was cloned into SmaI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T. For construction of pGEX-L335LBD, DNA fragment (nucleotide position, 505–1815) was amplified from RT-PCR by using first strand cDNA synthesized from total RNA extracted from brain of B6 mice. The HindIII fragment isolated from amplified DNA was cloned into pGEX-P335LBD. To construct pET-LBDHis, PCRs were performed with the forward primer GCATATGAATGAAATGTCCAGC and the reverse primer GCTCGAGAAGCTTCCGGTTGTTGT by using plasmid pGEX-P335LBD or pGEX-L335LBD as a template, and then amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into pET-21b plasmid after NdeI/XhoI digestion. All PCR products and the polymorphic site were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Purification of Recombinant GST-LBD and LBD-His Protein—Bacterial cultures of pGEX-LBD were grown at 37 °C in a 500-ml volume of LB/ampicillin (100 μg/ml) until an A600 reached 0.5. Induction of the GST fusion protein was carried out by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) and further incubation for 3 h. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The cells were lysed by passing through an Amicon French pressure cell. Cell lysates were applied to a column of glutathione-agarose pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with lysis buffer and then eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione). The expression of pET-LBDHis was performed as described previously (22Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T. Iwasaki H. Tomomori-Satoh C. Tanaka T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To purify recombinant LBD-His proteins, harvested bacterial pellets were resuspended in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml of benzamidine, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The cells were lysed by passing through an Amicon French pressure cell. Cell lysates were applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column pre-equilibrated with the binding buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer and washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole). The LBD-His proteins were eluted in the binding buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The concentrations of recombinant proteins were quantified using bicinchoninic acid according to the manufacture's instruction (Pierce). Partial Purification of IP3R3 from Intestine—Mouse intestines were mixed with 3 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) and were broken in a blender, followed by homogenization in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to precipitate the membrane pellet. The pellet were resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 to give the membrane protein concentration of ∼2 mg/ml. The membrane solution was stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained was mixed with an equal volume of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) and applied to a type 3 IP3R antibody-coupled immunoaffinity column equilibrated with buffer C as described above. The protein-loaded column was washed with 20 bed volumes of buffer C to remove unbound proteins, and the IP3R was eluted by 10 ml of elution buffer D (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin). The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, mixed with an equal volume of buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and then applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer E to remove any residual proteases from the IP3R sample. The IP3R containing flow-through was collected and stored at –70 °C until use. Reconstitution of IP3R into Proteoliposomes—Phospholipids were purchase from Avanti Polar Lipids. Chloroform solutions of lipids were stored in sealed ampules under argon gas at –20 °C. Phosphatidylcholine (from bovine brain), phosphatidylethanolamine (from bovine brain), and phosphatidylserine (from bovine brain) dissolved in chloroform were mixed to give a molar ratio of 50, 30, and 20%, respectively. The final lipid concentration was 5 mm in a total volume of 1 ml. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of argon gas, and the residual chloroform was removed by speed vacuuming. The dry lipids were hydrated in buffer F (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% CHAPS) containing about 5 μg/ml IP3R. The mixtures were dialyzed for 72 h against an excess volume of buffer G (buffer F without CHAPS). The resulting proteoliposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with buffer H (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl), and then dialyzed against buffer E for 24 h at 4 °C. The resulting proteoliposomes were passed through Chelex 100 to remove free Ca2+. The formation of proteoliposomes was monitored by measurement of light scattering during analysis with a spectrofluorometer (excitation and emission wavelength of 450 nm). The average diameter of the liposomes was about 360 when assayed as described previously (23Kolchens S. Ramaswami V. Birgenheier J. Nett L. O'Brien D.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 65: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The amounts of reconstituted IP3R were determined using NanoOrange® protein quantitation kit (Molecular Probes). After the reconstitution, the ratio of phospholipid concentration (w/v) to that of protein (L/P) was determined as 890 ± 27 for Pro335IP3R3 and 879 ± 22 for Leu335IP3R3 in reaction samples, respectively. IP3-induced Ca2+ Release Measurement Using Indo-1 Fluorescence—Ca2+ efflux from the proteoliposomes was observed by measuring the fluorescence changes of external indo-1. Fluorometric measurements were performed at 30 °C by using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence intensity was measured at the emission wavelength of 393 nm under an excitation wavelength of 355 nm. The fluorescent intensities of 10 μm indo-1 were calibrated to free Ca2+ concentration using the Ca2+-EGTA buffering system (24Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To quantify the amount of released Ca2+ from proteoliposomes by IP3 binding, the fluorescence intensity of indo-1 after addition of IP3 was compared with the fluorescence intensity after addition of Triton X-100 (1% (w/v), final concentration) instead of IP3. Effect of External Ca2+ on the IP3-mediated Ca2+ Release Measurement from the Proteoliposomes Using 45Ca2+—The proteoliposomes were produced in the presence of 45Ca2+ to include ∼20,000 cpm of 45Ca2+ in buffer H (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) according to the procedure described. To remove residual Ca2+ bound to the vesicle surface, the sample was applied to Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with buffer H, and the liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The pellet was then redissolved and dialyzed against excess volume of buffer H for 12 h at 4 °C. The proteoliposomes were mixed with each indicated concentration of CaCl2 and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. After further incubation of the sample for 10 min in the presence of 1 μm of IP3 in the reaction mixtures, the sample was diluted with buffer I (buffer H plus 1.5 m KCl). The liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 30 °C). The pellet was then dissolved with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and the radioactivity of each fraction (pellet and supernatant) was determined by scintillation counting. Removal of Ca2+ Contamination—Removal of Ca2+ contamination was conducted according to the method described previously (25Meyer T. Wensel T. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Ca2+ contamination during all experiments was checked using the fluorescence of the Ca2+ indicator, indo-1, before measurements. Preparation of IP3R3 Antibody-coupled Column—Type 3 IP3R antibody-coupled column was prepared by coupling 0.6 mg of affinity-purified anti-peptide type 3 IP3R antibody (Sigma) to 1.2 ml of the immobilized protein A resin from the ImmunoPure protein A IgG orientation kit (from Pierce) according to the instructions. The column was stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% sodium azide until use. [3H]IP3 Binding to Recombinant GST-LBD Fusion Protein or Reconstituted IP3R3—10 μg/ml GST-LBD fusion protein or 2.8 μg/ml IP3R3 in buffer J (buffer H plus 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was incubated with various concentrations of IP3 containing 1:1000 as much [3H]IP3. Binding experiments were carried out in the absence of free external Ca2+. After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, a 0.2 volume of each sample was filtered through a spun concentrator with molecular weight cut-off of 30,000. The radioactivity of each filtrate was determined by a liquid scintillation counter and compared with the control values without proteins. The same method was applied to measure Ca2+ binding on the recombinant GST-LBDs. Effect of External Ca2+ on the IP3 Binding to Recombinant GST-LBD—10 μg/ml IP3R-GST fusion protein was incubated with various concentrations of Ca2+ in the presence of a fixed concentration of IP3 containing 1:1000 as much [3H]IP3. After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, a 0.2 volume of each sample was filtered through a spun concentrator, and the radioactivity of filtrate was determined as described. Fluorescence and CD Spectroscopy—To measure the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp residues in the recombinant LBD-His protein (1 μm), the emission intensity in the range 310–400 nm was recorded under 295 nm of excitation wavelength using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. CD spectra in the far-UV and near-UV regions were monitored at room temperature with a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo); the optical path lengths were 0.1 and 1.0 cm, respectively. Measurements were conducted in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 2.45 μm of Pro335LBD-His and 2.5 μm of Leu335LBD-His for the far-UV and 12.17 μm of Pro335LBD-His and 21.43 μm of Leu335LBD-His for near-UV regions, respectively. The standard conditions were as follows: bandwidth, 1 nm; response, 1–2 s; step resolution, 0.1–0.2 nm. Blanks (buffer) were routinely recorded and subtracted from the original spectra. On average, data from 30 to 40 scans were accumulated. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitated IP3R samples were dissolved with a 1% SDS solution and then analyzed by 7% SDS-PAGE. This was followed by immunoblotting and detection with anti-IP3R antibody. Polymorphism of IP3R3 Found in BC and B6 Mice—The coding sequences of the IP3R3 of BC and B6 mice were compared with the search for polymorphism that may potentially be associated with functional variation. The open reading frame consists of 8013 bp and 2670 encoded amino acids, showing 95 and 92% identity with rat and human orthologs, respectively. A total of 11 nucleotide polymorphisms were founded in the open reading frame. One of the polymorphisms at the 335th position resulted in a change in amino acid from proline to leucine (Fig. 1A). Sequencing of genomic DNA obtained from the two mouse strains confirmed the polymorphism. The change is located in the N-terminal LBD (amino acids 1–605) with variations among species (Fig. 1B). On the basis of the crystal structure of the IP3R1 LBD core (amino acids 224–604), we were able to position the 335th residue in a loop between the β6 and β7 strands (26Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The LBDs seems to have similar structure regardless of the receptor subtypes, because the sequence homologies among them are fairly high, e.g. 68% identity between types 1 and 3 in the LBD core sequence. In order to compare the relative expressions of three IP3Rs and the ones between two mouse strains, semi-quantitative RT-PCR (21De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Henning R.H. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Gijsens A. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was conducted with specific primers designed to amplify two isoforms simultaneously. The expression levels of IP3Rs of BC mice were ∼30% higher than those of B6 mice in the brain regardless of the receptor type (Fig. 2A). In the intestine, type 1- and type 2-specific bands were not detected in both mice. On the other hand, IP3R3 mRNA was expressed more in the BC intestine than that of B6 by ∼60%. A Western blotting analysis after immunoprecipitation using a specific antibody against IP3R3 showed that more IP3R3 proteins are expressed in the BC intestine than that of B6 (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with the results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results confirmed that IP3R3 is the major isoform expressed in the mouse intestine, with a slight variation in their expressions among inbred mice. IP3-binding Affinity and IP3-induced Ca2+ Release (IICR) of the Pro335 and Leu335 Forms of IP3R3—In order to test whether the polymorphism affects the intrinsic function of IP3R3, an IP3-binding assay was performed with purified Pro335IP3R3 and Leu335IP3R3 reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Considering that IP3R3 was highly expressed (10Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the expression of type 1 or 2 IP3R was not detected in intestines by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2A), the purified IP3R was expected to be mostly type 3. From the results, Pro335IP3R3 showed 2.4-fold higher IP3-binding affinity than that of Leu335IP3R3 (Fig. 3A). In particular, the difference was more significant at values less than 1 μm IP3, which is the range of physiological concentration after stimulation (27Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Above 1 μm IP3 concentration, both IP3R3s exhibited similar IP3-binding affinities. The IP3 dissociation constants (Kd) for Pro335IP3R3 and for Leu335IP3R3 were estimated to be 301.5 ± 28.9 and 722.4 ± 27.0 nm, respectively. Hill coefficients of both Pro335IP3R3 and Leu335IP3R3 were 1.1 and 2.7, respectively. These values indicate that IP3 binds to each subunit of Pro335IP3R3 independently, whereas IP3 binding to Leu335IP3R3 exhibits a positive cooperativity. As we observed an alteration in IP3-binding affinity, we further examined whether the polymorphism influences IICR. In a previous study, purified bovine IP3R1 reconstituted into proteoliposomes showed Ca2+ release in dose-dependent manner of IP3 (29Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent Ca2+ release of IP3 from reconstituted proteoliposomes in each IP3R3 was compared. As shown in Fig. 3B, Pro335IP3R3 released a significantly higher amount of Ca2+ than that of Leu335IP3R for all IP3 concentrations tested. In particular, the difference was remarkable in the range less than 3 μm IP3. The IP3 concentration for half-maximal Ca2+ release (EC50) of Pro335IP3R3 was 4.2-fold lower than that of Leu335IP3R3. EC50 of Pro335IP3R3 and Leu335IP3R3 was 248.6 ± 14.3 and 1019.2 ± 365.6 nm, respectively. This indicates that Pro335IP3R3 forms a more sensitive Ca2+ channel than Leu335IP3R3 in response to the same IP3 concentration. Ca2+ Effects on IICR of Pro335- and Leu335IP3R3—External Ca2+ is a well known modulator of IP3R3 Ca2+ channel activity (15Taylor C.W. Laude A.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Two Ca2+-binding sites were identified previously in LBD of IP3R1 exposed to cytosol, and the residues were conserved in LBD between IP3R1 and IP3R3 (11Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B.
