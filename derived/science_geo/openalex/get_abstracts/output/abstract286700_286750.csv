Microtubules are structures that are likely to be affected by a genetic defect causing a predisposition to Alzheimer's disease, trisomy 21 and, possibly, to myeloproliferative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1988747127,"The newly developed technique of ""tritium-helium dating"" has been used to investigate in situ rates of oceanic oxygen utilization. As an example, an apparent oxygen utilization rate of 0.20 +/- 0.02 milliliter per liter of water per year has been obtained for the Subtropical Mode water (18 degrees C water) in the Sargasso Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2030457651,"Electron micrographs and x-ray diffraction patterns of crystals of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, probably the most abundant protein on earth, have provided new details of the arrangement of subunits. The eight large subunits and eight small subunits are clustered in two layers, perpendicular to a fourfold axis of symmetry. Viewed down the fourfold axis, the molecule is square-shaped."

https://openalex.org/W2084600491,"Fission track, radiometric, and paleomagnetic age determinations in marine sedimentary rocks of the Ventura Basin make it possible to estimate the vertical components of displacement rates for the last 2 million years. The basin subsided at rates up to 9.5 ± 2.5 millimeters per year until about 0.6 million years ago, when subsidence virtually ceased. Since then, the northern margin of the basin has been rising at an average rate of 10 ± 2 millimeters per year, about the same rate as that based on the geodetic record north and west of Ventura since 1960 but considerably lower than the rate along the San Andreas fault at Palmdale since 1960."
