https://openalex.org/W1538692246,"Actin purified by a new, simple, and rapid purification procedure activated the ATPase activity of both heavy meromyosin and Subfragment 1 of heavy meromyosin, and this activation was not inhibited by the removal of Ca2+. Preparations of tropomyosin-troponin inhibited (by 85%) both the acto-heavy meromyosin and acto-Subfragment 1 ATPases in the absence of, but not in the presence of, Ca2+. This inhibition was shown to result from binding of the tropomyosin-troponin complex solely to actin and in a ratio of about 1 mole of tropomyosin-troponin to 7 moles of actin."
https://openalex.org/W1595204022,"Abstract An adenosine triphosphatase has been purified approximately 6-fold from sarcoplasmic reticulum through the use of deoxycholate and salt fractionation. Gel electrophoretic profiles indicate that the preparation consists largely of one protein component. Protein purification and the increase in ATPase activity appear to be commensurate. The enzyme, which is soluble by virtue of bound detergent, becomes insoluble when deoxycholate is removed. In both soluble and insoluble states the ATPase activity is stable under appropriate storage conditions. The enzyme contains phospholipid in an amount comparable to that found in intact reticulum. Since the ATPase activity is inhibited by digestion with phospholipase C but can be reactivated by further addition of phospholipid, the phospholipid is believed to be essential to activity. The properties of the purified enzyme appear to be the same as those of the enzyme in sarcoplasmic reticulum. In both cases the ATPase activity requires Mg++ and is stimulated by Ca++. The activity in the presence of 5 mm Mg++ is completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1 to 0.5 mm ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetate, a chelator with great specificity for Ca++. The enzyme is inhibited by mersalyl acid at the same levels required for inhibition in sarcoplasmic reticulum. ATPase activity is insensitive to ouabain or oligomycin. The purified enzyme catalyzes an ATP-ADP exchange and is phosphorylated by ATP labeled in the terminal position with 32P. The rate of ATP-ADP exchange and the level of phosphorylation are both increased by a factor commensurate with the increase in ATPase activity. The purified enzyme, depleted of deoxycholate, binds calcium in the presence of ATP and oxalate, but the rate is only a few per cent of that catalyzed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1538939790,"Abstract Purified troponin prepared according to published procedures was separated into four major protein fractions when chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex in 6 m urea. The main components in Fractions 1 to 4 had approximate molecular weights of 14,000, 24,000, 35,000, and 21,000, respectively, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Reconstitution experiments using all possible combinations indicated that Fractions 2, 3, and 4 restored the Ca++ requirement for the ATPase activity of actomyosin in the presence of tropomyosin. Recovery of activity could only be achieved when the required components were mixed prior to removal of urea. This suggests that one or more of these proteins may refold improperly on removal of urea unless the other components are present."
https://openalex.org/W1587174601,"Abstract In order to characterize a step in the reaction sequence of sodium and potassium ion-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3), the binding of radioactive adenosine triphosphate to kidney cell membranes was estimated by flow dialysis in the presence of a chelator of divalent cations, which prevented hydrolysis of the adenosine triphosphate. Adenosine triphosphate was bound to a single site on sodium and potassium ion-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (a) because binding capacity of the membranes was equal, one for one, to the phosphorylation capacity of this enzyme, (b) because binding was inhibited by pretreatment of the membranes with the specific inhibitor, ouabain, and (c) because binding was inhibited by potassium ion with antagonism of this inhibition by sodium ion, which had no direct effect. The dissociation constant was 0.22 µm. Other nucleotides displaced ATP including, in order of decreasing effectiveness: deoxyadenosine triphosphate, β,γ-methylene adenosine triphosphate, cytidine triphosphate, and inosine triphosphate. Monovalent cations reduced the binding affinity at progressively higher cation concentrations, as follows: potassium, rubidium, thallous, ammonium, and cesium ions. Lithium ion had no effect. Binding was stable between pH 5.6 and 7.6, but declined sharply above pH 8.0. In the presence of potassium ion alone, there appeared to be one or more binding sites on this enzyme with a much lower affinity for adenosine triphosphate. These may be regulatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1574721503,"Palmitoyl coenzyme A instantly and reversibly inhibited the electron transport-linked phosphorylation of ADP coupled to the oxidation of various substrates by rat heart mitochondria. The inhibitory effectiveness of palmitoyl-CoA was dependent on mitochondrial as well as ADP concentration. Removal of palmitoyl-CoA, such as by its oxidation following (—)-carnitine addition, led to a restoration of ADP-coupled mitochondrial oxidations. Excess of ADP also reversed the palmitoyl-CoA inhibition, whereas ATP, AMP, and guanosine diphosphate were ineffective. Dinitrophenol overcame the palmitoyl-CoA-imposed inhibition of mitochondrial oxidation. Palmitoyl-CoA also inhibited the dinitrophenol-stimulated mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase activity, whereas (—)-palmitoylcarnitine and lauryl sulfate did not show a comparable kind of effect, and oleate was relatively ineffective. However, palmitoyl-CoA did not inhibit the mitochondrial adenylate kinase or the palmitate-activating enzyme. Palmitoyl-CoA thus behaved like atractyloside, suggesting the site of its inhibition to be at the adenine nucleotide translocase. In agreement was the observation that palmitoyl-CoA decreased the affinity of the mitochondrial phosphorylation system for added ADP. CoA, acetyl-CoA, (—)-palmitoylcarnitine, oleate, or lauryl sulfate did not reveal a type of inhibition of ADP-supported mitochondrial oxidations shown by palmitoyl-CoA or stearoyl-CoA. It is possible that this inhibition of mitochondrial ADP phosphorylation by long chain acyl-CoA esters beregulate the proportioning of long chain acyl-CoA esters between their utilization for oxidation and for glyceride formation depending upon the availability of free fatty acids and the existing energy needs of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1517349884,"The (Na+ + K+) adenosine triphosphatase was obtained from canine renal medulla and partially purified. A highly active, membrane-bound enzyme was prepared from the microsomal fraction of a homogenate. The enzyme was then transferred from this particulate state to the supernatant phase by treatment with sodium deoxycholate and, in this form, it was further purified by gel filtration. The final preparation had a high specific activity which was constant over a significant region of the elution profile. When this material was examined by electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate solvent, more than 90% of the protein was accounted for by two polypeptide chains which were present in approximately equimolar amounts. The ratio of these two polypeptides remained constant in those fractions from the gel filtration which had the highest specific activity. The protein traveled as a single component in an acetic acid-urea electrophoresis system. These results suggest that a specific complex responsible for the (Na+ + K+) adenosine triphosphatase activity has been isolated."
https://openalex.org/W1484784503,"Abstract The purified ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum exists as particles with minimum dimensions of about 90 A when dispersed by deoxycholate. When the dispersing agent is removed, the enzyme spontaneously forms vesicular membranes. The membranes are 60 A in thickness when examined in thin section and show a trilaminar staining pattern. Freeze-fracture profiles of the membranes formed from the ATPase demonstrate the presence of globular subunits possibly corresponding to the ATPase molecules. The reformed membranes can be disrupted by treatment with trypsin but not by treatment with phospholipase C. In the latter case, the vesicles take on a signet ring appearance. The reformed membranes are free of the 30- to 50-A projecting particles which are characteristic of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. It is concluded that the ATPase enzyme is a functional subunit and is likely to be a structural subunit of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The membranes formed by the enzyme may be one enzyme particle in thickness. The projecting particles, which are missing from the purified ATPase preparation, cannot be concerned with the hydrolysis of ATP nor with the site of calcium activation of the ATPase. Amino acid and phospholipid analyses of the purified enzyme are presented. The phospholipid and neutral lipid content of the ATPase is identical with that of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The molecular weight of the protein is determined to be 102,000 daltons. Phosphorylation of the enzyme with ATP-γ-32P has led to a maximal measured specific phosphoryl content of 7.1 nmoles per mg of protein or about 0.73 phosphoryl groups/102,000 daltons. Each molecule of 102,000 appears, therefore, to contain one active site."
https://openalex.org/W1616924899,"Abstract Mitochondrial particles prepared from glucose-repressed yeast bind only nominal amounts of the soluble ATPase components, rutamycin-insensitive ATPase and oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein, when tested in an in vitro reconstitution assay. The capacity of the membranes to bind these components and to reconstitute rutamycin-sensitive ATPase increases when the cells are incubated in a derepression medium, suggesting that a membrane factor essential for the reconstitution is synthesized during the derepression. The effect of inhibitors of protein synthesis on the increase of the membrane factor during derepression has been studied. The membrane factor does not increase when either chloramphenicol or cycloheximide is added to the derepression medium. Increase of membrane factor, however, is found when yeast are incubated sequentially in derepression media containing first chloramphenicol and then cycloheximide. These results have been interpreted to indicate that the membrane factor is made by the mitochondrial protein-synthesizing system and that its synthesis is stimulated by products of the cytoplasmic ribosomal protein-synthesizing system. A positive control of mitochondrial protein synthesis by products of cytoplasmic ribosomal system is also supported by studies on the in vivo incorporation of amino acids into mitochondrial membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1549279227,"Abstract 1. The adenosine triphosphatase of rat liver mitochondria is tightly bound to the inner membrane and is solubilized in very poor yield (less than 0.5%) by sonic oscillation procedures alone. Solubilization of the enzyme in good yield (30 to 55%) is obtained by sonic oscillation provided the membranes are first washed exhaustively in low ionic strength buffer and incubated for 16 hours in the presence of ATP and ethylene glycol. Purification of the solubilized enzyme by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 consistently yields preparations exhibiting a specific activity of approximately 22 µmoles of ATP hydrolyzed per min per mg. 2. The purified enzyme is homogeneous as assessed by gel filtration, sedimentation in sucrose gradients, and sedimentation in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The molecular weight of the ATPase is 384,000 based on determinations of its sedimentation coefficient (s020,w = 12.15), diffusion coefficient (D020,w = 2.96 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1), and partial specific volume (v = 0.740 cm3 g-1). 3. Electrophoresis in two dissociating solvent systems indicates that the enzyme contains three classes of subunits. The molecular weights of the three subunits determined by their electrophoretic mobilities in the sodium dodecyl sulfatemercaptoethanol system are: subunit A, 62,500; subunit B, 57,000; and subunit C, 36,000. 4. The amino acid composition of the purified ATPase from rat liver mitochondria is strikingly similar to amino acid compositions reported for ATPases from such diverse sources as bovine heart mitochondria, spinach chloroplasts, and bacteria. The similarity in chemical and physical properties among these enzymes is discussed in terms of their possibly analogous structural and functional roles in these membrane systems."
https://openalex.org/W1558983023,"Abstract The (sodium + potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase (NaK ATPase) in Lubrol extracts of NaI-treated bovine brain microsomes has been purified 30 to 50 times over that in the microsomes by salt and isoelectric precipitation, zonal centrifugation, and a new ammonium sulfate fractionation procedure. The final step in the purification procedure renders the NaK ATPase insoluble. The partially purified enzyme has been examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after solubilization in either phenol-acetic acid-urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol. The former system is unsatisfactory in that a considerable proportion of the protein, including the NaK ATPase, remains at the origin; however, all of the protein penetrates the gel with the latter system. The purification procedure removes the majority of proteins seen in the microsomal fraction. With the partially purified enzyme, one prominent band, two less prominent bands, and two to three rather minor bands are seen with the sodium dodecyl sulfate system. The most prominent band has been identified as the phosphorylated subunit of the NaK ATPase by labeling its glutamyl-γ-phosphate residue with 32P by prior incubation of the partially purified enzyme with ATP-γ-32P in the presence of magnesium and sodium. Its apparent molecular weight is 94,000. Scanning of the protein-stained gel indicates that 25 to 40% of the protein applied to the gel can be accounted for by this 94,000 molecular weight subunit. The protein, phospholipid, and carbohydrate content of the preparation remain remarkably constant as purification proceeds, being approximately 50%, 25%, and 2 to 3%, respectively, of the dry weights of the preparations after correction for bound Lubrol. The protein-bound Lubrol at the final stage of purification is 17%. The cholesterol content falls with purification. Ninety-nine per cent of the ATPase in the partially purified enzyme is ouabain-sensitive. Ouabain-sensitive, potassium-activated p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity parallels NaK ATPase. All detectable cholinesterase in the microsomes is removed by purification. With the method of purification reported here, as much as 1.2 kg of bovine brain cortex can be worked up weekly giving 30 to 50 mg of final enzyme with a specific activity of 450 to 750 µmoles of ATP split per mg of protein per hour. Based on the gel scans and on calculations from the picomoles of phosphorylated subunit and molecular weight of the native enzyme, the best preparations are judged to be approximately half pure. The partially purified enzyme is quite stable on storage at 0°, retaining full activity for two months. Electron microscopy of the enzyme preparation after zonal centrifugation shows rods of about 60 A in diameter, spherical protein, and aggregated protein. The ammonium sulfate fraction shows chains of protein averaging 60 A in diameter, which are believed to be end-to-end aggregates of the rods seen in the zonal fraction. Many chains form ringlike structures. Sheets of aggregated protein are also seen. Resolubilization of the ammonium sulfate enzyme with Lubrol to protein ratios of 20:1 shows predominantly protein subunits averaging 60 A in diameter and some aggregates of subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1593011531,"Abstract Long chain fatty acids inhibit the Mg2+-dependent Na+ + K+-stimulated ATPase of rat brain microsomal membrane preparations without any significant effect on the basic Mg2+-stimulated component. The magnitude of inhibition increases with the chain length, reaching a maximum with myristate followed by a decline with higher fatty acids. Myristate (5 x 10-5 m) produces about 45% inhibition of the Na+ + K+-stimulated ATPase. Unsaturated fatty acids are more inhibitory than their corresponding saturated congeners; e.g. at 5 x 10-5 m, oleate produces 66% inhibition compared with 15% by stearate. The inhibitory effects are not due to the binding of Mg2+ by fatty acids as the effects are not reversed by increasing the Mg2+ concentration in the reaction. The inhibition is freely reversible and does not appear to be time dependent. Kinetic analysis of the action of myristate on the Na+ + K+-stimulated ATPase indicates that the inhibition is uncompetitive with respect to ATP and competitive with respect to K+. The primary site of action of myristate appears to be an inhibition of K+ activation of the enzyme. The Na+ activation of the enzyme is also inhibited, but only when the concentration of Na+ is very low; in the presence of higher concentrations of Na+, the action of myristate can be interpreted as a second (in addition to Na+) competitive inhibitor of K+. K+-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase is also inhibited in a competitive fashion by myristate. The myristate inhibition of the Na+ + K+-stimulated ATPase is as well elicited in the presence of ouabain or oligomycin. The effects of these mixed inhibitors are of a cumulative nature suggesting separate binding sites for each of the inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1549718609,"Abstract Three proteinpolysaccharide fractions with different physical properties, PPL3, PGS, and PPL5, have been isolated from crude proteinpolysaccharide extracted from bovine nasal cartilage with 3 m MgCl2. The macromolecular species present in each fraction have been visualized by electron microscopy by monolayer techniques of a mixed proteinpolysaccharide-cytochrome c film. The results suggest that both PPL3 and PGS may exist as mixtures of monomers and dimers formed by the end to end association of monomers. While PPL3 appears to exist mainly in the monomer form, PGS appears to exist almost entirely in the dimer form. Two kinds of aggregate forms were present in monolayer preparations of PPL5. The first order aggregates consist mainly of several dimers radiating outward in starlike fashion from a central locus of association. The larger, second order aggregates appear to consist of many dimers clustered around several central loci of association. From the electron micrographs, a model of increasing complexity has been derived for the macromolecular organization of cartilage ground substance."

However, contrary to our assumptions, the increase in raphe fluorescence is not prevented by p-chlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis. These results suggest that under some conditions derivatives of tryptophan other than, or in addition to, serotonin may be of significance in raphe neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1564757226,"The bird erythrocyte provides a cell system which comprises only two sorts of membranes, namely the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope. As calculated morphometrically, both of these membranes are present in an almost 1:1 membrane surface ratio. Contamination with other types of membranes is a priori excluded in this cell. Purified fractions of plasma membranes and nuclear envelope membranes were isolated by using nondetergent methods, in which high speed rotating knife homogenization is combined with differential and gradient centrifugation steps. Nuclear membranes were separated from other nuclear constituents after high salt extraction of nucleoproteins and sonic oscillation, with or without an additional digestion with DNase. Purity and structural integrity of the fractions are shown in electron micrographs. The buoyant densities of nuclear membranes (p422 = 1.20) and plasma membranes (p422 = 1.14) are different. The gross compositions of intact cells and the nuclei, nuclear membrane, and plasma membrane fractions, with respect to lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, protein, RNA, and DNA, are given, as well as corresponding recoveries. The nuclear membrane is distinct from the plasma membrane as shown in a much lower cholesterol-phospholipid ratio, in a higher content in protein, and a certain amount of DNA remaining firmly attached to it. In general, the properties of the bird erythrocyte plasma membrane agree with those known from the non-nucleated erythrocytes. Among the enzymes examined, the plasma membrane showed ATPase activity, including a ouabain-sensitive one. On the other hand, the nuclear membrane fraction was almost devoid of ATPase activity, but did show the activity of a typical endoplasmic reticulum type enzyme, the NADH-cytochrome c reductase. While the nuclear fraction demonstrated a strong enrichment for NAD+ pyrophosphorylase, this activity was not found in the plasma membranes or in the nuclear membranes, which indicates the low degree of nucleoplasmic protein contamination present in the nuclear membrane fraction. The differences between the only two membrane systems of this dead end differentiated cell type are discussed in context with the present concepts on the cytomembrane → plasma membrane polarization and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1579017170,Abstract A small amount of tritium incorporated from a labeled water medium into the coupling factor of chloroplasts has been interpreted as indicating a conformational change in the protein. The tritiation of this protein occurred in light but not darkness and was markedly inhibited by the uncouplers NH4Cl and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. These results raise the possibility that ATP formation in chloroplasts may be linked with a conformational change in the phosphorylating enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1486333464,"Abstract Illumination of chloroplasts in the presence of sulfate, ADP, and Mg2+ causes 35 to 50% inhibition of a subsequent phosphorylation reaction; ADP cannot be replaced by other nucleotides. Compounds that normally inhibit photophosphorylation prevent the appearance of the sulfate-induced inhibition. No evidence was found for phosphorylation site specificity of the sulfate inhibition. In chloroplasts inhibited by preliminary illumination with sulfate, the light-induced pH rise and the P/e2 ratio in a phosphorylating Hill reaction are inhibited as much as photophosphorylation is. The pH rise can be restored by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Both the trypsin- and dithiothreitol-activated Ca2+-dependent ATPase activities associated with the chloroplast coupling factor (CF1) are decreased in sulfate-inhibited chloroplasts. Removal of CF1 from the membranes followed by recombination with CF1 from noninhibited chloroplasts restores the pH rise completely and phosphorylation to a large extent. From these and other experimental results it is concluded that sulfate, in the presence of ADP and Mg2+, interacts with CF1 on chloroplast membranes under conditions of coupled electron flow so as to cause a modification of CF1 structure."
https://openalex.org/W1525649419,"Abstract 1. Submitochondrial particles have been sequentially treated with trypsin, urea, and sonic oscillation at an alkaline pH. These TUA particles required addition of a protein (Fc1) in order to render added ATPase (F1) sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Further resolution was obtained by exposure of TUA particles either to 2 m sodium thiocyanate or to 1.5% silicotungstate. These procedures removed a second soluble protein component (Fc2) which was also required for the sensitivity of ATPase to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 2. Preparations of Fc2 purified from the sodium thiocyanate extract stimulated the 32Pi-ATP exchange reaction and oxidative phosphorylation in silicotungstate-treated submitochondrial particles. 3. Treatment of TUA particles with silicotungstate reduced their ability to bind ATPase (F1). Addition of Fc2 restored the ability to bind ATPase. It is therefore proposed that Fc2 is a component which links the mitochondrial ATP-ase to the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W140926176,"Abstract 1. Treatment of subchloroplast particles with silicotungstate (0.3%) damaged the activities of Photosystem II. Photosystem I activity measured as methylviologen mediated O2 uptake with ascorbate as electron donor retained 60 to 70% of activity after exposure to 0.8% silicotungstate. At this concentration, there was a complete loss of cyclic photophosphorylation which was associated with the removal of Coupling Factor 1 from the particles. Partial restoration of cyclic photophosphorylation (up to 30 µmoles of ATP per mg of chlorophyll per hour) was obtained by reconstitution with CF1. 2. The characteristic 90 A inner membrane spheres seen in electron micrographs of negatively stained preparations of subchloroplast particles were removed by treatment with silicotungstate. Reconstitution of the resolved particles with coupling factor resulted in the reappearance of the inner membrane spheres. 3. A Mg++-dependent ATPase activity which was induced by exposure of chloroplasts to light and to chymotrypsin-free preparations of trypsin was shown to be another expression of the catalytic function of Coupling Factor 1. Exposure of pure coupling factor, activated by dithiothreitol, to trypsin also gave rise to a Mg++-dependent ATPase activity. However, whereas the activity associated with the particles was sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, that of the soluble coupling factor was not. Reconstitution of soluble, activated coupling factor with particles that had been treated with silicotungstate, followed by brief exposure of the reconstituted system to light, gave rise to an additional (about 3-fold) increase in Mg++-dependent ATPase activity. The activity acquired by recombination with the membrane was inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. This assay can be used for the isolation of membrane components responsible for the changes in the properties."
https://openalex.org/W1583340821,"Abstract We have isolated from Streptococcus faecalis plasma membranes a new protein, termed nectin, which is required for the attachment of the membrane enzyme, ATPase. Both nectin and membrane-bound ATPase are released from the native membranes by a procedure, described previously, which depends on repeated washing in dilute buffer without Mg++. Resolution of the solubilized nectin and ATPase can then be accomplished by gel filtration through agarose. The ATPase, separated from nectin by passage through agarose, fails to reattach to enzyme-depleted membranes unless nectin is added. The amount of ATPase that recombines with the depleted membranes is proportional to the amount of nectin added until the membrane receptor sites for the enzyme become nearly saturated. Nectin is heat labile and has an ultraviolet absorption spectrum typical of a protein. By the method of gel filtration through Sephadex, we estimate that its molecular weight is 37,000."
https://openalex.org/W1591572497,"Abstract Ammonium ions were shown to be much more efficient than potassium ions in activating rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11). Under experimental conditions simulating physiological ones (pH 7.2, and inhibitory concentrations of ATP), the apparent dissociation constant of the phosphofructokinase-NH4+ complex was 0.33 mm. This molarity was shown to lie within the physiological concentration of ammonia in several tissues exhibiting pronounced glycolytic activity. The activation of the enzyme by NH4+ was very specific and rapid. It was observed also when ITP was the phosphate donor, indicating that the activation was not mere deinhibition of ATP. The form of phosphofructokinase predominant in the presence of NH4+ exhibited in a qualitative fashion the same allosteric characteristics of the enzyme form prevailing in its absence, i.e. sigmoidicity with respect to fructose 6-phosphate, and sensitivity to inhibition by citrate and higher concentrations of ATP. However, NH4+ (2 mm) decreased the Km for ATP (from 0.031 mm to 0.013 mm) and for fructose 6-phosphate (from 0.34 mm to 0.04 mm), and increased the Ki for citrate (from 0.025 mm to 0.055 mm) and for ATP (from 0.31 mm to 0.48 mm). It is proposed that the activation of phosphofructokinase by NH4+ could be a regulatory mechanism which provides the metabolites necessary for ammonia fixation and the maintenance of its concentration at tolerable levels. Moreover, the possibility that the increase in tissue concentrations of NH4+ under anoxia might be a contributing factor to the Pasteur effect is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2464215900,"Abstract The Ca2+ uptake and the calcium-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity of skeletal muscle microsomes are inhibited by alkali ions in assay media containing ATP concentrations ranging from 10-6 to 10-5 m. No inhibition is observed at ATP concentrations higher than 10-4 m. The pattern of inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by different alkali ions varies depending on the ATP concentration. For 2 µm ATP, the sequence of inhibition is Li+ g Na+ g K+ and for 10 µm ATP is Na+ g Li+ ≥ K+. The calcium-activated ATPase is inhibited according to the same pattern, Na+ g Li+ ≥ K+, at both 2 and 10 µm ATP. The dependence of the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake on the ATP concentration displays hyperbolic saturation curves in assay media containing 20 mm KCl, 120 mm KCl, or 120 mm NaCl. Na+ and K+ inhibit both the Ca2+ uptake and the calcium-activated ATP-ase activity to the same extent. In contrast, sigmoidal saturation curves for Ca2+ uptake and hyperbolic saturation curves for the calcium-activated ATPase are obtained in media containing 120 mm LiCl. When the free Ca2+ concentration is varied from 1.0 to 7.1 µm in media containing 10 µm ATP and 20 mm KCl, 120 mm KCl, or 120 mm NaCl, both the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake and the calcium-activated ATPase activity increase hyperbolically. Lowering the ATP concentration to 2 µm results in sigmoidal saturation curves for Ca2+ uptake and hyperbolic saturation curves for the calcium-activated ATPase activity. The Ca2+ uptake in media containing 120 mm LiCl is a sigmoidal function of the Ca2+ concentration both at ATP concentrations of 2 µm and 10 µm. However, the calcium-activated ATPase always shows a hyperbolic dependence on the Ca2+ concentration. The effect of alkali ions on Ca2+ influx and efflux through the skeletal muscle microsomes membrane was studied with the use of 2 µm ATP. Both the rate of Ca2+ efflux and of active transport are inhibited by Na+ and Li+. In media containing 120 mm of either NaCl or LiCl, the equilibrium between active transport and Ca2+ efflux is reached at Ca2+ concentrations higher than 0.5 µm. The rate of Ca2+ exchange between the interior of the vesicles and the assay medium is essentially the same in the presence or absence of 120 mm of either NaCl or LiCl. The data presented suggest that: (a) acetyl phosphate and ATP are both substrates of a common active site for the Ca2+ transport; and (b) the binding of ATP to the Ca2+ carrier system promotes conformational changes which result in modification of its affinity for Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1556179982,"Abstract The activity of UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2) has been detected in lysates of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. It is apparently part of a pathway leading from glucose 1-phosphate to an acid mucopolysaccharide uniquely associated with the spores. The enzyme was found to accumulate and then disappear at different stages of fruiting body construction. The accumulation could be prevented by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. During the latter stages of morphogenesis, epimerase activity can be detected extracellularly and appears to be preferentially released by the cells. Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to possible existence of intracellular organelles and their relation to the biosynthesis of the mucopolysaccharide in D. discoideum."

https://openalex.org/W1535983201,"Abstract Addition of 2-deoxyglucose to a culture of the hybrid yeast Saccharomyces fragilis x Saccharomyces dobzhanskii causes 2- to 200-fold increase in the differential rate of synthesis of all glycolytic enzymes except alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1). For most enzymes, the stimulation in the rate of synthesis occurs with a delay. The greatest stimulation is observed in the case of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), viz. about 200-fold, while P-glycerate mutase (EC 2.7.5.3) and enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) show a 2.5-fold increase in the differential rate of synthesis. Glucosone also stimulates the rate of synthesis of hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) and glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase. Generally, glycolytic enzyme synthesis is elicited by all compounds studied which are substrates of yeast hexokinase, while 6-deoxyglucose fails to induce synthesis either in the hybrid yeast or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The loss of fructose-phosphorylating activity in a hexokinaseless mutant of this yeast is associated with the failure of fructose to induce any of the glycolytic enzymes that fructose induces in the wild type. The differential rates of synthesis of all of the glycolytic enzymes between aldolase (EC 4.1.2.7) and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) increase 6- to 150-fold over the basal rates when glucose is added to a P-glucoisomerase (EC 5.3.1.9)-deficient mutant of S. cerevisiae. Experiments with a P-mannoisomerase (EC 5.3.1.8)-deficient mutant of S. cerevisiae indicate that hexokinase and P-fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) synthesis is stimulated in response to the presence of mannose. These and other data on the metabolites produced from 2-deoxyglucose have been interpreted to suggest that glucose-6-P is the inducer of the following enzymes: aldolase, triose-P isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1), glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, P-glycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), P-glycerate mutase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase. Mannose-6-P is the inducer of hexokinase and, presumably, of P-fructokinase. Pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.7.1.1) does not appear to be induced by glucose-6-P. These data are also consistent with P-glucomutase (EC 2.7.5.1) being induced by glucose-1-P."

https://openalex.org/W1960831194,"Abstract Three principal effects of mercurial reagents on the ATPase activity of isolated heart mitochondria have been defined. The observed ATPase activity depends on the extent of binding of the mercurial to the membrane and on ion movements across the membrane as follows. 1. Under conditions of low mercurial binding (approximately 20 nmoles per mg of protein or less), ATP-dependent ion uptake and swelling are activated by mercurials and an elevated ATPase activity is observed. For example, p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate strongly activates ATPase in heart mitochondria suspended in salts of strong acid anions. The observed ATPase activity shows a marked specificity for K+ and is closely associated with the accumulation of ions and osmotic swelling of the mitochondria. Respiration opposes the swelling under these conditions but actually enhances the ATPase activity. The observed effects on mitochondrial swelling and ATPase activity appear to be related to the inability of the phosphate carrier to remove Pi from the matrix in the presence of the mercurial, and to the fact that p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate induces passive permeability to Cl-. p-Chloromercuriphenylsulfonate does not induce passive permeability to H+ or cations, but increases K+ uptake in the presence of ATP. 2. Less polar mercurials such as p-chloromercuribenzoate react with internal as well as superficial thiols (approximately 40 nmoles per mg total) and these reagents induce passive permeability to both anions and cations. Under these conditions ATPase activity is strongly inhibited. 3. Heart mitochondria which have been swollen osmotically in the presence of mercurials by either active or passive ion uptake can be contracted by an ATP-dependent reaction if the mercurial is removed by excess dithioerythritol. The resulting ion extrusion is accompanied by elevated ATPase activity. A model based on the simultaneous entrance of cations with ATP and the postulates of the chemiosmotic coupling hypothesis is presented to account for the observed effects of mercurials on the ATPase activity of heart mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W3119408838,"The effects of myo-inositol (inositol) deprivation on the Na+ and K+ transport system of KB cells and on the Na+- and K+- activated adenosine triphosphatase of cell-free extracts were investigated. Kinetic studies under presteady state conditions showed that inositol deprivation causes a decrease of the initial rates of K+ influx and Na+ efflux. Both the Vmax of K+ influx and the Km for K+ are decreased. The rate of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the membrane-bound, Na+- and K+-activated adenosine triphosphatase is greatly diminished in inositol-deficient cells. Both the Vmax and the Km values for K+ and Na+ are decreased. These changes are quantitatively identical with those observed in the case of Na+ and K+ fluxes across the plasma membrane of intact cells. Inositol-deficient cells are unable to concentrate K+ to the same extent as normal cells, but the steady state concentration of intracellular Na+ remains within normal range. The lower intracellular concentration of K+ in inositol-deficient cells is not responsible for the impaired transport of α-amino-isobutyric acid exhibited by these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1633956689,"Abstract Rabbit liver, kidney, and small intestine contain glucosidase activity with a very high affinity toward the 3-β-d-glucosides of estrone, 17α-estradiol and 17β-estradiol. The liver enzyme has been purified 300- to 400-fold by chromatography on Sephadex G-150 and CM-cellulose. The Km for the hydrolysis of 17α-estradiol-3-glucoside by the purified enzyme was 5 x 10-10 m as compared to 3.9 x 10-5 m, 1.3 x 10-3 m, and 2.1 x 10-3 m for 17α-estradiol-17-glucoside, 17β-estradiol-17-glucoside, and p-nitrophenyl glucoside, respectively. Tissue distribution studies suggest that different steroid glucosidases, or else different forms of a single enzyme, may be responsible for hydrolysis of the phenolic and the alcoholic glucosides of the estrogens. The rapid hydrolysis of the estrogen-3-glucosides may explain the previous findings that these glycosides can be made by rabbit tissues in vitro, but are absent from rabbit excreta. The steroid glucosides represent novel, naturally occurring substrates for mammalian β-glucosidase, and are also very convenient substrates for its assay."

Disc electrophoresis revealed one major protein band. This protein bound 0.042 µmole of colchicine per 100 mg; it lacked ATPase activity, but markedly altered the cation requirements for the ATPase activity of both muscle myosin and thrombosthenin-M, and when added to either muscle myosin or thrombosthenin-M, produced a rise in relative viscosity which fell sharply upon addition of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2098999660,"Abstract Initial reaction velocities of yeast hexokinase and the adenosine 5'-triphosphatase activity associated with hexokinase were studied in the presence and absence of 1.5 m NaCl. At least 500 times more enzyme is required for the latter measurement relative to the determination of hexokinase activity. The Michaelis constants for adenosine 5'-triphosphate for the two activities are essentially the same in the salt environment but differ by a factor of 25 in the absence of NaCl. Gel filtration experiments indicate that the molecular weight of the enzyme is decreased by 10 mm glucose, 1.5 m sodium chloride, or dilution. The sedimentation coefficients were determined for hexokinase with and without 1.5 m NaCl. The s20,w is significantly higher in the absence of the salt. The results from these studies support the view that, when the physical state of the yeast enzyme is the same in both the hexokinase and ATPase assays, the Km values for ATP are the same for both activities. These findings are taken to be evidence in support of a random kinetic mechanism for the yeast phosphotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1572017248,"Abstract The activation of the ATPase activity of yeast hexokinase by d-lyxose and d-xylose was investigated. Sugars lacking a carbon 6 activate the ATPase activity while the presence of a carbon 6 inhibits the activity. Xylose and lyxose, which are competitive inhibitors of glucose in the hexokinase reaction, induce substrate inhibition by ATP in the hexokinase and ATPase reactions. Ultracentrifugation studies indicate that the various sugars change the conformation of hexokinase to give lower s20,w values. The pentose activation of the ATPase activity has previously been interpreted as evidence for an ordered mechanism, but the initial rate and competitive inhibition studies of this report support a random addition of pentose and ATP in the reaction. These results are consistent with the proposed Random Bi Bi mechanism suggested for hexokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1669265119,"Abstract Reaction of streptokinase with 1 mole of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide results in a 50% loss of potency in the standard clot lysis assay. Reaction with a second mole of reagent results in only a slight additional loss in potency. However, the modification of the 2 residues of streptokinase does not inhibit the formation of the stoichiometric complex with plasminogen or the formation of the active enzymatic site in the complex as measured by the hydrolysis of α-N-toluene sulfonyl-l-arginine methyl ester. Relative to the plasmin-native streptokinase complex, the complex formed from human plasminogen and benzylated streptokinase has a higher Km with excess human plasminogen but a lower Km with bovine plasminogen. Evidence based on difference spectra indicates that the substrate plasminogens interact with one or both of the 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl residues of streptokinase in the complex, but α-N-toluene sulfonyl-l-arginine methyl ester does not. This evidence supports the conclusion that in addition to the hydrolytic center on the plasmin portion of the activator complex, there is a site on the streptokinase portion which binds plasminogen substrates so that the peptide bond which must be cleaved for activation is brought into juxtaposition with the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1610660903,"Abstract The S-carboxymethyl heavy chain derivative of human plasmin was prepared in a highly purified form by precipitating out the contaminating S-carboxymethyl light chain derivative in 1 m trichloracetic acid-8 m urea. The S-carboxymethyl heavy chain derivative was shown to be homogeneous by ultracentrifugal, carboxyl-terminal amino acid, and cellulose acetate electrophoretic analyses. Its weight average molecular weight was determined to be 48,800 ± 3,000 and its sedimentation coefficient was determined to be 2.8 S. Arginine was verified to be its carboxyl-terminal amino acid. The heavy chain derivative consists of approximately 410 amino acid residues."

https://openalex.org/W1505652413,"The incorporation of various radioactive reagents into myosin and sarcoplasmic proteins of resting and electrically stimulated frog muscles was studied. N-Ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide showed a decreased incorporation into myosin during contraction, whereas benzenediazonium chloride could not differentiate between myosin of contracting and resting muscle. None of these reagents showed any specificity as far as the sarcoplasmic proteins were concerned. On account of its high incorporation into myosin, N-ethylmaleimide was used to determine the distribution of label in the substructure of myosin. Most of the label was found in the globular head part (heavy meromyosin subfragment 1) of the myosin molecule and only a small amount of label was in its rod-like part (heavy meromyosin subfragment 2 and light meromyosin). The entire difference in incorporation between contracting and resting muscle (0.5 to 0.7 mole of label per mole of myosin) occurred in the globular head. In terms of muscle structure, these results indicate that the change in reactivity during contraction appears in the cross-bridges, whereas the backbone of the filament and its linkage with the cross-bridge remain unaffected. The decreased incorporation was not caused by a protecting effect of actin or ATP, or both, on the active site of myosin. This was evidenced by the identical actin-binding ability and ATPase activity of myosin from contracting or resting muscle. Dowex 50 chromatography of peptic, tryptic, peptictryptic-chymotryptic, and subtilisin digests of myosin from contracting and resting muscle yielded a large number of radioactive peptides. Most of the peptides were similar but a number of them were different. The prevalent difference was that the peptides derived from myosin of contracting muscle contained less radioactivity than the corresponding ones from myosin of resting muscle. These results are compatible with the idea that during contraction a conformational change occurs in a certain area of the cross-bridges rendering this area inaccessible for reaction with N-ethylmaleimide."
https://openalex.org/W1515537925,"Abstract The roles of K+ and the Na+- and K+-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+ pump) in the transport of α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) in KB cells were evaluated. It was shown that 0.33 µm ouabain causes half-maximal inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump. Similar sensitivity to the inhibitor was shown earlier for AIB transport. However, whereas the pump is inhibited maximally within 90 sec, inhibition of AIB transport is time-dependent and is maximal after 30 min of the cells' exposure to the inhibitor. Selective inactivation of the Na+-K+ pump by ouabain or by omission of extracellular K+ is without effect on the rate of AIB influx, provided that the concentration of intracellular K+ remains above 30 mm. Depletion of intracellular K+ leads to a loss of concentrative AIB transport. This inactivation is not immediate; rather, it is time-dependent. Subsequent addition of KCl fails to reverse this inactivation, even though the cells can concentrate K+ 11-fold to a level greater than 55 mm. The intracellular K+ concentration which protects against inactivation of the AIB transport system is above 30 mm. Extracellular K+, other than being the source of intracellular K+, is not required for active AIB transport. It is concluded that the role of the Na+-K+ pump in AIB transport is to maintain the necessary concentration of intracellular K+ for maintaining the functional integrity of the AIB transport system."
https://openalex.org/W2071682430,"RATS treated with approximately 20 mg/kg of cyclamate each day have been found to behave abnormally1 and it is believed that the behavioural changes may be induced during meiosis and embryonic development2. The offspring are hyperactive and slow to develop a response to food reward and, once trained, they are deficient, in comparison with controls, in tasks requiring response inhibition. Our results suggest similarities to certain types of brain-lesioned rats and to minimal brain-damaged human offspring. We have studied the effects of artificial sweeteners on human offspring because, in the past decade, they have been consumed by vast numbers of women, particularly during pregnancy. The questionnaire technique, with all its inherent faults, has been used because this was the only method readily available; the area of interest was “hidden” in the series of questions asked. The data suggest that during the past decade there were correlations between the known use of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy and behavioural and physical aberrations in human offspring."

Experiments were carried out under conditions in which no known magnesium effects occurred, so that only the effect of calcium on the nucleoside triphosphatase activity of myosin A could be qualitatively characterized. Myosin A ATPase was inhibited by free ATP at 0.15 ionic strength in the presence of millimolar calcium and 0.006 m KCl. A reaction model is proposed in which Ca-ATP is the substrate for native myosin A and inhibition is brought about by 2 moles of ATP."
