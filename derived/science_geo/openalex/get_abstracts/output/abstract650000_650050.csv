https://openalex.org/W3013215798,"The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems. Preventing further transmission is a priority. We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact tracing needed to stop the epidemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 is spreading too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, it could be controlled if this process were faster, more efficient, and happened at scale. A contact-tracing app that builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without resorting to mass quarantines (""lockdowns"") that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind."
https://openalex.org/W3013188135,"The most effective interventions By 23 January 2020, China had imposed a national emergency response to restrict travel and impose social distancing measures on its populace in an attempt to inhibit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, which measures were most effective is uncertain. Tian et al. performed a quantitative analysis of the impact of control measures between 31 December 2019 and 19 February 2020, which encompasses the Lunar New Year period when millions of people traveled across China for family visits. Travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan were too late to prevent the spread of the virus to 262 cities within 28 days. However, the epidemic peaked in Hubei province on 4 February 2020, indicating that measures such as closing citywide public transport and entertainment venues and banning public gatherings combined to avert hundreds of thousands of cases of infection. It is unlikely that this decline happened because the supply of susceptible people was exhausted, so relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence. Science , this issue p. 638"
https://openalex.org/W3013649595,"Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ∼4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ∼3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ∼2.6 based on confirmed cases and ∼2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around ∼0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February."
https://openalex.org/W3013360115,"What will be the global impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)? Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3013900499,"Single-cell CRISPR screens enable the exploration of mammalian gene function and genetic regulatory networks. However, use of this technology has been limited by reliance on indirect indexing of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Here we present direct-capture Perturb-seq, a versatile screening approach in which expressed sgRNAs are sequenced alongside single-cell transcriptomes. Direct-capture Perturb-seq enables detection of multiple distinct sgRNA sequences from individual cells and thus allows pooled single-cell CRISPR screens to be easily paired with combinatorial perturbation libraries that contain dual-guide expression vectors. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for high-throughput investigations of genetic interactions and, leveraging this ability, dissect epistatic interactions between cholesterol biogenesis and DNA repair. Using direct capture Perturb-seq, we also show that targeting individual genes with multiple sgRNAs per cell improves efficacy of CRISPR interference and activation, facilitating the use of compact, highly active CRISPR libraries for single-cell screens. Last, we show that hybridization-based target enrichment permits sensitive, specific sequencing of informative transcripts from single-cell RNA-seq experiments."

https://openalex.org/W3014091199,"We recently described glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) as a promising target for killing therapy-resistant cancer cells via ferroptosis. The onset of therapy resistance by multiple types of treatment results in a stable cell state marked by high levels of polyunsaturated lipids and an acquired dependency on GPX4. Unfortunately, all existing inhibitors of GPX4 act covalently via a reactive alkyl chloride moiety that confers poor selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we report our discovery that masked nitrile-oxide electrophiles, which have not been explored previously as covalent cellular probes, undergo remarkable chemical transformations in cells and provide an effective strategy for selective targeting of GPX4. The new GPX4-inhibiting compounds we describe exhibit unexpected proteome-wide selectivity and, in some instances, vastly improved physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties compared to existing chloroacetamide-based GPX4 inhibitors. These features make them superior tool compounds for biological interrogation of ferroptosis and constitute starting points for development of improved inhibitors of GPX4."

Here we show how to decode the electrocorticogram with high accuracy and at natural-speech rates. Taking a cue from recent advances in machine translation, we train a recurrent neural network to encode each sentence-length sequence of neural activity into an abstract representation, and then to decode this representation, word by word, into an English sentence. For each participant, data consist of several spoken repeats of a set of 30-50 sentences, along with the contemporaneous signals from ~250 electrodes distributed over peri-Sylvian cortices. Average word error rates across a held-out repeat set are as low as 3%. Finally, we show how decoding with limited data can be improved with transfer learning, by training certain layers of the network under multiple participants' data."
https://openalex.org/W3013936205,"SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake is critical for maintaining redox balance and cell survival. Here we show that this comes at a significant cost for cancer cells with high levels of SLC7A11. Actively importing cystine is potentially toxic due to its low solubility, forcing cancer cells with high levels of SLC7A11 (SLC7A11high) to constitutively reduce cystine to the more soluble cysteine. This presents a significant drain on the cellular NADPH pool and renders such cells dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway. Limiting glucose supply to SLC7A11high cancer cells results in marked accumulation of intracellular cystine, redox system collapse and rapid cell death, which can be rescued by treatments that prevent disulfide accumulation. We further show that inhibitors of glucose transporters selectively kill SLC7A11high cancer cells and suppress SLC7A11high tumour growth. Our results identify a coupling between SLC7A11-associated cystine metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway, and uncover an accompanying metabolic vulnerability for therapeutic targeting in SLC7A11high cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3013072344,"Mining the antibody repertoire of plasma cells and plasmablasts could enable the discovery of useful antibodies for therapeutic or research purposes1. We present a method for high-throughput, single-cell screening of IgG-secreting primary cells to characterize antibody binding to soluble and membrane-bound antigens. CelliGO is a droplet microfluidics system that combines high-throughput screening for IgG activity, using fluorescence-based in-droplet single-cell bioassays2, with sequencing of paired antibody V genes, using in-droplet single-cell barcoded reverse transcription. We analyzed IgG repertoire diversity, clonal expansion and somatic hypermutation in cells from mice immunized with a vaccine target, a multifunctional enzyme or a membrane-bound cancer target. Immunization with these antigens yielded 100–1,000 IgG sequences per mouse. We generated 77 recombinant antibodies from the identified sequences and found that 93% recognized the soluble antigen and 14% the membrane antigen. The platform also allowed recovery of ~450–900 IgG sequences from ~2,200 IgG-secreting activated human memory B cells, activated ex vivo, demonstrating its versatility. Millions of primary IgG-secreting cells from mouse and human are characterized for activity and antibody sequence at the single-cell level."

This first comprehensive application of the fast-fail approach evaluated the potential of κ-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonism for treating anhedonia with a POM study determining whether robust target engagement favorably impacts the brain circuitry hypothesized to mediate clinical effects. Here we report the results from a multicenter, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in patients with anhedonia and a mood or anxiety disorder (selective KOR antagonist (JNJ-67953964, 10 mg; n = 45) and placebo (n = 44)). JNJ-67953964 significantly increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ventral striatum activation during reward anticipation (primary outcome) as compared to placebo (baseline-adjusted mean: JNJ-67953964, 0.72 (s.d. = 0.67); placebo, 0.33 (s.d. = 0.68); F(1,86) = 5.58, P < 0.01; effect size = 0.58 (95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.99)). JNJ-67953964, generally well tolerated, was not associated with any serious adverse events. This study supports proceeding with assessment of the clinical impact of target engagement and serves as a model for implementing the 'fast-fail' approach."
https://openalex.org/W3013821852,"The importance of germline-inherited post-translational histone modifications on priming early mammalian development is just emerging1-4. Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) trimethylation is associated with heterochromatin and gene repression during cell-fate change5, whereas histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation marks active gene promoters6. Mature oocytes are transcriptionally quiescent and possess remarkably broad domains of H3K4me3 (bdH3K4me3)1,2. It is unknown which factors contribute to the maintenance of the bdH3K4me3 landscape. Lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) demethylates H3K9me3 at promoters marked by H3K4me3 in actively transcribing somatic cells7. Here, we report that KDM4A-mediated H3K9me3 demethylation at bdH3K4me3 in oocytes is crucial for normal pre-implantation development and zygotic genome activation after fertilization. The loss of KDM4A in oocytes causes aberrant H3K9me3 spreading over bdH3K4me3, resulting in insufficient transcriptional activation of genes, endogenous retroviral elements and chimeric transcripts initiated from long terminal repeats during zygotic genome activation. The catalytic activity of KDM4A is essential for normal epigenetic reprogramming and pre-implantation development. Hence, KDM4A plays a crucial role in preserving the maternal epigenome integrity required for proper zygotic genome activation and transfer of developmental control to the embryo."

Therapeutic bacteria would benefit from the ability to turn on different programs of gene expression in response to conditions inside and outside of the gut; however, the availability of regulatory parts, and methods to combine them, have been limited in B. thetaiotaomicron2-5. We report implementation of Cello circuit design automation software6 for this species. First, we characterize a set of genome-integrated NOT/NOR gates based on single guide RNAs (CRISPR-dCas9) to inform a Bt user constraint file (UCF) for Cello. Then, logic circuits are designed to integrate sensors that respond to bile acid and anhydrotetracycline (aTc), including one created to distinguish between environments associated with bioproduction, the human gut, and after release. This circuit was found to be stable under laboratory conditions for at least 12 days and to function in bacteria associated with a primary colonic epithelial monolayer in an in vitro human gut model system."
https://openalex.org/W3012969293,"During mouse embryonic development, pluripotent cells rapidly divide and diversify, yet the regulatory programs that define the cell repertoire for each organ remain ill-defined. To delineate comprehensive chromatin landscapes during early organogenesis, we mapped chromatin accessibility in 19,453 single nuclei from mouse embryos at 8.25 days post-fertilization. Identification of cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin pinpointed two TAL1-bound endothelial enhancers, which we validated using transgenic mouse assays. Integrated gene expression and transcription factor motif enrichment analyses highlighted cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Subsequent in vivo experiments in zebrafish revealed a role for the ETS factor FEV in endothelial identity downstream of ETV2 (Etsrp in zebrafish). Concerted in vivo validation experiments in mouse and zebrafish thus illustrate how single-cell open chromatin maps, representative of a mammalian embryo, provide access to the regulatory blueprint for mammalian organogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W3013336903,"The availability of nucleotides has a direct impact on transcription. The inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) with leflunomide impacts nucleotide pools by reducing pyrimidine levels. Leflunomide abrogates the effective transcription elongation of genes required for neural crest development and melanoma growth in vivo1. To define the mechanism of action, we undertook an in vivo chemical suppressor screen for restoration of neural crest after leflunomide treatment. Surprisingly, we found that alterations in progesterone and progesterone receptor (Pgr) signalling strongly suppressed leflunomide-mediated neural crest effects in zebrafish. In addition, progesterone bypasses the transcriptional elongation block resulting from Paf complex deficiency, rescuing neural crest defects in ctr9 morphant and paf1(alnz24) mutant embryos. Using proteomics, we found that Pgr binds the RNA helicase protein Ddx21. ddx21-deficient zebrafish show resistance to leflunomide-induced stress. At a molecular level, nucleotide depletion reduced the chromatin occupancy of DDX21 in human A375 melanoma cells. Nucleotide supplementation reversed the gene expression signature and DDX21 occupancy changes prompted by leflunomide. Together, our results show that DDX21 acts as a sensor and mediator of transcription during nucleotide stress."
https://openalex.org/W3015079562,"Tumor cells can spread to distant sites through their ability to switch between mesenchymal and amoeboid (bleb-based) migration. Because of this difference, inhibitors of metastasis must account for each migration mode. However, the role of vimentin in amoeboid migration has not been determined. Because amoeboid leader bleb–based migration (LBBM) occurs in confined spaces and vimentin is known to strongly influence cell-mechanical properties, we hypothesized that a flexible vimentin network is required for fast amoeboid migration. To this end, here we determined the precise role of the vimentin intermediate filament system in regulating the migration of amoeboid human cancer cells. Vimentin is a classic marker of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and is therefore an ideal target for a metastasis inhibitor. Using a previously developed polydimethylsiloxane slab–based approach to confine cells, RNAi-based vimentin silencing, vimentin overexpression, pharmacological treatments, and measurements of cell stiffness, we found that RNAi-mediated depletion of vimentin increases LBBM by ∼50% compared with control cells and that vimentin overexpression and simvastatin-induced vimentin bundling inhibit fast amoeboid migration and proliferation. Importantly, these effects were independent of changes in actomyosin contractility. Our results indicate that a flexible vimentin intermediate filament network promotes LBBM of amoeboid cancer cells in confined environments and that vimentin bundling perturbs cell-mechanical properties and inhibits the invasive properties of cancer cells."

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between food insecurity with hunger and psychological distress among older people in Ghana.A total of 1200 individuals aged ≥50 years were recruited during 2016/2017 Ageing, Health, Psychological Well-being and Health-seeking Behavior Study. Associations between psychological distress (assessed with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) and hunger (assessed with a 30-day subjective scale) were evaluated using linear regression modeling.The overall prevalence of food insecurity was 36% with approximately 27% and 9% respectively for moderate and severe levels of hunger whilst the mean score of psychological distress was 9.5 (±4.10). Persons experiencing moderate hunger (β = 0.71, SE = 0.160, p < 0.001) and severe hunger (β = 1.81, SE = 0.280, p < 0.001) significantly reported increased psychological distress outcome compared to those without hunger. These associations varied between women (β = 1.59, SE = 0.359 p < 0.001) and men (β = 2.33, SE = 0.474, p < 0.001) as well as 50-64 age group (β = 1.48, SE = 0.368, p < 0.005) and 65+ age group (β = 2.51, SE = 0.467, p < 0.001).The results suggest that experiencing hunger is associated with psychological distress and the effect may be aggravated with advancing age and in men. These findings may inform social policy initiatives and health programmatic interventions for older people exposed to food insecurity."

Multidrug-resistant S. Heidelberg strains are disseminated into poultry production chair, which can lead to severe clinical infections in humans and of difficult to treat. This study aimed at evaluating the β-lactam susceptibility and genotypic relatedness of Salmonella Heidelberg at Brazilian poultry production chain. Sixty-two S. Heidelberg strains from poultry production chain (poultry, poultry meat and poultry farm) were used. All strains were evaluated to antimicrobial susceptibility by diffusion disk test, as well as β-lactam resistance genes. Genotypic relatedness was assessed by Pulsed-Field Gel Eletrophoresis, using Xba1 restriction enzyme. Forty-one strains were characterized as multidrug-resistant according to phenotype characterization. The resistance susceptibility revealed 31 distinct profiles, with higher prevalence of streptomycin (61/62), nalidixic acid (50/62), tetracycline (43/62) and β-lactam drugs (37/62). blaCMY-2 was the more frequent β-lactamase gene found (38/62); other resistance genes found were blaCTX-M (2/62), blaSHV (3/62) and blaTEM-1 (38/62). No carbapenemase genes was found. The Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis showed 58 different profiles. Strains with a larger number of antimicrobial resistance were grouped into ten major clusters apart from others. The spread of resistance by ampC continues to rise, thereby turning concern to public health, since the β-lactam antimicrobials are used as a therapeutic treatment in humans."

Here we show that the axon guidance cue Netrin-1 promotes naive pluripotency by triggering profound signalling, transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in mESCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 can substitute for blockade of Gsk3α/β and Mek1/2 to sustain self-renewal of mESCs in combination with leukaemia inhibitory factor and regulates the formation of the mouse pluripotent blastocyst. Mechanistically, we reveal how Netrin-1 and the balance of its receptors Neo1 and Unc5B co-regulate Wnt and MAPK pathways in both mouse and human ESCs. Netrin-1 induces Fak kinase to inactivate Gsk3α/β and stabilize β-catenin while increasing the phosphatase activity of a Ppp2r2c-containing Pp2a complex to reduce Erk1/2 activity. Collectively, this work identifies Netrin-1 as a regulator of pluripotency and reveals that it mediates different effects in mESCs depending on its receptor dosage, opening perspectives for balancing self-renewal and lineage commitment. Netrin-1, via precise Neo1/Unc5B stoichiometry, promotes naive pluripotency, embryonic stem cell self-renewal in combination with leukaemia inhibitory factor, and the formation of the mouse epiblast in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3013558001,"Employer-sponsored health insurance is the most widely spread form of medical coverage in the United States. Substantial portion of the premiums' costs is covered by employers, thus contributing to labor costs for organizations. Although worker health and well-being have become increasingly important for businesses, most of them do not see a direct link between their health and well-being investments and work output and quality of work of their employees. This study aimed to estimate the cost of inefficiencies at work with emphasis on their internal causes, i.e., sick-related absenteeism and distraction at work. With data from 3,258 employees (2,775 office and 483 manufacturing) from a major US manufacturer with revenue of $6 billion, monetary loss in productivity due to sick-related absenteeism and distraction among office and factory floor employees was assessed. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scale and the Health-related Lost Productivity Time tool (both already validated) were used to estimate the cost of productivity loss. Survey data on health-related absenteeism and distraction time at work, together with company pay records, were used. A secondary analysis, using survey data collected from 615 Polish apparel factory workers at a major global brand complemented with their payroll records (absenteeism and salary), was conducted to validate the main findings. Results of the primary analysis indicated that annual productivity loss to the organization amounted to approximately $300 m. Distraction contributed to 93.6% of the annual productivity loss of the US manufacturer, while only 6.4% resulted from health-related absenteeism, implying that distraction at work cost this organization almost 15 times more than health related absenteeism, reducing the overall return on sales by over 6 pp. The secondary analysis corroborated the dominance of distraction induced productivity costs over the cost of health-related absenteeism. Evidence from the regression analysis conducted on cross-sectional data indicated that regardless of the type of work, work engagement and auditory privacy were evidently highly bound with productivity loss. For manufacturing workers, job security was also negatively correlated with productivity loss, while for office employees, better social relationships and lack of work-family conflict were positively associated with productivity. Despite being based on two case studies, our results are informative of the magnitude of distraction and health related productivity costs. They also show that workers with deficiencies in their well-being at work present a substantial opportunity for growth to companies in terms of reduced efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3013760885,"This study aimed to evaluate the oxidative status and antioxidant capacity in maternal and fetal livers upon undernutrition as well as the connection between oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorder. Ten ewes, who were pregnant for 115 days, were restricted to a 30% level of ad libitum feed intake to develop an undernourished model, while another 10 pregnant ewes were fed normally as controls. Undernutrition induced severe lipid metabolism disorder and oxidative stress in blood, maternal liver, and fetal liver. RNA-sequencing data displayed that antioxidant capacity was changed and antioxidant genes were downregulated in maternal and fetal livers of the undernourished model. Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) levels showed a positive correlation with oxidative indices and negative correlation with the expression of antioxidant genes both in maternal and fetal livers. Primary hepatocytes experiments confirmed that both high levels of NEFAs and BHBA could elicit oxidative stress and decrease antioxidant capacity, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA)/retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA) signaling pathway played a vital role in enhancing antioxidant capacity and relieving oxidative stress. In conclusion, maternal undernutrition induced lipid metabolism disorder, which downregulated antioxidant genes, decreased antioxidant activity, and further triggered oxidative stress both in maternal and fetal livers. Activation of PPARA/RXRA signaling could enhance antioxidant capacity and mitigate oxidative stress. Our findings contribute to protecting the pregnant mother and her fetus from oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3013803258,"The Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) is a top predator that inhabits the Iberian Peninsula. In Portugal, its numbers and distribution declined throughout the 20th century, due to human persecution, habitat degradation and prey decline, which have led to higher predation rates of livestock in the remaining packs. In Montesinho Natural Park (northeast Portugal), wild ungulate populations have been increasing in the last years, which may have led wolf to predate upon them. In order to assess Iberian wolf diet in this area, 85 wolf scats were collected from transects distributed throughout the study area in two periods between November 2017 and August 2019. Scat analysis indicated a high predation on wild ungulates, where the frequency of occurrence showed that roe deer was the most consumed prey (44%), followed by red deer (26%) and wild boar (24%). Domestic/wild cat (6%), domestic goat and stone marten (5%) were consumed in lower quantities. It was found a higher selection towards roe deer (D = 0.71) and this was the only prey item which was significantly dependent of the season of the year (χ2 = 16.95, df = 3, p < 0.001). This is the first study in Portugal where was recorded that wolves feed mainly on wild ungulates. We conclude that lower livestock predation may be correlated with higher wild ungulates densities in our study area, as well as suitable husbandry practices, leading to a shift on Iberian wolf diet from mainly livestock on previous studies to wild ungulates."

Systemic treatments were prescribed to patients with frequent (more than 2 flares per year) or severe uveitis, according to a step-up strategy.101 patients (51.5% of men, 88.1% of white Europeans) with a median age of 37 years. AU was mostly recurrent (68.3%) and associated with spondyloarthritis (60.4%). After a median follow-up duration of 22 months (3-73), 37.6% of the patients have received systemic treatment. 88.5% of the patients have been treated with sulfasalazine (SSZ) for ophthalmologic purposes (23/26). Methotrexate (MTX) and anti-TNFα agents have been initiated for a rheumatologic indication in 81.8% (9/11) and 100% of the patients (13/13), respectively. The annual uveitis relapse rate significantly decreased on SSZ (0.37 recurrences/year versus baseline 2.46 recurrences/year; p<0.001) and MTX (1.54 recurrences/year versus 4.17/year; p = 0.008). Patients under ADA for ophthalmologic purposes (n = 2) did not experience any recurrence.We report an open-label strategy to prevent the recurrences of HLA-B27-associated AU. First-line sulfasalazine reduced uveitis relapses. The use of anti-TNFα agents for ophthalmologic purposes was unnecessary with rare exceptions."

Using the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) rat model of pre-eclampsia, this study aimed to define the plasma metabolic profile following treatment with L-Ergothioneine.The effect of L-Ergothioneine (ET) treatment was explored using in vivo treatment in rats: Sham control (SC, n = 5), RUPP control (RC, n = 5), Sham +ET (ST, n = 5), RUPP +ET (RT, n = 5). Differential expression of plasma metabolites were obtained using untargeted liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was performed on normalised data comparing RC to SC, RT to RC, and RT to ST. Metabolites significantly altered (FDR < 0.05) were identified through database search.We report significantly lower levels of L-palmitoylcarnitine in RC compared to SC, a fatty acyl substrate involved in beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. We report that a metabolite that has been associated with oxidative stress (Glutamylcysteine) was detected at significantly higher levels in RT vs RC and RT vs ST. Five metabolites associated with inflammation were significantly lower in RT vs RC and three metabolites in RT vs ST, demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effects of ET in the RUPP rat model of pre-eclampsia.L-Ergothioneine may help preserve mitochondrial function by increasing antioxidant levels, and reducing inflammatory responses associated with pre-eclampsia.

To find novel and potentially targetable STAT3 regulators we performed a kinase and phosphatase siRNA screen with cells expressing either a hyperactive STAT3 mutant or IL6-induced wild type STAT3. The screen identified cell division cycle 7-related protein kinase (CDC7), casein kinase 2, alpha 1 (CSNK2), discoidin domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2), cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2-alpha (PI4KII), C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase H (PTPRH) as potential STAT3 regulators. Using small molecule inhibitors targeting these proteins, we confirmed dose and time dependent inhibition of STAT3-mediated transcription, suggesting that inhibition of these kinases may provide strategies for dampening STAT3 activity in cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3013806590,"Rictor is an essential component that directly activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, which contributes to the intrinsic axon growth capacity of adult sensory neurons after injury. However, whether its action also applies to regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) remains unknown. In this study, rats were given spinal cord contusion at the T9-10 level to establish the SCI model and were subsequently treated with intraspinal cord injection of a Rictor overexpression lentiviral vector to locally upregulate the Rictor expression in the injured spinal cord. Thereafter, we investigated the therapeutic effects of Rictor overexpression in the injured spinal cords of SCI rats. Rictor overexpression not only significantly attenuated the acute inflammatory response and cell death after SCI but also markedly increased the shift in macrophages around the lesion from the M1 to M2 phenotype compared to those of the control lentiviral vector injection-treated group. Furthermore, Rictor overexpression dramatically increased neurogenesis in the lesion epicenter, subsequently promoting the tissue repair and functional recovery in SCI rats. Interestingly, the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of Rictor overexpression on SCI may be associated with the Rictor overexpression playing a role in the anti-inflammatory response and driving macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype, which benefits resident neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival. Our findings demonstrate that Rictor is an effective target that affects the generation of molecules that inhibit spinal cord regeneration. In conclusion, localized Rictor overexpression represents a promising potential strategy for the repair of SCI."
https://openalex.org/W3013046995,"Endothelial cells are a primary site of leukocyte recruitment during inflammation. An increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) levels as a result of infection or some autoimmune diseases can trigger this process. Several autoimmune diseases are now treated with TNFa inhibitors. However, genomic alterations that occur as a result of TNF-mediated inflammation are not well understood. To investigate molecular targets and networks resulting from increased TNFa, we measured DNA methylation and gene expression in 40 human umbilical vein endothelial cell primary cell lines before and 24 hours after stimulation with TNFa via microarray. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 15 gene groups (modules) with similar expression correlation patterns; four modules showed a strong association with TNFa treatment. Genes in the top TNFa-associated module were all up-regulated, had the highest proportion of hypomethylated regions, and were associated with 136 Disease Ontology terms, including autoimmune/inflammatory, infectious and cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. They included chemokines CXCL1, CXCL10 and CXCL8, and genes associated with autoimmune diseases including HLA-C, DDX58, IL4, NFKBIA and TNFAIP3. Cardiovascular and metabolic disease genes, including APOC1, ACLY, ELOVL6, FASN and SCD, were overrepresented in a module that was not associated with TNFa treatment. Of 223 hypomethylated regions identified, several were in promoters of autoimmune disease GWAS loci (ARID5B, CD69, HDAC9, IL7R, TNIP1 and TRAF1). Results reveal specific gene groups acting in concert in endothelial cells, delineate those driven by TNFa, and establish their relationship to DNA methylation changes, which has strong implications for understanding disease etiology and precision medicine approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3014522831,"This year’s Gairdner Foundation Award for Biomedical Research goes to Roel Nusse for his pioneering work on the Wnt signaling pathway and its many roles in development, cancer, and stem cells. This year’s Gairdner Foundation Award for Biomedical Research goes to Roel Nusse for his pioneering work on the Wnt signaling pathway and its many roles in development, cancer, and stem cells. All multicellular animals face the daunting task of properly organizing their cells into complex, specialized tissues. They do not only have to build these structures during embryonic development but also actively maintain them to preserve homeostasis later in life. A tissue, therefore, is a dynamic entity in which cells actively turn over. The inability to balance cell proliferation and differentiation in this context is a recipe for disaster, resulting in either unbridled cell division (risking tumor formation) or loss of tissue integrity (contributing to degenerative diseases and aging). In the past 40 years, the Wnt signal transduction pathway has emerged as a cell-to-cell communication pathway with an important role in each of the aforementioned processes. Conserved in all multicellular animals, it is one of the oldest developmental signaling pathways, controlling robust pattern formation in the early embryo in myriad species. Interest in Wnt signaling stretches far beyond the developmental and evolutionary biology communities, however, and research in the field has impacted on many areas of biomedical research. None of this would have been possible without the contributions of Roel Nusse, who has, in many ways, shaped the field itself from the very start (Figure 1). Unbeknownst to him at the time, Nusse stumbled upon the Wnt pathway in the late 1970s, when he was a PhD student in what was then the Division of Virology at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. His research focused on the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a retrovirus that had long been known to cause mammary tumor formation in certain inbred mouse strains. The mechanism, however, remained entirely unknown. His was another project in a long tradition of MMTV studies that had been ongoing at the Netherlands Cancer Institute since the 1930s. Let us pause for a moment to sketch the biomedical research landscape at the time. In 1975, the potential hazards of recombinant DNA technology (i.e., the possibility to cut and paste together pieces of DNA from different species for the first time in history, something referred to as “DNA cloning” and nowadays one of the most basic techniques in any molecular biology lab) had been discussed at the famous Asilomar conference. This had resulted in a set of guidelines under which experiments using the technology were judged safe to continue. Up until then, it had been virtually impossible for researchers to get their hands on specific DNA sequences—let alone use them for experimentation. Around the same time, the question of what caused cancer was also a hot topic of debate. Cumulative research had just revealed that the fast-transforming Rous sarcomavirus carried a transforming oncogene, later to be known as v-src. Other, slow-transforming viruses, including MMTV, seemed devoid of such a load. Then came the Nobel prize-winning work of Harold Varmus and J. Michael Bishop, which showed that v-src had a non-viral origin: somehow, the virus had at one point hijacked a cellular gene (c-src). This so-called proto-oncogene was found to be present in the genome of many different species, suggesting that cancer too might have a cellular origin and that, perhaps, slow-transforming retroviruses could induce cancer by activating these proto-oncogenes. Roel Nusse initially studied the infection mechanism of MMTV as well as the characteristics of some of its proteins. But in 1980, researchers at the institute had gotten their hands on recombinant DNA technology, and the expectation was that this would help reveal what changes were brought about by integration of MMTV into mammary epithelial cells. By then, Nusse had also come into contact with Harold Varmus, who was equally intrigued by the question of how MMTV caused mammary tumors to form. Nusse joined Varmus for a postdoc at the University of California in San Francisco. The offer letter (archived by the US National Library of Medicine) sketches a long list of interesting projects, mentioning what would later become groundbreaking work as almost an afterthought in the P.S.: “I should have mentioned the possibility of looking directly at the ‘dominant’ proviruses in tumor DNA.” Together, Nusse and Varmus indeed set out to find a tumor with a clonal MMTV insertion in which they could ultimately map the precise proviral integration site: in this particular locus (int-1), the virus had landed in the vicinity of an unknown gene, inducing its enhanced expression via the strong enhancer sequences in the viral LTRs. Many other, independent tumors also harbored a proviral integration in int-1, suggesting a causal role for this cellular gene product in mammary tumor formation. One year later, the structure of the gene had been mapped. Barring any homology to known oncogenes, this represented the discovery of a novel cellular proto-oncogene (Nusse and Varmus, 1982Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Many tumors induced by the mouse mammary tumor virus contain a provirus integrated in the same region of the host genome.Cell. 1982; 31: 99-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). After returning to the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Nusse and coworkers spent the remainder of the decade trying to figure out the identity and function of the int-1 gene. As a sign of the times, the Division of Virology had been renamed to the Division of Molecular Biology, and Nusse and colleagues were eager to apply the appropriate methods to further investigate int-1's biological function and oncogenic properties. This was not immediately successful: sequencing of the gene did not reveal similarities to other known sequences (although it should be noted that the database at the University of California in San Diego contained only 2,000 of such sequences at the time). It did uncover a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at the N terminus—now known to be the signal peptide for Wnt protein secretion. Attempts to raise antisera against an int-1 fusion protein expressed in bacteria did not yield antibodies capable of recognizing the native protein. Transcripts of the int-1 gene could be detected in embryos, but not in adult animals. An early effort to generate int-1 transgenic mice (in collaboration with molecular geneticist Anton Berns, who had recently introduced genetically engineered mouse models at the institute) also failed to provide any clues, as the transgenic animals all died prior to weaning. In 1986, because of the restricted embryonic expression pattern and given the fact that int-1 was highly conserved in evolution, the idea arose to clone the Drosophila homolog, which could then be used to screen for developmental mutants. This turned out to be a lucky decision: the fly homolog mapped to the same chromosomal position as the segment polarity gene wingless (wg). Just like that, int-1 had become the first mammalian oncogene with a known developmental mutant in Drosophila and, with that, the first example of an oncogene with a critical role in normal development (Rijsewijk et al., 1987Rijsewijk F. Schuermann M. Wagenaar E. Parren P. Weigel D. Nusse R. The Drosophila homolog of the mouse mammary oncogene int-1 is identical to the segment polarity gene wingless.Cell. 1987; 50: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). With their hands on a fly homolog and access to developmental mutants, exciting new opportunities arose. Attempts to generate antisera against the wg protein were successful. Earlier work on wg had shown that the mutation acted non-cell autonomously. This, in combination with the protein sequence, suggested that the wg gene product could be secreted. Together with Peter Lawrence at Cambridge University, who studied pattern formation in the Drosophila embryo, Nusse was able to show the specific location of wg in developing larva. Electron microscopy studies clearly revealed the presence of wg protein inside small vesicles, as well as in the extracellular space between wg-producing cells and neighboring engrailed (en)-expressing cells. The latter also seemed to have taken up wg protein, leaving the authors to conclude that “it seems likely that the wingless gene product functions as a paracrine factor that binds to a receptor” (van den Heuvel et al., 1989van den Heuvel M. Nusse R. Johnston P. Lawrence P.A. Distribution of the wingless gene product in Drosophila embryos: a protein involved in cell-cell communication.Cell. 1989; 59: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In 1989, Roel Nusse was whisked away by Stanford University to join the newly formed Department of Developmental Biology in the Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine and, together with most of his group, left the Netherlands Cancer Institute—something that then-director Piet Borst described as “a major blow,” highlighting his “broad knowledge, nose for quality and ability to promote collaborations.” The generation of wg transgenic flies turned out more successful than the earlier attempts in mice: the flies presented with an embryonic phenotype that made it possible to screen for suppressor mutations and thereby map the factors responsible for transducing the wg signal. Multiple groups used similar approaches at the time, harnessing the full power of Drosophila developmental genetics that had been made possible by the Nobel prize-winning work of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus. In the early 1980s, they had managed to identify, and then classify, many different segmentation mutants. The wg mutant belonged to one of these classes—that of the segment polarity genes (Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980Nüsslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in Drosophila.Nature. 1980; 287: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2825) Google Scholar). Mark Peifer and Eric Wieschaus first proposed that another one of these genes, armadillo (arm), interacted with the wg pathway to control pattern formation in the developing and adult fly (Peifer et al., 1991Peifer M. Rauskolb C. Williams M. Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. The segment polarity gene armadillo interacts with the wingless signaling pathway in both embryonic and adult pattern formation.Development. 1991; 111: 1029-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By combining different mutants, genetic epistasis experiments soon revealed many more components involved in the wg pathway and, more importantly, the order in which they acted. Together, work from the Nusse, Peifer, Perrimon, and Wieschaus labs thus revealed the core working mechanism of what was, by then, becoming known as the Wnt pathway (Clevers and Nusse, 2012Clevers H. Nusse R. Wnt/β-catenin signaling and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 1192-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar, Nusse and Varmus, 2012Nusse R. Varmus H. Three decades of Wnts: A personal perspective on how a scientific field developed.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2670-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In a savvy display of forward thinking, the few scientists working on int-1/wingless-related proteins in vertebrates jointly proposed a new nomenclature for int-1 and its rapidly expanding gene family. Among them were Andrew McMahon and Randall Moon, who had by then begun to identify a large family of int-1-related genes in mice and frogs. They had also just introduced a powerful technique to study the activity of int-1 in early vertebrate development: the famous Xenopus axis duplication assay (McMahon and Moon, 1989McMahon A.P. Moon R.T. Ectopic expression of the proto-oncogene int-1 in Xenopus embryos leads to duplication of the embryonic axis.Cell. 1989; 58: 1075-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The name Wnt (pronounced “wint”) was proposed “for the wingless-type MMTV integration site that founded the gene family” (Nusse et al., 1991Nusse R. Brown A. Papkoff J. Scambler P. Shackleford G. McMahon A. Moon R. Varmus H. A new nomenclature for int-1 and related genes: the Wnt gene family.Cell. 1991; 64: 231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It has often been said that behind every great man there’s a great woman, and rumor has it that it was in fact Roel Nusse’s wife, Betsy, who came up with the suggestion for that name (Nusse and Varmus, 2012Nusse R. Varmus H. Three decades of Wnts: A personal perspective on how a scientific field developed.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2670-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). With a large part of the Wnt signal transduction pathway now mapped out, two main question marks remained. What was the identity of the cell-surface receptor that made cells competent to respond to Wnt proteins, and what happened once the signal reached arm? Drosophila would again provide one of the answers, when fz2 was identified as a wg receptor in a collaborative effort between the labs of Roel Nusse and Jeremy Nathans (Bhanot et al., 1996Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. A new member of the frizzled family from Drosophila functions as a Wingless receptor.Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Light on the other question was to be shed from a different corner, representing one of the few holes in the Wnt pathway that were plugged without Roel Nusse’s apparent direct involvement. Armadillo in flies had by then been shown to be homologous to beta-catenin (CTNNB1) in vertebrates, a known component of adherens junctions. While Nusse was occupied with the upstream hunt for the Wnt receptor, scientists over in Europe uncovered an interaction between CTNNB1 and transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family. One of them was Hans Clevers, who had up until then been studying TCF1, a transcription factor critical for T cell development. Another was Walter Birchmeier, whose research had been angled toward the role of E-cadherin, and by association CTNNB1, in suppressing cell invasion and metastasis. Yeast-two-hybrid screens revealed CTNNB1 as a binding partner for human TCF1 and, conversely, led to the discovery of LEF1 as a CTNNB1-interacting protein (Behrens et al., 1996Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Functional interaction of β-catenin with the transcription factor LEF-1.Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar, Molenaar et al., 1996Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destrée O. Clevers H. XTcf-3 transcription factor mediates β-catenin-induced axis formation in Xenopus embryos.Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). This not only marked a clear end point for how Wnt signaling was ultimately able to regulate target gene transcription but also gave rise to one of the most robust tools to study WNT/CTNNB1 signaling: the famous TOPFLASH luciferase reporter assay, which contains a multimerized stretch of TCF/LEF binding sites. A couple of years prior, Paul Polakis and others had already shown that CTNNB1 interacted with the tumor suppressor protein APC, thereby firmly consolidating the link between Wnt signaling and cancer. By 1998, the idea of a “destruction complex,” responsible for the controlled turnover of CTNNB1 in the absence of a WNT signal, had become established in the rapidly expanding community of Wnt researchers, tying all of the available genetic evidence together into a biochemical model that still very much holds up today (Clevers and Nusse, 2012Clevers H. Nusse R. Wnt/β-catenin signaling and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 1192-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar, Nusse and Varmus, 2012Nusse R. Varmus H. Three decades of Wnts: A personal perspective on how a scientific field developed.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2670-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, Nusse revisited the problem of Wnt protein purification. Plans to overproduce and purify a bioactive form of the mammalian Wnt1 protein had been made as early as 1988 and had failed miserably. But in 2003, Karl Willert and Roel Nusse finally succeeded to purify active mouse WNT3A protein (Willert et al., 2003Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates 3rd, J.R. Nusse R. Wnt proteins are lipid-modified and can act as stem cell growth factors.Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). The “trick,” as it turned out, was to preserve solubility of the Wnt protein—something that is achieved by including serum in the medium while culturing and by including detergent during the purification and fractionation steps. Otherwise, Wnt proteins, which turned out to be highly hydrophobic as a result of a post-translational lipid modification, will aggregate and become nonfunctional. This important achievement chimed in a new chapter in Nusse’s research, which would slowly move away from Drosophila and back to studying mammalian tissues over the next decade. It was becoming clear that in addition to controlling the development of complex animal tissues, WNT/CTNNB1 signaling was also critical for maintaining their integrity, suggesting a role in stem cell biology. Indeed, Nusse’s lab has shown that purified WNT3A is capable of maintaining self-renewal in many types of stem cells, including pluripotent embryonic stem cells and, signaling a brief return of his research to the tissue in which it all began, those of the mammary epithelium (Zeng and Nusse, 2010Zeng Y.A. Nusse R. Wnt proteins are self-renewal factors for mammary stem cells and promote their long-term expansion in culture.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 568-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Roel Nusse’s recent work has also employed in vivo lineage-tracing strategies, using expression of the negative-feedback target gene Axin2 to mark WNT/CTNNB1-responsive cells, to identify new populations of stem cells in multiple tissues, with a recent focus on hepatocytes and adjacent central vein endothelial cells as a liver stem cell/niche compartment. It should be evident by now that Roel Nusse is a well-deserving recipient of this year’s Gairdner award. Major other breakthroughs have been made possible as a result of his work, which reverberates across the cancer research and stem cell biology fields. Retroviral insertional mutagenesis was used for decades after the initial MMTV screen by Nusse and Varmus to identify new oncogenes, for instance by the labs of Anton Berns and Neil Copeland. Model organisms from across the animal kingdom, including the starlet sea anemone Nematostella and planarian flatworms, have revealed a fundamental role for Wnt signaling in regeneration. Organoid cultures, branded “method of the year” by Science magazine in 2017, have transformed basic stem cell research and hold great promise for regenerative medicine. Those cultures, started from adult tissue stem cells, almost invariably require active WNT/CTNNB1 signaling for their long-term maintenance. One of the most exciting promises is that of using the Wnt pathway as a target for therapeutic intervention. This includes the development of selective inhibitors to block aberrant Wnt signaling in cancer, as well as the development of specific agonists to mobilize self-renewal signaling in stem cells, the latter being aimed at preventing tissue degeneration or promoting injury repair. Using a combination of smart design and protein engineering, the generation of surrogate Wnt agonists is showing great promise for future applications in this area (Janda et al., 2017Janda C.Y. Dang L.T. You C. Chang J. de Lau W. Zhong Z.A. Yan K.S. Marecic O. Siepe D. Li X. et al.Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling.Nature. 2017; 545: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The discovery of the Wnt1 gene as being overexpressed, rather than genetically altered, in mammary tumors opened the door to the idea that a mere change in RNA and protein levels, rather than a clear gain or loss of function, could contribute to tumor formation. This also forms the basis for thinking about developmental signaling pathways as targets for cancer therapy, since tumors might highjack these networks to promote their own growth and differentiation even in the absence of mutations. Efforts to develop Wnt-secretion inhibitors or antibodies interfering with WNT/FZD binding have been successful, but clinical implementation of these drugs still has major challenges to overcome. To prevent detrimental side effects of such a treatment, we need to find a way to block oncogenic Wnt signaling while leaving the physiological processes that depend on it intact. To maximize clinical efficacy, patients who have the best chance of benefiting from the drug need to be selected—something that is more difficult in the absence of a clear genetic mutation. Of course, as far as Wnt signaling itself is concerned, the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway is just one arm of a much larger network. CTNNB1-independent Wnt signaling activities play a critical role in planar cell polarity, convergent extension and other complex cell movements, including cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Here, a younger generation of researchers is following in the footsteps of people like Randall Moon, Norbert Perrimon, and Paul Adler to continue to solve the mysteries in this exciting field. Roel Nusse himself will probably be the first to remind us that he does not study Wnt, but stem cells. However, there is no denying that his true legacy is that of an entire field of Wnt signaling research. By all intents and purposes, he has become the pater familias of an ever-growing community of scientists who find themselves fascinated by the Wnt pathway—the author of this piece included. As everyone who has ever attended a Wnt meeting knows, the show isn’t really over until Roel Nusse has picked up the microphone to thank the organizers, summarize the highlights, and point out a few of the key questions that everyone should go home to study. One other contribution, therefore, should not be left unmentioned. As curator of the Wnt homepage (http://wnt.stanford.edu), Nusse has created an online resource that benefits all researchers in the field, as well as those who are first entering it. Starting a website is one thing. Actively maintaining and updating it for more than 20 years is something different altogether. Frequently cited itself, the Wnt homepage is a valuable repository that also contains information that tends to get left out of scientific publications, such as the traps associated with Wnt protein purification, or, in Nusse’s words, “unpublished misery in many labs.” At Stanford, Roel Nusse has received continuous support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1990. As he celebrates his 70th birthday this year, he continues his efforts to identify common principles of tissue development and maintenance. Hopefully, just like last time, the 70s will turn out to be the start of something beautiful. I thank Tanne van der Wal for designing the figure and acknowledge funding support from the Dutch Cancer Society (KWF Kankerbestrijding), the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), and the University of Amsterdam . I am happy to have found access to the old annual scientific reports of the Netherlands Cancer Institute online. I know I have omitted the contributions of many, either by mistake or for stylistic reasons."
https://openalex.org/W3013894205,"The specification of cell identity depends on the exposure of cells to sequences of bioactive ligands. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) affects neuronal development in the early stage, and it is involved in neuronal lineage reprogramming. We previously established a fibroblast-like dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs) derived from highly homogeneous mature adipocytes, which are more suitable for the study of cellular reprogramming. Canine cognitive dysfunction is similar to human cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that dogs could be a pathological and pharmacological model for human neuronal diseases. However, the effect of ATRA on neuronal reprogramming in dogs has remained unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of ATRA on the neuronal reprogramming of canine DFATs. ATRA induced the expression of neuronal marker mRNA/protein. The neuron-like cells showed Ca2+ influx with depolarization (50 mM KCl; 84.75 ± 4.05%) and Na+ channel activation (50 μM veratridine; 96.02 ± 2.02%). Optical imaging of presynaptic terminal activity and detection of neurotransmitter release showed that the neuron-like cells exhibited the GABAergic neuronal property. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing analysis shows that the transcriptome profile of canine DFATs is effectively reprogrammed towards that of cortical interneuron lineage. Collectively, ATRA can produce functional GABAergic cortical interneuron-like cells from canine DFATs, exhibiting neuronal function with > 80% efficiency. We further demonstrated the contribution of JNK3 to ATRA-induced neuronal reprogramming in canine DFATs. In conclusion, the neuron-like cells from canine DFATs could be a powerful tool for translational research in cell transplantation therapy, in vitro disease modeling, and drug screening for neuronal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3013545214,"Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the small and medium blood vessels. Endothelial injury is one of the pathological hallmarks of MPA. However, the pathogenesis for this has not yet been fully elucidated. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as a new molecular pattern involved in the endothelial injury in other diseases. Hence, we speculated that MPA plasma-derived exosomes (MPA-exo) could induce the endothelial injury, which was likely to be aroused by the dysregulated exosomal miRNAs in MPA. In the present study, plasma-derived exosomes were isolated and identified. MPA-exo could be internalized by human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) in vitro and induced HRGECs injury. Subsequently, a series of differentially expressed miRNAs in MPA-exo were identified by high-throughput sequencing analysis. Further bioinformatics analysis for the target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs showed a potential mechanism for their possible role in MPA endothelial injury. Notably, we revealed a considerable correlation between miR-185-3p, miR-125a-3p, and clinical parameters. In conclusion, the current study revealed that differentially expressed miRNAs in MPA-exo are associated with the endothelial injury. Our results suggested that these miRNAs and their target genes might be involved in the inflammation process of MPA."

Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies to depurate livestock moderately contaminated with POPs in order to reduce such economic and social damages. This study aimed to test a POPs depuration strategy based on undernutrition (37% of energy requirements) combined with mineral oil (10% in total dry matter intake) in nine non-lactating ewes contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and PCBs 126 and 153. In order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the depuration process, POPs kinetics and body lipids dynamics were followed concomitantly over 57-day of depuration in POPs storage (adipose tissue, AT), central distribution (blood) and excretion (faeces) compartments. Faecal POPs concentrations in underfed and mineral oil supplemented ewes increased by 2.0 to 2.6-fold, but not proportionally to lipids concentration which increased by 6-fold, compared to the control ewes. Nonetheless, after 57 days of depuration in undernutrition and mineral oil supplementation, AT POPs concentrations were 1.5 to 1.6-fold higher while serum concentrations remained unchanged compared to the control ewes. This was concomitant with a decrease by 2.7-fold of the AT estimated lipids weight along the depuration period. This reduction of the volume of the storage compartment combined with the increase of POPs faecal excretion in underfed and mineral oil supplemented ewes led to a reduction by 1.5-fold of the PCB 126 AT burden, while no changes were observed for TCDD and PCB 153 burdens (vs. no change for PCB 126 and increases for TCDD and PCB 153 AT burdens in control ewes). The original approach of this study combining the fine description at once of POPs kinetic and of body lipids dynamic improved our understanding of POPs fate in the ruminant."
https://openalex.org/W3013880182,"A growing body of evidence suggests that men may perceive women’s bodily odour to be more attractive during the high-fertility ovulatory phase than during other phases in the menstrual cycle. In particular, women’s bodily odour may influence important aspects of male mating behaviour, but the precise nature of this phenomena remains to be elucidated. Twenty-six men and five women participated in the study. Each woman wore a cotton T-shirt during the night for 3 days during the ovulatory phase, after which the regions of the T-shirt that had been in contact with the woman’s chest, armpits, and back, were cut out of the garment. We evaluated the changes in testosterone and cortisol levels in the saliva of men who smelled these cloth pieces. The odour emitted from the backs of women in the ovulatory phase was found to increase testosterone secretion in men, whereas the odour emitted from the chests of women in the ovulatory phase reduced cortisol secretion in men. These results suggest that the odour of specific body parts of women modulate unconscious physiological reactions in men."

The mitochondrion of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei lacks tRNA genes and therefore imports all of its tRNAs from the cytosol. This has generated interest in the tRNA modifications and their distribution in this organism, including how CCA is added to tRNAs. Here, using a BLAST search for genes encoding putative CAE proteins in T. brucei, we identified a single ORF, Tb927.9.8780, as a potential candidate. Knockdown of this putative protein, termed TbCAE, resulted in the accumulation of truncated tRNAs, abolished translation, and inhibited both total and mitochondrial CCA-adding activities, indicating that TbCAE is located both in the cytosol and mitochondrion. However, mitochondrially localized tRNAs were much less affected by the TbCAE ablation than the other tRNAs. Complementation assays revealed that the N-terminal 10 amino acids of TbCAE are dispensable for its activity and mitochondrial localization and that deletion of 10 further amino acids abolishes both. A growth arrest caused by the TbCAE knockdown was rescued by the expression of the cytosolic isoform of yeast CAE, even though it was not imported into mitochondria. This finding indicated that the yeast enzyme complements the essential function of TbCAE by adding CCA to the primary tRNA transcripts. Of note, ablation of the mitochondrial TbCAE activity, which likely has a repair function, only marginally affected growth. tRNAs universally carry a CCA nucleotide triplet at their 3′-ends.

Unlike in most other eukaryotes the mitochondrion of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei and its relatives does not encode any tRNAs (1Shikha S. Brogli R. Schneider A.

As in other systems a connection to mitochondrial protein import has emerged, even though in contrast to what has been proposed in yeast, trypanosomal tRNAs are not co-imported with proteins (9Niemann M.

Furthermore, a mitochondrion-specific editing of the anticodon of the tRNATrp has been shown, which allows it to decode different codons in the cytosol and the mitochondrion, explaining how T. brucei accommodates the re-assignment of the stop codon UGA to Trp in mitochondria (16Alfonzo J.D.

Trypanosomes were also instrumental in deciphering the eukaryotic pathway for selenocysteinyl-tRNASec formation (20Aeby E. Palioura S. Pusnik M. Marazzi J. Lieberman A. Ullu E. Söll D. Schneider A. The canonical pathway for selenocysteine insertion is dispensable in Trypanosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, unlike in other systems and in contrast to all other trypanosomal tRNAs, the tRNASec of T. brucei is transcribed by RNA polymerase II as it is embedded in a polycistron (22Aeby E.

Eukaryotic tRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase III as precursors carrying 5′- and 3′-extensions and may carry introns. Correct processing of the precursor is essential for aminoacylation and thus for tRNA function (23Hartmann R.K. Gössringer M. Späth B. Fischer S. Marchfelder A.

In trypanosomes this is different, a recent study has shown that T. brucei has an unusual protein-only RNase P and a similar situation has also been observed in plants (25Rossmanith W.

Furthermore, a mitochondrial version of a protein-only RNase P enzyme has also been characterized in T. brucei, even though it is not clear what the in vivo substrate of that enzyme would be (26Taschner A.

The final cut: the importance of tRNA 3′-processing.EMBO J. 2001; 2: 17-2010.1093/embo-reports/kve006Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Subsequently CCA is added to the processed 3′-end by the nontemplated CCA-adding enzyme (CAE) creating the universal 3′ CCA end that is found on all tRNAs (whereas in many bacteria the CCA is already encoded in the tRNA gene this not the case in eukaryotes) (29Betat H. Mörl M. The CCA-adding enzyme: a central scrutinizer in tRNA quality control.Bioessays. 2015; 37 (26172425): 975-98210.1002/bies.201500043Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is the 3′-terminal A that gets aminoacylated by the aaRSs. 3-Processing of tRNAs is one of the few aspects of tRNA biology that has so far not been studied in trypanosomes. This was the reason why we decided to characterize the trypanosomal CAE. In the present study, we show that the enzyme is essential for normal growth, because its ablation abolishes translation. We, furthermore, show that the protein is dually localized in mitochondria and the rest of the cell. Doing BLAST searches using the sequences of the yeast or human CAEs as templates we identified a single ORF, Tb927.9.8780, that appears to encode the trypanosomal CAE, which we termed TbCAE. To functionally study the enzyme, we produced an inducible RNAi cell line in procyclic T. brucei that targets the ORF of the mRNA. Fig. 1A shows that addition of tetracycline results in the efficient ablation the TbCAE mRNA. Moreover, growth slows down after 1 day and stops after 2 days RNAi induction, which is typical for an essential gene. Ablation of the CAE should ultimately abolish translation as it would lead to accumulation of nonchargeable tRNAs with immature 3′-ends. To test this, we labeled cell culture with [35S]methionine, which gets incorporated into proteins during translation (Fig. 2B, left two lanes). When the experiment was done with the induced TbCAE-RNAi cell line we observed a great reduction of [35S]methionine incorporation after 24 h of induction when compared with uninduced cells. Moreover, after 48 h translation was essentially abolished. Virtually the same was seen if cells were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Thus, ablation of TbCAE, as might be expected, rapidly abolishes translation. To directly measure TbCAE activity we prepared total cellular extracts of the uninduced and 2-day induced TbCAE-RNAi cell line. The extracts were incubated in the presence of radioactive [α-32P]CTP and isolated total RNA (30Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. Identification of nuclear encoded precursor tRNAs within the mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1385429): 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, total RNA was re-isolated and separated by 8 m urea, 15% PAGE. The gel was stained by ethidium bromide, dried, and exposed on a PhosphorImager. The result in the upper left panel of Fig. 2 shows a highly efficient labeling of the tRNA region that was greatly reduced after ablation of TbCAE. The same result was obtained when [α-32P]ATP but not when [α-32P]UTP was added to the reaction. We concluded from these results that C and/or A were added to the small fraction of the newly synthesized and 3′-cleaved tRNAs present in the assay mixture. Thus, our results strongly suggest that TbCAE adds both C and A to the 3′-ends of newly transcribed and processed trypanosomal tRNAs. The absence of labeling in the presence [α-32P]UTP indicates that it is not caused by transcription. To investigate how ablation of TbCAE affects different tRNA isoacceptor groups in vivo we isolated total RNA from uninduced and 2-day–induced cells, separated it by 8 m urea, 15% PAGE, and stained the gel by ethidium bromide (Fig. 3, lower panels). The tRNA regions of total RNA isolated from uninduced and induced cells look very similar. To look at individual tRNAs we analyzed the steady-state levels of all tRNA isoacceptor groups by Northern blotting using specific oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 3, upper panels). The results allow the separation of the tRNAs into four groups regarding how they react to the ablation of TbCAE. The strongest phenotypes were seen for tRNACys, tRNAHis, and the tRNA-like molecule that is part of the trypanosomal signal recognition particle (31Béja O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Identification of a tRNA-like molecule that copurifies with the 7SL RNA of Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 223-23010.1016/0166-6851(93)90198-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In all three cases we see efficient accumulation of a lower molecular weight band, suggesting that tRNAs lacking a part or the whole CCA-tail accumulate. In the case of tRNACys and tRNAHis the truncated molecules are the main species observed. For tRNAArg, tRNAGln, and tRNATrp, we see the same as above except that only very small amounts of truncated tRNAs are found. For tRNAAla, tRNAGly, and tRNAThr, ablation of TbCAE causes a significant reduction in the steady-state levels when compared with the total tRNAs seen in the ethidium bromide-stained gel, which serves as a loading control. However, no specific accumulation of lower molecular weight forms is seen. Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly we find that 14 tRNA acceptor groups are not affected by the knockdown of the TbCAE. For some tRNAs (Fig. 3, tRNAPro) we see additional low molecular weight bands. These might be other tRNA isoacceptors that cross-react with the oligonucleotide that was used as a probe. Alternatively they may represent hypo-modified tRNAs in the cases were the modification as added after the CCA addition. tRNA are known to be quite stable molecules. Thus, a caveat of our analysis is that the tRNA population, which was synthesized before the RNAi takes effect, might not be affected. To increase the sensitivity of the analysis we used a cell line in which upon addition of tetracycline not only TbCAE-RNAi is induced but also expression of a mutationally tagged tRNAMet occurs (11Bouzaidi-Tiali N. Aeby E. Charrière F. Pusnik M. Schneider A. Elongation factor 1a mediates the specificity of mitochondrial tRNA import in T. brucei.EMBO J. 2007; 26 (17853889): 4302-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). (This is possible because its gene contains a 5′-flanking tetracycline-operator sequence.) With this system, we can selectively monitor the fate of the newly synthesized variant of tRNAMet (tRNAMet*) during induction of TbCAE RNAi. Interestingly, a significant accumulation of truncated tRNAMet* species was seen in such an experiment (Fig. 4), even though no phenotype was observed for either of the two endogenous tRNAsMet (tRNAMet-i and tRNAMet-e) when their steady-state levels were analyzed (Fig. 3). In summary, these results show that ablation of TbCAE leads to accumulation of truncated tRNAs as would be expected. However, surprisingly there were large differences in how much truncated tRNAs accumulated, from 72.02% for tRNACys (S.D. ± 2.92%) to a very low percentage for tRNAMet, which could only be detected when newly synthesized tRNA was analyzed. RNAi inherently does not completely remove its target mRNA, indicating that a small amount of TbCAE is still present in induced cells. Assuming a similar half-life for all tRNA isoacceptor groups, the differential effects we see might be explained by different affinities of TbCAE to different tRNA isoacceptor groups. Thus, the tRNAs that are only marginally affected may have higher affinities for the enzyme and therefore the CCA-tail might still be added to these substrates even when only very little enzyme is present in induced RNAi cells. The simplest way to explain the reduced levels of tRNAAla, tRNAGly, and tRNAThr observed in induced RNAi cells is that the truncated tRNA lacking the CCA-tail becomes rapidly degraded. To determine the intracellular localization of TbCAE, we produced a transgenic cell line expressing a version of TbCAE whose C terminus is tagged with the c-myc epitope. Fig. 5A shows that the TbCAE-myc is expressed. Moreover, when the cells are extracted with low concentration of digitonin the protein is essentially recovered in the soluble supernatant fraction. In the pellet that contains intact mitochondria approximately the same percentage of total tagged TbCAE is detected as is for the cytosolic markers elongation factor 1a (EF1a) and TbVCP. In line with this, TbCAE-myc is localized all over the cell when analyzed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 5B). In summary these results suggest that the large majority of TbCAE is cytosolically and to a lesser extent nuclearly localized. In other eukaryotic systems a fraction of CAEs is generally imported into mitochondria (32Wolfe C.L. Lou Y.C. Hopper A.K. Martin N.C.

Moreover, the N terminus of TbCAE is not predicted to form a mitochondrial targeting sequence. However, not all mitochondrial proteins have typical N-terminal targeting sequences and import of a small fraction of TbCAE might be beyond the detection limit in these experiments. In fact, in a recent study we have experimentally defined the mitochondrial proteome of T. brucei using two criteria (15Peikert C.D. Mani J. Morgenstern M. Käser S. Knapp B. Wenger C. Harsman A.

TbCAE fulfilled both criteria in this study and therefore is a bona fide component of the mitochondrial proteome (Fig. 5C) (15Peikert C.D. Mani J. Morgenstern M. Käser S. Knapp B. Wenger C. Harsman A. Oeljeklaus S. Schneider A. Warscheid B. Charting organellar importomes by quantitative mass spectrometry.Nat.

Should a small fraction of TbCAE be mitochondrially localized we would expect that its activity can be detected in mitochondrial extracts using the same assay that was used for total RNA (Fig. 2). Fig. 6 shows that this is the case. Mitochondrial tRNAs are strongly labeled with [α-32P]CTP in an organellar extract, however, after depletion of TbCAE by RNAi the labeled fraction is dramatically reduced. The immunoblots in Fig. 6B confirm that the mitochondrial extracts used in activity assays were not contaminated by cytosolic proteins. These results confirm that TbCAE is indeed a component of the mitochondrial proteome as has recently been determined (15Peikert C.D. Mani J. Morgenstern M. Käser S. Knapp B. Wenger C. Harsman A. Oeljeklaus S. Schneider A. Warscheid B. Charting organellar importomes by quantitative mass spectrometry.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (28485388): 1527210.1038/ncomms15272Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), even though standard biochemical and cell biological methods are not sensitive enough to detect this (Fig. 5, A and B). As was done for total RNA (Fig. 3) we analyzed the effect ablation of the mitochondrial TbCAE activity has on the steady-state level of the different tRNA isoacceptor groups that were imported into mitochondria. To that end organellar RNA was isolated from digitonin-extracted uninduced and induced TbCAE RNAi cells that were treated with RNase to digest the contaminating cytosolic RNAs. Fig. S2 shows that the resulting mitochondrial RNA fractions, in contrast to total cellular RNA, is free of the cytosol-specific initiator tRNAMet and tRNASec. In contrast to when tRNAs from total cellular extracts (of which less than 5% correspond to mitochondrial tRNA (38Tan T.H. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A.

The one exception is tRNACys for which accumulation of a small fraction of a lower molecular weight form is observed. Interestingly, tRNACys also shows the strongest phenotype when total"

Despite the growing importance of aquaculture sector in Egyptian labour force, only a few studies have explored the livelihoods of Egypt’s women and men fish retailers. Even fewer studies have examined gender-based market constraints experienced by these informal fish retailers. This study uses sex-disaggregated data collected in 2013 in three governorates of Lower Egypt to examine the economic and social constraints to scale of enterprises between women (n = 162) and men informal fish retailers (n = 183). Specifically, we employ linear regression method to determine the correlates of enterprise performance. We found that both women and men retailers in the informal fish market earn low profits and face livelihood insecurities. However, women’s enterprise performance is significantly lower than that of men even after controlling for individual socio-economic and retailing characteristics. Specifically, the burden of unpaid household work and lack of support therein impedes women’s ability to generate higher revenues. These findings strengthen the argument for investing in understanding how gender norms and attitudes affect livelihood options and outcomes. This leads to recommendations on gender-responsive interventions that engage with both men and women and enhance the bargaining power and collective voice of fish retailers."

The Rysto gene, conferring a broad spectrum of durable resistance, originated from Solanum stoloniferum and was introgressed into several commercial potato cultivars, including ‘White Lady’, by classical breeding. Rysto was mapped to chromosome XII in potato, and markers used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes were identified. Nevertheless, there was no information on the identity of the Rysto gene. To begin to reveal the identification of Rysto, fine-scale genetic mapping was performed which, in combination with chromosome walking, narrowed down the locus of the gene to approximately 1 Mb. DNA sequence analysis of the locus identified six full-length NBS-LRR-type (short NLR-type) putative resistance genes. Two of them, designated TMV2 and TMV3, were similar to a TMV resistance gene isolated from tobacco and to Y-1, which co-segregates with Ryadg, the extreme virus resistance gene originated from Solanum andigena and localised to chromosome XI. Furthermore, TMV2 of ‘White Lady’ was found to be 95% identical at the genomic sequence level with the recently isolated Rysto gene of the potato cultivar ‘Alicja’. In addition to the markers identified earlier, this work generated five tightly linked new markers which can serve potato breeding efforts for extreme virus resistance."

To assess the feasibility and acceptability of PrEP in Lesotho and to study the attitudes and beliefs around HIV risk and prevention measures among young women, between September and December 2016 we asked 302 female university students at fourteen higher education institutions in Lesotho about their sexual behavior, experiences of sexual coercion and abuse, HIV risk perception, willingness to use PrEP, as well as their attitudes toward condom use and self-administration of daily medications. Overall, 57.3% of the sample reported perceiving themselves at risk of acquiring HIV and 32.1% reported being strongly willing to use PrEP if it were available in their community. In a multivariate mediation analysis, perceived HIV risk was associated with 11.5 percentage points increase in likelihood of using PrEP (p = 0.041). Multiple concurrent sexual partnership was associated with 16.1 percentage points increase in likelihood of self-perceived HIV risk (p = 0.007), while having sexual partners in polygamous relationships was associated with 17.8 percentage points increase in likelihood of self-perceived HIV risk (p = 0.002) and the mediated indirect effect accounted for 18.2% of its total effect. Those who reported strong adherence to antibiotics were 23.1 percentage points more likely to express willingness to use PrEP than those who did not (p = 0.004), and those who reported to dislike condoms were 19.1 percentage points more likely to be willing to use PrEP than those who did not report aversion to condom use: these effect were direct and not mediated by HIV risk perception. Intimate partner violence (IPV) in the network of peers was also directly associated with willingness to use PrEP and its effect was not significantly mediated by HIV risk perception: those who had friends who experienced intimate partner violence were 14.9 percentage points more likely to be willing to use PrEP than those who did not report IPV in their network of peers (p = 0.009). These findings support the inclusion of individuals with multiple concurrent sexual partners among the key populations for PrEP provision and confirm that willingness to use PrEP is not solely driven by HIV risk perception. They also indicate that the presence of IPV in peer networks is related to one's willingness to use PrEP. PrEP service provision may generate synergies with IPV prevention programs when offered within this framework."
https://openalex.org/W3013511437,"Purpose Using 4D magnetic particle imaging (MPI), intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) catheters are tracked in real time in order to compensate for image artifacts related to relative motion. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility for bimodal IVOCT and MPI in-vitro experiments. Material and methods During IVOCT imaging of a stenosis phantom the catheter is tracked using MPI. A 4D trajectory of the catheter tip is determined from the MPI data using center of mass sub-voxel strategies. A custom built IVOCT imaging adapter is used to perform different catheter motion profiles: no motion artifacts, motion artifacts due to catheter bending, and heart beat motion artifacts. Two IVOCT volume reconstruction methods are compared qualitatively and quantitatively using the DICE metric and the known stenosis length. Results The MPI-tracked trajectory of the IVOCT catheter is validated in multiple repeated measurements calculating the absolute mean error and standard deviation. Both volume reconstruction methods are compared and analyzed whether they are capable of compensating the motion artifacts. The novel approach of MPI-guided catheter tracking corrects motion artifacts leading to a DICE coefficient with a minimum of 86% in comparison to 58% for a standard reconstruction approach. Conclusions IVOCT catheter tracking with MPI in real time is an auspicious method for radiation free MPI-guided IVOCT interventions. The combination of MPI and IVOCT can help to reduce motion artifacts due to catheter bending and heart beat for optimized IVOCT volume reconstructions."
https://openalex.org/W3013521709,"Galanin receptors (GALRs) belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. The three GALR subtypes (GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3) are activated by their endogenous ligands: spexin (SPX) and galanin (GAL). The synthetic SPX-based GALR2-specific agonist, SG2A, plays a dual role in the regulation of appetite and depression-like behaviors. Little is known, however, about the molecular interaction between GALR2 and SG2A. Using site-directed mutagenesis and domain swapping between GALR2 and GALR3, we identified residues in GALR2 that promote interaction with SG2A and residues in GALR3 that inhibit interaction with SG2A. In particular, Phe103, Phe106, and His110 in the transmembrane helix 3 (TM3) domain; Val193, Phe194, and Ser195 in the TM5 domain; and Leu273 in the extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) domain of GALR2 provide favorable interactions with the Asn5, Ala7, Phe11, and Pro13 residues of SG2A. Our results explain how SG2A achieves selective interaction with GALR2 and inhibits interaction with GALR3. The results described here can be used broadly for in silico virtual screening of small molecules for the development of GALR subtype-specific agonists and/or antagonists."

Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies to depurate livestock moderately contaminated with POPs to reduce economic and social damage. This study aimed to test undernutrition (37% of energy requirements) combined with mineral oil (10% in total dry matter intake) in nine non-lactating ewes contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 126 and 153 as a strategy to enhance the depuration of POPs through faecal excretion. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the depuration process, lipophilic POPs and lipid fluxes were co-monitored in various body and excretion compartments. Body compartments (adipose tissues, muscle, liver and blood) and the total empty body were analyzed for lipids and POPs concentrations and burdens at slaughter, as well as excretion compartments (faeces and wool) collected during the depuration period. Decreases in empty body total and lipid weights were 6-fold higher in underfed and supplemented ewes compared to control ewes. In addition, over the depuration period undernutrition and supplementation treatment increased faecal TCDD, PCBs 126 and 153 excretions by 1.4- to 2.1-fold but tended to decrease wool PCB 153 excretion by 1.4-fold. This induced 2- to 3-fold higher decreases in the empty body POPs burdens for underfed and supplemented ewes. Nonetheless, when expressed relative to the calculated initial empty body burdens, burdens at slaughter decreased only slightly from 97%, 103% and 98% for control ewes to 92%, 97% and 94% for underfed and supplemented ones, for TCDD, PCBs 126 and 153, respectively. Fine descriptions at once of POPs kinetic (companion paper 1) and mass balance (companion paper 2), and of body lipid dynamics were very useful in improving our understanding of the fate of POPs in the ruminants."
https://openalex.org/W3013423151,"Previously, we identified a mechanism of inflammation control directed by ribosomal protein L13a and “GAIT” (Gamma Activated Inhibitor of Translation) elements in target mRNAs and showed that its elimination in myeloid cell-specific L13a knockout mice (L13a KO) increased atherosclerosis susceptibility and severity. Here, we investigated the mechanistic basis of this endogenous defense against atherosclerosis. We compared molecular and cellular aspects of atherosclerosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed L13a KO and intact (control) mice. HFD treatment of control mice induced release of L13a from 60S ribosome, formation of RNA-binding complex, and subsequent GAIT element-mediated translational silencing. Atherosclerotic plaques from HFD-treated KO mice showed increased infiltration of M1 type inflammatory macrophages. Macrophages from KO mice showed increased phagocytic activity and elevated expression of LDL receptor and pro-inflammatory mediators. NanoString analysis of the plaques from KO mice showed upregulation of a number of mRNAs encoding inflammatory proteins. Bioinformatics analysis suggests the presence of the potential GAIT elements in the 3′UTRs of several of these mRNAs. Macrophage induces L13a/GAIT-dependent translational silencing of inflammatory genes in response to HFD as an endogenous defense against atherosclerosis in ApoE−/− model."
https://openalex.org/W3013659508,"The responses of individuals and populations to climate change vary as functions of physiology, ecology, and plasticity. We investigated whether annual variation in seasonal temperature and precipitation was associated with relative abundances of breeding bird species at local and regional levels in southern California, USA, from 1968–2013. We tested our hypotheses that abundances were correlated positively with precipitation and negatively with temperature in this semiarid to arid region. We also examined whether responses to climate varied among groups of species with similar land-cover associations, nesting locations, and migratory patterns. We investigated relations between seasonal climate variables and the relative abundances of 41 species as estimated by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Associations with climate variables varied among species. Results of models of species associated with arid scrublands or that nest on the ground strongly supported our hypotheses, whereas those of species associated with coniferous forests or that nest in cavities did not. Associations between climate variables and the abundances of other trait-based groups were diverse. Our results suggest that species in arid areas may be negatively affected by increased temperature and aridity, but species in nearby areas that are cooler and less arid may respond positively to those fluctuations in climate. Relations with climate variables can differ among similar species, and such knowledge may inform projections of future abundance trajectories and geographic ranges."
https://openalex.org/W3013779888,"The human positive coactivator 4 (PC4) was originally identified as a multi-functional cofactor capable of mediating transcription activation by diverse gene- and tissue-specific activators. Recent studies suggest that PC4 might also function as a novel cancer biomarker and therapeutic target for different types of cancers. siRNA knockdown studies indicated that down-regulation of PC4 expression could inhibit tumorigeneicity of A549 non-small cell lung cancer tumor model in nude mice. Here we show that AG-1031, a small molecule identified by high throughput screening, can inhibit the double-stranded DNA binding activity of PC4, more effectively than its single-stranded DNA binding activity. AG-1031 also specifically inhibited PC4-dependent transcriptional activation in vitro using purified transcription factors. AG-1031 inhibited proliferation of several cultured cell lines derived from non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and growth of tumors that formed from A549 cell xenografts in immuno-compromised mice. Moreover, pre-injection of AG-1031 in these mice not only reduced tumor size, but also prevented tumor formation in 20% of the animals. AG-1031 treated A549 cells and tumors from AG-1031 treated animals showed a significant decrease in the levels of both PC4 and VEGFC, a key mediator of angiogenesis in cancer. On the other hand, all tested mice remained constant weight during animal trials. These results demonstrated that AG-1031 could be a potential therapy for PC4-positive NSCLC."

It is a good model for studying enzyme kinetics and cooperativity, specifically for being able to separate those aspects of protein function through directed mutagenesis. Variant proteins were generated with mutations in four active-site residues, Phe-316, His-583, Tyr-766, and His-767. Structures for glycine-soaked crystals were obtained for each. Different mutations had differential effects on kcat and K0.5 for catalysis, K0.5 for substrate binding, and the Hill coefficients describing the steady-state kinetics or substrate binding. Phe-316 and Tyr-766 variants retained catalytic activity, albeit with altered kinetics and cooperativity.

https://openalex.org/W3013663636,"Postnatal vitamin D supplementation is standard of care in neonates and preterm infants. Despite routine supplementation of vitamin D, a wide range of complications related to vitamin D deficiency has been described in the literature. Since standard vitamin D supplementation might be not sufficient in preterm infants with a genetic predisposition for vitamin D deficiency, we investigated the outcome of preterm infants with regard to their genetic estimated vitamin D levels.Preterm infants with a birth weight below 1500 grams were included in the German Neonatal Network at the time of their birth and tested at the age of five. The vitamin D level was genetically calculated based on three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs12794714, rs7944926 and rs2282679) which alter vitamin D synthesis pathways. Specific alleles of these polymorphisms are validated markers for low plasma vitamin D levels. Outcome data were based on baseline data at the time of birth, typical complications of prematurity, body measurements at the age of five and occurrence of bone fractures. T-test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical comparison.According to their genetic predisposition, 1,924 preterm infants were divided into groups of low (gsVitD < 20. Percentile), intermediate and high vitamin D level estimates. Low genetic vitamin D level estimates could not be shown to be associated with any adverse outcome measures examined. The analyses covered data on aforementioned determinants.Low genetic vitamin D level estimates could not be shown to be associated with previously described adverse outcome in preterm infants."

Patients received bevacizumab-containing (n = 22) or conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy (n = 22). Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at baseline and at three follow-ups (on average 3, 6 and 9 months after initial treatment). Three independent readers rated the T2 signal intensity and the relative contrast enhancement of the metastases on a 5-point scale.T2 signal intensity of metastases treated with bevacizumab showed a significant (p<0.001) decrease in T2 signal intensity after initial treatment and exhibit compared to conventionally treated metastases significantly (p<0.001 for each follow-up) hypointense (bevacizumab: 0.70 ± 0.83 before vs. -1.55 ± 0.61, -1.91 ± 0.62, and -1.97 ± 0.52; cytotoxic: 0.73 ± 0.79 before vs. -0.69 ± 0.81, -0.71 ± 0.68, and -0.75 ± 0.65 after 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively). T2 signal intensity was strongly correlated with tumor contrast enhancement (r = 0.71; p<0.001). Intra-observer agreement for T2-signal intensity was substantial (κ = 0.75). The agreement for tumoral contrast enhancement between the readers was considerably lower (κ = 0.39).Liver metastases exhibit considerably hypointense in T2-weighted imaging after treatment with bevacizumab, in contrast to conventionally treated liver metastases. Therefore, T2-weighted imaging seems to reflect the effect of bevacizumab."
