https://openalex.org/W1988866780,"To address the biological role of vimentin in the context of the living organism, we have introduced a null mutation of the vimentin gene into the germ line of mice. Surprisingly, animals homozygous for this mutation developed and reproduced without an obvious phenotype. Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and immunogold labeling analysis confirmed the absence of vimentin and of the corresponding filament network. Furthermore, no compensatory expression of another intermediate filament could be demonstrated. While these results leave open the question of the possible role of vimentin in unusual situations or pathological conditions, they show that a conspicuous developmental and cell-specific structure that is an integral part of the cytoskeleton can be eliminated without apparent effect on mouse reproduction and development."
https://openalex.org/W2094554392,"The brain dopaminergic system is a critical modulator of basal ganglia function and plasticity. To investigate the contribution of the dopamine D1 receptor to this modulation, we have used gene targeting technology to generate D1 receptor mutant mice. Histological analyses suggested that there are no major changes in general anatomy of the mutant mouse brains, but indicated that the expression of dynorphin is greatly reduced in the striatum and related regions of the basal ganglia. The mutant mice do not respond to the stimulant and suppressive effects of D1 receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively, and they exhibit locomotor hyperactivity. These results suggest that the D1 receptor regulates the neurochemical architecture of the striatum and is critical for the normal expression of motor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1669771493,"An endoplasmic reticulum-like fraction, termed the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), that co-isolates with mitochondria from rat liver has been characterized. One potential function of the MAM is as a bridge between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria that may be involved in transfer of phospholipids between these two organelles (Vance, J. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7248-7256). A polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-2, a specific marker protein of the MAM (Cui, Z., Vance, J. E., Chen, M. H., Voelker, D. R., and Vance, D. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16655-16663), was used in immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy localization studies in rat hepatocytes. Immunoreactive protein was clustered in regions of the cell that did not correspond to the bulk of endoplasmic reticulum. A second potential role for the MAM, as a component of the secretory pathway that supplies lipids for assembly into very low density lipoproteins, has been examined. The MAM contains enzymes of similar, or higher, specific activities to those enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum for the synthesis of phospholipids, triacylglycerols, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters. Specific activities of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, and phosphatidylserine synthase (base exchange enzyme) are enriched 2.2-3.4-fold in the MAM compared with endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, the microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein, which is required for the assembly/secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, was present in the MAM. Nascent apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins were isolated from the lumen of the MAM. These lipoproteins had the same average density and composition as nascent apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins isolated from heavy and light endoplasmic reticulum fractions, from the Golgi, and lipoproteins newly secreted by cultured rat hepatocytes. The MAM is a pre-Golgi compartment of the secretory route, as shown by pulse-chase studies with apolipoprotein B and albumin, as well as the sensitivity of luminal apolipoprotein B to endoglycosidase H."
https://openalex.org/W1509143146,"The membrane proteins SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin (vesicle-associated membrane protein) have recently been implicated as central elements of an exocytotic membrane fusion complex in neurons. Here we report that SNAP-25 binds directly to both syntaxin and synaptobrevin. The SNAP-25-binding domain of syntaxin lies between residues 199 and 243, within the region previously shown to mediate synaptobrevin binding (Calakos, N., Bennett, M. K., Peterson, K. E., and Scheller, R. H. (1994) Science 263, 1146-1149). The syntaxin-binding domain of SNAP-25 encompasses most of the amino-terminal half of SNAP-25, including its putative palmitoylation sites. Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 9 residues of SNAP-25, which yields a fragment corresponding to that generated by botulinum neurotoxin A, diminishes the interaction of SNAP-25 with synaptobrevin, but not with syntaxin. Sequence analysis revealed that the regions that mediate the interaction between SNAP-25 and syntaxin contain heptad repeats characteristic of certain classes of alpha-helices. Similar repeats are also present at the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-25 and in synaptobrevin. These domains have a moderate to high probability of forming coiled coils. We conclude that SNAP-25 can interact with both syntaxin and synaptobrevin and that binding may be mediated by alpha-helical domains that form intermolecular coiled-coil structures."
https://openalex.org/W1599376419,"alpha-Crystallin has been shown to function as a molecular chaperone in preventing thermal aggregation of crystallins and other proteins. The molecular mechanism of this protection is not yet clear. gamma-Crystallin aggregates upon exposure to UV light. We have investigated the effect of the presence of alpha-crystallin in the photoaggregation process and find that alpha-crystallin does not prevent photoaggregation at low temperatures. The protection starts around 30 degrees C and steeply increases with temperature. The plot of protection ability versus temperature is sigmoidal, indicating a structural transition. Perturbation of the quaternary structure of alpha by non-thermal mode, such as 3 M urea, also results in enhanced protection. Pyrene, a hydrophobic fluorophore, is sparingly soluble in water. alpha-Crystallin enhances the solubility of pyrene by severalfold. Temperature dependence of this solubilization shows a transition around 30 degrees C (another at about 50 degrees C). Fluorescence intensity ratio of third and first peaks of pyrene emission (I3/I1,), indicative of hydrophobicity of the reporting area, also shows similar transitions suggesting enhanced hydrophobicity. Gel filtration experiments of irradiated samples indicate the complex formation between gamma- and alpha-crystallins. alpha-Crystallin does not prevent cold precipitation of gamma-crystallin. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that alpha-crystallin prevents aggregation of non-native structures by providing appropriately placed hydrophobic surfaces. A structural transition above 30 degrees C enhances the protective ability, perhaps by increasing or reorganizing the hydrophobic surfaces. A similar temperature dependence has been reported for GroEL. Whether a structural switch, either activated by temperature, solvent conditions, or small molecule binding, forms a part of the general mechanism of chaperone activity needs to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2152114427,"The genome of all retroviruses consists in two homologous RNA molecules associated near their 5' end in a region called the dimer linkage structure. Dimerization of genomic RNA is thought to be important for several functions of the retroviral cycle such as encapsidation, reverse transcription, and translation. In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a region downstream of the splice donor site was initially postulated to mediate dimerization. However, we recently showed that the dimerization initiation site is located upstream of the splice donor site and suggested that dimerization may initiate through a loop-loop interaction. Here, we show that single base mutations in the palindromic loop of the dimerization initiation site completely abolish dimerization, while introduction of compensatory mutations restores the process. Furthermore, two single nucleotide mutants that are unable to form homodimers efficiently codimerize, while the wild type RNA and the compensatory mutant, which both form homodimers, are unable to codimerize. These results unambiguously prove the interaction between the palindromic loops of each monomer. By contrast, none of the deletions that we introduced downstream of the splice donor site abolishes dimerization. However, deletions of two purine tracts located in the vicinity of the initiation codon of the gag gene significantly decrease the thermal stability of the HIV-1 RNA dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1494239480,"During cell activation, Ca2+, by stimulating the NADH-producing mitochondrial dehydrogenases, triggers the generation of reducing equivalents whereby ATP production is sustained. In cell populations, [Ca2+] changes in the mitochondrial matrix were demonstrated to parallel rapidly those in the cytosol ([Ca2+]i). There is still no indication as to whether metabolic activation follows oscillatory patterns similar to those of [Ca2+]i. Therefore, changes in NAD(P)H were monitored in single pancreatic beta-cells, adrenal glomerulosa cells, and liver cells during oscillatory [Ca2+]i transients. Rapid NAD(P)H and [Ca2+]i oscillations with similar frequency and sensitive both to changes in glucose concentration and to extracellular Ca2+ removal were identified in a subpopulation of pancreatic beta-cells in primary culture. Furthermore, Ca(2+)-dependent oscillatory NAD(P)H formation could be evoked by the pulsatile application of depolarizing [K+], demonstrating the pacing effect of increased [Ca2+]i on beta-cell metabolism. In adrenal glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II, a physiological stimulator of aldosterone production, could be shown to elicit the oscillatory formation of mitochondrial NAD(P)H through frequency modulation of [Ca2+]i transients. In contrast to the two former endocrine cell types, in hepatocytes, [Arg8]vasopressin and epinephrine caused the amplitude modulation of NAD(P)H formation. Taken together, these results provide unprecedented evidence for a cell-specific pacing of metabolism by [Ca2+]i transients coordinated with cell activation and function."
https://openalex.org/W1588673533,"In a previous cross-linking study we have shown that the cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) complex has a heterotetrameric structure (Perdew, G. H. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 182, 55-62). In this report, both cross-linked and [35S]methionine-labeled Hepa 1c1c7 cytosol were used to characterize the subunit composition of the AhR complex by immunoprecipitation with an AhR polyclonal antibody followed by immunochemical analysis using antibodies against the AhR and 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90). Results indicated that the four subunits found in cross-linking experiments were composed of three species: the AhR ligand binding subunit, hsp90, and an unknown 43-kDa protein. The stoichiometry of hsp90 present in each AhR complex was determined in two separate experiments: 1) from cross-linking experiments, stoichiometry was determined by quantitative immunoblotting with anti-AhR and anti-hsp90 antibodies followed by quantitation with 125I-counterantibody on protein blots; 2) using 35S-labeled Hepa 1 cytosol, the hsp90/AhR stoichiometry was determined by immunopurifying receptor complexes, and the amount of 35S-labeled AhR and hsp90 was assessed. The stoichiometry values obtained were 2.4 and 1.72 mol of hsp90/mol of AhR using each experimental approach, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1497578315,"A method is presented for determining the compartmentation of amino acid metabolism in the brain. 13C NMR spectroscopy, and more specifically, homonuclear 13C-13C spin coupling patterns of 13C-labeled amino acids were used to measure the relative flux of label from D-[U-13C]glucose through the anaplerotic pathway versus the oxidative pathway. Glucose flux through the pyruvate carboxylase pathway was quantitated following primed dose constant infusion of D-[U-13C]glucose to young rabbits at a rate of 1 mg/kg body weight per min. We demonstrate, for the first time, that multiplet spectra of three adjacent 13C isotopomer in 1,2,3-13C3 in glutamine and glutamate, which are derived from [1,2,3-13C3]pyruvate, present different isotopomer populations in glutamine in comparison to that in glutamate. This is due to two different metabolic compartments characterized by the presence or absence of glutamine synthetase activity and two different tricarboxylic acid cycles, one preferentially mediated by pyruvate carboxylase and the other by pyruvate dehydrogenase. Our results indicate that the anaplerotic pathway accounts for 34% of glutamine synthesis and only 16% of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid syntheses in metabolic and isotopic steady state conditions. These results support the concept, and provide a quantitative measure, that glutamine and/or tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates are supplied by astrocytes to neurons to replenish the neurotransmitter pool of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1544076335,"The flux through different segments of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was measured in rat brain synaptosomes with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using either deuterated glutamine or [13C]aspartate. The flux between 2-oxoglutarate and oxaloacetate was estimated to be 3.14 and 4.97 nmol/min/mg protein with and without glucose, respectively. These values were 3-5-fold faster than the flux between oxaloacetate and 2-oxoglutarate (0.92 nmol/min per mg protein) measured in the presence of glucose. The pattern of intermediates labeling suggests that the overall rate-controlling reaction involves either citrate synthase or pyruvate dehydrogenase but not 2-oxoglutarate or isocitrate dehydrogenase. The enrichment in [3,3,4,4-2H4]glutamate from [2,3,3,4,4-2H5]glutamine was as rapid as in [2,3,3,4,4-2H5]glutamate, which indicates that the aspartate aminotransferase reaction is severalfold faster than the flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. [13C]Aspartate was rapidly converted to [13C]malate, suggesting that in intact synaptosomes aspartate entry into the mitochondrion is very slow. The finding that aspartate is taken up by mitochondria as malate, along with the observed high enrichment in [3-2H]malate (from [2,3,3,4,4-2H5]glutamine), is consistent with the substantial synaptosomal activity of the malate/aspartate shuttle."
https://openalex.org/W1709456377,"In the course of characterizing the bacteriocin lactocin S and its encoding gene, we discovered three alanine-for-serine substitutions which, apparently, is a violation of the genetic code. Subsequent chiral analysis of lactocin S hydrolysates revealed a correlation between D-alanine content and the three substitutions, implying a conversion of L-serine to D-alanine in lactocin S maturation. In order to explain this observation, we suggest a sequence of events initiated by the dehydration of serine, which is common in the biosynthesis of the lanthionine-containing polycyclic lantibiotics (Schnell, N., Entian, K.-D., Schneider, U., Gotz, F., Zahner, H., Kellner, R. & Jung, G. (1988) Nature 333, 276-278; Jung, G. (1991) Angew, Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 30, 1051-1068; Bierbaum, G. & Sahl, H.-G. (1993) Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 278, 1-22) and completed by the stereospecific reduction of dehydroalanine residues. The occurrence of non-lanthionine alpha-carbon stereoinversion in lactocin S maturation substantiates the hypothetical alpha-epimerization scheme originally put forward by Bycroft (Bycroft, B. W. (1969) Nature 224, 595-597), and we propose a revision of this model to accommodate the lactocin S-type stereoinversion. Lactocin S is the first prokaryotic exception to the rule that only L-amino acids are included in ribosomally synthesized peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1592324643,"In a reconstituted system, the participation of the ATP/ADP carrier (AAC) in the free fatty acid (FFA)-induced proton transport was demonstrated (i) by direct measuring of the proton transport through the membranes of AAC proteoliposomes and (ii) by monitoring of the transmembrane potential delta psi in AAC-cytochrome-c oxidase (COX)-coreconstituted proteoliposomes. FFA increased the initial rate of proton transport in AAC proteoliposomes and decreased delta psi in AAC-COX proteoliposomes. Inhibitors of AAC suppressed the effects of FFA. Without AAC or with inactive AAC, FFA cannot maintain proton leakage through the membrane. In these cases, even a small increase of delta psi was induced by FFA. These results demonstrate for the first time with purified components a participation of AAC in FFA-induced proton transport supporting an earlier suggestion (Skulachev, V.P. (1991) FEBS Lett. 294, 158-162). Mersalyl treatment of the AAC-COX proteoliposomes resulted in an increase of the AAC-mediated protonophoric action of FFA. Mersalyl also sensitized the protonophoric action of the FFA against nucleotides so that even guanine nucleotides, which are inactive in transport, become inhibitory. The effect of mersalyl is rationalized in terms of a specific interaction with cysteine 159 being attracted as anion by surrounding positive charges. This might open a gate similarly as suggested for eosin 5-maleimide interaction (Majima, E., Koike, H., Hong, Y.-M., Shinohara, Y., and Terada, H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22181-22187) and, thus, transform the AAC into undirectional transport mode."
https://openalex.org/W1554143159,"Studying Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, we report that arachidonic acid strongly stimulates mRNA levels of the growth-associated immediate early genes c-fos and Egr-1. Structurally related compounds like arachidonic acid methyl ester, arachidonyl alcohol, or eicosatetraynoic acid are ineffective, indicating a specific role of free unesterified arachidonic acid or an arachidonic acid metabolite in c-fos and Egr-1 mRNA accumulation. Blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase abolishes arachidonic acid-induced accumulation of c-fos and Egr-1 mRNA. Inhibition of the lipoxygenase or cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase pathways has no significant effect on arachidonic acid-induced c-fos and Egr-1 mRNA levels, indicating that prostaglandin synthesis is necessary for the increase in c-fos and Egr-1 mRNA. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography revealed prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as the major arachidonic acid metabolite in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. When added to the cells, PGE2 stimulates c-fos and Egr-1 mRNA levels to the same degree as arachidonic acid. Also, the inhibition of arachidonic acid-stimulated c-fos and Egr-1 mRNA accumulation by indomethacin is reversed by PGE2. Contrary to reports that PGE2 caused an increase in cAMP levels in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, we found that arachidonic acid and PGE2 only minimally increase cAMP levels as compared with untreated cells. In contrast, inhibition of protein kinase C by calphostin C and chelerythrine or down-regulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate drastically reduces PGE2 and arachidonic acid-induced c-fos and Egr-1 mRNA levels. These data indicate that arachidonic acid exerts its stimulatory effect on c-fos and Egr-1 mRNA via synthesis of PGE2 and subsequent activation of protein kinase C, probably through a PGE2 receptor coupled to phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1523008440,"The reversal of the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction was investigated in rat livers perfused with [U-13C5]glutamate or [U-13C5]glutamine. The mass isotopomer distribution of citric acid cycle intermediates extracted from the livers was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Citrate was enriched in an isotopomer containing five 13C. The formation of this isotopomer can only be explained by the reversal of the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction. Calculation of kinetic parameters from the mass isotopomer data reveals a rapid interconversion of isocitrate and alpha-ketoglutarate. This interconversion results in an isotopic exchange between carbon 6 of citrate and mitochondrial CO2 that can affect the calculation of citric acid cycle kinetic parameters. Thus, the reversal of the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction should be included in isotope labeling models of the citric acid cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1586970734,"The chromosomal tetB(L) gene of Bacillus subtilis encodes a transporter that catalyzes Na+/H+ antiport even more actively than tetracycline/H+ antiport, as shown by assays of membrane antiporter activity upon transformation of Na+/H+ antiporter-deficient Escherichia coli with the cloned gene; the transformation results in a substantial increase in Na+ resistance as well as detectable resistance to low tetracycline concentrations. Transpositional disruption of the chromosomal tetB(L) locus of B. subtilis led to reduced rates of electrogenic Na+ efflux and revealed a physiological role for this locus in Na+ resistance and Na(+)-dependent pH homeostasis at pH 8.5. The mutant phenotype was reversed by transformation with a plasmid expressing the cloned tetB(L) gene. Energy-dependent tetracycline efflux rates in the wild type were greater than in the transposition mutant but were not sufficient to confer resistance to the antibiotic. TetB(L) is also inferred to have a modest capacity for K+ efflux, since the transposition mutant is slightly impaired in K(+)-dependent pH homeostasis at pH 8.5 and grew better than the wild type at pH 7 on limiting K+ concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1488644231,"Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of hydrated films of the Neurospora crassa plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase has been used to monitor the alpha-helix and beta-sheet contents and amide hydrogen exchange rates of the enzyme in the absence of ligands or locked in several stages of the enzyme catalytic cycle by MgADP, Mg-vanadate, and MgATP-vanadate. No difference larger than 2% was found in the alpha-helix or beta-sheet content of the H(+)-ATPase in different conformational states. However, when the rate of hydrogen/deuterium exchange monitored by the evolution of the area of amide II and amide II' is decomposed into three components, the number of amide protons characterized by a short exchange rate (1.1 min) falls from 38% of the protein amide protons (or 37% in the presence of Mg2+ alone) to 24-27% in the presence of Mg-vanadate and MgATP-vanadate and to 19% in the presence of MgADP. These results suggest that the conformational changes known to occur when the H(+)-ATPase interacts with the above ligands are predominantly tertiary structure changes."
https://openalex.org/W1540033041,"The yeast SSS1 gene has been isolated as an extragenic high copy suppressor of sec61, a mutant displaying defects in protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that SSS1 is an essential gene required for transfer of secretory precursors through the ER membrane. Here we demonstrate that the SSS1 product (Sss1p) is firmly bound to the ER membrane and exposes its amino-terminal half on the cytosolic side. Only detergent, or an alkali treatment, is effective at extracting Sss1p from the membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Sss1p and Sec61p participate in the same multisubunit complex. Cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation specifically yielded an additional polypeptide of molecular mass 73 kDa. Moreover, Sss1p and Sec61p show mutually stabilizing interactions: Sss1p is destabilized in a sec61 mutant context, and mutated Sec61p is stabilized by Sss1p overproduction. These observations account for the isolation of SSS1 as a dosage-dependent suppressor of sec61. Since the polytopic integral membrane protein Sec61p is adjacent to translocating precursors and to ribosomes, and given the comparable translocation deficiencies of sss1 or sec61 mutants, we propose that Sss1p belongs to the Sec61 subcomplex that constitutes the pore of the membrane-bound translocation apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1597232807,"Dental amalgam fillings are the most important source of mercury exposure in the general population, but their potential to cause systemic health consequences is disputed. In this study, inbred mice genetically susceptible to mercury-induced immune aberrations were used to examine whether dental amalgam may interfere with the immune system and cause autoimmunity. Female SJL/N mice were implanted in the peritoneal cavity with 8-100 mg silver amalgam or silver alloy for 10 weeks or 6 months. Chronic hyperimmunoglobulinemia, serum IgG autoantibodies targeting the nucleolar protein fibrillarin, and systemic immune-complex deposits developed in a time- and dose-dependent manner after implantation of amalgam or alloy. Splenocytes from mice implanted with amalgam or alloy showed an increased expression of class II molecules. The functional capacity of splenic T and B cells was affected in a dose-dependent way: 10 weeks of low-dose and 6 months of high-dose amalgam implantation strongly increased mitogen-induced T and B cell proliferation, whereas 10 weeks of high-dose implantation decreased the proliferation. Not only mercury but also silver accumulated in the spleen and kidneys after amalgam implantation. In conclusion, dental amalgam implantation in a physiological body milieu causes chronic stimulation of the immune system with induction of systemic autoimmunity in genetically sensitive mice. Implantation of silver alloy not containing mercury also induced autoimmunity, suggesting that other elements, especially silver, have the potential to induce autoimmunity in genetically susceptible vertebrates. Accumulation of heavy metals, from dental amalgam and other sources, may lower the threshold of an individual metal to elicit immunological aberrations. We hypothesize that under appropriate conditions of genetic susceptibility and adequate body burden, heavy metal exposure from dental amalgam may contribute to immunological aberrations, which could lead to overt autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1565055885,"The conversion of prothrombin to thrombin requires the cleavage of two peptide bonds and is catalyzed by the prothrombinase complex composed of factors Xa and Va assembled on a membrane surface. Presteady-state kinetic studies of the effects of membranes on the proteolytic reaction were undertaken using model membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PCPS). The concentration of PCPS was varied to alter the concentration of free phospholipid available for substrate binding without influencing the concentration of membrane-assembled prothrombinase. In fluorescence stopped-flow measurements, increasing concentrations of PCPS resulted in an increase in the rate of product formation. Assessment of bond cleavage by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following rapid chemical quench using 125I-prothrombin revealed that the activation reaction proceeded through the ordered cleavage at Arg323-Ile324 followed by cleavage at Art274-Thr275 at all concentrations of PCPS. Increasing the PCPS concentration resulted in a large increase in the Arg323-Ile324 cleavage reaction with a much smaller effect on the subsequent cleavage at Arg274-Thr275, thereby leading to an increase in the extent of accumulation of the intermediate, meizothrombin. Fluorescence stopped-flow and rapid chemical quench measurements were also conducted using prethrombin 2 plus fragment 1.2 or meizothrombin as substrates to assess the influence of PCPS on the individual cleavage reactions. The rate of cleavage at Arg323-Ile324 by prothrombinase was increased approximately 60-fold with increasing PCPS, whereas the cleavage at Arg274-Thr275 was increased by a factor of approximately 5. These differential effects of PCPS on the two cleavage reactions adequately explain changes in the extent of accumulation of meizothrombin during prothrombin activation. Proteolytic removal of the membrane binding fragment 1 domain of the substrates, meizothrombin and prethrombin 2-fragment 1.2, had no effect on the cleavage at Arg274-Thr275 at saturating PCPS but completely eliminated the membrane-dependent rate enhancement for cleavage at Arg323-Ile324. Thus, membrane binding by the substrate is essential for the first cleavage reaction at Arg323-Ile324, which leads to the conversion of prothrombin to meizothrombin. In contrast, the substrate-membrane interaction mediated by the fragment 1 domain has no detectable effect on the second cleavage reaction at Arg274-Thr275 which is required for the conversion of meizothrombin to thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1867068006,"Porcine hepatic methionine synthase has been purified to near homogeneity. The enzyme is isolated in two forms which were purified approximately 9,000- and approximately 7,000-fold and were obtained in 0.9 and 2.5% overall yield, respectively. The mammalian enzyme from pig liver is a large monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 151-155 kDa. It is characterized by the absence of any metals other than cobalt which is associated with the cofactor, cobalamin. This enzyme, like the methionine synthase from Escherichia coli is dependent on S-adenosylmethionine for activity. The steady state kinetic studies demonstrate that the reaction operates via an ordered sequential mechanism in which binding of CH3-H4-folate precedes homocysteine, and methionine is released prior to H4-folate."
https://openalex.org/W1509946046,"The sugar binding specificities of two groups of Streptococcus suis, a pig pathogen that causes meningitis also in man, were determined. Both the group represented by a recently characterized strain inhibitable by galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (type PN) and the group inhibitable by galactose (type PO) were found by hemagglutination and solid-phase binding inhibition experiments to recognize the disaccharide Gal alpha 1-4Gal of the P1 and Pk blood group antigens. Both types preferred the disaccharide in terminal position. PN showed some, whereas PO showed almost no, binding to the globoside oligosaccharide containing an additional GalNAc beta 1-3 residue. The complete hydrogen bonding patterns were determined by using deoxy and other synthetic derivatives of the receptor disaccharide, and the constructed models of the interactions were compared with that of Escherichia coli PapG396 adhesin. The essential hydroxyls for binding were the HO-4', HO-6', HO-2, and HO-3 hydroxyls on the beta' alpha-side of the Gal alpha 1-4Gal molecule. Type PO adhesin also formed weak interactions with the hydroxyls HO-6 and HO-3'. The mechanism differed from that of E. coli, which binds to a cluster of five hydroxyls (HO-6, HO-2', HO-3', HO-4', and HO-6') and thus to a different part of the receptor disaccharide. These results represent the first example of the comparison of the saccharide receptor hydrogen bonding patterns of two bacterial organisms of different origin and show that the same saccharide may be recognized by two different binding mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1519777141,Screening of a new Tn551 library constructed in the background of a highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain identified a new insertion site located on the SmaI B-fragment of the chromosome that reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration of the parent (1600 micrograms/ml) to 25-50 micrograms/ml in the mutant and caused heterogeneous expression of resistance and abnormality in peptidoglycan composition (absence of the unsubstituted pentapeptide and incorporation of alanylglutamate- and alanylisoglutamate-containing muropeptides). There was an accumulation of large amounts of the UDP-linked muramyl dipeptide in the cytoplasmic wall precursor pool of the mutant. Reduced (heterogeneous) antibiotic resistance and all the biochemical abnormalities were reproduced in genetic backcrosses by transduction with phage 80 alpha. Mutant RUSA235 appears to be impaired in the biosynthesis of the staphylococcal cell wall precursor muropeptide before the lysine addition step. We propose to provisionally call the gene inactivated in this mutant femF.
https://openalex.org/W1589672361,"The findings presented in this paper indicate that glucocorticoids down-regulate Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) mRNA and activity in aortic myocytes. Serum and purified growth factors reversed NCX down-regulation. Dexamethasone, cortisol, or aldosterone decreased NCX activity by approximately 55% in 24 h. Dexamethasone was > 100 times more potent than aldosterone, indicating that a glucocorticoid receptor mediates the down-regulation of NCX activity. Dexamethasone decreased the NCX transcript to approximately 10% of the control level in 24 h without affecting plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase transcripts. Fetal bovine serum increased NCX mRNA 10-fold in 4 h in dexamethasone-treated cells and restored full NCX activity in 16 h. The increase in NCX mRNA produced by serum required RNA and protein synthesis. Thrombin moderately increased NCX mRNA and partially restored NCX activity in dexamethasone-treated cells. Insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, or epidermal growth factor increased NCX mRNA similarly to thrombin. Tunicamycin, which inhibits N-linked glycosylation, prevented the restoration of NCX activity. These observations suggest that changes in the level of NCX mRNA mediate the opposing influences of glucocorticoids and growth factors on NCX activity. NCX induction by growth stimuli would increase the capacity for Ca2+ efflux and cycling between the cell and the environment."

Because monkeys are a limited resource, a more convenient, sensitive model was sought for investigating these dietary fatty acid and plasma lipid relationships. Accordingly, this report describes the results of multiple regression analysis of the TC response to dietary fatty acids based on 319 young, male Mongolian gerbils fed a total of 59 purified diets supplying about 40% energy as fat from single or blended fat sources. Gerbils (6-16 animals per dietary group) were fed purified diets (21 with 0.01 to 0.08% cholesterol and 38 cholesterol-free) for 4-week periods. When cholesterol-free diets were fed, dietary 14:0 and 18:2 together accounted for 89% of the observed variation in TC. Although 14:0 consumption increased TC in a linear manner, the independent ability of 18:2 to lower cholesterol was nonlinear and exhibited a threshold effect at 5-6% dietary energy, above which further lowering of TC was less remarkable. In gerbils consuming cholesterol-supplemented diets, 87% of the observed variation in TC could be accounted for by a regression equation that included 14:0, palmitic acid (16:0), and a log function of 18:2 plus dietary cholesterol itself. These results demonstrate the applicability of gerbils for such studies and confirm previous observations in monkeys and humans that dietary 14:0 and 18:2 are the main fatty acids modulating plasma cholesterol under normocholesterolemic circumstances (i.e., when consuming low-cholesterol diets and lipoprotein metabolism is normal) whereas 16:0 also appears modestly hypercholesterolemic when LDL receptors are compromised (i.e., when dietary cholesterol or certain metabolic factors have encumbered lipoprotein metabolism)."
https://openalex.org/W1481366545,"Glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GAT) catalyzes the conversion of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the first and committed step of triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. In spite of the important regulatory roles GAT may play in this biosynthetic pathway, little information is available on the structure, biochemical properties, and regulation of GAT from eukaryotic cells. We solubilized GAT from rat liver mitochondrial membranes and purified it to an apparent homogeneity by hydroxylapatite chromatography, preparative isoelectric focusing, and gel filtration. The enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide of 85 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography of the native protein. The GAT activity was completely lost during the purification procedure and required addition of exogenous phospholipids for its reconstitution. Since a high phospholipid to detergent ratio was needed for full reactivation, it is concluded that GAT requires lipid boundary for reconstitution. The ability of different phospholipids to reactivate GAT decreased in the following order: phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), asolectin, phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and cardiolipin. 1,2-Dioleoyl derivatives of PG and PE were more effective in reconstituting the GAT activity than corresponding dipalmitoyl derivatives. The GAT activation was further increased by using a combination of PG and PE or PG and PC. Regardless of the phospholipid used for reconstitution, palmitoyl-CoA was the best acyl donor and LPA was the only reaction product."
https://openalex.org/W1599428638,"We have previously shown that a decapeptide sequence between Lys-243 and Glu-252 (KYSFNYDGSE) in the third immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of chick neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM is directly involved in NCAM-to-NCAM binding. To identify the domain that interacts with this decapeptide sequence, the Ig-like domain 3 of NCAM was expressed in bacteria and the refolded protein was assayed for its NCAM binding activity. Covaspheres conjugated with domain 3 protein bound to a substratum coated with either NCAM or the domain 3 protein, suggesting that NCAM-NCAM binding is mediated by interactions between domain 3 sequences on apposing molecules. Further studies were carried out using a cell-to-substratum binding assay. Mouse L cells stably transformed with different deletion constructs of NCAM were assayed for their ability to attach to substratum coated with different peptide conjugates. The results indicated that a site in NCAM Ig-like domain 3 bound specifically to the decapeptide sequence. To identify this site, cells expressing mutant NCAMs with alterations in the amino acid sequence of the homophilic binding site were subjected to the same cell-to-substratum assay. Mutant NCAMs that had lost their homophilic binding activity also failed to attach to the peptide substrate. Taken together, these results suggest that the NCAM homophilic binding site interacts isologously with the same sequence on apposing molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1511200882,"A rapid rise in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration due to influx of extracellular Ca2+ or mobilization from intracellular stores is the primary trigger for exocytosis from secretory cells. Our understanding as to the precise role of Ca2+ mobilization has been complicated by the presence of several types of Ca2+ stores in most cells. We now demonstrate that overexpression of the type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor in insulin-secreting beta TC-3 cells results in the creation of a unique IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool, restricted to the insulin secretory granules of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1608547024,"The expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), and their corresponding mRNAs increases dramatically during the conversion of myoblasts to myotubes in C2-C12 cells. The increase in expression of nAChR arises from transcriptional activation of the genes encoding the receptor subunits, whereas stabilization of labile transcripts is primarily responsible for enhanced AChE expression. In a search for the signaling pathways responsible for stabilization of the AChE mRNA, we found that ryanodine, synthetic ryanodine receptor antagonists and L-type, but not N-type, Ca2+ channel blockers inhibit the differentiation-induced expression of AChE mRNA, but not the nAChR mRNA. Selective inhibition of increased expression of AChE is also evident. Inhibition by ryanodine and nifedipine is additive suggesting different target sites for the two Ca2+ channel ligands. Ryanodine binding sites can be detected in both myoblasts and myotubes, but they increase substantially during differentiation. Rates of AChE gene transcription are not altered by ryanodine and nifedipine, indicating that decreased Ca2+ availability prevents stabilization of the mRNA normally seen with differentiation. Muscle cells still undergo elongation and fusion in the presence of ryanodine or L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists. Ryanodine block is fully reversible, indicating functional integrity of the cellular expression system after the drug treatment. These findings indicate that intracellular ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels and extracellular L-type Ca2+ channels link to play an important role in stabilizing AChE mRNA and suggest that transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ may be critical for the commitment of AChE expression during myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1604988710,"The photosystem I (PSI) complex in higher plants contains eight nuclear-encoded subunits, of which two (PSI-F and -N) are synthesized with bipartite presequences containing cleavable thylakoid transfer sequences. Previous studies on four other chloroplast proteins bearing bipartite presequences have shown that they are transported across the thylakoid membrane by two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism is delta pH-dependent and hence sensitive to uncouplers, whereas the other is inhibited by azide. We show that PSI-F is targeted by the latter pathway, since its translocation across the thylakoid membrane is inhibited by azide but not by nigericin. Translocation is furthermore unaffected by the presence of high concentrations of the lumenal 23-kDa photosystem II (PSII) protein, which is known to be transported by the delta pH-dependent pathway. In contrast, translocation of PSI-N across the thylakoid membrane is completely blocked by saturating concentrations of pre-23-kDa protein. Three proteins are now known to be synthesized with thylakoid transfer signals in both higher plants and cyanobacteria (PSI-F, plastocyanin, and the 33-kDa PSII protein), and all three are transported by the azide-sensitive, possibly sec-dependent pathway. In contrast, PSI-N and the 23-kDa and 16-kDa PSII proteins (transported by the delta pH-driven pathway in higher plants) are all absent in cyanobacteria. These data suggest that the delta pH-dependent translocation mechanism for these proteins may also have arisen relatively recently during the evolution of the chloroplast. Three additional PSI proteins (PSI-H, -K, and -L) are synthesized in the cytosol with stroma-targeting presequences and hence integrate into the thylakoid membrane by means of information in the mature proteins. We show that the integration mechanisms are insensitive to azide in each case, and nigericin causes only a slight inhibition of integration in each case. We therefore suggest that these proteins are targeted into the thylakoid membrane by a separate pathway(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1608829020,"An ATP-dependent transport system specific for non-bile acid organic anions such as S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione is present in the canalicular plasma membrane of hepatocytes. It has been shown recently that transport of these anions by isolated hepatocytes is modulated by the activity of cellular protein kinase C (Roelofsen, H., Ottenhoff, R., Oude Elferink, R. P., and Jansen, P.L. (1991) Biochem. J. 278, 637-641, 1991). Using a series of affinity chromatography steps, we have purified to apparent homogeneity a 90-kDa glycoprotein which has S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione-dependent ATPase activity. As shown by binding to immobilized S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione and by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-ATP, the binding sites for organic anions and for ATP of the 90-kDa protein are interdependent, a behavior that is consistent with an ATP-dependent transport function. The ATP binding site has been further characterized using a fluorescent ATP analog. The 90-kDa protein was phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and the Vmax (but not the Km) of the S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione-dependent ATPase activity increased at least 2-fold upon phosphorylation. On the basis of its enzymatic properties, we propose that the 90-kDa protein is identical with the multispecific organic anion transporter (MOAT) of the hepatic canalicular plasma membrane. The size and oligosaccharide content of the 90-kDa protein indicate that it does not belong to the family of mammalian plasma membrane P-glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2167676678,"Amino acids contained in fossil materials show an increasing extent of racemization with age, postulating time and temperature as the two major variables. The recent discovery of the Homo tirolensis made possible a comparison between racemization rates of the amino acids found in hair at identical ages (5200 years of age) but at different diagenetic temperatures (""Ginger,"" found in the hot, dry sand of Egypt; H. tirolensis, found on a glacier of the Otztaler Alps). The rate of racemization was higher in the H. tirolensis, which is surprising and in contrast to current concepts. Ortho-tyrosine and di-tyrosine, parameters for OH-radical attack, were also higher in the H. tirolensis, suggesting a role for free OH-radical involvement in the racemization process."
https://openalex.org/W1503469366,"We have measured the dissociation rate of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent tumor promoter, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), a weak tumor promoter, and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate (dPP), an antitumor promoter, from intact mouse keratinocytes. PDBu and dPP showed a very rapid release from the cells (t1/2 = 1 min), whereas PMA showed a slower release (t1/2 = 9 min). Western blot analysis of the amounts of protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) and PKC delta in the soluble fraction and the Triton X-100-soluble particulate fraction revealed that translocation of both isozymes from the soluble to the particulate fraction was reversible when the phorbol esters were washed off. Washes of 5-15 min resulted in complete redistribution of the PKC isozymes when the cells were previously treated with 1 microM dPP or 1 microM PDBu for 5 min. In the case of treatment with 100 or 10 nM PMA, the redistribution required a longer time; nevertheless, the PKC isozymes returned to the soluble fraction within 60 min. Longer initial treatments with PMA, dPP, and PDBu (up to 60 min) translocated PKC in a very similar, completely reversible fashion. We conclude that in this cell line phorbol esters do not induce the conversion of PKC isozymes to an integral membrane state."
https://openalex.org/W1537738331,"The importance of cysteine residues in the cyclooxygenase activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS) was investigated using cysteine-specific reagents and site-directed mutagenesis. N-(7-Dimethyl-amino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)maleimide (DACM), a hydrophobic maleimide, inactivated both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of apoPGHS in a time-dependent manner but did not affect holoPGHS. Heme titration experiments indicated that modification of apoPGHS with DACM prevented heme binding. Peptide mapping revealed that DACM modified Cys313, Cys512, and Cys540. N-Ethylmaleimide inactivated cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of holoPGHS in a time-dependent manner but did not affect apoPGHS. Peptide mapping demonstrated that N-ethylmaleimide reacted primarily with Cys313 in holoPGHS and with Cys540 in apoPGHS. Each of the 3 cysteines was changed to serine by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells. The C512S mutant converted arachidonic acid to products to the same extent as wild-type PGHS. In contrast, the C313S and C540S mutants converted arachidonic acid to products to the extent of 10% of wild-type PGHS. These results indicate that Cys313, Cys512, and Cys540 are not essential for cyclooxygenase activity but that alteration of Cys540 or Cys313 dramatically decreases enzyme activity. Both residues are well removed from the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase active sites so our findings reveal that subtle changes, such as substitution of a single oxygen for sulfur atom as far as 30 A from the heme prosthetic group, can significantly alter enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1589555651,We demonstrate that acetylation of core histone tails does not significantly impair the ability of linker histones to bind preferentially and asymmetrically to a defined sequence mononucleosome core reconstituted in vitro. Thus a simple inhibition mechanism cannot explain models whereby acetylation is causal for the observed reduction in the linker histone content in chromatin. Other models to explain this correlation are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1616231405,"Phenobarbital induces gene transcription of both cytochrome P450IIB (the barbiturate-inducible cytochrome P450 in mammals) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, one of the major acute-phase proteins in rats and humans. Analysis of the 5'-regulatory sequences of cytochrome P450IIB and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein genes in rats revealed the presence of a consensus sequence of 10 base pairs, termed the phenobarbital-responsive element or Barbie box, located in a region extending from positions -136 to -127 from the transcription start site of the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene. A 17-base pair oligonucleotide probe specific for alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and including the consensus sequence showed, in mobility shift assays, slight binding to liver nuclear protein from untreated animals. This binding was strongly and specifically increased with protein extracts from phenobarbital-treated rats. Transfection of rat primary hepatocytes with the pAGPcat construct induced basal expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, which was increased by phenobarbital and dexamethasone treatment of cells. Induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity by phenobarbital was abolished when hepatocytes were transfected by constructs with a mutation or deletion of the Barbie box sequence. These results strongly suggest that the Barbie box sequence is involved in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene regulation by phenobarbital."
https://openalex.org/W1575698517,"The determinants of sugar specificity and cooperative behavior of human beta-cell glucokinase were studied by mutating several active site residues and performing a steady-state kinetic analysis of the purified mutant and wild-type enzymes after their expression in Escherichia coli. Asn-204, Glu-256, and Glu-290 were predicted from molecular modeling to interact with the 3-OH, 4-OH, 2-OH, and 1-OH groups of glucose. Mutation of these residues resulted in enzymes with decreased values of kcat and increased values of Km for glucose, mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose. Lys-56 is also predicted to make an interaction with the side chain of Glu-256 and its mutation increased the Km for glucose, deoxyglucose, mannose, and fructose by 4-, 4-, 3-, and 10-fold, respectively, and also increased the kcat for fructose by 5-fold. The Ki values for N-acetylglucosamine and mannoheptulose for the wild-type enzyme were 0.2 and 0.8 mM, respectively, and mutation of glucose binding residues to alanine resulted in an increase of about 3 orders of magnitude in these Ki values. Mutation of residues that directly hydrogen bond glucose hydroxyls (Asn-204, Glu-256, and Glu-290) to alanine resulted in enzymes that did not exhibit cooperative behavior, but mutation of Lys-56 or other residues that do not directly contact glucose had no effect on the Hill coefficient. Only glucose and deoxyglucose exhibited cooperative behavior. The results 1) confirm the predictions of the model that Asn-204, Glu-256, and Glu-290 are important residues involved in catalysis and hydrogen bonding glucose hydroxyl groups, 2) provide evidence for a role of Lys-56 in hexose binding, and 3) are consistent with the cooperative behavior of glucokinase being mediated by interactions of other regions of the protein with the highly conserved active site glucose binding residues."
https://openalex.org/W1601638712,"Most mutagenic DNA lesions are noninstructive in the sense that template instruction is either missing or inaccessible during DNA replication, leading to replication arrest. According to the SOS hypothesis, arrested replication induces the expression of SOS factors that force replication past stalled sites at the cost of mutagenesis. We have recently shown that prior UV irradiation of delta recA cells, in which the SOS pathway does not function, enhances mutagenesis at an ethenocytosine residue borne on a circular gapped duplex DNA vector, indicating the existence of an SOS-independent inducible mutagenic phenomenon termed UVM (UV modulation of mutagenesis). In the previous experiments, mutation fixation was expected to occur during gap-filling DNA synthesis. To test whether UVM is observable during normal replication by DNA polymerase III, we have examined mutagenesis at an epsilon C residue borne on M13 single-stranded DNA. By analyzing mutation frequency and specificity using a multiplex sequence assay, we now show that UVM is observable in UV-irradiated recA+, and in delta recA cells. These data indicate that UV irradiation induces a previously unrecognized mutagenic mechanism in Escherichia coli, and that this mechanism is manifested during gap-filling DNA synthesis as well as during normal DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1608185315,"In this work we demonstrated that IgG present in the sera of patients with congenital heart block (CHB) and their mothers could bind and activate beta adrenoceptors and muscarinic cholinergic receptors of neonatal heart. These antibodies were able to inhibit in a noncompetitive manner the binding of [3H]QNB and [3H]CGP to muscarinic cholinergic and beta adrenoceptors of purified neonatal rat myocardial membranes, respectively. Moreover, IgG from children with CHB and their mothers could modify biological effects mediated by these neurotransmitter receptors, i.e., heart contractility and cAMP production. Neither binding nor biological effects were obtained using adult instead of neonatal rat atria. Both reactivities (adrenergic and cholinergic) were independent of Ro/SS-A and La/SS-B antibodies and were absent in the sera of normal women of childbearing age and of normal children. It could be concluded that antibodies against cardiac neurotransmitter receptors may be another serum factor (or factors) to be considered in the pathophysiology of the development of CHB."
https://openalex.org/W1515363507,"The early growth response zinc finger transcription factor (EGR-1) and the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein encoded by the protooncogene G alpha i-2 each play pivotal roles in signaling pathways that control cell growth and differentiation. The G alpha i-2 gene 5'-flanking region contains a putative binding site (5'-CGCCCCCGC-3') for EGR-1 that may allow it to be a target gene for EGR-1 mitogenic signaling. We now demonstrate in LLC-PK1 renal cells the temporal expression of EGR-1 protein by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry coincident with the maximal activation of the G alpha i-2 gene during cell growth. To determine whether G alpha i-2 or EGR-1 influence epithelial cell growth, LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding cDNAs for G alpha i-2 (pRSV G alpha i-2) or EGR-1 (pRSV EGR-1) driven by a viral Rous sarcoma promoter enhancer to overexpress each protein. Following transfection, cell growth was examined in media containing either 10 or 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Only cells transfected with plasmids encoding G alpha i-2 and EGR-1 had growth rates greater than that of serum replete cohorts. To assess whether EGR-1 was contributing to the transcriptional activation of the G alpha i-2 gene, cells were cotransfected with pRSV EGR-1 and plasmids encoding firefly luciferase reporter genes fused to 5'-flanking areas of the G alpha i-2 gene containing either the EGR-1 binding site or a mutated EGR-1 binding site (5'-AAAAACCGC-3'). A 320% enhancement of G alpha i-2 transcription was found only in LLC-PK1 cells following their transfection with plasmids that contained both the EGR-1 binding site and overexpressed EGR-1 protein. Utilizing mobility shift assays, which compared nuclear extracts from cells before and after cell polarization, a probe containing the EGR-1 motif detected induced nuclear protein complexes during transcriptional activation of the G alpha i-2 gene. An anti-EGR-1 antibody specifically retarded the mobility of the induced nuclear complexes, indicating that the EGR-1 protein was a component of these complexes. These data provide direct evidence for a novel mitogenic signaling pathway coupling proximal signaling events that activate EGR-1 gene expression to a target protooncogene G alpha i-2 that is participatory for growth and differentiation in renal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1867023728,"Sugars react nonenzymatically with protein amino groups to form a ketoamine adduct (Amadori product), which leads to the formation of advanced glycation end-products. These compounds are involved in the development of tissue modifications such as cross-linking and fluorescence in diabetes and aging. Searching for an enzyme to reverse protein glycation, we isolated a Pseudomonas sp. soil strain growing selectively on the Amadori product epsilon-fructosyl-aminocaproate. An Amadori product binding protein (ABP) was purified from the bacterial extract by single-step affinity chromatography on glycated lysine-Sepharose. The protein, a monomer of 45 kDa, did not bind to unglycated or NaBH4-reduced glycated lysine-Sepharose suggesting specificity for the Amadori compound. The concentration-dependent binding of glycated aminocaproate showed saturation with Kd = 1.49 microM and Bmax = 17.63 nmol/mg of protein corresponding to 0.8 mol/mol of protein. The binding of epsilon-1-[14C]fructosyl-aminocaproate to the protein was inhibited by other glucose-derived Amadori products, but not by free sugars, unglycated amines, or ribated lysine. The sequence of the first 16 NH2-terminal amino acids and a GenBank search revealed that ABP is a novel protein. Its synthesis was inducible by growth of the organism in Amadori product. Immunoblotting studies showed that ABP is not found in cell extracts from other prokaryotes, yeast, or liver homogenate and does not bind Amadori products in glycated proteins. ABP has no enzymatic activity toward glycated substrates and may thus have transport or permease function for glycated amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1516718411,"Endonuclease NaeI is a prototype for an unusual group of type II restriction endonucleases that must bind two DNA recognition sequences to cleave DNA. The naeIR gene, expressed from a Ptac promotor construct, was toxic to Escherichia coli in the absence of NaeI-sequence specific methylases. The naeIR gene was mutagenized with N-methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidine; four classes of NaeI variants were isolated in the absence of protecting methylase activity. Class I variants (T60I, E70K) lacked detectable cleavage activity, but displayed good sequence-specific DNA binding. Class II variants (D95N, G141D) displayed 1-5% of the wild-type cleavage activity and normal DNA binding. Class III variants (G131E, G131R, G155D, G245E) displayed significantly attenuated cleavage and binding activities. Class IV variants (G197D, G214R/A219T, G236S, L241P, G245E, G245R, G250E, G270E) lacked both cleavage and binding activities. These results imply two amino acids (Thr-60, Glu-70) essential for catalysis. In addition, two domains are indicated in NaeI: one (Thr-60 to Gly-155) mediates substrate binding and catalysis, the other (Gly-197 to Gly-270) may mediate binding of the activating DNA sequence. Our results are compared with the active site residues of EcoRI, EcoRV, and BamHI."
https://openalex.org/W1545060892,"The hydrophobic fluorescent dye 3-[4-(3-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-1-yl)benzene-1-sulfonylamido]phen ylboronic acid (PPBA) stoichiometrically binds to myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 26 microns. Upon addition of nucleotides to the complex of S-1 with PPBA, the PPBA-binding site is converted to a more firm hydrophobic pocket accompanied by a large fluorescence change. For the complex formed with ATP, binding of the dye is competitive with respect to ATP with a Ki of 0.8 microns. This competition was confirmed by the result that the Kd value of S-1 with ATP was increased 3.3-fold by the addition of PPBA. The dye bound to S-1 senses ATP hydrolysis but has no effect on the binding of actin to S-1. Measurements of acrylamide fluorescence quenching of the complexes have revealed that the Stern-Volmer quenching constant of the dye is reduced by a factor of 2.7 during ATP hydrolysis. These results together with the fluorescent properties of the complexes suggest that the ATP-binding pocket of S-1 is closed and/or tightened during ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1594510334,"A method was developed for the solubilization of approximately 50% of proteins in synaptic membranes that have ligand-binding characteristics of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Affinity chromatographic separation of the solubilized proteins through L-glutamate-derivatized matrices and subsequent elution by NMDA-containing buffers led to the purification of four predominant proteins with estimated sizes of 67-70, 53-62, 41-43, and 28-36 kDa. The co-purification of NMDA-sensitive L-glutamate binding, dizocilpine-sensitive thienylcyclohexyl piperidine (TCP)-binding, and strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding proteins was achieved by this affinity chromatographic procedure. Glutamate, glycine, and the polyamine spermidine increased both the on rate and the equilibrium level of [3H]TCP binding to the isolated proteins. The group of proteins eluted by NMDA from the glutamate-derivatized matrices could be further purified through size exclusion chromatography of the NMDA-sensitive glutamate-binding from the dizocilpine-sensitive TCP-binding proteins. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the cloned NMDA receptor protein NMDAR1 did not react with any proteins in the solubilized membrane proteins or the purified fractions. However, immunoreaction of antibodies raised against a glutamate-binding protein and a phosphonoaminocarboxylic acid-binding protein indicated that these are two of the major proteins in the purified fractions. These studies indicate that these two proteins might be components of a complex that has some of the characteristics of NMDA receptors and that neuronal membranes may contain varieties of NMDA-like receptors composed of protein subunits that differ from the NMDAR1 and NMDAR2 receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1493102539,"Abstract Two interferon (IFN) alpha-regulated genes, IRF1/ISGF2 and PKR/p68 kinase, may function as tumor suppressor genes suggesting that the IFN system may function as a tumor suppressor system. We report that the expression of the alpha subunit of the type I IFN receptor in human K-562 cells had anti-oncogenic effects that include a marked decrease in: (i) cell proliferation rate, (ii) the cell density at which growth arrest normally occurs, and (iii) the tumorigenicity in nude mice. Furthermore, expression of the alpha subunit in K-562 cells induced erythroid differentiation. While most cytokine receptors become activated after binding their corresponding ligands, the overexpression of the alpha subunit has a physiological effect in the absence of its natural ligand, type I IFNs, suggesting a novel function for this type I IFN receptor subunit. The anti-oncogenic effect of the alpha subunit is mediated by a pathway that does not involve two tumor suppressor genes induced by type I IFNs, the transcriptional regulator IFN response factor-1 and the RNA-dependent protein kinase, or the p135tyk2 tyrosine kinase that directly associates and phosphorylates the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1603272105,"The secretory form of IgM (sIgM) undergoes developmentally regulated intracellular sorting and transport, as demonstrated by the distinct assembly patterns and intracellular fate exhibited by its mu heavy chain (microseconds). In the 38C B lymphocytes, microseconds-containing monomers are retained and degraded intracellularly, whereas in the 38C-derived D2 hybridoma, microseconds-containing polymers are secreted. Here we show that sorting of sIgM is impaired in the presence of the thiol-reducing agent beta-mercaptoethanol or when cellular calcium sequestration is perturbed either with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 or with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. Under these conditions, sIgM evades retention/degradation in the 38C cells, resulting in its enhanced secretion. Conversely, in the D2 cells, secretion is strongly attenuated, and sIgM is partly degraded. Both cell types secrete unusually processed sIgM, which is completely resistant to endoglycosidase H, unlike the partially sensitive sIgM secreted in the usual manner, indicating terminal glycosylation of all carbohydrate moieties of microseconds. Moreover, secretion is no longer restricted to fully assembled polymeric sIgM, and in both cell types under Ca2+ perturbation preferentially hemimeric and monomeric assembly intermediates are detected in the medium. Our results suggest that the intracellular fate of sIgM is collectively determined by several sorting events that confer sIgM retention/degradation, ensure sIgM secretion from D2 cells, and prevent the arrival of assembly intermediates to the cell surface. All of these sorting events appear to require high Ca2+ concentration and oxidizing thiol redox state, the conditions that prevail in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, thiol and calcium are implicated as modulators of intracellular traffic."

The ribozyme-cleaved transcript was shown to be polyadenylated. The poly(A) tail length was similar to the poly(A) tail length of an endogenous yeast mRNA. Therefore, cleavage of the precursor RNA at the polyadenylation site and the addition of adenosine residues to the 5' product require independent cellular machineries in yeast and can be separately analyzed.

We used molecular, immunological, and biochemical approaches to analyze in situ the expression of catecholamine enzymes in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells of rats flown for 6 days on board Space Shuttle mission STS-54. Exposure to microgravity (10−6 g) resulted in a 35% inhibition of both the expression and the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting step in the cascade of CA synthesis. By contrast, the expression, specific activity, and immunoreactivity of other catecholaminesynthesizing enzymes, e.g., phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase (PNMT), were not altered. The total tissue CA contents were reduced, concomitant with a decrease in the epinephrine:norepinephrine ratio. These results are in line with reports of other gravity-sensitive cellular effects and suggest that the inhibition of TH expression might be due to a direct effect of microgravity on PKC-dependent signal transduction pathways in chromaffin cells.—Lelkes, P.

https://openalex.org/W1571730439,"The Escherichia coli Uvr(A)BC endonuclease acts in a progression of several distinct steps accompanied by changes in the conformation of macromolecular constituents, the overall architecture of the complex, and its stoichiometry. In order to probe these structural changes, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to Uvr proteins. The anti-UvrA mAb, A2D1, recognizing the N-terminal zinc-finger region of UvrA, and the anti-UvrB mAb, B2E2, having an epitope within the 43 C-terminal amino acids of UvrB, were purified and further characterized. It was found that A2D1 mAb interacts in solution both with UvrA-UvrB and UvrA-DNA complexes in the presence of the requisite ATP. This implies that the N-terminal zinc-finger of UvrA doesn't play a direct role in its interactions with UvrB and DNA. On the other hand, A2D1 does inhibit formation of the UvrB-damaged DNA preincision complex, apparently by preventing UvrB delivery by UvrA. The interaction of B2E2 with UvrA-UvrB and nucleoprotein complexes, including UvrB, suggests that the highly hydrophobic C-terminal domain of UvrB (i) doesn't participate in its interaction with UvrA, (ii) is accessible to this mAb in an intermediate UvrA-UvrB DNA helix-tracking complex, and (iii) seems to be directly involved in the formation of the preincision complex. These conclusions are supported by the finding that the neutralizing effect of A2D1 and B2E2 on the Uvr(A)BC endonuclease is significantly decreased if the preincision complex is preformed prior to mAbs addition."
https://openalex.org/W1529138389,"Two-equivalent oxidation of metmyoglobin (MbIII) by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yields an oxoferryl moiety (MbIV) plus a protein radical which presumably originates from the conversion of tyrosines to tyrosyl radicals (-MbIV). In the absence of electron donors, MbIII oxidation is followed by (i) heme degradation or (ii) tyrosyl radical-dependent reactions, such as irreversible dimerization or covalent binding of the heme group to the apoprotein. Moreover, the oxidizing equivalents of H2O2-activated MbIII promote the peroxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In this study, water-soluble short chain coenzyme Q analogs (CoQ1H2 and CoQ2H2) were found to reduce the oxoferryl moiety, preventing heme degradation and regenerating MbIII and, more slowly, MbIIO2. CoQ1H2 and CoQ2H2 were also found to reduce tyrosyl radicals generated by UV irradiation of tyrosine solutions. Accordingly, CoQ1H2 and CoQ2H2 effectively prevented tyrosyl radical-dependent reactions such as the dimerization of sperm whale myoglobin and heme-apoprotein covalent binding in horse heart myoglobin. By competing for the oxidizing equivalents of hypervalent myoglobin, CoQ1H2 and CoQ2H2 also prevented the peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Collectively, these studies suggest that the proposed function of coenzyme Q as a naturally occurring antioxidant might well relate to its ability of reducing H2O2-activated myoglobin. Coenzyme Q should therefore mitigate cardiac or muscular dysfunctions that are caused by an abnormal generation of H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W1582015491,"The identification, purification, and biochemical characterization of specific markers for neuroglial cells in the central nervous system is an essential step toward a better understanding of the function of glial cells. This manuscript reports the identification and purification of a neuroglia-associated protein (NAP-185) with an apparent molecular mass of 185 kDa. While its expression is not restricted to the brain, it was first identified in a specific subpopulation of glial cells when chick brain stem sections were analyzed with an affinity-purified rabbit antiserum raised against the catalytic domain of the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase. This 185-kDa antigen was purified to apparent homogeneity and confirmed to be responsible for the neuroglial staining observed. In spite of its immunological relation to T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, purified NAP-185 failed to display tyrosine phosphatase activity. The primary sequence of five NAP-185-derived peptides shows that this protein has not yet been characterized and that it is possibly related to AP180, a clathrin-associated protein."
