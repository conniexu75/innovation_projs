https://openalex.org/W1966200086,"Class switch recombination (CSR) is a region-specific DNA recombination reaction that replaces one immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant region (Ch) gene with another. This enables a single variable (V) region gene to be used in conjunction with different downstream Ch genes, each having a unique biological activity. The molecular mechanisms that mediate CSR have not been defined, but activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a putative RNA-editing enzyme, is required for this reaction. Here we report that the Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein (Nbs1) and phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (gamma-H2AX, also known as gamma-H2afx), which facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, form nuclear foci at the Ch region in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in cells undergoing CSR, and that switching is impaired in H2AX-/- mice. Localization of Nbs1 and gamma-H2AX to the Igh locus during CSR is dependent on AID. In addition, AID is required for induction of switch region (S mu)-specific DNA lesions that precede CSR. These results place AID function upstream of the DNA modifications that initiate CSR."

In spleen cells and macrophages where TNF biosynthesis is restored as a result of this deletion, interleukin (IL)-6 biosynthesis is still dependent on MK2. In MK2-deficient macrophages the half-life of IL-6 mRNA is reduced more than 10-fold, whereas the half-life of TNF mRNA is only weakly decreased. It is shown that the stability of a reporter mRNA carrying the AU-rich 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of IL-6 is increased by MK2. The data provide in vivo evidence that the AU-rich 3′-UTRs of TNF and IL-6 are downstream to MK2 signaling and make MK2 an essential component of mechanisms that regulate biosynthesis of IL-6 at the levels of mRNA stability, and of TNF mainly through TNF-ARE-dependent translational control.

Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) in inflammation has been defined several years ago by the anti-inflammatory effect of the p38 MAPKα,β/SAPK2a,b inhibitor SB203580 and related compounds (reviewed in Ref. 2Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it was expected that several components of this kinase cascade may be essential components for early signaling in the inflammatory response and, hence, targets for an anti-inflammatory therapy. Targeted disruption of p38 MAPKα/SAPK2a in mice results in embryonic lethality and impaired IL-1 signaling in differentiated embryonic stem cells in one study (3Allen M. Svensson L. Roach M. Hambor J. McNeish J. Gabel C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and in defective erythropoietin expression in a second study (22Tamura K. Sudo T. Senftleben U. Dadak A.M. Johnson R. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 102: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Deletion of one of the two known specific upstream activators of p38 MAPK/SAPK2, the dual-specific MAPK kinase MKK3, leads to a reduction in IL-12 production (4Lu H.T. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Gatti E. Mellman I. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and impaired tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytokine expression (5Wysk M. Yang D.D. Lu H.T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3763-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice lacking one of the several kinases downstream to p38 MAPK/SAPK2, the serine/threonine kinase MK2 (also designated as MAPK-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 2), show a reduction of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced biosynthesis of TNF-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-1, IL-6, and nitric oxide resembling the effect of SB203580 at least in part (6Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The different phenotypes of the mice mutated in components of the p38 MAPK/SAPK2 cascade analyzed so far demonstrate the complexity of this signaling module, which is far away from being a linear step by step reaction (cf. Ref.1Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). In the last few years it became evident that the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA contributes to regulation of gene expression by influencing subcellular localization of mRNA, its translation or degradation (reviewed in Ref. 7Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′-UTR have been identified as cis-elements that affect mRNA stability (8Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 9Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar) and translation (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the p38 MAPK/SAPK2 cascade is involved in regulating mRNA stability via 3′-UTRs of IL-8, IL-6, c-Fos, GM-CSF mRNAs (11Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Müller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), via the 3′-UTR of cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA (12Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), via the 3′-UTR of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA (13Pages G. Berra E. Milanini J. Levy A.P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26484-26491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and also via the 3′-UTR of TNF mRNA (14Brook M. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a significant p38 MAPK/SAPK2-dependent contribution to translational control of the ARE in the 3′-UTR of TNF mRNA has also been demonstrated (15Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 23Mijatovic T. Houzet L. Defrance P. Droogmans L. Huez G. Kruys V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6004-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the case of 3′-UTR-dependent stability of IL-8 mRNA, a role for the kinase MK2 downstream to p38 MAPK/SAPK2 was evident, since mutants of MK2 interfered with IL-8 mRNA stability (11Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Müller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). For the mice lacking MK2 it was not clear whether the relatively complex phenotype resulted from secondary effects of the reduced TNF level after LPS induction or whether MK2 is involved in regulation of the different cytokines in response to LPS in parallel. In this paper, we present evidence that deletion of the ARE in the 3′-UTR of the TNF gene restored LPS-induced TNF production in MK2-deficient mice and could even increase TNF production above the wild type level. We analyzed the effect of lacking MK2 on IL-6 biosynthesis in mice where the TNF production was restored and found that IL-6 biosynthesis is still impaired. From the data obtained, a parallel ARE-dependent regulation of TNF and IL-6 biosynthesis by MK2 is proposed. The MK2−/− and TNFΔARE/− mice used for the crossing were on a mixed 129Sv × C57BL/6 background. Genotyping for MK2 was carried out using a three-primer PCR with the oligonucleotides 5′-cgtgggggtggggtgacatgctggttgac (5′-MK2), 5′-ggtgtcaccttgacatcccggtgag (3′-MK2), and 5′-tgctcgctcgatgcgatgtttcgc (Neo). A fragment length of about 500 bp indicates wild type and 800-bp stands for the deletion. For genotyping of TNF the primers 5′-ccttcctcacagagccagccccctc (sense) and 5′-aattacggttaggctcctgtttcc (antisense) were used for PCR. The fragments obtained are about 500 bp for wild type and 620 bp for ΔARE. Spleen cell culture and stimulation was done as described in Ref. 6Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar. For macrophage assays, total exudate peritoneal macrophages (TEPM) were isolated by peritoneal lavage from 10-week-old mice, 3 days after a single peritoneal injection of 1.0 ml of thioglycollate broth (4%, Difco Laboratories). For cytokine measurements, TEPM were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture tissue culture plates. Following adherence, cultures were stimulated with 1 ml of complete RPMI medium + 5% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence 1 μg/ml LPS (Salmonella enteriditis, Sigma L-6011) for the indicated time points. For the detection of lymphocyte derived TNF, total splenocytes were isolated from mouse spleens via mechanical dissociation. Following erythrocyte lysis, cells were set onto tissue culture plates to remove the adherent fraction of splenocytes corresponding to myeloid cells. The nonadherent fraction was collected, counted, and plated into 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml/well in the presence or absence of coated 10 μg/ml agonistic monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody (Clone 145-2C11, Low Endotoxin/PharMingen) to activate T-lymphocytes. Supernatants were collected following centrifugation at the indicated time points. Murine TNF immunoreactivity of cultured supernatants (diluted ¼– 110) was measured using specific ELISA as described previously (15Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Murine IL-6 immunoreactivity of cultured supernatants (diluted ½– 18) was measured using a specific ELISA (Endogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were treated with 5 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli, Sigma L-6529) for 1 h and subsequent adding of actinomycin D (10 μg/ml). Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 104 cells at different times after actinomycin D treatment using RNApure (PeqLab). RNAs were separated in 1.25% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transfered to nitrocellulose, and hybridized to 32P-labeled IL-6 or TNF cDNA probes (6Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels were normalized by stripping and reprobing the membranes with a 514-bp β-actin cDNA probe. Northern blots were analyzed by phosphorimaging. Decay of β-globin mRNA carrying an insertion of the IL-6 3′-UTR (nucleotides 767–1022) was monitored using the tet-offsystem as described previously for IL-8 3′-UTR (11Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Müller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). For detection of mRNA levels in spleen cells, mice were injected with LPS (S. typhosa; Sigma L-7895) at 5 mg/kg body weight. After 90 min total RNA was isolated from spleens, and 20 μg of RNA were analyzed as described above. To test whether the post-transcriptional regulation of TNF biosynthesis by MK2 proceeds via the ARE of the TNF gene, we analyzed LPS-induced TNF production in systems where both MK2 and the ARE are deleted. In the case that the ARE is a downstream regulatory element of MK2 signaling for TNF biosynthesis, its deletion should lead to MK2 independence of LPS-induced TNF production. We crossed MK2−/− animals with the mouse strain carrying a 69-base pair deletion of the ARE in the 3′-UTR of the TNF gene TNFΔARE/− (15Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Since offspring carrying the genotype MK2−/−TNFΔARE/ΔARE were not viable, we selected mice with the genotypes MK2+/+TNF+/+, MK2−/−TNF+/+, MK2+/+TNFΔARE/+, and MK2−/−TNFΔARE/+ from the F2 generation for further analysis. Splenocytes from these mice were stimulated with LPSin vitro. As seen from Fig.1A, deletion of the ARE in only one allele leads to an almost complete restoration of LPS-induced TNF biosynthesis in the absence of MK2. When thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages of the different genotypes were stimulated by LPS in vitro (Fig. 1B), a similar result was obtained: deletion of the ARE leads to a re-establishment of TNF production leading to wild type levels after 3 and 6 h and to levels even significantly above the wild type macrophages 12 h after stimulation. This findings indicate that the ARE is downstream to the protein kinase MK2 at the same genetically defined LPS-signaling pathway and that MK2 directly or indirectly targets this element in the TNF-α mRNA. Interestingly, when a spleen cell population was stimulated by antibodies against the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor, deletion of the ARE even leads to a significant increase of TNF production compared with wild type animals, and this increase was independent of MK2 (Fig. 1C). Since it has already been shown that other hemopoietic cell types such as T-cells overproduce TNF as well (15Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), this finding indicates that the MK2/ARE axis is also functioning in these cells to activate TNF production following CD3 or antigen engagement similar to the case of LPS-induced macrophages. So far, it was not clear whether the reduced biosynthesis of cytokines like IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ in MK2−/− animals is an indirect effect due to the lack of production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF. Alterations in the serum level of IL-6 have been observed as a secondary effect,e.g. in mice lacking TNF (16Marino M.W. Dunn A. Grail D. Inglese M. Noguchi Y. Richards E. Jungbluth A. Wada H. Moore M. Williamson B. Basu S. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8093-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and IL-1β (17Alheim K. Chai Z. Fantuzzi G. Hasanvan H. Di Malinowsky D. Santo E. Ghezzi P. Dinarello C.A. Bartfai T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2681-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To decide whether this is also the case in MK2−/− animals, we analyzed IL-6 production in splenocytes and macrophages of the MK2−/− TNFΔARE/+ animals. Although the absolute values of IL-6 production are lower in the ΔARE/+ spleen cell population probably due to a reduced representation of IL-6 producing cells, a comparable relative reduction of IL-6 levels (to about 30%) as a result of ablation of MK2 is observed in both the MK2−/− TNFΔARE/+ and the MK2−/− TNF+/+ background (Fig.2A). Analysis of LPS-stimulated IL-6 production of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages shows similar and even more clear data (Fig.2B). For the same MK2 genotype, there is no significant difference in IL-6 production between the ΔARE/+ background, where TNF production is restored and even increased above wild type levels and the TNF +/+ background. This result clearly indicates that the defect in IL-6 biosynthesis in MK2−/− animals is not a secondary effect of reduced TNF production but independent of TNF. When looking at IL-6 mRNA levels in the different spleen cell cultures analyzed (Fig. 2C), a reduction of IL-6 mRNA, which correlates to the decreased biosynthesis of this cytokine in MK2−/−TNF+/+ and MK2−/−TNFΔARE/+ cells (as shown in Fig.2A), is observed. This indicates that the production of IL-6 is regulated at the level of transcription or stability of mRNA. To further analyze the mechanism by which MK2 determines the level of IL-6 mRNA we blocked transcription in LPS-stimulated macrophages from MK2+/+ and MK2−/− animals by using actinomycin D and analyzed half-life of the mRNA by Northern blotting. For comparison, we also determined the stability of TNF mRNA (Fig.3A). As a control, actin mRNA was detected and used to normalize the IL-6 and TNF mRNA level to equal loading. A quantitative evaluation of the mRNA decay (Fig. 3B) reveals a half-life of more than 20 h for IL-6 mRNA in LPS-stimulated MK2+/+ macrophages. Interestingly, in macrophages lacking MK2 its half-life is reduced 10-fold to about 2 h. This result provides the first direct genetic evidence for the involvement of MK2 in regulating mRNA stability. TNF mRNA is about 20-fold less stable than IL-6 mRNA in MK2+/+ cells. This is probably due to the more classical ARE in the TNF 3′-UTR compared with the AU-rich ARE-like motifs in the IL-6 3′-UTR (see below). Remarkably, the lack of MK2 in the macrophages leads only to a weak further destabilization of TNF mRNA reducing the half-life from 76 to 51 min. These data indicate that MK2 can regulate the stability of different cytokine mRNAs to a different degree. For IL-6 the 10-fold destabilization of mRNA could well explain the about 70% decrease in IL-6 protein biosynthesis in response to LPS in macrophages lacking MK2. However, the very weak destabilization of TNF mRNA in MK2-deficient macrophages compared with wild type cells cannot explain the 90% reduction of TNF biosynthesis observed. This finding supports the notion that MK2 regulates TNF biosynthesis mainly at the level of mRNA translation (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 15Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Since AREs in the 3′-UTR of cytokine mRNAs are made responsible for both translational control (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 18Kruys V. Marinx O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G. Science. 1989; 245: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and mRNA stability (8Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 9Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar), we examined whether the ARE-containing 3′-UTR of IL-6 is sufficient to confer MK2-dependent stabilization to a reporter mRNA. It is interesting to note that in the 3′-UTR of mouse or human IL-6 mRNA there are no overlapping pentanucleotide cores of AUUUA. Instead, they are scattered in an ARE-like region with varying U stretches of 2–5 nucleotides in length (Fig.4A). These regions of the human and mouse gene exhibit high homology to each other. To clarify their functional role we inserted the 3′-UTR region of human IL-6, including several AU-rich sequences (nt 767–1022, Fig. 4A), into the 3′-UTR of a β-globin genomic sequence and expressed the chimeric RNA using the tet-off system in HeLa cells (11Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Müller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). After addition of doxycycline to the cells transcription of the reporter mRNA (BBB-IL-6767–1022) is blocked, and mRNA decay can be followed. As seen in Fig. 4B the reporter construct shows a relatively short half-life (∼30 min) in HeLa cells co-transfected with a control vector, indicating that the IL-6 3′-UTR-derived sequence destabilizes the globin mRNA, which is very stable in its nonfused form (half-life > 300 min, Ref. 19Xu N. Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Co-expression of a constitutively active mutant of MK2, MK2EE (20Engel K. Schultz H. Martin F. Kotlyarov A. Plath K. Hahn M. Heinemann U. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27213-27221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), as well as of the activator for p38 MAPK/SAPK2, MKK62E (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), lead to a significant stabilization of the reporter mRNA (half-life about 120 min). Furthermore, a negative interfering mutant of MK2, MK2K76R (11Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Müller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), can at least partially block the MKK62E-stimulated stabilization of the reporter mRNA (Fig. 4B, half-life of about 120 min reduced to about 60 min). Stability of a β-globin reporter RNA carrying the 3′-UTR of murine IL-6 was affected in the same way (not shown). These data indicate that MK2 can regulate IL-6 mRNA stability in an 3′-UTR-dependent manner. We have demonstrated that in the LPS response AU-rich elements are downstream to the protein kinase MK2 and that MK2 regulates TNF-α and IL-6 biosynthesis independently. Regulation of TNF proceeds through the ARE in the mRNA, since deletion of this ARE leads to restoration of TNF biosynthesis in the absence of MK2. In cells where TNF biosynthesis is re-established, MK2 is still necessary for IL-6 induction, indicating that reduced IL-6 levels are not a secondary effect of the reduction of TNF. The defect of IL-6 synthesis correlates with decreased mRNA levels, and it is shown that the absence of MK2 leads to a 10-fold increased degradation rate of IL-6 mRNA in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, MK2 can stabilize an mRNA reporter construct carrying the IL-6 3′-UTR, which contains ARE-like motifs. The data presented do not directly exclude that MK2 is also necessary for transcriptional stimulation of the IL-6 gene. However, since it is known that activated MK2 is rapidly translocated to the cytoplasm of the cell (24Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it seems likely that regulation of the IL-6 mRNA level by MK2 is mainly the result of altered stability of its mRNA in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, degradation of TNF mRNA in the absence of MK2 is increased only marginally. This is in agreement with the finding that the p38 MAPK/ARE axis mainly regulates translation of TNF mRNA and not its absolute level or stability (6Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 15Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar) and that TNF mRNA stability and hypoadenylation are not significantly altered in LPS-stimulated macrophages (23Mijatovic T. Houzet L. Defrance P. Droogmans L. Huez G. Kruys V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6004-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Other studies also indicate that, depending on the cellular context, TNF mRNA is also regulated on the stability level, and ARE-binding proteins such as tristetraprolin (TTP) (25Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or HuR (26Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), which decrease or increase its half-life, have been described. However, ARE-binding proteins such as TIAR (27Gueydan C. Droogmans L. Chalon P. Huez G. Caput D. Kruys V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2322-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and TIA-1 (28Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) confer specific translational regulation of the TNF mRNA. Deletion of TIA-1 from mouse macrophages does not alter transcript stability but increases the level of TNF mRNA that is associated with the polysomes (28Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), strongly indicating translational control of TNF. Obviously, MK2 is an element of a signaling mechanism that can regulate biosynthesis of different cytokines via their different AU-rich 3′-UTRs in parallel and on different levels. So far, it is not clear whether there is a signaling branch point downstream to MK2 with different ARE-binding protein substrates such as TTP or HuR responsible for regulation of stability and others such as TIAR and TIA-1 responsible for regulation of translation. To us, it also seems possible that MK2 phosphorylates a so far unknown target, which can directly or indirectly interact with AREs and which regulates stability and/or translation of the mRNA, depending on the context of the particular ARE and other ARE-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2130835350,"Matrix GLA protein (MGP) has been identified as a calcification inhibitor in cartilage and vasculature. Part of this effect may be attributed to its influence on osteoinductive activity of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). To detect binding between MGP and BMP-2, we performed immunoprecipitation using MGP and BMP-2 tagged with FLAG and c-Myc. The results showed co-precipitation of BMP-2 with MGP. To quantify the effect of MGP on BMP-2 activity, we assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity and showed a dose-dependent effect. Low levels of MGP relative to BMP-2 (<1-fold excess) resulted in mild enhancement of osteoinduction, whereas intermediate levels (1–15-fold excess) resulted in strong inhibition. High levels of MGP (>15-fold excess), however, resulted in pronounced enhancement of the osteoinductive effect of BMP-2. Cross-linking studies showed that inhibitory levels of MGP abolished BMP-2 receptor binding. Immunoblotting showed a corresponding decrease in activation of Smad1, part of the BMP signaling system. Enhancing levels of MGP resulted in increased Smad1 activation. To determine the cellular localization of BMP-2 in the presence of MGP, binding assays were performed on whole cells and cell-synthesized matrix. Inhibitory levels of MGP yielded increased matrix binding of BMP-2, suggesting that MGP inhibits BMP-2 in part via matrix association. These results suggest that MGP is a BMP-2 regulatory protein. Matrix GLA protein (MGP) has been identified as a calcification inhibitor in cartilage and vasculature. Part of this effect may be attributed to its influence on osteoinductive activity of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). To detect binding between MGP and BMP-2, we performed immunoprecipitation using MGP and BMP-2 tagged with FLAG and c-Myc. The results showed co-precipitation of BMP-2 with MGP. To quantify the effect of MGP on BMP-2 activity, we assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity and showed a dose-dependent effect. Low levels of MGP relative to BMP-2 (<1-fold excess) resulted in mild enhancement of osteoinduction, whereas intermediate levels (1–15-fold excess) resulted in strong inhibition.

These results suggest that MGP is a BMP-2 regulatory protein. matrix GLA protein bone morphogenetic protein-2 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium bovine serum albumin 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid MGP1 is a small matrix protein that was initially isolated from bone and characterized by Price and Williamson (1Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MGP deficiency in mice results in premature calcification in bone, calcification of normally noncalcifying cartilage, such as the trachea, and severe vascular calcification leading to premature death (2Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Thus, MGP functions as a calcification inhibitor; however, its molecular mechanism is incompletely understood. MGP appears to play a role in cell differentiation. In the artery wall of the MGP knockout mouse, medial smooth muscle cells are replaced by chondrocyte-like cells undergoing endochondral ossification, and in the growth plate of growing bones, hypertrophic chondrocytes are lacking (2Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Further support for an effect of MGP on cell differentiation comes from the work of Yagami et al. (3Yagami K. Suh J.-Y. Motomi E.-I. Koyama E. Abrams W.R. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. Iwamoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), who show that overexpression of MGP in developing limbs delays chondrocyte maturation and blocks endochondral ossification. In addition, MGP inactivation triggers mineralization in cultured hypertrophic chondrocytes but not in immature chondrocytes. This is consistent with recent data from Newman et al. (4Newman B. Gigout L.I. Sudre L. Grant M.E. Wallis G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrating that overexpression of MGP in hypertrophic chondrocytes reduces mineralization. These authors also show that MGP expression is biphasic and stage-specific during chondrocyte differentiation and that MGP has an effect on chondrocyte viability. Increased expression of MGP induces apoptosis in maturing chondrocytes, whereas decreased expression induces apoptosis in proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Previous studies from our laboratory using the multipotent cell line C3H10T1/2 cells demonstrate that MGP inhibits differentiation induced by BMP-2 (5Boström K. Tsao D. Shen S. Wang Y. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). BMP-2 belongs to the TGF-β superfamily of growth factors, and it is a potent inducer of bone and cartilage (6Ducy P. Karsenty G. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2207-2214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). When initially purified from bone, it was observed to be strongly associated with MGP, and strong denaturants were required to separate the two proteins (7Urist M.R. Huo Y.K. Brownell A.G. Hohl W.M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). More recently, Wallin et al. (9Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D.C. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), have shown binding between MGP and BMP-2 using ligand blotting. If such a binding also occurs in cellular systems or in vivo, it may at least partly explain MGP's function as a calcification inhibitor. In the present study, we further explore the relationship between MGP and BMP-2. We show that the effect of MGP on BMP-2 differentiation is dose-dependent. In addition, we show that MGP is able to bind BMP-2 and promote an association between BMP-2 and matrix components. Interaction between MGP and BMP-2 interferes with binding of BMP-2 to its receptor and activation of Smad1, part of the BMP signaling system. M2-10B4 (M2) mouse marrow stromal cells were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Irvine Scientific). The cells were split at 70–80% of confluency. HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Irvine Scientific). Both media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), andl-glutamine (2 mm). Transfections were performed using SuperfectTM or PolyfectTM (Qiagen), after optimization of the ratio of DNA to transfection agent as per manufacturer's instructions. Conditioned media containing BMP-2, Myc-tagged BMP-2, MGP, or FLAG-tagged MGP were prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with 16 μg of the respective plasmid per 100-mm culture dish as previously described (5Boström K. Tsao D. Shen S. Wang Y. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 5 or 10 ml of conditioned medium was collected and filtered after 48 h of incubation starting after transfection. Control medium was collected from HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector. To construct the Myc-tagged BMP-2 vector, a Myc tag was introduced upstream of the first cysteine of the mature N-terminal domain of BMP-2. Four oligonucleotides were synthesized, which together created a dsDNA fragment that included (in 5′ to 3′ order): two random nucleotides, an EcoRI site, the signal sequence of MGP (corresponding to MKSLILLAILAALAVVTLC, Ref. 10Chen L. O'Bryan J.P. Smith H.S. Liu E. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1391-1395PubMed Google Scholar), the c-Myc tag (corresponding to EQKLISEEDL), 11 nucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 1170–1210 in the BMP-2 sequence (11Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar) (including a PvuII site at the 3′-end), and four random nucleotides. The oligonucleotides were annealed, ligated, and cut withEcoRI and PvuII to create a ∼150-bp fragment. The previously described human BMP-2 vector (construction in Ref. 5Boström K. Tsao D. Shen S. Wang Y. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was cut with PvuII and XbaI, to isolate a ∼300-bp fragment that covered the sequence between nucleotide 1208 (BMP-2 sequence, Ref. 11Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar) and the 3′ insertion point for the BMP-2 cDNA in that vector. The 150- and 300-bp fragments were subsequently inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) Zeo (Invitrogen). The construct was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing of the complete coding sequence. For detection of BMP-2 and Myc-BMP-2 by immunoblotting, either 30 μl of culture medium or protein extracted from immunoprecipitation beads were electrophoresed through 10% NuPAGE™ Bis-Tris (MES) gels. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter using NuPAGE™ transfer buffer (Invitrogen). The blots were incubated with specific antibodies (1 μg/ml) to either BMP-2 (polyclonal antibody H-51, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the c-Myc tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Specific antibody binding was visualized with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To estimate the concentration of MGP-FLAG, 0.5–4 ng of C-terminally FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase standard protein (Sigma) was electrophoresed and transferred as described above, in parallel with 1–2 μl-aliquots of conditioned media containing MGP-FLAG. The blots were incubated with anti-FLAG M2®monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma), diluted 1:250, and specific antibody binding was visualized. Densitometry using NIH Image J, version 1.08i (public domain program, Internet address: rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image) was performed to compare the amount of FLAG in the samples to that in the standards. The difference in calculated molecular weight between the two proteins, 49.4 kDa for the standard protein and 11.6 kDa for MGP-FLAG, was taken into account when estimating the concentration of MGP-FLAG in ng/ml. M2 cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at 10,000 cells per well. 16 h later, 200 μl of conditioned medium containing the indicated combinations of BMP-2 and MGP, ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml), and β-glycerophosphate (3 mm) were applied to the cultures. The alkaline phosphatase activity was determined 48 h later. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by freeze-thawing twice in 50 μl of 0.2% Nonidet P-40 with 1 mm MgCl2. Cell lysates were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity by adding 150 μl of alkaline phosphatase buffer (40 mg of Sigma 104 alkaline phosphate substrate dissolved in 20 ml of Sigma 221 alkaline buffer solution diluted 1:2 with distilled water) per well and incubating for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance at 405 nm was read using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Activity was expressed as units/mg of cellular protein and presented as mean ± S.D. Two aliquots of equal volume (∼3 ml) of conditioned media containing MGP-FLAG and Myc-BMP-2, respectively, were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation. After preclearance with agarose-conjugated nonspecific rabbit antibodies, 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (polyclonal antibody F7425, Sigma) was added, and incubation continued overnight at 4 °C. The following day, 25 μl of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and incubation continued for 1–2 h at room temperature. The protein G-agarose was spun down and washed 12–15 times with DMEM with 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA), or six times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA) (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). The clearest results were obtained after extensive washing with DMEM; the number of washes was determined by the number of washes it took to remove all nonspecific binding to the agarose-conjugated nonspecific rabbit antibodies. Co-precipitated Myc-BMP-2 was detected by immunoblotting as described above. HEK293 cells were transfected with pCMV-BMPRI-HA (12De Zimmerman L.B. Jesús-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), alone or in combination with pCMV5-BMPRII-His (12De Zimmerman L.B. Jesús-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), or with pCMV5 empty vector. The vectors were graciously supplied by Dr. Joan Massagué, Columbia University, New York. Recombinant human BMP-2, obtained from R&D Systems, was radiolabeled using IODOBEADS™ (Pierce). 3 μg of BMP-2 and 0.5 mCi of [125I]NaI were incubated with the IODOBEADSTMas per manufacturer's instructions. Free [125I]NaI was separated from 125I-BMP-2 by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Whole cell binding and affinity labeling were performed using previously described methods (12De Zimmerman L.B. Jesús-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), except that a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μl/ml, Sigma, for mammalian cells) was added during the preincubation and binding procedures. Briefly, ∼3 nm125I-BMP-2 was preincubated for 30 min with or without 10-fold excess of MGP or MGP-FLAG in binding buffer (DMEM with 25 mm HEPES and 2 mg/ml of BSA) prior to binding to cell monolayers in 6-well plates for 3.5 h at 4 °C. The binding solution was then aspirated, and cells were rinsed three times in ice-cold binding buffer and twice in binding buffer without BSA. Cross-linking was performed using 0.26 mm disuccinimidyl suberate in DMEM for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.75% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors mixture for 20 min at 4 °C. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation. After preclearance with agarose-conjugated nonspecific rabbit antibodies, 1 μg of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (H6908, Sigma) was added, and incubation continued overnight at 4 °C. The following day, 25 μl of protein G-agarose was added, and incubation continued for 1–2 h at room temperature. The protein G-agarose was washed three times with lysis buffer and three times with RIPA before the protein was extracted and analyzed with SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. M2 cells were plated the day before the experiment in 60-mm Petri dishes, at a density resulting in 80–90% confluency on the day of the experiment. The cells were incubated with BMP-2 alone or in combination with excess MGP for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were scraped into 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 20 μl/ml of protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated. The proteins were analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed using anti-phosphorylated Smad1(P) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Specific antibody binding was visualized with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody. Cell-synthesized matrix was prepared as previously described (13Watson K.E. Parhami F. Shin V. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). M2 cells were allowed to grow on tissue culture plastic for 3 days followed by detachment of the cell monolayer with 25 mm NH4OH. The monolayers were incubated with NH4OH for 10 min, followed by extensive washing with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and microscopic inspection of the dishes to ensure complete cell removal. If cells remained after the initial incubation, the treatment was repeated. Assays for cellular binding of radioactively trace-labeled BMP-2 in the presence of increasing amounts of MGP were performed at 4 °C as previously described by Massagué (14Massagué J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) for identification of TGF-β receptors. M2 cells were plated in 12- or 24-well plates either 1 or 3 days prior to the assay, in both cases at a density resulting in 100% confluency 1 day after plating. ∼1.2 nm radioactively trace-labeled BMP-2 per well was added in ice-cold binding buffer (DME with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 and 2 mg/ml BSA), together with different amounts of conditioned media containing cold MGP or MGP-FLAG. The final concentration of MGP was between 0.05 and 18 nm (15-fold excess). Conditioned medium from sham-transfected cells were used as a control. The assay was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C and 120 rpm and was subsequently washed five times with ice-cold binding buffer. The receptor-bound BMP-2 was solubilized as described using a Triton X-100-containing buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml BSA) for 40 min at 4 °C and 120 rpm. After removal of the Triton X-100-containing buffer, an equal amount of 5 m guanidine hydrochloride in 0.1 mTris HCl, pH 8.0 was added. The plates were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and 120 rpm. 125I-BMP-2 was detected by gamma counting. At least three independent experiments for each time point were performed, each for MGP and MGP-FLAG. After cell removal with dilute alkaline treatment, assays for matrix binding were performed in the identical manner. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and immunocytochemistry was performed as previously described (15Tsuji H. Iehara N. Masegi T. Imura M. Ohkawa J. Arai H. Ishii K. Kita T. Doi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to MGP were graciously supplied by Dr. Reidar Wallin, Wake Forest University, NC. Data was analyzed for statistical significance by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Scheffe's analysis, unless otherwise stated. The analyses were performed using StatView, version 4.51 (Abacus Concepts). We constructed a Myc-tagged BMP-2 (Myc-BMP-2), adding the Myc tag to the N terminus of the mature protein, similar to what previously has been described for BMP-4 (12De Zimmerman L.B. Jesús-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The Myc-BMP-2 was easily detected in conditioned medium by immunoblotting (Fig. 1) and retained 20–25% of the osteoinductive effect of native BMP-2 in M2 cells, as measured by alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). The FLAG-tagged form of human MGP (MGP-FLAG) used in the present study has been shown previously to have the same effect on BMP-2 activity as native MGP (5Boström K. Tsao D. Shen S. Wang Y. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and was used interchangeably with native MGP, except in experiments where MGP-FLAG was immunoprecipitated. To study the interaction between BMP-2 and MGP or MGP-FLAG, conditioned media were used as the source of the proteins. The conditioned media for the respective proteins were always prepared in parallel using equimolar amounts of plasmid. The transfection efficiency was monitored using β-galactosidase. The concentration of biologically active BMP-2 in conditioned medium was estimated by using its ability to induce osteoblastic differentiation in M2 cells, as measured by alkaline phosphatase, in comparison to purified BMP-2 standards (Fig.1A). Immunoblotting was used to confirm the presence of BMP-2 in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1A). The concentration of MGP-FLAG in conditioned medium was determined using a comparison with FLAG-tagged standard protein on immunoblots probed with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 1B). Because there were no available MGP-antibodies suitable for immunoblotting, the biological activity of native MGP was compared with that of MGP-FLAG of known concentration in alkaline phosphatase assays using 10T1/2 cells (5Boström K. Tsao D. Shen S. Wang Y. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and M2 cells (see below). Known amounts of BMP-2 were combined with the same amounts of conditioned media for MGP-FLAG and native MGP, respectively. In all cases, conditioned media containing MGP-FLAG and native MGP, respectively, that had been prepared in parallel showed similar activity. The results also showed that the concentration of MGP-FLAG corresponded to that of BMP-2 as well when conditioned media for the respective protein were prepared in parallel. For experiments requiring a mix of BMP-2 and MGP (MGP-FLAG or MGP), medium containing both proteins were prepared either by mixing separately produced conditioned media at the appropriate ratio or by obtaining conditioned medium from cells co-transfected with the two vectors at the same ratio. No difference was seen between the two methods. In addition, we have taken into account that MGP has poor solubility in aqueous solutions, about 200 μg/ml (1Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and adjusted transfections to keep BMP-2 and MGP concentrations to no more than 10 μg/ml. To study whether MGP binds BMP-2, we performed immunoprecipitation studies. Conditioned media for MGP-FLAG and Myc-BMP-2 were mixed at a ratio of 1:1, a ratio where MGP significantly inhibited the effect of BMP. MGP-FLAG was immunoprecipitated using FLAG antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibodies. The results showed that Myc-BMP-2 co-precipitated with MGP-FLAG (Fig.2). The results were confirmed for native BMP-2 using radioactively labeled BMP-2, which also co-precipitated with MGP-FLAG (data not shown). To quantitate the effect of MGP on osteoinduction by BMP-2, we established a 96-well plate assay for alkaline phosphatase, an early osteoblastic marker, using M2 marrow stromal cells. Medium containing either BMP-2 (500 ng/ml) alone or in combination with MGP or MGP-FLAG at a molar ratio between 0.1 and 15 were prepared as described above. A differential effect on osteoinduction was seen when the ratio of MGP to BMP-2 was changed (Fig. 3). Molar ratios of MGP to BMP-2 of less than 1 consistently resulted in a small but reproducible increase in osteoinduction, whereas ratios between 1 and as much as 10–15 resulted in significantly decreased osteoinduction. For ratios between 10 and 15, a trend toward a second increase was seen. To study whether MGP inhibits binding of BMP-2 to its receptor, we transiently transfected HEK 293 cells with hemagglutinin-tagged BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA), alone or in combination with BMP receptor type II (BMPRII). Radioactively trace-labeled BMP-2 was subsequently added alone or in combination with 10-fold excess of MGP or MGP-FLAG. Cross-linking was performed followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-hemagglutinin antibodies, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. The results showed that BMP-2 bound to the receptors, both after transfection with BMPRIA alone and after co-transfection with BMPRII (Fig.4A, lanes 3 and5). The binding decreased significantly when MGP was added to the medium (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and6). We also tested whether MGP inhibited activation of Smad1, part of the intracellular signaling system for BMP-2 (16Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M.J. Ten Dijke P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6954-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). We treated M2 cells with BMP-2 alone or in combination with 10-fold excess of MGP and studied the activation of Smad1 by immunoblotting, using antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated (activated) form of Smad1 (P-Smad1). The results showed that phosphorylation of Smad1 was inhibited by the addition of MGP to the medium (Fig. 4B) consistent with the decreased receptor binding. Together, these results suggest that MGP inhibits BMP-2 signaling by preventing receptor binding and subsequent Smad1 activation. To study the effect of MGP on cellular localization of BMP-2, we performed whole cell binding assays as described by Massagué (14Massagué J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), using M2 cells. The binding assays were performed using radioactively trace-labeled BMP-2, with increasing amounts of cold MGP or MGP-FLAG or control medium. Cell membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100-containing buffer, while Triton X-100 insoluble cell and matrix components were solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride-containing buffer. The results showed that the whole cell binding of BMP-2 increased significantly with increasing concentration of MGP, even though previous experiments had showed decreased osteoinduction with increasing MGP concentration. If the binding assay was performed within 24 h of plating of the cells, most of the labeled BMP-2 was detected in the Triton X-100-containing fraction (Fig.5A). However, after 3 days of culture, most of the labeled BMP-2 was instead detected in the guanidine hydrochloride fraction (Fig. 5B). The results suggest an increased association of BMP-2 to the extracellular matrix in the presence of MGP. Shortly after plating, the matrix is likely to remain immature and soluble in Triton X-100-containing buffers. With time, however, the matrix would be expected to mature and become less soluble in Triton X-100-containing buffers. Instead, it would require guanidine hydrochloride for solubilization. A large excess of MGP resulted in a trend for reduced binding of labeled BMP-2 (Fig. 5, A and B), possibly suggesting a limited number of sites for MGP-dependent association of BMP-2. To assess whether the results of the binding assays could be reproduced by cell-synthesized matrix alone, we removed the M2 cells after 3 days in culture using dilute alkali treatment and performed binding assays identical to those above. The results were similar to those in whole cells after 3 days of culture (Fig.6A), with most of the labeled BMP-2 being detected in the guanidine hydrochloride fraction. The BMP-2 content of the Triton X-100 fraction increased only slightly or not at all. Again, large excess resulted in reduced binding of labeled BMP-2 (Fig. 6A). For comparison, the binding assay was performed on plastic not previously used for cell culture. The results showed that labeled BMP-2 was found mostly in the guanidine hydrochloride-containing fraction, but decreased with increasing concentrations of MGP. This is consistent with previous observations that BMP-2 binds to plastic (14Massagué J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a binding with which MGP may interfere. Taken together, these results support that there is an increased matrix association of BMP-2 in the presence of MGP. In the previous experiments, an excess of MGP to BMP-2, greater than 10–12-fold, resulted in both a slight increase in osteoinduction (Fig. 3) and a decrease in whole cell and matrix binding of labeled BMP-2 (Figs. 5 and 6). To further clarify the effect of an excess of MGP above 15-fold on osteoinduction of BMP-2 in M2 cells, we used the 96-well plate assay described above. We prepared media containing either BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) alone, or in combination with MGP or MGP-FLAG at an excess of 20-fold or more. Interestingly, the results showed that induction of alkaline phosphatase continued to increase to levels significantly above that for BMP-2 alone (Fig.7A). In addition, immunoblotting showed an increase in phosphorylated (activated) Smad1, indicating an increased receptor activation (Fig. 7B). One possible explanation for this would be a large excess of MGP interfering with matrix association of MGP-BMP-2 complexes. However, osteoinduction appears to be enhanced to levels beyond what would be expected with liberated BMP-2, possibly by a mechanism not yet identified. MGP is a component of the extracellular matrix. Previous studies have shown a possible association of MGP with RGD-containing proteins (17Loeser R.F. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9459-9462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its low solubility in water-based buffers may be because of a self-aggregation of MGP monomers reminiscent of that in organized bone matrix (1Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many cells in culture express MGP that has been suggested to aid in the attachment of cells to plastic (17Loeser R.F. Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9459-9462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that exogenous MGP added to the cells would associate with endogenous MGP. We used immunocytochemistry to visualize the amount of endogenous MGP in M2 cells after 1 or 3 days in culture. The results showed that within 24 h of plating MGP was primarily intracellular, and the nuclei were well visualized (Fig.8A). However, after 3 days, MGP accumulated extracellularly and became part of a sheet of matrix covering the cells (Fig. 8B). This parallels the increase of BMP-2 associated with matrix components in the presence of exogenous MGP, seen after 3 days in culture. MGP is a small matrix protein, initially isolated from bone and characterized by Price and Williamson (1Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known how MGP is bound or incorporated into the extracellular matrix; however, high levels of MGP in nonmineralized cartilage indicates that MGP does not require hydroxyapatite as an anchor (1Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Otawara Y. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10828-10832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a low content of hydrophobic amino acids (1Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MGP has low solubility in water-based buffers, possibly reflecting a specific aggregation of monomers reminiscent of the structure in organized bone or cartilage matrix. This study provides evidence that MGP is a regulatory protein for BMP-2. MGP has a dose-dependent effect on BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation in M2 cells. Low relative levels of MGP to BMP-2 (less than 1-fold) result in mild enhancement of BMP-2 activity. Intermediate levels (∼1–15-fold) result in inhibition, and high levels (above 15-fold) result in strong enhancement of BMP-2 activity. Immunoprecipitation results demonstrating co-precipitation of BMP-2 with MGP suggest that the modulating effect involves direct binding of MGP to BMP-2. This is consistent with earlier studies that showed BMP-2 to be tightly associated with MGP during protein purification (7Urist M.R. Huo Y.K. Brownell A.G. Hohl W.M. Buyske J. Lietze A. Tempst P. Hunkapiller M. DeLange R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 8Price P.A. Urist M.R. Otawara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and to bind to membrane-fixed MGP in ligand-blotting experiments (9Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D.C. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is not clear from our experiments whether BMP-2 can still exert an effect when bound to MGP. The promoting effect of low levels of MGP on BMP-2 activity may be similar to the facilitating effect of betaglycan on TGF-β receptor binding (20Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Binding of BMP-2 to its receptor, as well as Smad1 activation, is decreased in the presence of intermediate levels of MPG, consistent with the inhibitory effect on osteoinduction in M2 cells. However, overall binding of BMP-2 to whole cells or matrix is increased and inversely correlated with the inhibitory effect. This suggests that MGP promotes association of BMP-2 to the extracellular matrix. When the levels of MGP exceeded 12–15-fold relative to BMP-2, there was a trend to increased osteoinduction in the alkaline phosphatase assay and to decreased binding of BMP-2 to whole cells and matrix. In the experiments designed to study large excesses of MGP (20–80-fold) relative to BMP-2, we found a strong enhancement of the osteoinductive effect of BMP-2 and a corresponding activation of Smad1. One possible explanation for this phenomenon may be saturation of association sites. However, the level of osteoinduction far exceeds the one by BMP-2 alone, suggesting an additional mechanism not yet identified. The variable effect of MGP, depending on its ratio to BMP-2, may explain the apparently contradictory observations in vascular calcification. On one hand, MGP knockout mice develop profound vascular calcification (2Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar), whereas on the other hand, calcifying atherosclerotic lesions show an increased expression of MGP (19Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R.B. Metcalfe J.C. Weissberg P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In the MGP knockout mouse, decreased control of BMP-2 may explain the effects of MGP-deficiency in the artery wall and also in the growth plate. In the developing aorta, BMP-2 is strongly expressed in the primitive endothelium as SMC precursor cells are recruited to form the media (21Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). It is possible that MGP, which is expressed throughout the embryonic aorta, interferes with BMP-2 at a certain stage inhibiting osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of precursor cells. In the growth plate, both MGP and BMP-2 have distinct patterns of expression (22Luo G. D'Souza R. Hogue D. Karsenty G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Yazaki Y. Matsunaga S. Onishi T. Nagamine T. Orihuchi N. Yamamoto T. Ishidou Y. Imamura T. Sakou T. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2339-2344PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in this pattern may contribute to the lack of hypertrophic chondrocytes seen in MGP knockout mice (2Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Both BMP-2 and MGP are expressed at increased levels in calcified atherosclerotic vessels (19Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R.B. Metcalfe J.C. Weissberg P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 24Boström K. Watson K.E. Horn S. Wortham C. Herman I.M. Demer L.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), BMP-2 as a possible promoter and MGP as a possible inhibitor of calcification. However, interactions between the two proteins may also be important in determining vascular cell differentiation and calcification. Our results are consistent with the previous observations that both BMP-2 and MGP are present in bone matrix and are closely associated during protein purification (7Urist M.R. Huo Y.K. Brownell A.G. Hohl W.M. Buyske J. Lietze A. Tempst P. Hunkapiller M. DeLange R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 8Price P.A. Urist M.R. Otawara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that BMP-2 is liberated from matrix in areas of bone fracture (25Kaplan F.S. Shore E.M. Bone. 1996; 19: 13S-21SCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), supporting healing and new bone formation in the fracture area. Interestingly, osteoblasts in nonhealing fractures were positive for MGP expression, whereas osteoblasts in normally healing fractures were not (26Lawton D.M. Andrew J.G. Marsh D.R. Hoyland A. Freemont A.J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 52: 92-96Google Scholar). It is possible that MGP interferes with BMP-induced bone formation. Several BMP-binding proteins have previously been identified, including Noggin (12De Zimmerman L.B. Jesús-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), Chordin (27Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M.

The majority have been identified as BMP-4 antagonists and play crucial roles in the development of Xenopus and mice. In addition, type IIA procollagen containing the cysteine-rich NH2-propeptide, deposited in extracellular matrix of prechondrogenic tissue, has been shown to bind BMP-2 and the related growth factor TGF-β1 (31Zhu Y. Oganesian A. Keene D.R. Sandell L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Matrix binding of BMP may be a relatively common way to limit the activity of BMP-2 to critical time periods in development or healing. In summary, our results demonstrate that MGP may act as a regulator of BMP-2. Its effect is dose-dependent and appears to involve direct binding between the proteins as well as a matrix association.

Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar) has shown that ER Ca2+ release has immediate effects on mitochondrial function. Close contacts exist between mitochondria and the sites of ER Ca2+ release, such that ER Ca2+ release leads to rapid Ca2+accumulation in mitochondria (32Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S.

However, one group has shown that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake promotes cytochrome crelease in cells exposed to the proapoptotic agent, staurosporine (34Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar,35Pacher P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4107-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Given previous work implicating BCL-2 in the control of ER Ca2+ homeostasis, we wondered whether or not proapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family might exert their effects through modulation of intracellular Ca2+ stores.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWith the observations outlined above in mind, we hypothesized that Bak and Bax-mediated emptying of the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ pool might trigger mitochondrial Ca2+uptake and subsequent cytochrome c release. To investigate this possibility, we overexpressed Bax or Bak in human PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells with adenoviral vectors Ad-Bak and Ad-Bax. We decided on this approach, because it allowed us to study the effects of Bak and Bax in isolation. In addition, we designed our experiments to reproduce the kinds of increases in protein expression (2–4-fold) observed in cells exposed to more conventional proapoptotic stimuli (i.e. DNA-damaging agents) (39Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 40Kitada S. Krajewski S. Miyashita T. Krajewska M. Reed J.C.

Transduction of the PC-3 cells resulted in detectable increases in Bak or Bax by 10–12 h (Fig. 1). Protein expression was followed closely by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and DNA fragmentation both by 12 h (Fig. 1), consistent with previous results (36Pataer A. Fang B. Yu R. Kagawa S. Hunt K.K. McDonnell T.J. Roth J.A. Swisher S.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 788-792PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kagawa S. Gu J. Swisher S.G. Ji L. Roth J.A. Lai D. Stephens L.C. Fang B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1157-1161PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Bax and Bak accumulated within mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, we characterized their subcellular localizations by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using antibodies specific to Bax, Bak in conjunction with mitochondrial (MitoTracker), or endoplasmic reticular (antibody to GRP-78/BIP) probes. The results confirmed that both proteins traffic to both organelles, although some diffuse cytosolic staining was also detected (Fig. 2).Figure 2Bak and Bax localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. PC-3 cells were infected with Ad-Bax or Ad-Bak as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 12 h, cells were stained for each polypeptide using phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibodies (red) and counterstained with either MitoTracker Green or an antibody to the ER-specific protein GRP-78/BIP with an Alexa 594-conjugated (green) secondary antibody, and fluorochromes were detected by confocal microscopy (×60 objective).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next determined the effects of Bak or Bax expression on ER Ca2+ pool content. Substantial reductions (>50%) in ER Ca2+ levels were detected as early as 10 h after transduction with Ad-Bax or Ad-Bak, whereas infection with a control vector Ad-β-galactosidase had no effect (Fig.3, A and B). Bax and Bak were not expressed until 10 h, and [Ca2+]ER calcium was not detectable after 12 h. Therefore, even though [Ca2+]ERwas significantly depleted in cells treated with Ad-Bax or Ad-Bak compared with controls at 10 h, there were still measurable amounts of Ca2+ within the ER at this time point that were equal to or greater than the concentration of Ca2+ within the mitochondria. The loss of ER Ca2+ induced by Bax (data not shown) or Bak was unaffected by pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor ZVADfmk (Fig.3 C) but was prevented by the overexpression of BCL-2 in PC-3 transfectants (Bcl-2.9) (Fig. 3 D). The overexpression of BCL-2 also blocked the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and delayed DNA fragmentation (Fig.4).Figure 3Adenoviral Bak depletes endoplasmic reticular calcium [Ca2+]ER.[Ca2+]ER was quantitated at the single cell level by choosing at random 10–20 cells within the field.

Therefore, we assessed the effects of Bak and Bax on mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations in cells loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye, Rhod-2. The expression of either protein induced a significant increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, although Bax produced significantly more Ca2+ uptake than Bak (p < 0.01) (Fig.5 A). The increases in mitochondrial calcium levels were almost completely suppressed in cells pretreated with a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+uptake (RU-360) (43Matlib M.A. Zhou Z. Knight S.

In contrast, mitochondrial Ca2+ levels were unchanged following infection with the control vector Ad-β-galactosidase or in the BCL-2 transfectants infected with Ad-Bax or Ad-Bak (Fig. 5 B). Importantly, RU-360-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake attenuated the cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation induced by Ad-Bax or Ad-Bak (Fig. 5, C and D), demonstrating that cytochrome c release occurred via a Ca2+-sensitive mechanism.Figure 5Effects of Ad-Bax or Ad-Bak on mitochondrial Ca2+.

Sagara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin does induce apoptosis in a variety of different cell types, but a significant lag period is invariably observed between thapsigargin-induced emptying of ER Ca2+ pool and the first biochemical end points of apoptosis (12Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar). To test whether direct effects of Bax and/or Bak on mitochondria might sensitize them to cytochrome crelease induced by emptying of ER pool, we measured cytochromec release in cells that had been pretreated with Ad-Bax or Ad-Bak for 10 h. At this time point, Bax and Bak protein accumulation was readily detected, but ER Ca2+ release was submaximal and cytochrome c release had not yet occurred. Cytochrome c release was not observed in untreated cells or in cells infected with Ad-β-galactosidase (Fig. 5 E). Strikingly, however, exposure to Ad-Bax- or Ad-Bak-sensitized mitochondria to Ca2+ induced cytochrome crelease, such that the release was induced by thapsigargin within 5 min (Fig. 5 E). Together with the results presented above, the data demonstrate that Bax and Bak regulate Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release by promoting the release of Ca2+ from the ER pool and by sensitizing mitochondria to the effects of this release. Although not absolutely required for cytochrome c release, ER Ca2+ release appears to augment the kinetics of cytochrome c release. The regulation of SMAC/Diablo and other proteins may further refine this process, which was set up initially by ER Ca2+ release from the multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bak and Bax.The release of protein factors from mitochondria plays a central role in cellular commitment to apoptosis, but the biochemical mechanisms controlling the release remain obscure. A growing consensus suggests that proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family are involved. The results of this study support this conclusion and identify one candidate mechanism for their effects. Specifically, our data demonstrate that two proapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family, Bak and Bax, promote early emptying of the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ pool and subsequent accumulation of Ca2+within the mitochondria. These effects are blocked by the overexpression of BCL-2 but are not dependent upon caspase activation. Importantly, a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+uptake attenuated the cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation induced by either protein, providing direct evidence for a causal role for Ca2+ uptake in apoptosis. Furthermore, cells overexpressing Bax or Bak were sensitized to cytochromec release induced by thapsigargin, a compound that directly stimulates direct and complete emptying of ER Ca2+ pool through the inhibition of the ER Ca2+ ATPase. Together, our data indicate that Bax and Bak simultaneously promote alterations in intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization and sensitize mitochondria to cytochrome c release induced by these alterations. A role for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in promoting cytochrome c release is consistent with other recent studies. For example, Hajnoczky and co-workers (34Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 35Pacher P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4107-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) showed that staurosporine sensitized mitochondria to cytochrome crelease induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced emptying of the ER Ca2+ pool, and independent work by Gogvadze and colleagues (48Gogvadze V. Robertson J.D. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 19066-19071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (187) Google Scholar) demonstrates that Bax promotes Ca2+-mediated cytochrome c release in isolated liver mitochondria.Although BCL-2 did not affect steady-state levels of Ca2+in the ER or mitochondria, it did inhibit the effects of Bax and Bak on ER Ca2+ release and subsequent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. These observations suggest that BCL-2 acts primarily to antagonize the effects of Bax and Bak in our cells and does not exert direct effects of its own. However, it should be stressed that other laboratories have reported different effects of BCL-2 on intracellular Ca2+ pools (16Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 19Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C. Kelley W.L. Tschopp J. Lew D.P. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Proc.

For example, at least three groups have shown that BCL-2 lowers the steady-state level of Ca2+ within the ER, which they argued inhibits apoptosis by reducing Ca2+ efflux across the ER membrane (16Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 19Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C.

Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In contrast, another group (50Kuo T.H. Kim H.R. Zhu L. Yu Y. Lin H.M. Tsang W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) showed that the overexpression of BCL-2 increased steady-state levels of ER Ca2+. On the other hand, Murphy et al. (18Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) concurred that BCL-2 had no significant effect on steady-state Ca2+ levels in their cells, but they found that BCL-2 potentiated Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria, an observation that stands in opposition to our results. Although we cannot explain these contrasting findings at present, they are probably related to the use of different cellular model systems. Hematopoietic cells and excitable cells (neurons) are likely to regulate intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization very differently from epithelial cells. Other groups (51Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar) have argued that BCL-2 is capable of interacting with a variety of different proteins, some of which are involved in Ca2+-associated signal transduction (i.e. the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin). It is conceivable that cellular context dictates precisely how BCL-2 will influence intracellular Ca2+ pools. Importantly, the connection between ER Ca2+ pool emptying and apoptosis is not disputed.Although our studies establish a role for Bax and Bak in regulating ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes, they do not directly identify the proximal mechanism(s) involved. Most of the available information on the biochemical mechanisms underlying the actions of BCL-2 family members has come from studies describing their effects on mitochondria and planar lipid bilayers. Specifically, proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the family appear to bind to and regulate components of the permeability transition pore (9Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M.

In addition, a caspase-processed form of the BH3-only family member, Bid (tBID), can promote oligomerization of Bax or Bak to form transmembrane channels capable of directly allowing for passage of cytochromec into the cytoplasm (53Wei M.C.

However, because the treatment of Alzheimer's disease will be a long term therapy, a β-secretase inhibitor has to be very selective. Aspartic proteases are widely distributed in the body. BACE2, for instance, is found at low levels in most peripheral organs (13Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Loeloff R. Louis J.C. Curran E. Citron M. Vassar R. J. Biol.

Here we describe the enzymatic properties of BACE in comparison with its homologue, BACE2, and other relevant mammalian aspartic proteases, namely pepsin, cathepsin D, cathepsin E, napsin A and renin. cDNAs encoding the aspartyl proteases BACE and BACE2 were modified by PCR in the 5′ non-coding region to optimize ribosomal recognition and at the 3′ end by adding sequences encoding 6×His residues to enable rapid purification of the recombinant proteins. Expression in Sf9 insect cells via recombinant baculovirus resulted in higher yields than expression in Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, or HEK293 cells. Thus the cDNAs were cloned into the pFASTBAC1 vector (Invitrogen) as BamHI × XbaI fragments for expression in insect cells and the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. After recombination into the baculovirus genome, the purified viral DNA was transformed into the insect cells. Sf9 cells were cultured at 27 °C in TC100 medium (BioWhittaker) with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Virus stocks were generated with a titer of 1.5 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml. For large scale production of BACE and BACE2, 24-liter fermenters of Sf9 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 1. The first step in purification of BACE ectodomain is immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody (BSC-1) generated in-house by Dr. M. Brockhaus. The antibody was generated by standard methods from a mouse immunized with BACE purified from E. coli. The specificity of BSC-1 (IgG1) was established by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot assays. Thus 5 liters of cell-free Sf9 fermentation broth was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration and loaded directly onto a 1.6 × 4-cm BSC-1-Sepharose immunoaffinity column that had been equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mmNaCl. The column was washed with several column volumes each of 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl then 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 500 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0. Fractions containing BACE were pooled, neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. This material was passed over a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) that had been previously equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. BACE, which is obtained in the column flow-through, was subsequently concentrated by ultrafiltration and chromatographed on a Superdex 200 HR 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl. The purified BACE was stored at 4 °C. 50 g (wet weight) of Sf9 cells was suspended in 750 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 2% Triton X-100 and homogenized with a hand-held glass homogenizer. The homogenate was stirred on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 8.0 and loaded on a 2.6 × 2.5-cm Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Qiagen, Germany) that had been equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0. The column was subsequently washed with this buffer and then with 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was then eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 column volumes). Pooled fractions containing full-length BACE were passed over a 5-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and the unbound material was collected. This material was then diluted 10-fold into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton, and re-loaded onto a second 5-ml HiTrap Q column that had been equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed in this buffer and eluted with a gradient of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (20 column volumes). Fractions containing BACE were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 and loaded on a Mono S HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The unbound material, containing BACE, was pooled and stored at 4 °C. 50 g (wet weight) of Sf9 cells were washed with 10 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in 750 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 1.5% dodecyl β-d-maltoside and homogenized with a hand-held glass homogenizer. The homogenate was stirred on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 8.0, and imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The extract was then loaded on a 2.6 × 2.5-cm Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0. The column was subsequently washed with this buffer and then with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was then eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 column volumes). BACE2-containing fractions were dialyzed against 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 25 mm NaCl and further purified by affinity chromatography on P10-P4′ StatVal-Sepharose, as described by Sinha et al.

Saquinavir (Ro 31-8959) and Remikiren (Ro 42-5892) were taken from the Roche bulk products, and pepstatin was purchased from Fluka. Peptides were synthesized on TentaGel S-Rinkamide resin (0.25 mmol/g, Rapp Polymer, Tübingen) following a standard procedure consisting of the repetition of the following steps: 1) deprotection with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA); 2) washing with DMA, isopropyl alcohol, and DMA; 3) coupling with fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected amino acid usingN-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridino-1-yl-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide (HATU) and diisopropylethylamine in N-methylpyrrolidone. Double coupling of the Fmoc-protected amino acid was performed by usingO-(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-1-pyridyl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) and diisopropylethylamine inN-methylpyrrolidone. Boc-Lys(dabsyl)-OH (where Boc istert-butoxycarbonyl) was prepared by the reaction of Boc-Lys-OH with dabsyl chloride. Fmoc-Glu-Lucifer Yellow was obtained by condensation of the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of Fmoc-Glu-(OtBu)-OH (where tBu istert-butyl) with Lucifer Yellow and subsequent treatment with trifluoroacetic acid; 4) same washing as step 2. After the last cycle, the resins were treated with trifluoroacetic acid/H2O 95:5. Crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a Nucleosil-C18 column (7 μm, 10 × 250 mm, Machery Nagel, gradient of H2O and acetonitrile). Identity and purity of the peptides were analyzed by HPLC and electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (using a PE SCIEX, model API-100 liquid chromatograph). All enzyme assays were performed at 20 °C on a FLUOstar (BMG Lab Technologies, D-77656 Offenburg) using 96-well microtiter plates (DYNEX Microfluor 2, Chantilly, VA). The assay volume was 100 μl. Typically, inhibitors dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide were added into a well followed by buffer and enzyme. The dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was kept below 4%. The enzymatic reaction was started by adding the substrate. pH and buffer conditions under which the experiments were carried out are indicated in the figure and table legends. The progression of the fluorescence increase was measured at λemission = 520 nm with fluorescence excitation at λexcitation = 430 nm. Reaction kinetics were followed periodically for 30 min at various substrate concentrations. The detected signals were converted into moles of substrate hydrolyzed per second. Kinetic data were determined graphically from Lineweaver-Burk plots. It should be noted that data obtained by varying substrate concentrations had to be corrected for the effect of excess quenching capacity, which is typical of all the FRET substrates used here. Assays were performed at enzyme concentrations that warranted a linear progression of product formation. The samples were dried in a Speed-Vac and then dissolved in 110 μl of 50% formic acid. 100 μl were subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a AL12S05 column (5 μm, 5 × 100 mm, YMC, gradient of 1% formic acid and acetonitrile). Peak fractions were collected and dried again in a Speed-Vac. The peptide fragments were analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (using a PE SCIEX, model API-100LC). The FRET substrate combinatorial libraries were synthesized on PEGA1900(copolymer of polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 1900 and acrylamide) resin via split synthesis after standard Fmoc chemistry using HATU as the condensing reagent. Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Glu-Lucifer Yellow, and all Fmoc-protected amino acids were coupled to the amino PEGA1900 resin using HATU in the presence of diisopropylethylamine in N-methylpyrrolidone. Double coupling was performed usingO-(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-1-pyridyl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine inN-methylpyrrolidone. The synthesis was performed on a semi-automated shaking-vessel machine. For variable positions in the peptide sequences the resin was transferred in a Manual Multiple/Library Synthesizer (MULTIBLOCK®) and split into 19 portions. A different and single Fmoc-protected amino acid (except Fmoc-Cys-OH) was coupled to each of the 19 portions. Then the portions were mixed together and washed thoroughly. Depending on the library the splitting was either repeated or synthesis proceeded in a single portion. The last building block wastert-butoxycarbonyl-Lys(dabsyl)-OH. The protecting groups were removed with trifluoroacetic acid:H2O:TIS 95:3:2 for 2 h. A part (∼2000 beads) of the peptide library (either Lys(dabsyl)-SEVXXDAEFR-Glu(Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow or Lys(dabsyl)-SEVXLXAEFR-Glu(Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow) was extensively washed with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Then 80 μl of the purified enzyme (ectodomain) was added to the resin in a final volume of 0.8 ml in the reaction buffer. After shaking for 18 h at room temperature, the resin was filtered off, and the beads were washed with the incubation buffer and 100 mm MES buffer, pH 4.8, containing 5% glycerol and 0.05% Triton X-100. The beads were inspected under the fluorescence microscope (Leica MZ12 equipped with Leica 2 video system). Brightly fluorescent beads were isolated and submitted to Edman sequencing. The sequencing was performed on a PE Biosystems Procise 494 HT Sequencer. Portions of 200–400 beads of the six libraries, Lys(dabsyl)-SEXNLDAEFR-Glu(Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow, Lys(dabsyl)-SEVXLDAEFR-Glu(Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow, Lys(dabsyl)-SEVNXDAEFR-Glu (Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow, Lys(dabsyl)-SEVNLXAEFR-Glu(Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow, Lys(dabsyl)-SEVNLDXEFR-Glu(Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow, and Lys(dabsyl)-SEVNLDAXFR-Glu(Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow, were extensively washed and incubated in a volume of 0.1 ml as described above. Then the beads were washed with the incubation buffer and 100 mm MES buffer, pH 4.8, containing 5% glycerol and 0.05% Triton X-100. Each portion of beads was inspected separately, and the exact number of total beads as well as brightly fluorescent beads was counted. Fluorescent beads were submitted to sequencing. Full-length BACE, BACE ectodomain, and full-length BACE2 constructs were made containing a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag to facilitate purification. The purification process was monitored by Western blotting using an anti-6×His antibody. The presence of enzymatically active β-secretase was checked by a mass spectrometry assay (17Grüninger-Leitch F. Berndt P. Langen H. Nelboeck P. Döbeli H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the enzymatic purity (=absence of contaminating proteases) was determined by a FRET assay using four homologous substrates. The main criteria for purity were the absence of activity with the KL-V and VL-M substrates and presence of activity with the KM-D and NL-D substrates. A further criterion was the preferential cleavage of NL-D over KM-D (see Table I).Table ISoluble substrates and relative activity with BACESubstrateSequenceSubstrate typeCleavage by BACE% of best substrateNL-DSEVNLDAEFRSwedish mutant APP β-cleavage site100EL-DSEVELDAEFRModified APP β-cleavage site87DA-AVVEVDAAVTPArtifical cleavage site at APP carboxyl terminus24NL-ASEVNLAAEFRModified APP β-cleavage site16EF-ASEVEFAAEFRModified APP β-cleavage site15KM-DSEVKMDAEFRWild-type APP β-cleavage site9GY-EHDSGYEVHHQAlternative APP β-cleavage site8EF-DSEVEFDAEFRModified APP β-cleavage site2P4KSKVNLDAEFRModified APP β-cleavage site2VL-MTSVLMAAPCathepsin D substrate (octametric peptide)2KL-VVHHQKLVFFAAPP α-secretase cleavage site1HL-VIHPFHLVIHNRenin substrate0The substrates are listed in the order of cleavage efficiency by BACE.

Sf9 cells clearly contain a furin-like protease that is potentially capable of processing the ectodomain since the full-length enzyme is correctly processed in this system. It may be that the soluble ectodomain does not come into extended contact with the furin-like convertase if this protein is, in analogy to furin, membrane-bound. It may also be the case, however, that the very high expression level of BACE ectodomain completely saturates the convertase. The proenzyme as purified here shows almost identical catalytic activity to the mature enzyme, a phenomenon already documented by others, implying that BACE is not a true zymogen (20Creemers J.W. Dominguez D.I. Plets E. Serneels L. Taylor N.A. Multhaup G. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol.

Ruf, unpublished data. BACE2 was not purified to homogeneity but was shown to be almost free of other contaminating protease activities by analysis with a series of aspartic protease substrates (Fig. 3). The FRET assay was based on dodecameric peptides containing 10 amino acids of the putative substrate and a linker amino acid at each end. The linker amino acids, lysine at the amino terminus and glutamine at the carboxyl terminus, are used to couple the fluorescent group Lucifer Yellow and the quenching group dabsyl to the substrate (Fig.2). Because the quenching group is coupled via the ε-amino group of lysine, the peptide can still be analyzed by Edman degradation. The substrates were either used as soluble enti"

These enzymes are related to ADAMs as judged from sequence homology and conserved domains such as a characteristic metalloprotease domain and a disintegrin-like module. However, they differ from ADAMs by their domain organization and the presence of distinct features. The most specific hallmark is the presence of a central thrombospondin type I repeat (TSPI) between the disintegrin-like module and the Cys-rich domain.

Human Ehlers-Danlos type VIIC (dermatosparactic-type, OMIM 225410) and animal dermatosparaxis are recessively inherited disorders that are caused by mutations preventing the synthesis of active ADAMTS-2 (11Colige A. Sieron A.L., Li, S.-W. Schwarze U. Petty E. Wertelecki W. Wilcox W. Krakow D. Cohn D.H. Reardon W. Byers P.H. Lapière C.M. Prockop D.J. Nusgens B.V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 63: 308-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As a consequence, pN-I collagen (type I collagen that still contains the N- but not the C-propeptide) accumulates (12Nusgens B.V. Verellen-Dumoulin G. Hermans-Le T., De Paepe A. Nuytinck L. Piérard G.E. Lapière C.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), resulting in the polymerization of abnormal collagen fibers that appear irregular, thin, branched and “hieroglyphic” in cross-section (13Piérard G.E. Lapière C.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1976; 66: 2-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The main clinical feature of human patients and affected animals is a severe cutaneous fragility. A similar phenotype has been recently reported in transgenic mice with inactive alleles forAdamts2 (14Li S.-W. Arita M. Fertala A. Bao Y. Kopen G.C. Långsjö T.K. Hyttinen M.M. Helminen H.D. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other type I collagen-rich tissues, such as bone and tendon, do not seem to be functionally affected. Furthermore, a significant proportion of type I collagen extracted from skin biopsies of Ehlers-Danlos type VIIC (EDSVIIC) patients or from dermatosparactic calves is NH2-terminal processed, at a site that remained to be determined, although no active ADAMTS-2 is synthesized (11Colige A. Sieron A.L., Li, S.-W. Schwarze U. Petty E. Wertelecki W. Wilcox W. Krakow D. Cohn D.H. Reardon W. Byers P.H. Lapière C.M. Prockop D.J. Nusgens B.V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 63: 308-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These observations and the fact that processing of aminopropeptide is a complex event requiring a specific three-dimensional native conformation (15Prockop D.J. Sieron A.L. Li S.-W. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) suggested that an enzyme closely related to ADAMTS-2 would be responsible for this alternative aminoprocollagen peptidase activity. In this study, the specificity of the processing of the aminopropeptide of type I collagen in absence of ADAMTS-2 is demonstrated for the first time. The cloning of the cDNA and characterization of human and mouse ADAMTS-14, a novel ADAMTS with striking homologies with ADAMTS-2 and -3, are also reported. Finally, the aminoprocollagen peptidase activity of the recombinant enzyme, the structure of the gene, and the regulation of its expression are described. For evaluating the level of aminoprocollagen I (pNPI) processing inAdamts2 −/− mice (14Li S.-W. Arita M. Fertala A. Bao Y. Kopen G.C. Långsjö T.K. Hyttinen M.M. Helminen H.D. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), various organs and tissues were ground at liquid nitrogen temperature and extracted with 0.1 m acetic acid for 18 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were neutralized and ammonium sulfate was added (40% saturation). After centrifugation (8000 ×g, 30 min), the pellets were washed in an ammonium sulfate solution (20% saturation) and finally dissolved in 0.1 macetic acid. After precipitation at 33% ethanol (final concentration) at neutral pH, the pellets containing collagen were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer. Similar amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The cleavage site of aminoprocollagen I in the absence ofAdamts-2 activity was determined on dermatosparactic calf tendon. Collagen was purified from 1 m NaCl extracts by sequential steps of precipitation and solubilization as described earlier (16Lapière C.M. Nusgens B.V. Piérard G.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1977; 5: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The collagen preparation was then treated or not with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase before electrophoresis on a pre-run 7.5% acrylamide/piperazine diacrylamide gel in 50 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 mmthioglycolic acid. After transfer on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (in 200 mm Tris borate, pH 9.5) and Coomassie Blue staining, α1I and α2I bands were collected and submitted to 6 cycles of Edman degradation amino acid sequencing. Three large overlapping cDNA fragments covering theADAMTS14 cDNA sequence that corresponds to exons 2 to 22 of ADAMTS2 were PCR- amplified from fibroblasts cDNA (37 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 90 s) using Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and three ADAMTS14 primer pairs (5′-CTATGGTGTGACAGTGCCCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GACGCTGCCCAGGCTGGTCTCA-3′; 5′-GGCATGTGTCACCCCCTGAGGA-3′ and 5′-TCCTTGTCACAGCCGACAGGCACA-3′; 5′-GACGTGGTGTTCATGAACCAGGT-3′ and 5′-GCCAGTGGGATGGCAGGGCACA-3′). PCR products were then gel purified and sequenced using the manufacturers recommended protocols (Thermo-sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit, Amersham Biosciences Inc.). To amplify mouseAdamts14 cDNA, various human primer pairs were used. PCR conditions were: 2 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 20 s, 66 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products amplified by 5′-CTATGGTGTGACAGTGCCCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GACGCTGCCCAGGCTGGTCTCA-3′ or 5′-AGCCTGGCCTACAAGTACGTCAT-3′ and 5′- CTCTTCTTGTGGTCACACAGGTGT-3′ pairs were sequenced. The determination of partial mouse sequences allowed the design a mouse-specific primer pair that was used to amplify and sequence the central part of the murine cDNA. For tissue distribution analysis, total RNA was purified from various normal mouse tissues (17Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Duplicate samples from 3 dilutions of RNA from each tissue (10, 2, and 0.4 ng) were used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR amplification. The 5′-end of ADAMTS14 mRNA was amplified using the FirstChoiceTM RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion) using the manufacturers recommended protocols. Briefly, mRNA from cultured fibroblasts was dephosphorylated and then treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the cap structure from full-length mRNA, leaving a 5′-monophosphate. A RNA adapter was then ligated to the decapped phosphorylated mRNA. After reverse transcription (BcaBestTM RNA PCR kit, Takara), the 5′-end of theADAMTS14 cDNA was amplified using the sense “Outer Adapter primer” from the kit and the ADAMTS145′-CCAGACACCACGTGGGAGAGGAA-3′ antisense primer (30 cycles; 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min). One microliter of the outer amplification product was then re-amplified using the nested sense “Inner Adapter primer” and the 5′-CGTCCCCGAAAGTCTGTGCTGCA antisense primer (25 cycles; 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min). Resulting PCR products were then sequenced as described above. PCR amplified products generated from the 5′- or 3′-end of the ADAMTS14 cDNA (corresponding to amino acids 153–471 and 824–1078, respectively) were cloned using pCR4-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers protocols. Antisense labeled riboprobes were synthesized from 500 ng of linearized plasmid (SpeI restriction site) using T7 RNA polymerase (Strip-EZTM RNA kit, Ambion) and [32P]UTP (ICN). Messenger RNA purified from human skin fibroblasts in culture (PolyATtractTM mRNA Isolation System III, Promega) was separated by electrophoresis on a 0.9% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred and fixed to a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) by UV irradiation. The filters were then sequentially prehybridized for 1 h (at 65 °C in 0.2m NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS, 20% formamide), hybridized with labeled probes for 18 h (same conditions as for prehybridization) and washed 3 times (at 65 °C in 40 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) before autoradiographic exposure. The determination of mRNA level by RT-PCR amplification requires the use of an internal standard allowing to monitor the efficiency of each step of the procedure in each sample. The construction of synthetic RNA standards that are used as controls for RT-PCR quantification of various mRNAs is described elsewhere (18Lambert C.A. Colige A. Lapière C.M. Nusgens B.V. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, we designed and generated synthetic RNAs that have two main characteristics. First, they can be RT-PCR amplified by using the same primer pairs used for RT-PCR amplification of the cellular mRNAs. Second, their amplification products are larger or smaller than those obtained from the cellular mRNAs, enabling their discrimination by electrophoresis when co-amplified in the same tube. Semi-quantification was obtained by calculating, for each sample, the ratio between the level of the product generated from the endogenous mRNA and from a defined copy number of the standard synthetic RNA. RT-PCR reactions were performed, in a 25-μl reaction mixture, in an automated thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 2400 or 9600, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT) using the GeneAmp Thermostable rTth Reverse Transcriptase RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 ng of total RNA, a known copy number of internal standard RNA, when available, and specific pairs of primers (5 pmol each). The various primer pairs allowed the amplification of human (5′-AGCCTGGCCTACAAGTACGTCAT-3′/5′-CTCTTCTTGTGGTCACACAGGTGT-3′) or mouse (5′-AGCCTGGCCTACAAGTACGTCAT-3′/5′-CTCCTCCACAGGCCTTGCTGCA-3′)ADAMTS14 mRNA, human MMP1 mRNA (5′-GAGCAAACACATCTGAGGTACAGGA-3′/5′- TTGTCCCGATGATCTCCCCTGACA-3′) and human (5′-GAACCATGAGGACGGCTTCTCCT-3′/5′-GGCTGCAGCGGGACCAGTGGAA-3′) or mouse (5′-CAGGCGCACACATAGTACCATCCA-3′/5′-CAGCCGCTACCTGCATTCCTATGA-3′)ADAMTS2 mRNA. The RT step (70 °C for 15 s) was followed by denaturation of RNA/DNA duplexes (95 °C for 2 min) and by PCR amplification (adequate number of cycles consisting of 94 °C for 15 s, 66 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 10 s). RT-PCR products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed (Fluor-S-MultiImager, Bio-Rad) after staining (Gelstar, FMC BioProducts). Human dermal fibroblasts, at passages 4 to 12, were plated at a density of 8 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for 1 or 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). The medium, supplemented with 10% dialyzed and decomplemented FCS, contained or not 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (10 ng/ml), IL-1β (100 units/ml), tumor necrosis factor-α (5 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), or transforming growth factor-β (5 ng/ml). Total RNA was purified using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Fragments of skin and tendon from wild type and Adamts2 −/− mice were fixed for 60 min at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 Sörensen's buffer (pH 7.4), postfixed for 30 min in 0.1% osmium tetroxide in Sörensen's buffer, dehydrated in a series of ethanol concentrations and embedded in epoxy resin (Epon 812, Fluka). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before being examined using a Jeol electron microscope CX100 II at 60 kV. An expression vector containing the entire coding sequence of ADAMTS14 transcript A (see “Results” section) and part of the 5′-untranslated region was constructed. Briefly, 3 PCR products were amplified (Pfu TurboTM DNA polymerase, Stratagene) using cDNA from human skin fibroblasts in culture and three different pairs of primers (1, 5′-CACACACAGCGGCCGCTTGCCCAGCCCGCGTCCCA-3′ and 5′- TGAAGAATTCGGTGCTGTCTGTGCGGATGA-3′; 2, 5′-CACAGAATTCTTCATTGAGCCTCTGGAGC-3′ and 5′-CACAAAGCTTGAGAGCTCCTGCCTGCTT-3′; 3, 5′-CACAAAGCTTGTGCAGATCCCAGCAGGTGCCA-3′ and 5′- CTCTTCTAGATTAGCTAGCTGTCACCGGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′). By digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes (1, NotI/EcoRI; 2, EcoRI/HindIII; 3,HindIII/NheI) and ligation of the PCR products, a cDNA fragment covering the entire coding sequence was created in a pCDNA4 vector (Invitrogen). A sequence verified full-length insert was then cloned in the NotI/NheI sites of a pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen) containing a modified multiple cloning site and an additional sequence coding for a “Flag” (DYKDDDDK) at the COOH terminus of the expressed recombinant protein. This ADAMTS-14 expression vector, a similarly constructed ADAMTS-2 vector 2A. Colige, C. M. Lapière, and B. V. Nusgens, manuscript in preparation. and the modified empty pCEP4 vector were then used for transfection of 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) by electroporation (20 μg of plasmid; 220 V and 960 μF in 4-mm cuvettes). Stably transfected cells were then selected in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. For evaluating the production of recombinant ADAMTS-14, cells were cultured at confluency, scraped, and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C in an extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 to 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NEM, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the cell extracts were collected and the pellets were solubilized in SDS-PAGE denaturation buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Conditioned culture medium and the two cell layer-associated fractions were then assayed by Western blotting by using the anti-FLAGTM M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). The stably transfected 293 cells amplified from two separate transfections were grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and hygromycin B (100 μg/ml). In some cultures, dextran sulfate (average M r 500,000; 0.01%) or concanavalin A (10 or 50 μm) were added for the last 48 h of culture. Cells were then scraped and extracted as described above. Aliquots of cell extracts were then stored at 4 °C or incubated in presence of p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (0.3 mm for 15 min at 25 °C) or trypsin (100 μg/ml for 15 or 30 min at 37 °C) followed by an incubation with soybean trypsin inhibitor (500 μg/ml for 5 min at 37 °C). The various samples of cell extracts were then assayed for their aminoprocollagen peptidase activity using 14C-labeled pNI collagen as described earlier (10Colige A. Beschin A. Samyn B. Goebels Y. Van Beeumen J. Nusgens B.V. Lapière C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16724-16730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Values determined for the cell transfected with the empty vector were considered as background and substracted from values obtained for cells expressing recombinant ADAMTS-2 or -14. Aminoprocollagen peptidase activity of ADAMTS-14 are reported in % of the ADAMTS-2 activity. Co-culture experiments were performed in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) in the absence of hygromycin B. Stably transfected 293 cells were plated with a similar number of skin fibroblasts isolated from normal or dermatosparactic calf. After 24 h, the culture medium was changed andl-[2,3-3H]proline (45 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/ml) was added. After 24 h, the culture mediums and the cell layers were collected separately. The collagen polypeptides were recovered from the cell layer by extraction at 4 °C with 0.1 macetic acid and from the culture medium by differential salt precipitation with ammonium sulfate as described earlier (16Lapière C.M. Nusgens B.V. Piérard G.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1977; 5: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The pattern of labeled collagen polypeptides was analyzed by 6.25% SDS-PAGE in nonreducing conditions and visualized after fluorography. The level of type I aminoprocollagen (pNI) processing in the skin of wild type (WT) orAdamts2 −/− mice was investigated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). Only α1 and α2 chains were observed in tissues of WT mice, illustrating the complete processing of the aminopropeptide of type I collagen. InAdamts2 −/− mice, pNα1I and pNα2I chains were detected, as expected from an animal lacking Adamts-2activity. However, mature α1 and α2 chains were present, suggesting the existence of an alternative aminoprocollagen peptidase activity. Similar observations were made in bovine dermatosparaxis and human Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC (12Nusgens B.V. Verellen-Dumoulin G. Hermans-Le T., De Paepe A. Nuytinck L. Piérard G.E. Lapière C.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The level of processing varied from tissue to tissue (Fig. 1 B) and was not related to the collagen content in the various organs. Skin contains mostly unprocessed pNI-collagen (60 to 70%) while, in tendon, it represents only 20 to 25%. When most of the pN-I collagen is not processed, such as in the skin of Adamts2 −/− mice, collagen fibers are deeply altered (Fig. 2, compare panels A and B). On the opposite, in tendons, where a high proportion of collagen is correctly processed, fibers look almost normal in terms of diameter, shape, and supramolecular organization (Fig. 2, panels C andD). Their mechanical resistance is also normal (not shown).Figure 2Structure of collagen fibrils. Collagen fibrils from skin and tendons of wild type (WT) andAdamts2 −/− (TS2−/−) mice were observed by electron microscopy. In TS2−/−, skin collagen fibrils are strongly disorganized while they display an almost normal shape in tendon. Bars represent 0.3 μm. Top panels, collagen fibrils (longitudinal and cross-section) in skin from a WT mouse (A) or a TS2−/− mouse (B). Bottom panels, collagen fibrils, in longitudinal (C) or cross (D) section, in tendon from a TS2−/− mouse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The specificity of the processing of pNI collagen in the absence ofAdamts-2 activity was assessed by amino acid sequencing of the NH2 terminus of processed α1 and α2 chains isolated from dermatosparactic calf tendon. A first attempt failed to provide sequence information, suggesting that their amino terminus was blocked, possibly by modification of the glutamine residue which is the first expected amino acid of α1 and α2 when the processing occurs at the site normally cleaved by Adamts-2. After digestion with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase, a LSYGYD sequence was obtained for the α1 chain and a FDAKGG sequence for the α2 chain. In bovine type I collagen, these two sequences immediately follow the Gln residue in position 1 of correctly processed α1 and α2. These features demonstrate that, even in absence of Adamts-2 activityin vivo, procollagen processing can occur at the cleavage site for Adamts-2. Based upon the hypothesis that the specific aminoprocollagen peptidase activity observed in animals lacking Adamts-2results from the expression and the activity of a closely related enzyme, we scanned nucleic acid data bases from GenBankTMusing the human ADAMTS2 cDNA sequence (accession numberAJ003125). Besides homologies with ADAMTS2 andADAMTS3 cDNA and genes (on chromosome 5 and 4, respectively), homology was also found between portions of exons 6, 7, 8, and 10 of ADAMTS2 and sequences from chromosome 10 (accession numbers: AC069538, AC016043, AC007484, AC018979, andAL358817). A second homology search using less stringent parameters and the sequence of individual ADAMTS2 exons revealed that, with the exception of exons 1, 5, and 21, each ADAMTS2 exon had partial sequence homology with sequences in chromosome 10. This suggested the existence of a gene coding for a new ADAMTSclosely related to ADAMTS2. By RT-PCR, we found that this new ADAMTS gene was actually expressed in human skin fibroblasts in culture and in placenta, although at a lower level. Region of the mRNA corresponding to exons 2 to 22 of ADAMTS2 was then RT-PCR amplified and sequenced. This allowed to determine that sequences corresponding to exons 5 and 21 of ADAMTS2 were present in the new ADAMTS but displayed very low homology, explaining why they were not detected by scanning of the data bases. We also found an alternative splicing mechanism leading to the removal of the last 9 bases of exon 6 (TableI). The ADAMTS14 name was assigned to this new cDNA, in agreement with the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (GenBankTM accession numberAF366351). Comparison of the ADAMTS14 cDNA sequence with the draft sequence of the human genome revealed that the gene is located on chromosome 10 (q21.3). The exon/intron structure has been determined (Table I). A 5′-RACE method was used for the determination of sequences located upstream exon 2. Two different sequences were identified. They represent 2 alternative exons 1 that were named exon 1A and 1B (Fig. 3, Table I). Comparison with genomic sequences showed that the beginning of exon 1B (5′-TATTT) starts at a tctgTATTT potential Cap signal located 17 base pairs (bp) downstream a potential TATA-box (tgtatat) (19Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). This suggests that the TATTT sequence represents the actual start of transcription of this transcript. For exon 1A, the 5′-end sequence that was determined (TTGC) does not start after a typical Cap site, perhaps suggesting that the actual 5′ end of the transcript had not been cloned. A tcagc Cap signal 27 bp upstream and adequately preceded (82 bp) by a typical GC-box could be the actual start of transcription. As a confirmation of the presence, at the 5′ end of the mRNA, of the alternative ex"

We show that circulating human neutrophils express groups V and X sPLA2 (GV and GX sPLA2) mRNA and contain GV and GX sPLA2 proteins, whereas GIB, GIIA, GIID, GIIE, GIIF, GIII, and GXII sPLA2s are undetectable. GV sPLA2 is a component of both azurophilic and specific granules, whereas GX sPLA2 is confined to azurophilic granules. Exposure to fMLP or opsonized zymosan results in the release of GV but not GX sPLA2 and most, if not all, of the PLA2 activity in the extracellular fluid of fMLP-stimulated neutrophils is due to GV sPLA2. GV sPLA2 does not contribute to fMLP-stimulated leukotriene B4 production but may support the anti-bacterial properties of the neutrophil, because 10–100 ng per ml concentrations of this enzyme lead to Gram-negative bacterial membrane phospholipid hydrolysis in the presence of human serum. By use of a recently described and specific inhibitor of cytosolic PLA2-α (group IV PLA2α), we show that this enzyme produces virtually all of the arachidonic acid used for the biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 in fMLP- and opsonized zymosan-stimulated neutrophils, the major eicosanoid produced by these pro-inflammatory cells.

The different sPLA2s are not close isoforms of each other because their amino acid sequences are ∼30–50% identical among the paralogs. This plus the fact that the sPLA2enzymes have distinct tissue distributions argue for different physiological functions for each enzyme (5Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys.

Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In addition, some of the sPLA2 enzymes have N-terminal prepropeptide sequences of varying lengths (5Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 13Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which prepropeptide sPLA2 enzymes mature into secreted proteins has not been fully defined. Some sPLA2enzymes have dibasic motifs at the C terminus of their signal sequence, such as the arginine doublet in GX sPLA2 (25Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), that may be efficiently cleaved by subtilisin-like protein convertases in the Golgi apparatus (35Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Some sPLA2 enzymes, including GIB and GX sPLA2, are secreted as proenzymes and then cleaved to yield mature, catalytically active proteins, whereas others, like GIIA and GV sPLA2, do not have an extra N-terminal peptide. GX sPLA2 also contains a single consensus sequence for post-translational modification, the N-glycosylation acceptor site (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) at Asn-113 (25Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), andN-glycosylation of GX sPLA2 was demonstrated when this enzyme was expressed in HEK293 cells (36Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K. Yamada K. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol.

PLA2 enzymatic activity has been detected in intracellular granules in human neutrophils (37Rosenthal M.D. Gordon M.N. Buescher E.S. Slusser J.H. Harris L.K. Franson RC. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Balsinde J. Diez E. Schuller A. Mollinedo F. J. Biol.

Subcellular fractionation experiments have shown that neutrophils have a heterogenous population of granules that have distinct intra-granular and membrane-bound proteins (40Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, neutrophils contain azurophilic, specific, and gelatinase granules, as well as secretory vesicles, that function as regulated storage organelles. When neutrophils are stimulated, the granules may release their protein contents into the extracellular environment, or may fuse with phagosomes to form phagolysosomes, where the contents of the granules cooperate in the killing of microbes (41Sorensen O.E. Follin P. Johnsen A.H. Calafat J. Tjabringa G.S. Hiemstra P.S. Borregaard N. Blood. 2001; 97: 3951-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Fusion of granule membranes, which are important reservoirs of membrane-bound proteins, with the plasma membrane and phagolysosomes may also participate in the eradication of microbes (40Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the granules that contain sPLA2 enzymes in human neutrophils has not been established. A large body of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that agonist-stimulated release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids is mediated, at least in part, by cPLA2 (reviewed in Ref. 42Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). First, cPLA2 selectively hydrolyzes phospholipids with arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position (43Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). Second, exposing neutrophils to fMLP results in a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of cPLA2, a finding consistent with cPLA2 phosphorylation, and stimulates the translocation of cPLA2 from cytosolic to microsomal and nuclear compartments (44Marshall J. Krump E. Lindsay T. Downey G. Ford D.A. Zhu P. Walker P. Rubin B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45Surette M.E. Dallaire N. Jean N. Picard S. Borgeat P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1521-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Third, co-incubating neutrophils with the cPLA2inhibitor methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) decreases fMLP-stimulated arachidonic acid mass release (44Marshall J. Krump E. Lindsay T. Downey G. Ford D.A. Zhu P. Walker P. Rubin B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45Surette M.E. Dallaire N. Jean N. Picard S. Borgeat P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1521-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fourth, peritoneal macrophages from mice subjected to targeted disruption of the cPLA2 gene (cPLA2−/−) produce less PGE2, LTB4, and platelet-activating factor following exposure to inflammatory stimuli than macrophages from wild type mice (cPLA2+/+) (46Bonventre J.V.

Tashiro F. Nature. 1997; 390: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of cPLA2 have been identified as follows: cPLA2α, cPLA2β, and cPLA2γ (43Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although cPLA2α is thought to mediate arachidonic acid release by a variety of cells (42Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), the physiologic roles of cPLA2β and cPLA2γ have not been defined. The purpose of this study was to identify the sPLA2 enzymes that are expressed by neutrophils, define the subcellular localization of these enzymes, determine which sPLA2 enzymes are released by neutrophils, and evaluate the role of the extracellular sPLA2 enzymes in neutrophil LTB4 biosynthesis and Gram-negative bacterial phospholipid hydrolysis. We identified GV and GX sPLA2 mRNA in a homogeneous population of human neutrophils, showed that these cells contain GV and GX sPLA2 protein, demonstrated that GV and GX sPLA2 are both present in azurophilic granules, and found that GV sPLA2 is also a component of specific granules. Furthermore, we showed that GV sPLA2 was released into the extracellular environment following exposure to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) or opsonized zymosan (OZ), whereas mature GX sPLA2was not. Inhibition of extracellular sPLA2 activity with the active site-directed, tight-binding inhibitor indoxam (50Yokota Y. Hanasaki K. Ono T. Nakazato H. Kobayashi T. Arita H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which was found to inhibit GV sPLA2 activity 125-fold more efficiently than GX sPLA2 activity, had no effect on fMLP-stimulated neutrophil LTB4 synthesis. In contrast, pretreatment of neutrophils with pyrrolidine-1 (51Seno K. Okuno T. Nishi K. Murakami Y. Watanabe F. Matsuura T. Wada M. Fujii Y. Yamada M. Ogawa T. Okada T. Hashizume H. Kii M. Hara S.

Chem. 2000; 43: 1041-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a highly specific inhibitor of cPLA2α activity that has no effect on the catalytic activity of recombinant GIIA, V, or X sPLA2 (52Ghomashchi F. Stewart A. Hefner Y. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Leslie C.C. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), abrogated fMLP- and OZ-induced neutrophil LTB4biosynthesis. Finally, we showed that recombinant GIIA or GV sPLA2, but not GX sPLA2, efficiently hydrolyzed [3H]oleic acid from [3H]oleic acid labeled live Escherichia coli in the presence of serum. Ficoll-Paque was from Amersham Biosciences and was used for neutrophil isolation. DNase I RNase-free was from Qiagen (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Thermus aquaticus(Taq) polymerase was from MBI Fermentas (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Rhodamine-phycoerythrin (R-PE)-conjugated anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody (clone 3G8; Monosan, Uden, Netherlands), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD19 (Immunotech, Luminy, France), FITC-conjugated anti-CD3 (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA), and FITC-conjugated anti-HLA-DR (Immunotech, Luminy, France) were used for cell sorting procedures. [9,10-3H]Oleic acid (NFT 289, 5 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Myocardial RNA was from Ambion (Austin, TX). DNA sequence analysis was performed at the “DNA Sequencing Facility” of The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Isolation of the IgG fraction from serum was done with the ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein G Plus Orientation Kit (Pierce). TheE. coli strain pldA− was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Elsbach (New York University School of Medicine, New York). Zymosan was obtained from Sigma, and OZ was prepared as described previously (53Wheelan P. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indoxam and pyrrolidine-1 were synthesized as described elsewhere (50Yokota Y. Hanasaki K. Ono T. Nakazato H. Kobayashi T. Arita H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 52Ghomashchi F. Stewart A. Hefner Y. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Leslie C.C. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys.

After obtaining informed consent from healthy donors that were not taking any medications, 100 ml of blood was obtained and anticoagulated in citrate. Neutrophils were then isolated by dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation, exactly as described (44Marshall J. Krump E. Lindsay T. Downey G. Ford D.A. Zhu P. Walker P. Rubin B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Neutrophils (1 × 107) enriched by Ficoll centrifugation were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 20% heat-inactivated AB serum prepared in KRPD buffer (where KRPD is Krebs-Ringers phosphate dextrose), washed twice with KRPD, and simultaneously labeled for 30 min at 4 °C with anti-CD16 R-PE, anti-CD19 FITC, anti-CD3 FITC, and anti-HLA-DR FITC, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After two washes with cold KRPD buffer, cells were subjected to dual channel FACS analysis on a MoFlo cytometer (Cytomation Inc., Fort Collins, CO) using a 150-megawatt Coherent Innova enterprise II ion laser (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) tuned at 488 nm and equipped with CyCLOPS Summit software. Fluorescence was measured using 570/40 (R-PE) and 530/40 (FITC) band pass filters. CD16+, CD19−, CD3−, and HLA-DR− cells were separated by sorting in the “sort purify” mode setting with a flow rate of 10,000 cells/s. Gates were set to exclude debris and nonviable cells on the basis of light scatter properties. Neutrophils were defined by a combination of forward, pulse width, and side scatter characteristics as well as the fluorescence intensity of anti-CD16 R-PE. Aliquots of the Ficoll-enriched, CD16+-sorted cells were reanalyzed on a FACscan using the CellQuest program (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and were routinely >99.9% pure. Flow cytometric and FACS analysis were performed at the “Flow Cytometry Facility” (Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and was always more than 90%. Sorted cells were placed on ice and immediately processed for RNA isolation. Ficoll-enriched or FACS-sorted CD16+ cells (1 × 106) were directly lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol Reagent for 5 min at room temperature. After addition of 0.2 ml of CHCl3 and vigorous shaking, tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was aspirated and supplemented with glycogen (10 μg/ml), and total RNA was precipitated by mixing with 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol. After 10 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. RNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, briefly air-dried, dissolved in 55 μl of RNase-free water, and incubated with 5 μl of DNase I RNase-free (10 units/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. DNase I was then inactivated by heat treatment for 5 min at 70 °C. The absence of genomic DNA in the RNA preparations was confirmed by performing PCR analysis for “minus-RT controls” (using RNA that was not reverse-transcribed as the template). cDNA mixtures were prepared in a 20-μl reaction using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas, Burlington, ON) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 μl of the DNA-free RNA preparations from Ficoll-enriched or FACS-sorted CD16+human neutrophils or 2 μg of DNA-free RNA extracted from myocardial tissue (Ambion, Austin, TX) was reverse-transcribed using 40 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase in the presence of 0.5 μg of oligo(dT18) primers, 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 4 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, deoxynucleotide (dNTP) mix (1 mmol/liter each), and 20 units of RNase inhibitor. The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 39 °C (transcription) and 10 min at 70 °C (inactivation of RT). The cDNA mixture was then diluted with RNase-free water to a final volume of 100 μl. A total of 5 μl of the diluted first strand cDNA was amplified in a PCR that included the cDNA from 4166 cells in the case of Ficoll-enriched or FACS-sorted CD16+neutrophils or 100 ng of total RNA from human myocardium. PCR was performed in 50-μl reactions containing 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, dNTP mix (0.2 mmol/liter each), 2 units of Taq polymerase, and 0.5 μmol/liter"

However, direct visualization of the Bid-induced release of various proteins from the highly compartmentalized intermembrane space and the changes in the mitochondrial metabolic machinery remain elusive. Using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins and immunostaining in individual permeabilized HepG2 cells, first we demonstrated that truncated Bid (15.5-kDa C-terminal fragment, tBid) evoked a rapid and essentially complete release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from every mitochondrion. To establish at a resolution of seconds the kinetics of tBid-induced cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release and depolarization, we monitored the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) fluorimetrically in permeabilized cells and applied a rapid filtration method to obtain cytosolic fractions for Western blotting. We found that subnanomolar doses of tBid were sufficient to evoke cytochrome c release and mitochondrial depolarization, whereas full-length Bid was 100-fold less effective. Bcl-xL prevented tBid-induced cytochromec release and depolarization. In response to 2.5 nm tBid, cytochrome c release started after a 10 s delay, displayed rapid progression, and was complete at 50–70 s. Release of Smac/DIABLO was synchronized with cytochromec release, whereas the loss of ΔΨmlagged slightly behind cytochrome c release. Furthermore, tBid-induced cytochrome c release was insensitive to changes in substrate composition, but tBid-induced depolarization did not occur in the presence of extramitochondrial ATP supply. Thus, tBid-induced permeabilization of the outer membrane permits rapid release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from all domains of the intermembrane space.

Recently, it has also been shown that released Smac/DIABLO promotes caspase activation by binding to IAP, an inhibitor of the amplification of caspase activation (11Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.J.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to precipitate the release of cytochrome c and other apoptotic proteins. Among these pathways are Bcl-2 family proteins and/or components of the permeability transition pore (PTP), 1The abbreviations used are:PTPpermeability transition poretBidtruncated BidGFPgreen fluorescent proteincyto c-GFPcytochrome c fused to GFPTMREtetramethylrhodamine ethyl esterFCCPcarbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone voltage dependent anion channel, adenine nucleotide translocator, and cyclophillin D. In addition to playing a central role in the release of apoptotic proteins, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization also affects the mitochondrial metabolic machinery that provides ATP for many cellular functions including caspase activation. Depletion of cytochromec impairs H+ extrusion from the mitochondrial matrix, whereas permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane results in dissipation of the H+ gradient that drives the F1F0 ATPase. Although analysis of the proteins involved in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization has greatly advanced, formation of the pore is not likely to be the sole determinant for the escape of apoptotic factors from the mitochondria and changes of the metabolic machinery. For example, individual mitochondria are assembled into a complex and dynamic structure that has been visualized as a continuous network in some cell types (12Bereiter-Hahn J. Voth M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 27: 198-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar,13Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). Furthermore the intermembrane space of each mitochondrion is divided into discrete compartments (14Mannella C.A. Marko M. Buttle K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 37-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Thus luminal communication between individual mitochondria and between subdomains of the intermembrane space may also influence the release of the apoptotic factors. To investigate the subcellular spatial pattern of cytochromec distribution, Heiskanen et al. (16Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.W., Ma, J. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and Goldstein et al. (17Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell.

However, in these studies the time course of cyto c-GFP redistribution from mitochondria to the cytosol included formation of the apoptotic signal delivered to the mitochondria as well as the subsequent permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane. permeability transition pore truncated Bid green fluorescent protein cytochrome c fused to GFP tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone The Bcl-2 family proteins are regulators of cell death in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli either by acting as anti-apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) or pro-apoptotic molecules (e.g. Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid). The N-terminal BH4 domain is restricted to some anti-apoptotic proteins, whereas BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains are commonly found in both the anti- and pro-apoptotic subfamilies. Recent work including structural studies and mutagenesis revealed that the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains are essential for the dimerization of Bcl-2 family proteins (reviewed in Refs. 18Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar and 19Gross A McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). The heterodimerization of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL with pro-apoptotic Bax requires the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of the Bcl-xL and BH3 domain of the Bax (20Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Several apoptosis promoters have been identified that have only the BH3 domain. These proteins, named collectively as the “BH3-only” molecules include Bad, Bid, Bik, Bim, Blk, Hrk, and EGL-1 (recently reviewed in Refs. 21Huang D.C. Strasser A.

However, because of the time-consuming process of cell fractionation, the temporal pattern of tBid-induced cytochrome c release and metabolic dysfunction has not been determined. Furthermore, cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO may promote caspase activation in a concerted manner, but whether Smac/DIABLO is released simultaneously with cytochromec has not been addressed. To better understand the mechanisms of Bid-induced permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, we established direct measurements of the kinetics of Bid-induced cytochrome c release, Smac/DIABLO release, and ΔΨm loss at a resolution of seconds in permeabilized HepG2 cells. Thus, for the first time, we elucidated the temporal relationships between the tBid-induced release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO and function of the mitochondrial metabolic machinery. Prior to permeabilization, the cells were washed in a Ca2+-free buffer that was prepared as follows: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 20 mmHEPES-NaOH pH 7.4. The permeabilization buffer (intracellular-like medium) consisted of 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mmHEPES-Tris pH 7.2, and 1 μg/ml anti-pain, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Digitonin was added to 10 μg/106 cells. In some experiments 5% dextran was also included in the medium. The medium was also supplemented with either succinate (2 mm) or malate/glutamate (1 and 5 mm, respectively). The measurements were carried out in the presence or absence of 2.5 μg/ml oligomycin, 2 mm MgATP, and an ATP regenerating system composed of 5 mm phosphocreatine, 5 units/ml creatine kinase. Recombinant proteins, Bcl-xL, full-length Bid, and caspase-8-cleaved Bid (tBid) were produced as described earlier (43Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K.

HepG2, human hepatoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere (CO2, 5%) and were plated for the experiments onto coverslips or 75-cm2 flasks as described previously (51Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For transient tranfections, cells were transfected using Lipofecta-AMINE 2000 with plasmid DNA (pEGFP-Mito Vector, mito-GFP CLONTECH, or cytochrome c green fluorescence protein) keeping total DNA at 2 μg/ml. After 6 h, the cells were placed in a normal growth medium. Imaging was carried out 48 h after transfection. Adherent cells transfected with mito-GFP were permeabilized for 5 min and incubated in the presence or absence of 10 nm tBid for 20 min at 35 °C. Fixation of the cells was carried out using 3% paraformaldehyde. Prior to incubation with a monoclonal cytochrome c or Smac/DIABLO antibody (1:200 and 1:500 dilution, respectively) the cells were incubated in the presence of 200 μg/106 cells digitonin for 1 h at room temperature. Lengthening incubation or a higher digitonin concentration (up to 1,500 μg/106 cells) did not increase labeling of the mitochondrial cytochrome c. To determine the subcellular distribution of the cytochrome cor Smac/DIABLO antibody, the Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse signal amplification kit was used as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Confocal imaging was carried out using a Bio-Rad MRC1024/2P imaging system equipped with a Kr/Ar-ion laser source (488- and 568-nm excitation) fitted to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope. Images were captured using a ×60 PlanApo objective. The pixel size was 0.2 μm, and the axial resolution was ∼1 μm. Cytoc-GFP was excited at 488 nm, whereas propidium iodide was excited at 568 nm. In the immunocytochemistry experiments, mito-GFP and Alexa Fluor 568 were excited at 488 nm and 568 nm, respectively. In absence of the primary antibody, the fluorescence signal was minimal (<5%) with the confocal settings used to record the images shown in Fig. 1. Fluorimetric measurements of ΔΨm were carried out as described previously (51Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Briefly, suspensions of cells (6.5 × 106 cells/1.6 ml, equivalent to 2 mg of protein, determined by Bio-Rad protein assay) were incubated in permeabilization medium supplemented with 40 μg/ml (10 μg/106 cells) digitonin in the presence of 800 nm JC1 in a fluorimeter cuvette. Cell permeabilization was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion, and after 5 min incubation >95% of the cells were trypan-positive. Fluorescence was monitored in a multiwavelength-excitation dual wavelength-emission fluorimeter (Delta RAM, PTI) using 490-nm excitation/535-nm emission for the monomeric form and 570-nm excitation/595-nm emission for the J-aggregate of JC1 (57Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). ΔΨm is shown as a ratio of the fluorescence of J-aggregate (aqueous phase) and monomer (membrane-bound) forms of JC1. ΔΨm was also measured using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). The cell permeabilization medium was supplemented with 1 μm TMRE. After an 8-min incubation, the cells were centrifuged (125 × g for 5 min) and resuspended in fresh medium devoid of TMRE. Fluorescence was monitored using 540-nm excitation and 580-nm emission. When the time course of the JC1 ratio was compared with the response of the TMRE fluorescence (Fig.6 C, upper panel), the cells incubated with JC1 were also centrifuged after cell permeabilization, but JC1 was added to the medium used to resuspend the pellet of permeabilized cells. [Ca2+]c was measured using fura2FF as described previously (51Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were carried out with constant stirring at 35 °C (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, 8) or at 25 °C (Fig.7).Figure 3Inhibition of tBid-induced ΔΨ m loss and cytochromec release by Bcl-xL.

Their functions and structures have been extensively investigated and characterized over the past several decades. The PMCA is known to extrude Ca2+ from the cytosol, whereas the SERCA sequesters Ca2+ into the endoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in Refs. 1Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Phys. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar and 2East J.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In recent years, a new class of Ca2+-ATPases has emerged, the first member of which was found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and named PMR1 (for plasma membrane ATPase-related, Ref. 3Rudolph H.K.

PMR1 was localized to themedial-Golgi compartment, a hitherto unusual distribution for a Ca2+ pump, where it was found to be important for functioning of the secretory pathway (4Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 5Schröder S. Schimmöller F. Singer-Krüger B. Riezman H. J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). These studies showed that cells lacking functional PMR1 exhibit defects in protein glycosylation, processing, sorting, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. In the absence of a SERCA-type Ca2+-ATPase in yeast, PMR1 is the major pump that contributes to the steady-state free Ca2+ concentration (10 μm) in the endoplasmic reticulum; this level of Ca2+ decreases by 50% inpmr1-null mutants (7Strayle J. Pozzan T. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additionally, cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels increase up to 16-fold in the pmr1mutant (8Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), despite a compensatory increase in the expression of the vacuolar PMC1 Ca2+ pump (9Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y.

The first evidence for a role for PMR1 in Mn2+ transport came from the observation that pmr1 mutants bypass the need for Cu2+ superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In a pmr1sod1double mutant, Mn2+ accumulates in the cytosol at levels 4–5-fold higher than normal and can scavenge harmful free radicals (13Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X. Fink G.R. Culotta V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a trace element, Mn2+ is an essential cofactor for enzymes in the cytoplasm (14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), mitochondria (15Hearn A.S. Stroupe M.E. Cabelli D.E. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12051-12058Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and Golgi (6Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition, Mn2+ can serve as a surrogate for Ca2+; thus, in S. cerevisiae, a small amount of Mn2+ (130 pm) can replace Ca2+ (66 nm) to support cell growth (16Loukin S. Kung C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, high concentrations of cytoplasmic Mn2+ are toxic and can interfere with Mg2+ binding sites on proteins. It is well known that high Mn2+ concentration can compromise the fidelity of DNA polymerases (17Beckman R.A. Mildvan A.S. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). More recently, defective Ty1 retrotransposition in a pmr1 mutant was shown to be due to Mn2+ inhibition of reverse transcriptase. 2E. Bolton and J. Boeke, personal communication. 2E. Bolton and J. Boeke, personal communication. PMR1 appears to be the principal route for Mn2+ detoxification, via the secretory pathway. Maintaining an appropriate level of Mn2+in the Golgi/ER lumen is also equally critical: Mn2+depletion in the pmr1 mutant leads to defectiveN-linked and O-linked protein glycosylation. Taken together, these studies illustrate the importance of PMR1 in cytosolic and luminal Mn2+ homeostasis. Research on PMR1 has pioneered the identification of other members of the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases. PMR1 shares significant sequence homology with orthologues cloned from diverse organisms including other yeast (18Park C.S. Kim J.Y. Crispino C. Chang C. Ryu D.D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 206: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (19Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol.

Recently, heterologous expression of the C. elegans PMR1 homologue, ZK256.1, in cultured COS cells has been reported (19Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) where it was shown to mediate Ca2+ and Mn2+transport. In humans, there exist two PMR1 homologues (gene namesATP2C1 and ATP2C2, protein names abbreviated hSPCA1 and hSPCA2, respectively, in this study). While the tissue distribution of hSPCA2 is not yet known, hSPCA1 is widespread in many tissues including keratinocytes, skeletal muscle, kidney, and mammary gland (21Reinhardt T.A. Horst R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C796-C802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H. Ikeda S. Mauro T. Epstein E.H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). hSPCA1 shares 49% amino acid sequence identity to yeast PMR1, with nearly complete conservation in the transmembrane domains known to be important for transport. Nonsense and missense mutations inactivating one allele of hSPCA1 are found in patients with Hailey-Hailey disease (MIM 16960), whose symptoms involve a loss of ketatinocyte cohesion (22Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H. Ikeda S. Mauro T. Epstein E.H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 23Sudbrak R. Brown J. Dobson-Stone C.

Genet. 2000; 9: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This defect is reminiscent of improper protein glycosylation, sorting, and cell wall morphogenesis inpmr1-null mutants (4Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 24Sohn Y.S. Park C.S. Lee S.B. Ryu D.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Uccelletti D. Mancini P. Farina F. morrone S. Palleschi C. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we present direct biochemical evidence that hSPCA1 is abona fide member of the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases. Expressed in yeast and cultured chinese hamster ovary cells, hSPCA1 localizes exclusively to the Golgi. It complements the pmr1-null mutation and transports Ca2+ and Mn2+ with a high affinity similar to PMR1. Yeast strains were grown in yeast nitrogen base (6.7 g/liter; Difco) supplemented with 2% glucose and necessary amino acids. We used the strain K616 (Δpmr1Δpmc1Δcnb1), in which both PMR1 andPMC1, encoding endogenous yeast Ca2+- ATPases, have been disrupted (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 26Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Wild type PMR1 was reintroduced into this strain as a His-tagged protein expressed from the 2 μ plasmid YEpHis-PMR1, which has been described elsewhere (27Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A similar cloning strategy was employed to insert cDNA of human SPCA1 (KIAA1347; Kazusa Research Institute, Japan) into the expression plasmid pSM1052 (gift of Susan Michaelis, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine). Briefly, a 2.7-kb hSPCA1 PCR product was amplified from a SalI andNotI insert of KIAA1347 in the plasmid pBluescript II SK+ using an MluI-containing sense primer (CATCACCATACGCGTATTCCTGTATTGACATCAA; MluI site underlined) and a SacI-containing antisense primer (GGCGAATTGGAGCTCTCATACTTCAAGAAAAGATGAT; SacI site underlined). The hSPCA1 PCR product was cloned into pSM1052 atMluI and SacI sites, resulting in the introduction of a 9× His tag at the extreme N terminus of the protein. To generate the N-terminal GFP-tagged hSPCA1 protein, we introducedEcoRI and SacII into the hSPCA1 cDNA by a PCR amplification with a sense primer (EcoRI site underlined; CGGCCGGAATTCATGATTCCTGTATTGACA), and an antisense primer (SacII site underlined: CCGGGCCCGCGGTACTTCAAGAAAAGATGATGA). The resulting PCR product was ligated into vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) at EcoRI and SacII. cDNA of the human PMCA4b (GenBankTM accession numberAH001521; gift of Adelaida Filoteo and John Penniston, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) was used as a template for PCR with the following sense and antisense primers respectively, GCGCGCACGCGTGGTGATATGACCAACAGC (MluI is underlined), and GCGCGCGCGGCCGCCTAAAGCGACGTCTCCAG (NotI is underlined). The product was cloned into pSM1052 atMluI and NotI sites, resulting in the introduction of the His tag at the extreme N terminus. Plasmid br434 (CEN PMA1::SERCA1A::ADC1)expressing rabbit SERCA1 was a generous gift of Dr. Hans Rudolph (University of Stuttgart, Germany) and has been previously described (6Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Growth of K616 yeast cells transformed with plasmids expressing (His)9-PMR1, (His)9-hSPCA1, GFP-hSPCA1, rbSERCA1, or (His)9-hPMCA4b, was monitored in media supplemented with increasing concentrations of BAPTA and MnCl2 as in Weiet al. (27Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with some alterations. BAPTA-supplemented medium was buffered with MES/KOH (final concentration 100 mm) at pH 6.0. 200 μl of growth medium was inoculated with 0.009 A 600 units of cells in a 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 2–3 days. The cultures were then mixed by gentle vortexing, and growth was measured by determining the absorbance at 600 nm in a SPECTRAmax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Relative growth was expressed as a fraction of A 600 of the control culture (no BAPTA or Mn2+). Sucrose gradient fractionation of yeast cell lysates and total membrane preparation were as described earlier (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar), but without the 2-h heat shock. We determined protein concentration with a modified Lowry method (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after precipitating the protein samples in 10% cold trichloroacetic acid; bovine serum albumin was used as standard (Sigma). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar). His-tagged PMR1, hSPCA1, and hPMCA4b were detected on a Western blot by anti-His6 antibody (1:5000 dilution; CLONTECH), and anti-rabbit SERCA1 antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Affinity Bioreagent) was used to detect rabbit SERCA1. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used in conjunction with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to visualize protein bands. Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured in Ham's F12 medium (Mediatech; Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were grown on 8 chamber glass slides and transiently transfected with either pEGFP-hSPCA1 using LipofectAmine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and grown to 70–80% confluency. For microscopy, GFP-tagged hSPCA1 was visualized in live yeast cells and in transiently transfected CHO cells. Prior to staining with anti-mannosidase antibody, CHO cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, rinsed with PBS 3 times to remove residual fixative and then permeablized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Fixation, permeablization and all subsequent incubations were at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS three times prior to incubation with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Next, the permeablized cells were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at a dilution of 1:1000. The cells were then washed with PBS three times over 30 min and then incubated for 1 h with AlexaFluor 568-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Finally, cells were again washed with PBS three times over 30 min and then mounted with Prolong antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-mannosidase II antibody was purchased from Dr. Kelley Moremen (University of Georgia; Athens, GA). The transport assay was done as described (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar), with modifications. Transport buffer contained 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 6.7, 0.15m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 500 nm concanamycin A (Sigma), and 10 μm CCCP (Sigma); 45CaCl2 (22 Ci/g; ICN) was added to 1.7 μCi/ml. In 45Ca2+ titration assay, the buffer contained 20 μm CCCP, as well as 15 μm CaCl2 and 45CaCl2; EGTA was added in different amounts to titrate free Ca2+concentrations as in Wei et al. (29Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). H2O used in the buffer was treated with Chelex resin (Sigma) to prevent Ca2+ contamination. For other assays, Mn2+ or thapsigargin were added to the transport buffer, and the extent of45Ca2+ accumulation in vesicles was measured by liquid scintillation. Phenotype complementation is the first step in establishing that the hitherto uncharacterized human cDNA KIAA1347, defective in Hailey-Hailey disease, is a functional homologue of PMR1. A characteristic phenotype of pmr1-null mutants is their dependence on external Ca2+ or Mn2+ for growth (3Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J.M. Moir D.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 133-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Thus, growth of the host strain K616 (Δpmr1Δpmc1Δcnb1) is hypersensitive to divalent cation chelators such as BAPTA or EGTA. Because standard yeast minimal media contain ∼100-fold more Ca2+ than Mn2+, and the latter is efficiently removed at low chelator concentrations, the observed growth inhibition by BAPTA correlates with Ca2+ starvation. Heterologous expression of a high affinity Ca2+ pump allows Ca2+ to be efficiently scavenged for delivery into the secretory pathway where it is required for protein sorting and modification. Fig. 1 shows that like PMR1, expression of epitope-tagged hSPCA1 can effectively restore BAPTA tolerance to the yeast mutant lacking endogenous Ca2+pumps. Similarly, Mn2+ toxicity in K616 is indicative of loss of Mn2+ transport. A critical route for Mn2+ detoxification is delivery into the secretory pathway via PMR1, and subsequent exit from the cell. Fig. 1 also shows that the hypersensitivity of the pmr1-null mutant to Mn2+toxicity can be rescued by introduction of hSPCA1. Strikingly, hSPCA1 confers significantly higher levels of tolerance to Mn2+when compared with PMR1, while BAPTA tolerance typically remained lower. In previous studies we have established that differential sensitivity to BAPTA and Mn2+ in PMR1 mutants correlates with altered ion selectivity. The data in Fig. 1 are consistent with the possibility that hSPCA1 is more selective for Mn2+transport, relative to PMR1. Yeast strains expressing (His)9-tagged hSPCA1 were grown in 500 ml cultures, lysed gently, and fractionated on a 10-step sucrose gradient. Using an array of organellar markers, we have previously showed that (His)9-Pmr1 localizes discretely to Golgi fractions, which are separate from endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and vacuoles (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 29Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that histidine-tagged hSPCA1 localizes to the same fractions as histidine-tagged PMR1, as indicated by the appearance of ATP-driven 45Ca transport activity in fractions corresponding to the Golgi (26 to 30–34% sucrose). The equivalent fractions derived from the vector-transformed host strain were virtually devoid of Ca2+ pumping activity. Western analysis of the fractions confirms that hSPCA1 has a distribution similar to that of PMR1 (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether Golgi localization was specific to the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases, we examined the distribution of representative members of the SERCA and PMCA subtypes expressed in yeast. Fig. 2 also shows 45Ca transport activity and Western analysis of fractions derived from K616 yeast transformed with plasmid expressing (His)9-human PMCA4b and untagged rabbit SERCA1. These two Ca2+- ATPases are distributed in the denser half of the sucrose gradient, which has previously been shown to contain both endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane fractions (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Clearly, the Golgi localization and 45Ca2+transport activity of hSPCA1 expressed in yeast mirrors that of PMR1, and not those of the PMCA or SERCA pumps. Live yeast cells transformed with GFP-tagged hSPCA1 were examined by confocal microscopy. Fig. 3 shows that GFP fluorescence resides in scattered, punctate structures characteristic of the appearance of Golgi bodies in yeast, and similar to the previously reported distribution of PMR1 (4Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A is a confocal image of a field of live chinese ovary cells transiently transfected with GFP-hSPCA1. The majority of fluorescence has a juxtanuclear distribution, similar to the recently reported distribution of theC. elegans PMR1 homologue expressed in COS cells (30Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Weidema A.F. Vanoevelen J. Raeymaekers L. Renders J. Callewaert G. Rizzuto R. Wuytack F. J. Biol.

To verify the identity of this compartment, the cells were stained with antibody to the Golgi resident protein, mannosidase II. Fig.4 B shows that GFP fluorescence is essentially superimposable with the signal from mannosidase II, confirming the Golgi localization. These microscopy data, together with subcellular fractionation of yeast membranes, establish that hSPCA1 is a resident Golgi protein, and provide further evidence for classification as a member of the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases.Figure 4Fluorescence microscopy of GFP-tagged hSPCA1 in CHO cells. Panel A is a field of live CHO cells, transiently transfected with GFP-tagged hSPCA1, showing GFP fluorescence with a juxtanuclear concentration characteristic of Golgi. In Panels B–D, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and treated with antibody against mannosidase II, a resident Golgi marker. GFP fluorescence (Panel B) is superimposable with indirect immunofluorescence from mannosidase II (Panel C), as seen in the merged image (Panel D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Vesicles pooled from Golgi-enriched fractions of cells expressing His-hSPCA1 were assayed for45Ca2+ transport activity under conditions that inhibit H+/Ca2+ exchange (see “Experimental Procedures”). 45Ca2+ transport displayed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and was dependent on free Ca2+ with an estimated Km of 260 nm (Fig. 5 A). The data are consistent with a single high affinity site for Ca2+, similar to a recently reported value of 250 nm for the PMR1 homologue from C. elegans (19Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In earlier studies of 45Ca transport and Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, we have observed a Km of 70 nm for S. cerevisiae PMR1 (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 29Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of hSPCA1 to bind Mn2+ was assessed indirectly by inhibition of 45Ca2+ transport, as shown in Fig. 5 B. Mn2+ inhibition of45Ca2+ accumulation in vesicles decreased with increasing Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that the two ions compete for the same sites (not shown). Mn2+ inhibition of Ca2+ transport activity was significantly greater for the secretory pathway pumps (75–90%) than for human PMCA4 and rabbit SERCA1 (∼30%; Fig. 5 B, inset). Thapsigargin, a potent inhibitor of the SERCA pumps, was ineffective in inhibiting Ca2+ transport activity of hSPCA1, at concentrations up to 5 μm (not shown). This insensitivity is also exhibited by yeast PMR1 (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and its C. eleganshomologue, ZK256.1 (30Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Weidema A.F. Vanoevelen J. Raeymaekers L. Renders J. Callewaert G. Rizzuto R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39161-39170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To date, there is little evidence that the other P-type Ca2+-ATPases, PMCA and SERCA, can transport Mn2+ as effectively as Ca2+. In 1980, Chiesi and Inesi (31Chiesi M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) reported a slow accumulation of 54Mn2+ in sarcoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle when Ca2+ was absent. In contrast, numerous independent experimental observations have indicated that the secretory pathway homologues of PMR1 from yeast and C. elegans can transport Mn2+ with high affinity (12Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar, 19Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we evaluate Mn2+ sequestering activity in vivo by comparing phenotypes of yeast strains transformed with plasmids encoding rbSERCA1, hPMCA4 and hSPCA1, respectively. Heterologous expression of all Ca2+-ATPases in the pmr1-null mutant restores BAPTA tolerance to levels similar to endogenous yeast PMR1, indicating that all of these pumps share the ability to transport Ca2+ (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, only the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases, hSPCA1 and PMR1, confer tolerance to high levels of extracellular Mn2+ (Fig. 6 B). The inability of SERCA and PMCA to confer Mn2+ tolerance, taken together with significantly weaker Mn2+ inhibition of 45Ca transport (Fig.5 B, inset) suggests a lack of high affinity Mn2+ transport activity in these pumps. At this time, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that Golgi localization is somehow critical for effective in vivo Mn2+sequestration. Additional evaluation of Mn2+-dependent ATPase activity and phosphoenzyme formation may clarify this issue in the future. In summary, our current data are consistent with the intriguing possibility that the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases have evolved to function as major high affinity Mn2+ pumps in the Golgi. In this study we have provided biochemical evidence for the subcellular localization and ion transport properties of an uncharacterized human cDNA KIAA1347, which we have termed the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA1), in accordance with an earlier proposal by Shull (32Shull G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This nomenclature is consistent with the other two well known subtypes of Ca2+ pumps, SERCA and PMCA, and serves to distinguish members of a novel and rapidly expanding subtype. We show here that hSPCA1 localizes to the Golgi and mediates the high affinity, thapsigargin-insensitive transport of Ca2+ and Mn2+ into the secretory pathway, resulting in full complementation of pmr1-null phenotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequence alignments of representative Ca2+-ATPases from diverse species, depicted in Fig. 7, reveal three distinct clusters of SPCA, SERCA, and PMCA, consistent with non-overlapping organellar distributions and cellular functions. Haploinsufficiency of hSPCA1, resulting from missense and nonsense mutations in the ATP2C1 gene, was recently identified in patients with Hailey-Hailey disease (22Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H. Ikeda S. Mauro T. Epstein E.H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In that study, keratinocytes from HHD patients were shown to have higher levels of resting Ca2+, and were defective in removal of excess cytosolic Ca2+ despite having intact thapsigargin-sensitive SERCA activity. More recent studies involving heterologous expression of theC. elegans PMR1 homologue in cultured COS1 cells demonstrate that the SPCA-filled stores, but not the SERCA-filled stores, are capable of setting up Ca2+ oscillations upon stimulation of IP3 receptors. Thus, defects in spatio-temporal response to Ca2+ in HHD may lead to defective Ca2+signaling, gene expression and keratinocyte differentiation. Alternatively, when Ca2+ and Mn2+ levels are low in the Golgi, secreted or surface proteins may not be correctly glycosylated and sorted, as demonstrated in yeast (6Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 24Sohn Y.S. Park C.S. Lee S.B. Ryu D.D. J.

Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and may lead to improper keratinocyte adhesion. Our data support the hypothesis that hSPCA1 might play a pivotal role in maintaining cytosolic as well as organellar (particularly Golgi and the secretory pathway) Ca2+ and Mn2+ concentrations. At present, it remains an important issue to distinguish whether defective cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis, or a deficiency in Golgi Ca2+and Mn2+ concentrations is responsible for abnormal keratinocyte adhesion. The effect of Mn2+ on SERCA and PMCA pump activity has been investigated in earlier studies. Mn2+ was found to effectively replace Mg2+ in promoting ATP hydrolysis (31Chiesi M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,33Low W. Brawarnick N. Rahamimoff H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+, excess Mn2+competitively inhibited Ca2+ pumping activity of rat synaptic vesicles PMCA although no evidence was obtained for54Mn2+ transport (33Low W. Brawarnick N. Rahamimoff H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle SERCA, on the other hand, was shown to bind Mn2+, albeit with an affinity about three orders lower than for Ca2+, and mediate transport at a very slow rate (31Chiesi M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Gomes da Costa A. Madeira V.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our data on Mn2+ inhibition of 45Ca transport activity of SERCA and PMCA expressed in yeast are consistent with these earlier observations. In contrast, there is a growing body of evidence on SPCA pumps from yeast, worm and human demonstrating Mn2+tolerant phenotype, Mn2+ competition of Ca2+transport, direct assay of 54Mn transport and Mn2+-dependent ATPase activity (12, 19, 27, 29, and this study). Based on these observations, we propose that the SPCA have uniquely evolved as high affinity Mn2+ pumps to fulfill physiological roles that are only beginning to be understood.

The PKC-related isoform PKCμ/PKD has been implicated in mitogenic signal cascades because of the activation of p42/p44 MAPK leading to Elk1-mediated gene transcription, and PKCμ/PKD has been shown to be activated via a PKC-dependent pathway. By using confocal analyses, we demonstrate here that PKCμ partially colocalizes with PKCη in different cell types. Colocalization depends on the presence of the PKCμ pleckstrin homology domain. Coexpression of constitutively active PKCη with PKCμ leads to a significant enhancement of the PKCμ substrate phosphorylation capacity as a result of an increased phosphorylation of the activation loop Ser738/742 of PKCμ, whereas Ser910 autophosphorylation remains unaffected. In vitro phosphorylation experiments show that PKCη directly phosphorylates PKCμ on activation loop serines. Consequently, the p42 MAPK cascade is triggered leading to an increase in reporter gene activity driven by a serum-responsive element in HEK293 cells. At the same time, PKCη-mediated JNK activation is reduced, providing evidence for a mutual regulation of PKCμ/PKCη affecting different arms of the p38/ERK/JNK pathways. Our data provide evidence for the sequential involvement of selective PKC isoforms in kinase cascades and identify the relevant domains in PKCμ for interaction with and activation by PKCη as pleckstrin homology domain and activation loop.

Subsequently, activation of the MAPK by PKCμ was demonstrated (15Hausser A. Storz P. Hubner S. Braendlin I. Martinez-Moya M. Link G. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PKD has been shown to be constitutively associated with PKCη via its PH domain, leading to enhanced ε-peptide phosphorylation of PKD immunoprecipitates from cells coexpressing PKCη (16Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of PKD results in phosphorylation of five serine residues (17Vertommen D. Rider M., Ni, Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19567-19576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to other PKCs, phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal serine is defined as an autophosphorylation event and is not performed by upstream kinases (18Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Two other phosphorylation sites, serines 738 and 742, have been identified (19Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition to lipid second messenger-induced activation, PKCμ kinase activity is regulated by PKCμ-binding proteins p32 and 14-3-3, which apparently affect substrate access and down-regulate kinase activity (20Hausser A.

This is suggested by recent data showing enhancement of PKD kinase activity upon transient coexpression with constitutively active PKCη (22Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have carried out this study to analyze the activation of PKCμ by PKCη in detail and to identify upstream activators and potential downstream pathways. These data show intracellular colocalization of PKCμ with PKCη as well as PKCη-dependent PKCμ activation via phosphorylation of PKCμSer738/742. PKCη-mediated activation of PKCμ leads to the inhibition of PKCη-triggered JNK activity and to increased PKCμ-dependent MAPK activity, providing evidence for a mutual regulation of these PKC members affecting different arms of the p38/ERK/JNK pathways.DISCUSSIONIt has been shown previously that PKD is activated via a PKC-dependent pathway (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Demonstrating the physical association of PKD with PKCη (16Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that PKCη serves as an upstream kinase phosphorylating PKD. In accordance with this view we show by confocal analysis that the human isozyme PKCμ colocalizes partially with PKCη, a prerequisite for direct functional interaction. We could show that colocalization occurs in perinuclear compartments. The coexpression of constitutively active PKCη with PKCμ leads to a phosphorylation enhancement of Ser738/742in PKCμ, previously thought to act as autophosphorylation sites. The data presented here now suggest that these serines, which are located in the activation loop of PKCμ, are transphosphorylation sites targeted by an upstream activating kinase. In colocalization studies (Fig. 1), the previous finding of PKCη/PKCμ interaction via the PKCμ PH domain (16Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the PKCη dependence of PKCμSer738/742 phosphorylation (Figs. 3 and 4) demonstrates PKCη as the direct upstream kinase of PKCμ. The discovery that activation loop phosphorylation is essential for substrate phosphorylation further explains earlier observations of the regulation of PKCμ kinase activity.PDK1 has been shown to act as an upstream kinase for several PKC isotypes (3Le Good J.A.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) (e.g. leading to activation loop phosphorylation of Thr500 of PKCβII) but does not phosphorylate the PKCμ activation loop (Fig. 4). The PDK1 phosphorylation sites in the activation loop of several kinases contain threonines, whereas in the homologous position of PKCμ a serine is located. Furthermore, the primary amino acid sequence surrounding Ser738/742 diverges significantly from known PDK1 sites. According to the primary structure of the activation loop of PKCμ and our data (Fig. 4), PDK1 can be excluded as a direct PKCμ kinase.We have recently shown that the chaperon-like protein p32 binds to the PKCμ kinase domain and significantly reduces compartment-specific PKCμ substrate phosphorylation but interferes only weakly with the autophosphorylation capacity of PKCμ (21Storz P. Hausser A. Link G. Dedio J. Ghebrehiwet B. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24601-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). According to the data presented here, we conclude that p32 binds to the kinase domain and interferes by steric hindrance with the PKCμ activation loop, thereby inhibiting substrate phosphorylation.The PH domain of PKD/PKCμ has been implicated in the negative regulation of kinase activity (15Hausser A. Storz P. Hubner S. Braendlin I. Martinez-Moya M. Link G. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, on binding PKCη to the PKCμ PH domain, a negative block could be released, probably leading to conformational changes and enhanced autophosphorylation but not affecting substrate phosphorylation (Fig.2). According to this model, kinase-dead PKCηK/Ractivates PKCμ autophosphorylation by conformational changes but does not affect substrate phosphorylation, which in turn needs to be triggered independently by PKCη kinase activity. Within this activation model, the PH domain as well as PH domain-mediated interaction serve as an initial step unfolding PKCμ and thus enabling autophosphorylation of Ser910. In addition unfolding may further contribute to complete activation by unknown endogenous factors explaining the PKCμ/PKCηK/R-mediated SRE-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 5 A).Although the molecular mode of PKCμ activation is currently not clear, we were able to show that PKCη serves as a direct upstream activator for PKCμ-triggered cellular processes (15Hausser A. Storz P. Hubner S. Braendlin I. Martinez-Moya M. Link G. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The coexpression PKCη with PKCμ leads to the enhancement of SRE-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 5 A). Although PKCη acts as a PKCμ activator, it is interesting to note that, by coexpression of both kinases, PKCμ-mediated effects are enhanced, but simultaneously PKCη-triggered cellular processes activating JNK are reduced. The differential triggering of JNK and p42/p44 MAPK cascades by PKCs have been reported previously (35Cadwallader K. Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that PKCμ negatively interferes with the EGF receptor-mediated JNK activation in HEK293 cells (36Bagowski C.P. Stein-Gerlach M. Choidas A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study the authors suggest that PKCμ phosphorylation of Thr654,669 of the EGF receptor negatively affects JNK-activity, whereas EGF-triggered MAPK activity remains unaffected. PKCμ/PKD is activated by PDGF via a PKC-mediated pathway (29Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and not by EGF (36Bagowski C.P. Stein-Gerlach M. Choidas A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because PDGF induces suppression of EGF-mediated JNK activation, a PDGF-triggered pathway leading via PKCη to PKCμ activation can be postulated. This subsequently results in EGF receptor phosphorylation and the down-regulation of JNK, whereas mitogenic pathways remain unaffected. Our results point to the existence of a complex network of interfering kinase cascades triggered by PKCs and PKCμ. Activation of protein kinases through growth factor receptors is achieved through a complex network of intracellular signal processes involving second messengers, protein-protein interaction, and the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of interacting proteins.

PKCs comprise a family of intracellular serine/threonine-specific kinases; depending on the isoform, their activation is typically initiated by Ca2+, lipid second messengers, and/or protein activators. In addition, subsequent multiple phosphorylation steps caused by upstream kinases contribute to a fully active state of PKCs (3Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

PKCμ/PKD differs from the other PKC isozymes by the presence of an acidic domain (8Gschwendt M. Johannes F.J. Kittstein W. Marks F. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and the lack of a typical pseudosubstrate site. PKCμ/PKD is ubiquitously expressed and involved in diverse cellular functions such as transport processes and the G protein-mediated regulation of Golgi organization (10Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V.

Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PKCμ/PKD activation occurs through several mediators via a PKC-dependent pathway (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Activation of PKCμ by the growth factor PDGF via a phospholipase Cγ-mediated pathway (14Van Lint J., Ni, Y. Valius M. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7038-7043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) points to a role in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) cascade. Subsequently, activation of the MAPK by PKCμ was demonstrated (15Hausser A. Storz P. Hubner S. Braendlin I. Martinez-Moya M. Link G. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PKD has been shown to be constitutively associated with PKCη via its PH domain, leading to enhanced ε-peptide phosphorylation of PKD immunoprecipitates from cells coexpressing PKCη (16Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of PKD results in phosphorylation of five serine residues (17Vertommen D. Rider M., Ni, Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19567-19576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to other PKCs, phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal serine is defined as an autophosphorylation event and is not performed by upstream kinases (18Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Two other phosphorylation sites, serines 738 and 742, have been identified (19Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition to lipid second messenger-induced activation, PKCμ kinase activity is regulated by PKCμ-binding proteins p32 and 14-3-3, which apparently affect substrate access and down-regulate kinase activity (20Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Storz P. Hausser A.

Because PKCη has been shown to be selectively associated with PKD, PKCη can be considered as a potential upstream kinase of PKD/PKCμ triggering PKCμ-dependent downstream pathways. This is suggested by recent data showing enhancement of PKD kinase activity upon transient coexpression with constitutively active PKCη (22Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have carried out this study to analyze the activation of PKCμ by PKCη in detail and to identify upstream activators and potential downstream pathways. These data show intracellular colocalization of PKCμ with PKCη as well as PKCη-dependent PKCμ activation via phosphorylation of PKCμSer738/742. PKCη-mediated activation of PKCμ leads to the inhibition of PKCη-triggered JNK activity and to increased PKCμ-dependent MAPK activity, providing evidence for a mutual regulation of these PKC members affecting different arms of the p38/ERK/JNK pathways. DISCUSSIONIt has been shown previously that PKD is activated via a PKC-dependent pathway (13Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Demonstrating the physical association of PKD with PKCη (16Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that PKCη serves as an upstream kinase phosphorylating PKD. In accordance with this view we show by confocal analysis that the human isozyme PKCμ colocalizes partially with PKCη, a prerequisite for direct functional interaction. We could show that colocalization occurs in perinuclear compartments. The coexpression of constitutively active PKCη with PKCμ leads to a phosphorylation enhancement of Ser738/742in PKCμ, previously thought to act as autophosphorylation sites. The data presented here now suggest that these serines, which are located in the activation loop of PKCμ, are transphosphorylation sites targeted by an upstream activating kinase. In colocalization studies (Fig. 1), the previous finding of PKCη/PKCμ interaction via the PKCμ PH domain (16Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the PKCη dependence of PKCμSer738/742 phosphorylation (Figs. 3 and 4) demonstrates PKCη as the direct upstream kinase of PKCμ.

https://openalex.org/W2118216442,"We have solved the 2.5-Å crystal structure of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, an enzyme involved in the mevalonate-independent 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. The structure reveals that the enzyme is present as a homodimer. Each monomer displays a V-like shape and is composed of an amino-terminal dinucleotide binding domain, a connective domain, and a carboxyl-terminal four-helix bundle domain. The connective domain is responsible for dimerization and harbors most of the active site. The strictly conserved acidic residues Asp150, Glu152, Glu231, and Glu234 are clustered at the putative active site and are probably involved in the binding of divalent cations mandatory for enzyme activity. The connective and four-helix bundle domains show significant mobility upon superposition of the dinucleotide binding domains of the three conformational states present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. A still more pronounced flexibility is observed for a loop spanning residues 186 to 216, which adopts two completely different conformations within the three protein conformers. A possible involvement of this loop in an induced fit during substrate binding is discussed. We have solved the 2.5-Å crystal structure of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, an enzyme involved in the mevalonate-independent 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. The structure reveals that the enzyme is present as a homodimer. Each monomer displays a V-like shape and is composed of an amino-terminal dinucleotide binding domain, a connective domain, and a carboxyl-terminal four-helix bundle domain. The connective domain is responsible for dimerization and harbors most of the active site. The strictly conserved acidic residues Asp150, Glu152, Glu231, and Glu234 are clustered at the putative active site and are probably involved in the binding of divalent cations mandatory for enzyme activity. The connective and four-helix bundle domains show significant mobility upon superposition of the dinucleotide binding domains of the three conformational states present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. A still more pronounced flexibility is observed for a loop spanning residues 186 to 216, which adopts two completely different conformations within the three protein conformers. A possible involvement of this loop in an induced fit during substrate binding is discussed. Isoprenoids, formed by the condensation of varying numbers of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) 1The abbreviations used are:IPPisopentenyl diphosphateDOXP1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphateMEP2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphateCDP-ME4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritolMECDP2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphateMPD2-methyl-2,4-pentanediolSIRASsingle isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering 1The abbreviations used are:IPPisopentenyl diphosphateDOXP1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphateMEP2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphateCDP-ME4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritolMECDP2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphateMPD2-methyl-2,4-pentanediolSIRASsingle isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering units, constitute a major class of both primary and secondary metabolites including, for example, the ubiquitous sterols as well as dolichols, plastochinones, carotenoids, the prenyl side chains of chlorophylls, and ubiquinones (1Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In archaea, fungi, and mammals, the central building block of isoprenoids, IPP, is formed from acetyl-CoA via the classical mevalonate pathway that was described in the 1950s (reviewed in Ref.2Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. 1. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1981: 1-46Google Scholar). Only about 8 years ago, however, the existence of an alternative IPP biosynthesis pathway was established (3Rohmer M. Knani M. Simonin P. Sutter B. Sahm H. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The first step, in which the condensation of pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate leads to the formation of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) under release of CO2, is catalyzed by DOXP synthase. Subsequently, DOXP reductoisomerase mediates an intramolecular rearrangement followed by reduction using NADPH as hydrogen donor with 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) as product. In addition to NADPH, this reaction depends on the presence of divalent cations, with Mn2+ being most effective (4Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In subsequent steps, MEP is cytidylated by the enzyme CDP-ME synthetase under release of pyrophosphate and phosphorylated by CDP-ME kinase to yield 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate (CDP-ME-2-phosphate). This intermediate is then cyclized by MECDP synthase under release of CMP, resulting in the formation of 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECDP) (reviewed in Ref. 5Eisenreich W. Rohdich F. Bacher A. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The remaining terminal steps necessary for the synthesis of IPP are largely unknown as yet, although two genes controlling these steps, gcpE and lytB, have been characterized (6Altincicek B Kollas A.-K. Sanderbrand S. Wiesner J. Hintz M. Beck E. Jomaa H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2411-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Altincicek B. Kollas A.-K. Eberl M Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Hintz M. Beck E. Jomaa H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This second IPP biosynthesis pathway has been named the MEP pathway after its key metabolite and accounts for the production of IPP in many bacteria, in green algae, in the plastids of higher plants (plant cytoplasmic IPP is synthesized via the mevalonate pathway) (8Rohmer M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), as well as in the apicoplast of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria (9Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Türbachova I. Eberl M. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Given the essential nature of isoprenoids and the fact that IPP is synthesized in mammals (and thus in man) via the mevalonate pathway, enzymes involved in the MEP pathway are promising targets for the design of herbicidal, antibacterial, and antimalarial substances. DOXP reductoisomerase has attracted particular interest because fosmidomycin and FR-900098, inhibitors that mimic the presumed reaction intermediate, 2-C-methyl-d-erythrose 4-phosphate, not only possess herbicidal activity but also kill P. falciparum. Moreover, mice infected with the rodent malaria parasitePlasmodium vinckei can be cured by intraperitoneal or oral treatment with fosmidomycin or FR-900098 (9Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Türbachova I. Eberl M. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Finally, preliminary data from clinical phase II studies in Gabon and Thailand prove that DOXP reductoisomerase is an effective target for the chemotherapy of malaria. 2B. Lell, D. Hutchinson, R.

In this study we present the crystal structure of Escherichia coli DOXP reductoisomerase as a first step to understanding its mode of action on a structural basis, providing a starting point for more effective drug design. After the 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol synthetase published recently (10Richard S.B. Bowman M.E. Kwiatkowski W. Kang I. Chow C. Lillo A.M. Cane D.E. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct.

The amplified gene was inserted into the pQE9 overexpression vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) via aBamHI and a HindIII restriction site introduced by the primers (restriction sites are underlined). This resulted in adxr gene in which the encoded protein was endowed with an amino-terminal His6-tag separated from the original amino-terminal methionine by a glycine and a serine residue. This plasmid was transformed into the E. coli host strain XL1-blue pREP. Gene expression was induced in Standard I medium (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), supplemented with ampicillin (150 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml), by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at mid-log phase at 27 °C for 11 h. Bacteria from a 1.4-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and disintegrated by sonication. After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 25,000 × gfor 30 min the supernatant was filtrated over a 0.2-μm filter and loaded onto a Talon superflow column (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) washed with 8 mm imidazole. The enzyme eluted with 50 mm imidazole in buffer A and was rebuffered in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using a prepacked PD10 Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The protein was further purified on a source 15 Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) developed with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Final purification was carried out by gel filtration using an XK 16/60 Superdex 75 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl. The protein was concentrated for crystallization to 15 mg ml−1 using a YM-30 ultrafiltration unit (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). All chromatographic steps were carried out with a high performance liquid chromatography device (Gynkotek, Germany). The purification steps were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DOXP reductoisomerase activity was assayed as described previously. The native molecular weight of DOXP reductoisomerase was determined by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 0.150 m NaCl in 0.05 msodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 ml. The molecular weight was estimated by comparing the DOXP reductoisomerase elution with the standard molecular size markers (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.): thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Crystallization experiments were performed at 18 °C in Linbro plates using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Initially, a factorial screening was carried out using the 96 solutions of an in-house crystal screen kit. A drop of 1.5 μl of protein solution (15 mg ml−1 protein solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and sealed against 0.5 ml of reservoir solution. Small crystals appeared after a period of 3 days in 2 m sodium formate buffered with 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.3. Refinement of these conditions lead to a reservoir solution containing 1.5 m sodium acetate buffered with 150 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.1. When 2 μl of the refined reservoir solution were added to 2 μl of protein solution, crystals grew to a size of 400 × 300 × 200 μm. These crystals diffracted on our in-house rotating-anode generator (Rigaku RU-300 operating at 50 kV and 100 mA) equipped with focusing mirrors and an R-AXIS IV image plate (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX) to a resolution of not better than 5 Å. The diffraction ability of the crystals was significantly improved by treatment with 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), which reduces the electrostatic screening capacity of the intervening solvent molecules within the crystal (11McPherson A. McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Crystals were first transferred to stabilization buffer (2 m sodium formate, 100 μm sodium acetate, pH 5.1) and subsequently incubated in stabilization buffer containing 5% MPD for several hours (a time range of at least 2 days was well tolerated by the crystals). Finally the crystals were transferred to stabilization buffer containing 10% MPD for at least 4 h but not more than 12 h. For data collection, crystals treated in this manner were flash-frozen in stabilization buffer containing 20% MPD as a cryoprotectant. From such MPD-treated crystals, data sets up to a resolution of 3.5 Å could be recorded in-house (data not shown). For a multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment, trials were undertaken to crystallize a selenomethionine-labeled DOXP reductoisomerase produced according to Ref. 12VanDuyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, which showed an enzymatic activity comparable with that of the natural enzyme. Using the same crystallization conditions as for the natural enzyme, however, the selenomethionyl derivative produced a high number of very small crystals not suited for data collection. Decreasing the protein or precipitant concentration abolished the ability of selenomethionyl DOXP reductoisomerase to crystallize at all. As an alternative, a gold derivative was obtained by soaking a native crystal with 0.1 mm KAu(CN)2 added to all buffers used for MPD treatment. X-ray data used for structure determination and refinement were collected on the MPG/GBF wiggler beam line BW6 of the “Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron” (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany, equipped with a MAR CCD and on beam lines ID14-1 and ID14-4 of the “European Synchrotron Radiation Facility” (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, equipped with a MAR CCD or an ADSC Quantum 4 detector, respectively. A native data set was collected on beam line BW6 (λ = 1.05 Å) to a resolution of 2.9 Å, an additional native data set was obtained on beam line ID14-4 (λ = 1.04 Å) to a resolution of 2.5 Å, and a data set of a gold derivative on beam line ID14-1 (λ = 0.934 Å) to a resolution of 3.0 Å (Table I). All data were indexed and integrated using DENZO (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar) and scaled with the program SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The DOXP reductoisomerase crystals belong to space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 101.2 Å, b= 249.3 Å, c = 132.1 Å and three monomers per asymmetric unit, yielding a solvent content of 60.9%.Table ICrystallographic dataData collection (beam line)Native (ID14–4)Native (BW6)KAu(CN)2 (ID14–1)Crystal Resolution (Å)30.0–2.530.0–2.930.0–3.0 Wavelength (Å)1.0401.0500.934 Number of observed reflections242921135815224185 Number of unique reflections578103730433775 Completeness1-aNumber in parentheses is for highest resolution shell.98.4 (99.5)99.6 (100)99.8 (100) I/ς1-aNumber in parentheses is for highest resolution shell.28.9 (5.1)29.8 (5.3)23.3 (4.2) R sym1-aNumber in parentheses is for highest resolution shell.1-bRsym = Σ‖I − 〈I〉‖/ΣI, whereI is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity for multiple measurements.5.5 (27.9)3.7 (24.7)6.2 (24.7)Phasing and Refinement Number of sites8 Mean FOM1-cFOM, figure of merit.0.35 R-factor1-dR-factor = Σ‖F o −F c‖/Σ‖F o‖, whereF o and F c are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.23.2 R free1-eRfree is the cross-validation R-factor calculated for 10% of the reflections omitted in the refinement process.28.4Deviations from ideal geometry Bond length (Å)0.007 Bond angles (°)1.301-a Number in parentheses is for highest resolution shell.1-b Rsym = Σ‖I − 〈I〉‖/ΣI, whereI is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity for multiple measurements.1-c FOM, figure of merit.1-d R-factor = Σ‖F o −F c‖/Σ‖F o‖, whereF o and F c are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.1-e Rfree is the cross-validation R-factor calculated for 10% of the reflections omitted in the refinement process. Open table in a new tab Phases were calculated via “single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering” (SIRAS) using the data set of a native crystal recorded on beam line BW6 of the DESY and a KAu(CN)2 derivative recorded on beam line ID14-1 of the ESRF at a wavelength of 0.934 Å (Table I). Phase-angle determination, refinement, and map calculations were performed using the program SOLVE (14Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) including RESOLVE for solvent flattening. Eight gold heavy atom sites were located. The 3.0-Å electron density map obtained from RESOLVE was of sufficient quality to permit unambiguous chain tracing without further refinement of the heavy atom sites. After model building using the program O (15Jones T.A. Kjeldegaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), refinement steps consisting of conjugate gradient minimization, simulated annealing, and B-factor refinement were carried out with the program CNS (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) using the 2.5-Å native data set recorded on beam line ID14-4 of the ESRF (Table I). Non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was applied only for residues 1–150 because the three protein molecules of the asymmetric unit are not superimposable along the entire polypeptide chain. The non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were released during the last cycles of refinement. The DOXP reductoisomerase coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1k5h) and will be released upon publication. We have solved the crystal structure of E. coli DOXP reductoisomerase by means of SIRAS using a KAu(CN)2 derivative at a wavelength of 0.934 Å. The final model was refined at 2.5 Å to an R-factor of 23.2% and anR free of 28.4% (TableI). The asymmetric unit contains three protein molecules, referred to as A, B, and C, respectively. The protein used for crystallization was recombinant full-length DOXP reductoisomerase with an amino-terminal His6-tag spaced by two amino acids (Gly-Ser) from the original protein. The six amino-terminal histidines as well as the two spacer amino acid residues of all protein molecules within the asymmetric unit are disordered in the crystal and therefore not visible in the electron density map. In contrast, the Met residue corresponding to the amino-terminal Met of the original DOXP reductoisomerase is well defined for all molecules and represents residue 1 in our numbering system. Molecule C of the present structure determination displays all 398 residues of the original enzyme. The same holds true for molecule A, although a loop region between residues 186 and 216 is in part not well defined in the electron density map. The conformations of these residues in the model, in particular those of residues A205 to A211, must be regarded as tentative. For molecule B, no electron density could be observed for residues B212 to B215, residue B369, and the C-terminal two residues. These amino acids were omitted from the model. The Ramachandran plot calculated with the program PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) shows no residues with angular values in forbidden areas: 88.9% of the non-glycine residues are in the most favored regions, 10.5% are in additional allowed regions. The remaining residues within generously allowed regions belong mainly to the above mentioned loop region (amino acids 186 and 216), which is not well defined in two of the monomers. DOXP reductoisomerase consists of three domains arranged to form an overall V-shaped molecule (Fig. 2 A). The amino-terminal domain, stretching from residues 1–150, forms one arm of the V and represents a typical dinucleotide binding motif responsible for NADP(H) binding. In contrast to the canonical dinucleotide binding motif, which is a parallel six-stranded β sheet with helices on both sides of the sheet (18Branden C. Tooze J. Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1991: 144-147Google Scholar), the amino-terminal domain of DOXP reductoisomerase contains a seven-stranded parallel β sheet due to the insertion of an additional α-β motif into its amino-terminal Rossmann fold (Fig.2 B). The carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 312–398) is a four-helix bundle and forms the second arm of the V. The apical region of the V is formed by a connective α/β domain, which represents to the best of our knowledge a novel fold, as revealed by a structural homology search using the program DALI (19Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). The platform of this domain is a four-stranded parallel/antiparallel “open-faced” β sheet, meaning that the loops and helices cover only one side of the β sheet. An extended loop connects the terminal structural element of the connective domain, α helix 11, to the carboxyl-terminal four-helix bundle motif, spanning the whole domain. A remarkable feature of DOXP reductoisomerase is its intrinsic flexibility, observed directly in the crystal. Superposition of the dinucleotide binding domains of protein molecules A, B, and C results in several corresponding Cα atoms of the four-helix bundles and the connective domains becoming separated by more than 3 Å so that the connective domain may also be thought of as a hinge (Fig.3). An even more pronounced flexibility is observed for the loop region within the connective domain which connects β strand 8 and α helix 9 (residues 186–216). For molecule C, the electron density for this loop is excellently defined. In this conformer, the loop folds back toward the four-helix bundle, with only the carboxyl-terminal end of the loop protruding somewhat away from the inside of the V. A very similar conformation for this loop is observed for molecule B, although for residues B212 to B215, no electron density is observed. In molecule A, however, this loop adopts a completely different conformation. Although the density corresponding to this loop is in part not well defined, the course of its main chain is unambiguous. The carboxyl-terminal portion of the loop forms an amino-terminal extension to α helix 9 compared with the B and C monomers. The loop reaches over the putative active site (see below) toward the dinucleotide binding domain, where it touches the loop connecting β strand 1 and α helix 1. It thereby bridges the complete cleft of the V (Figs. 2 A and 3). Both conformations observed for this loop (which we term the “lid”) in the DOXP reductoisomerase crystal are clearly influenced and stabilized by crystal packing. It is thus in question whether they reflect stable conformations in solution. However, the different conformational states of the loop indicate a strong dynamic behavior likely to be linked to the functional properties of this enzyme in substrate binding and catalysis. The probable quaternary form of DOXP reductoisomerase was reported to be a homotetramer according to gel filtration and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments (4Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In the crystal, however, the molecules clearly assemble into homodimers. The dimerization partner of molecule A is another symmetry-related molecule A' (interaction surface area 1621 Å2, defined as the buried surface area per subunit, calculated using AREAIMOL (20CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar)), whereas B and C form a second dimer (interaction surface area 1660 Å2). In each case, dimerization occurs equivalently via the connective domains, the four-stranded β sheets of which combine to an extended eight-stranded β sheet through antiparallel juxtaposition of β strands 11 of each molecule. The connective domains of the dimerization partners thereby assemble to a saddle-like structure. The loop connecting α helix 11 with α helix 12 also contributes to dimer formation by interacting with the same loop of the other monomer, thereby shielding the inner surface of the saddle (Fig. 4). No further contacts between the symmetry independent monomers are common to all molecules; these contact areas are also considerably smaller (one C-C' contact of 924 Å2 and two A-B' contacts of 768 and 750 Å2, respectively). The dimer observed in the crystal agrees with our experimental evidence obtained by size exclusion chromatography, where DOXP reductoisomerase runs with an apparent molecular mass of 86 kDa (calculated molecular mass of the monomer: 43.5 kDa). DOXP reductoisomerase has a deep and wide cleft as a consequence of its overall V-like shape. This cleft would appear to be predestined to harbor the substrate binding and catalytic site. This assumption is confirmed by the relative orientation of the dinucleotide binding domain with respect to the remaining enzyme. The binding site for NADPH in DOXP reductoisomerase could be inferred through superposition of the DOXP reductoisomerase dinucleotide binding domain to that of glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (21Kingston R.L. Scopes R.K. Baker E., N. Structure. 1996; 4: 1413-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (PDB accession code1ofg) whose structure has been determined in complex with the cofactor. This enzyme was chosen as its dinucleotide binding domain has the highest similarity to that of DOXP reductoisomerase according to the scoring in DALI (19Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). Following superposition, slight manual adjustments of the NADPH moiety allowed its accommodation in DOXP reductoisomerase. The backbone amides of Gly11 and Ser12 would coordinate the pyrophosphate moiety, whereas those of Ala35 and Gly36 are suitably placed to accommodate the 2′-phosphate. The nicotinamide group (which was flipped 180° with respect to that seen in glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, corresponding to the orientation seen in acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (22Biou V. Dumas R. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Job D. Pebay-Peyroula E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) is thereby positioned in such a way that the DOXP substrate must bind in the cleft (Fig.5). This presumed substrate binding site at the bottom of this cleft, at the conjunction of all three domains, indeed harbors most of the hydrophilic amino acids that are strictly conserved among all DOXP reductoisomerases with known sequence. Among these are a number of acidic residues, namely Asp150, Glu152, Glu231, and Glu234, which cluster in the putative substrate binding site (see Fig. 5) and are likely to complex the manganese ion(s) required for reductoisomerase activity. In the present apo form of the enzyme, these acidic residues form a network of salt bridges with the highly conserved basic residues Lys125, His153, and Lys228. It should be noted, however, that these acidic and basic residues do not adopt the same conformations in all monomers of the asymmetric unit, resulting in slight differences in the salt bridge network. The distinct conformations of these residues appear to be induced by the overall conformational differences observed in the crystal packing of the independent molecules. These changes clearly influence the relative positions of Cα atoms within the substrate binding site due to the high flexibility of the connective domain. The carboxylate oxygens of Asp150, Glu152, and Glu231 are remarkably close to one another (3–3.5 Å) in all monomers, suggesting that they might form weak hydrogen bonds. This raises questions as to their protonation states, which can, however, not be answered unambiguously due to the moderate resolution of the present structure. In a recent study, five strictly conserved residues, namely Gly14, Glu231, His153, His209, and His257, were mutated in theE. coli DOXP reductoisomerase to learn about their functions (23Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Takagi M. Seto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19928-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The Gly14 → Asp mutated enzyme has been reported to be insoluble. As suggested by the authors, this residue is part of the NADP(H) binding motif. Mutation of Glu231 to Lys was reported to result in an enzyme with a significantly decreasedk cat but almost unchanged K mfor both DOXP and NADPH, suggesting that this residue is involved in catalysis rather than substrate or cofactor binding. Likewise the His153 → Gln mutant enzyme reveals a 10-fold decrease ink cat, suggesting that this residue might also play a crucial role in catalysis. Glu231 and His153 are part of the putative DOXP binding pocket and catalytic center of the enzyme as discussed above. His209and His257 have each been changed in Ref. 23Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Takagi M. Seto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19928-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar to Gln, resulting in both cases in mutant enzymes with significantly decreased affinities toward DOXP as shown by increased K mvalues. His257 is located in the presumed DOXP binding pocket/catalytic center and is in close proximity to the cluster of acidic residues discussed above. It makes a weak hydrogen bond (3.4 Å) to the invariant Ser151. His209 is part of the variable lid connecting β strand 8 and α helix 9 (see above). In all three monomers, this residue is at a large distance from the putative substrate binding and catalytic site. E. coli DOXP reductoisomerase, which is present as a dimer in the present crystal structure, is composed of three domains: an amino-terminal dinucleotide binding domain, a carboxyl-terminal four-helix bundle, and a connective domain that mediates the formation of the dimer. The three domains together form a V-shaped molecule with a wide and deep cleft harboring a significant portion of the substrate and cofactor binding site and thus the catalytic center. The latter comprises a cluster of strictly conserved acidic amino acids that in the present apo structure form a set of salt bridges to adjacent basic residues which are, interestingly enough, also invariant. This is strongly reminiscent of the situation in acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, which catalyzes a similar reaction to DOXP reductoisomerase. The crystal structure of this enzyme has been determined in complex with NADPH, Mg2+, and a transition state analogue (22Biou V. Dumas R. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Job D. Pebay-Peyroula E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1ylv). Here, two catalytic Mg2+ ions are complexed by the inhibitor and by a cluster of acidic residues. It therefore seems likely that the corresponding acidic residues positioned at the base of the DOXP reductoisomerase binding cleft are also involved in complexation of at least one divalent cation because it is known that the catalyzed reaction depends on Mn2+ (4Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9879-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Although there is neither sequence nor structural homology between acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase and DOXP reductoisomerase (apart from a common amino-terminal dinucleotide binding motif present in both enzymes), DOXP reductoisomerase presumably operates in a similar fashion to acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase. The crystal structure of the latter enzyme shows that the inhibitor, the Mg2+ ions, and the nicotinamide moiety of the NADPH cofactor are completely buried from solvent within the enzyme. This implies that a conformational change must take place during the binding process. Indeed, it has been shown that this enzyme follows a sequential mechanism in which NADPH and Mg2+ ions bind first and independently followed by the substrate (24Halgand F. Dumas R. Biou V. Andrieu J.-P. Thomazeau K. Gagnon J. Douce R. Forest E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There is evidence that binding of the Mg2+to the enzyme-NADPH cofactor complex triggers a slight conformational transition of the enzyme. Subsequent binding of the competitive inhibitor or substrate to the NADPH-Mg2+-enzyme complex induces a further, drastic conformational change. The crystal structure of apoDOXP reductoisomerase gives strong hints that a similar induced fit could occur for this enzyme upon substrate binding. (i) The cleft containing at least part of the catalytic center/substrate binding site is highly exposed to bulk solvent in the present apo form, making it questionable whether specific and tight binding of the relatively small substrate can be achieved. (ii) The connective and carboxyl-terminal four-helix bundle domains show a significant mobility with respect to the amino-terminal NADPH binding domain based on the comparison of the three conformational states present in the asymmetric unit. This intrinsic domain flexibility might reflect a necessity to undergo an induced fit upon substrate binding. (iii) The variable lid spanning residues 186–216 is capable of adopting at least two completely different conformations within the three protein conformers observed in the asymmetric unit. This flexible loop most likely folds over the active site upon substrate binding, shielding the reactants completely from the solvent environment, similarly to the conditions in acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase. The closing up of the binding site by the flexible lid could possibly form a stringent and highly specific binding pocket that displays drastically modified dielectric conditions due to complete burial from the solvent environment. This might be a prerequisite for the tight binding of a highly charged substrate and the subsequent enzymatic steps. This assumption is supported by the fact that the lid harbors the strictly conserved His209 residue, which has been shown to be involved in substrate binding (23Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Takagi M. Seto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19928-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The conformations of the lid adopted in the apoenzyme show this residue at a great distance to the presumed active site. To obtain better insight to the dynamics of this enzyme along with the detailed reaction mechanism, the crystal structure of ligand-bound DOXP reductoisomerase is required.

The neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor undergoes fast desensitization. We examined agonist-induced signaling and internalization using NPY Y1 receptors fused to green fluorescent protein (EGFP). When expressed in HEK293 cells, EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptors were localized at the plasma membrane, desensitized rapidly as assessed using calcium responses, and had similar properties compared to hNPY Y1 receptors. Upon agonist challenge, the EGFP signal decreased rapidly ( t12 = 107 ± 3 s) followed by a slow recovery. This decrease was blocked by BIBP3226, a Y1 receptor antagonist, or by pertussis toxin, in agreement with Y1 receptor activation. Internalization of EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptors to acidic endosomal compartments likely accounts for the decrease in the EGFP signal, being absent after pretreatment with monensin. Concanavalin A and hypertonic sucrose, which inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, blocked the decrease in fluorescence. After agonist, intracellular EGFP signals were punctate and co-localized with transferrin-Texas Red, a marker of clathrin-associated internalization and recycling, but not with LysoTracker Red, a lysosomal pathway marker, supporting receptor trafficking to recycling endosomes rather than the late endosomal/lysosomal pathway. Pulse-chase experiments revealed no receptor degradation after internalization. The slow recovery of fluorescence was unaffected by cycloheximide or actinomycin D, indicating that de novo synthesis of receptors was not limiting. Use of a multicompartment model to fit our fluorescence data allows simultaneous determination of internalization and recycling rate constants.

NPY modulates numerous physiological processes including regulation of cardiovascular and renal functions, intestinal motility, memory, anxiety, seizures, feeding, circadian rhythms, and nociception (4Blomqvist A.G.

From expression cloning and pharmacological studies with various truncated peptide fragments or with endogenously produced peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), 5 distinct NPY receptor subtypes have been so far identified: Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and y6 (6Michel M.C. Beck-Sickinger A. Cox H. Doods H.N. Herzog H. Larhammar D. Quirion R. Schwartz T. Westfall T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). The most common actions of these receptor subtypes are inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding proteins Gi/Go and/or phospholipase C activation and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. neuropeptide Y human neuropeptide Y human peptide YY human pancreatic polypeptide enhanced green fluorescent protein G protein-coupled receptor human embryonic kidney Chinese hamster ovary inhibitory GTP-binding protein of adenylyl cyclase phycoerythrin pertussis toxin {(R)-N 2-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-d-arginine amide} green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin intracellular calcium The wide spectrum of expression of the NPY Y1 receptor subtype and data from knock-out studies suggests that the Y1 receptor mediates many of the physiological and pathophysiological actions of NPY (7Kushi A.

However, the physiological role and potential therapeutic implications of NPY and the Y1 receptor have been difficult to establish due to a lack of selective pharmacological tools. Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Y1 receptors should contribute to a better understanding of the physiological roles of NPY. Prolonged activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) leads to a greatly decreased sensitivity of the receptor to a subsequent agonist challenge (10Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, termed desensitization, is a general physiological mechanism by which receptors adapt to a changing environment. The molecular mechanisms that lead to agonist-dependent desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors are not fully defined, but several distinct events are involved, including uncoupling of receptors from their heterotrimeric G proteins and reduction in the number of receptors at the cell surface by either internalization or down-regulation which may be associated with degradation (11Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 12Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

Internalization is thought to be initiated by receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and binding of β-arrestin to phosphorylated receptors, leading to targeting to clathrin-coated pits (14Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 15Goodman O.B., Jr. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V.

For example, internalization of receptors has been suggested to be the mechanism for somatostatin receptor desensitization (16Beaumont V. Hepworth M.B. Luty J.S. Kelly E. Henderson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33174-33183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the dynamic relationships between internalization, desensitization, and down-regulation are far from being well understood. Desensitization of NPY receptor responsiveness occurs after NPY exposure in isolated organ preparations (17Van Riper D.A. Bevan J.A. Circ.

Rapid desensitization of NPY-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization occurs in HEL cells and involves multiple effectors including PKC and tyrosine kinase (22Michel M.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, neither the underlying molecular mechanisms nor the intracellular trafficking pathways involved are well known. Recent studies indicate that endogenous Y1 receptors in SK-N-MC neuroblastoma (23Fabry M. Langer M. Rothen-Rutishauser B. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Hocker H. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Eur. J.

Li M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are internalized. On the other hand, in pharmacological studies, hNPY Y4 receptors expressed in CHO cells were resistant to desensitization and internalization (25Voisin T. Goumain M. Lorinet A.M. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 638-646PubMed Google Scholar), although in radioligand studies, rat Y4 receptors expressed in CHO cells were found to be internalized (24Parker S.L.

The development of fusion proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) allows real time analysis of membrane receptor trafficking, including synthesis and degradation, in single cells (26Kallal L.

In the present work, EGFP was fused to the NH2-terminal of the full-length human NPY Y1 and Y2 receptors and these chimeric constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells. The functional properties of fluorescent hNPY Y1 receptors were similar to those of wild-type hNPY Y1 receptors after transfection in these cells, and were the same as found for NPY Y1 receptor-mediated responses in SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells (27Fuhlendorff J.

The hNPY Y1 receptor sequence was subcloned in the expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) between theHindIII and NotI sites to yield pCEP4-hNPY Y1. The sp-EGFP sequence was excised from pCEP4-sp-EGFP-NK2R (31Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol.

The hNPY Y1receptor sequence was excised from pCEP4-hNPY Y1 usingBglII and BamHI. The two sequences were subcloned in pCEP4 between the HindIII and BamHI sites to yield pCEP4-sp-EGFP-hNPY Y1. HEK293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) and selected with 4000 μg/ml hygromycin B. EGFP-hNPY Y1 and hNPY Y1receptors were expressed stably for about 2 months (10 cell passages). EGFP-hNPY Y2 receptors were constructed and transfected in HEK293 cells using analogous procedures. NPY receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase was investigated by measuring the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of NPY and related peptide analogues on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Near confluent HEK293 cultures expressing wild type hNPY Y1 or EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptors were harvested and seeded in 24-well plates coated with collagen (60 μg/ml) at an initial density of 50,000. After 3–4 days of culture (∼80% confluency), the cells were treated as previously described for CHP 234 neuroblastoma cells (33Lynch J.W. Lemos V.S. Bucher B. Stoclet J.C. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8226-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with 0.5 ml of PBS (in mm: 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 0.9 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 6.5 Na2HPO4, 1.5 KH2PO4, pH 7.2), and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 0.5 ml assay buffer (in mm: 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 25 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, 10 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4). After removal of buffer, 0.45 ml of fresh buffer containing 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) was added for 10 min and cells were exposed to 10 μm forskolin without and with peptides (10−12-10−6m) for 20 min at 37 °C. We found that at this submaximal forskolin concentration, cAMP levels reach a maximum within 20 min (Fig. 1 E). The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 volume of ice-cold 0.2m HCl. Cells were further disrupted by sonication and suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatants were stored at −20 °C until determination of cAMP by radioimmunoassay (34Cailla H.L. Racine-Weisbuch M.S. Delaage M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To study agonist-dependent desensitization of the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C without or with either 1 or 100 nm hNPY. The cells were then washed with incubation medium to remove unbound hNPY during 10 min and thereafter assayed as above using different concentrations of hNPY for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. For imaging studies, HEK293 cells transfected with EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptors were plated at low density (5–8 × 105 cells/dish) in culture dishes in which a 2-cm diameter hole had been cut in the base and replaced by a thin (0.17-mm) glass coverslip. Measurements of [Ca2+] i were made as previously described (33Lynch J.W. Lemos V.S. Bucher B. Stoclet J.C. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8226-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in complete medium containing in addition 2.5 μm fura 2/acetoxymethyl ester (fura 2/AM), then washed and left equilibrated for 10 min in normal external bath solution (in mm: NaCl, 140; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 2; glucose, 11; HEPES, 10; pH 7.3 with NaOH). Single-cell fluorescence measurements were made at 37 °C on an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) using a ×40 oil immersion objective (Nikon UV-Fluor, numerical aperture 1.3) and an imaging system (Imstar, Paris, France). Fura-2 was excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm using a 100-watt Hg lamp. Emitted fluorescence was filtered at 510 ± 20 nm using a bandpass filter (Nikon) and measured with a Darkstar-800 intensified CCD camera (Photonics Sciences, Millham, United Kingdom). Images were digitized onto a computer and analyzed using Imstar software. Ratiometric Ca2+ images were generated at 3-s intervals, using 4 averaged images at each wavelength. After background subtraction, [Ca2+] i was averaged from pixels within manually outlined cell areas. Values of [Ca2+] i were calculated as reported before (33Lynch J.W. Lemos V.S. Bucher B. Stoclet J.C. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8226-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NPY or carbachol was locally microperfused during 1 min by pressure-ejection (10 kPa) from fine diameter (2 μm) puffer pipettes positioned ∼100–20 μm from the cell. For washout between successive agonist applications, the bath (volume 1.5 ml) was superfused at ∼1 ml/min. Transfected HEK293 cells were grown on 35-mm plastic dishes and when needed, preincubated with different drugs in complete medium. Cells were then washed with PBS, harvested after incubation in a PBS-EDTA, 5 mm buffer, pH 7.4, and resuspended in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing or not drugs used for preincubation. Fluorescence acquisitions were made from cell suspensions using a spectrofluorimeter (Fluorolog, SPEX) equipped with a 450-watt Xe lamp, a double grating excitation monochromator, and a single grating emission monochromator. Slits were set to 4 mm yielding bandwidths of 7.2 nm at excitation and 14.4 nm at emission. Data were acquired with a photon counting photomultiplier (linear up to 107 counts/s). Unless otherwise stated, cell suspensions (106 cells/ml) were placed in a 1-ml cuvette with magnetic stirring and maintained at 37 °C in a thermostatted cuvette handler. Time base recordings were typically made every 1 s. For endosome/EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptor co-localization, cells were split and grown for 2 days in 24-well plates on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with rat type I collagen. On the day of experiment, cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer buffer (in mm: 136 NaCl, 1.8 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 5 NaHCO3, 1.2 CaCl2, 0.21 EGTA, 5.5 glucose, 20 Hepes, 1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4). Cells were then starved by 1 h incubation in serum-free medium. The cells were then incubated for periods ranging from 0 to 60 min in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 20 μg/ml transferrin-Texas Red with or without 100 nm hNPY at 37 °C. Transferrin uptake was stopped by placing cells on ice and washing them immediately with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/Krebs-Ringer buffer (without glucose and BSA) for 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated for 15 min in NH4Cl 50 mm toquench any remaining paraformaldehyde and remove cellular autofluorescence. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using an anti-fading agent, Mowiol (Calbiochem). Cells were observed with an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) and a laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES) using a Plan Apo 60 × 1.20 numerical aperture water immersion objective (Nikon). Electronic zoom was 2, the pinhole was 2.7, and the pixel size was 0.275 μm. Excitation was from a 30 mW Kr/Ar laser at 10% power. Each stack of two-dimensional images was acquired sequentially in the green channel (PMT2, excitation 488, emission 522 nm) and in the red channel (PMT1, excitation 568 nm, emission 605 nm), before stepping (0.3 μm) the objective in theZ axis. For lysosome/EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptor co-localization, images were acquired from living cells. Cells were split and grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips which formed the base of 35-mm plastic dishes. On the day of experiment, cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer buffer, and then incubated for 0 to 60 min in buffer containing 50 nm LysoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) with or without 100 nm hNPY at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by placing cells on ice, and washing them with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer. Images were acquired as described for transferrin-Texas Red-EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptor co-localization. Co-localization analysis was done using AnalyzeAVW 3.0 software installed on a Silicon Graphics work station. The product of red (transferrin-Texas Red or LysoTracker Red) and green (EGFP) images was calculated, and co-localized yellow regions of interest were defined using a threshold of 10% of maximum product intensity. Volume measurements were made from image stacks using in-house developed View3d software in the PV Wave environment. After segmentation and suppression of isolated voxels using a binary filter, the volume and intensity of co-localized voxels were calculated. HEK293 cells transfected or not with EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptors were plated on 6-well plates (Falcon) pre-coated with collagen in 3 ml of complete medium and grown for 2 days. Cells were then preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1 ml/well labeling medium without fetal calf serum (minimal essential medium without methionine and without cysteine, Invitrogen) and, unless otherwise stated, radiolabeled for 90 min in 1 ml/well labeling medium + 1% fetal calf serum + 0.1 mCi/well [35S]methionine-cysteine (Promix, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and then washed for 15 min in chase medium (complete minimal essential medium supplemented with 1 × cold methionine + cysteine and 20 μm cycloheximide). Cells were exposed or not to 400 nm hNPY in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer for 10 min in the incubator. Thereafter, they were incubated in 1 ml of chase medium containing 100 μm cycloheximide for 0 to 7 h. At the end of the chase, cells were detached from the substratum with 1.6 ml of Versene buffer (PBS + 5 mm EDTA) and centrifuged in 2-ml tubes at low speed (825 × g, 3 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was then processed for immunoprecipitation. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol and 1 tablet of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (for 10 ml of buffer, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by passing the cells 100 times through a 22-guage syringe and discarding the pelleted material obtained after 10 min centrifugation at 367 × g. The membranes of the supernatant were solubilized by adding 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS and vortexing for 30 min at room temperature. Unsolubilized material was pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and discarded. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibody (1 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein A-Sepharose (45 mg) prewashed in H2O was equilibrated in washing buffer (lysis buffer + 1% Triton X-100) and incubated overnight with 800 μl of washing buffer + 1% BSA + 0.2% SDS + 10% cold HEK lysate. The next day, the EGFP-hNPY Y1-anti-GFP complex was bound to Protein A-Sepharose (7.5 mg/1 ml) for 1 h at 4 °C and sedimented by 1 min centrifugation at 367 × g. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed 3 times and resuspended twice in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol). Samples were vortexed for 30 min at room temperature and heated at 55 °C for 10 min prior to loading on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. For quantification, gels were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed for radioactivity after 48 h exposition in a PhosphorImager cassette. For immunoblotting, blots were incubated with an affinity purified polyclonal antibody against EGFP made in our laboratory, followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxydase (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignalTMWestPico, PerboScience, France). Cells expressing EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptors were suspended in 20 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer at a concentration of 106 cells/ml and the suspension was separated into 2 tubes of 10 ml. 100 nm NPY was added to one of the tubes and at times 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min later, 900 μl of the cell suspension were collected from both tubes and fixed by transfer to a 2-ml tube containing 900 μl of 8% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% sodium azide in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were pelleted by centifugation (3 min, 2000 × g) at 4 °C and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS + 1% BSA on ice for 10 min to 2 h to block nonspecific antibody labeling. Immunolabeling of EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptors expressed at the cell surface was done using a monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 1/1000 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Cell were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of PBS + 1% BSA and secondary labeling done using a R-phycoerythrin-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (Immunotech, Marseille; 1/1000). Samples were washed 3 times in 1 ml of PBS, fixed for 3 min in PBS + 4% paraformaldehyde, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and stored overnight. Phycoerythrin (PE) staining was quantified by flow cytometric analysis (10,000 cells per sample) on a cytometer (FACStar, Becton-Dickinson). Mean PE fluorescence intensity was calculated only from cells having high EGFP intensities using FACStar data software, after subtraction of nonspecific staining by the two antibodies measured on nontransfected cells and correction for baseline variations using EGFP-hNPY Y1 cells not exposed to agonist. hNPY, hNPY-(13–36), hPYY, and hPP were from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). All other chemicals were from Sigma. BIBP3226 and BIIE0246 were kindly supplied by Dr. H. Doods (Boehringer Ingelheim, Biberach, Germany). HEK293 cells, which lack endogenous Y1 receptors, were transfected with native hNPY Y1 or fluorescent EGFP-hNPY Y1 receptors. Expression of fluorescent receptors was confirmed by the characteristic excitation and emission spectra of EGFP (data not shown), and plasma membrane localization was verified in confocal micrographs (see Fig.7). To determine whether the transfected receptors were functional, coupling to adenylyl cyclase was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation following receptor activation (Fig. 1). Responses were obtained with NPY and related peptide analogues and in the presence of BIBP3226, a selective Y1 antagonist. In control HEK293 cells, hNPY (10−12-10−6m) had no effect, confirming the absence of endogenously expressed functional NPY receptors (not shown). Both hNPY and hPYY inhibited cAMP accumulation in cells expressing hNPY Y1 and EGFP-hNPY Y1receptors (Fig. 1, A and C; EC50values for hNPY were 0.21 ± 0.09 and 0.09 ± 0.03 nm for Y1 and EGFP Y1 cells, respectively; p > 0.05; EC50 values for hPYY were 0.40 ± 0.14 and 0.03 ± 0.01 nm for Y1 and EGFP Y1 cells, respectively;p < 0.05; differences between means were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test). We obtained comparable EC50 values for Y1 receptors in SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells (0.09 ± 0.02 and 0.10 ± 0.02 nm for hNPY and hPYY, respectively; not shown), in agreement with previous reports (27Fuhlendorff J. Gether U. Aakerlund L. Langeland-Johansen N. Thogersen H. Melberg S.G. Olsen U.B. Thastrup O. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Compared with hNPY and hPYY, the partial Y1 agonist hNPY-(13–36) was much less potent (EC50 values of 17.50 ± 1.65 and 3.27 ± 0.77 nm for Y1 and EGFP Y1 cells respectively), and the Y4 agonist hPP was ineffective. This rank order of potency is as expected for Y1 receptors. The Y1 antagonist BIBP3226 induced a parallel rightwards shift in the hNPY dose-response curve with no change in the maximal effect for both hNPY Y1 and EGFP-hNPY Y1 expressing cells (Fig. 1, B and D),"

https://openalex.org/W1993363599,"Notch signaling is involved in many cell fate determination events in metazoans. Ligand binding results in proteolytic cleavage to release the signal-transducing Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The nuclear protein RBP-Jκ, when complexed with NICD, acts as a transcriptional activator which, in turn, induces a target gene of Notch such as the repressorsHES/E(spl) and HERP2. Under physiological stimulation using co-culture with Notch ligand-expressing cells and target cells expressing Notch receptors, the HES1gene and the HERP2 gene have been shown to be directly up-regulated by Notch ligand binding. However, expression of another member of the HERP family, HERP1, was not induced by ligand stimulation in any cells tested, leading to the suggestion that HERP1 may not be an immediate target of Notch or that Notch pathways can be cell type-specific. Because HERP1 appears to play a central role in the development of the aorta (Zhong, T. P., Rosenberg, M., Mohideen, M. A., Weinstein, B., and Fishman, M. C. (2000) Science 287, 1820–1824), we re-addressed the issue of its relationship with the Notch pathway by examining its expression in A10 smooth muscle cells derived from thoracic aorta. We show that in these specific cells HERP1is also a direct target gene of Notch. NICD activates theHERP1 promoter in an RBP-Jκ-dependent manner, and induces expression of endogenous HERP1 mRNA as well as HERP1 protein in A10 cells. Co-culture with Notch ligand-bearing cells induces endogenous HERP1 mRNA expression in A10 cells, and these events occur even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. In addition, RBP-Jκ proved essential for induction of HERP1 mRNA in Notch signaling because exogenous RBP-Jκ was sufficient to rescue HERP1 mRNA expression in RBP-Jκ-deficient cells. These findings provide the first solid evidence that HERP1 is a novel primary target of Notch and underscores the cell-specific complexity of the Notch regulatory pathway.

The evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway controls cell fate in metazoans through local cell-cell interactions. Specific intercellular contacts activate this highly complex signaling cascade leading to down-regulation or inhibition of cell type-specific transcriptional activators. Cells are thus forced to take on a secondary fate or remain undifferentiated while awaiting later inductive signals (5Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

There the NICD associates with a transcriptional factor, RBP-Jκ (CSL/CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1). In the absence of NICD, RBP-Jκ can act as a transcriptional repressor from its DNA-binding site (GTGGGAA) by associating with a co-repressor complex, and this association is disrupted in the presence of NICD (10Kao H.Y.

Although the invariant proline residue in the basic domain and the WRPW tetrapeptide at the carboxyl terminus in HES/E(spl) are replaced in HERPs by a glycine and by YRPW (or YQPW), their overall structures are still similar to each other. The high sequence similarity among them led us to speculate that the HERP gene family might be new targets of Notch like HES and E(spl). In line with this, several observations suggest that theHERP family appears to be downstream of Notch (13Kokubo H. Lun Y. Johnson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, this possibility requires more rigorous examination, because these conclusions rely primarily on experiments involving overexpression of the NICD transgene. In marked contrast to endogenous NICD, which is physiologically maintained at an extremely low concentration (8Mumm J. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 21Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), exogenously introduced NICD is expressed at easily detectable and supra-physiological levels (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G.

Osborne B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), such artificial unregulated overexpression of NICD by transient transfection could create misleading consequences. In fact, we have observed different results between NICD overexpression-induced and ligand-induced stimuli (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), clearly indicating the distinct nature of these stimuli. By co-culturing Notch receptor-bearing target cells with Notch ligand-expressing cells, we have previously shown that theHERP2 (but not HERP1) mRNA was selectively up-regulated in several cell lines including C2C12 and C3H10T1/2 cells even in the presence of cycloheximide suppression of protein synthesis (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These experiments established HERP2 as a direct target of Notch. In contrast, however, we found no measurable induction ofHERP1 mRNA in any of the ligand-stimulated cells that had shown marked induction of HERP2 mRNA. These observations suggested the presence of previously unappreciated differential regulatory mechanisms for the different HERP family members. Furthermore, whether HERP1 is a direct physiological target of Notch remains to be determined. A number of observations indicate that both the Notch signaling pathway and HERP1 play roles in vascular development. Many Notch pathway components are expressed in the vascular system (24Krebs L.T.

Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that Notch and HERP1 both play roles in vascular development. Although our previous experiments (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) failed to find a direct interaction of Notch signaling with HERP1 expression in some cell types, we have now re-examined their relationship in cells derived from aortic components. Here we show in several different ways that HERP1 is a true target gene of Notch in aortic smooth muscle cells. NICD activates theHERP1 promoter in an RBP-Jκ-dependent manner and induces expression of endogenous HERP1 mRNA as well as HERP1 protein. Notch ligand stimulation induces endogenousHERP1 mRNA expression, which was observed even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. HERP1induction by Notch stimulation was not observed in RBP-Jκ-deficient cells, but exogenous expression of RBP-Jκ restores HERP1mRNA expression in these cells. These findings provide the first solid evidence that HERP1 is a novel primary target of Notch that is directly up-regulated by a cellular signal transduction system (requiring RBP-Jκ) activated by physiological Notch stimulation in a smooth muscle cell.

Nature. 1986; 323: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) was screened with mouseherp1 cDNA (nucleotides 568–1135) (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). HERP1genomic DNAs of different length (nucleotides −3520 to −8, −2017 to −8, −1042 to −8, and −528 to −8 relative to the start codon) containing the putative transcription regulatory regions were subcloned into the KpnI-XhoI site of pGL2 basic vector (Promega) by PCR. The accession number of the clone (−3520 to −8) in GenBankTM is AY059384. To generate the mutatedHERP1 reporter constructs (μ3, μ2, and μ1), the three consensus RBP-Jκ-binding sites in the HERP1 promoter (−2017 to −8), TCCTTCCCACTCC (−1579 to −1573), GCATTCCCACGCC (−342 to −336), and AGCGTGGGAAAGA (−139 to −133), were changed by PCR to TCCAGATCTCTCC, GCAAGATCTCGCC, and AGCCCCGGGAAGA, respectively. The RBP-Jκ-binding sites are written in boldface, and the mutated residues are underlined. Luciferase reporter plasmids under the control of the HES1(−467 to +46, HES1-luc) and the HES5(−800 to +32, HES5-luc) promoter were generously provided by Dr. Kageyama (Kyoto University) (32Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Empty adenovirus (Adeno-empty) and adenoviruses expressing NICD and RBP-Jκ (Adeno-NICD and Adeno-RBP-Jκ, respectively) have been created as described elsewhere (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G.

High titers of these viruses (1.0–4.0 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml) have been routinely obtained. Parental pEF-BOS empty vector, the Notch1-expressing vector, and its derivatives were kindly provided by Dr. G. Weinmaster (UCLA) (33Nofziger D. Miyamoto A. Lyons K.M. Weinmaster G.

Honjo (Kyoto University) (34Chung C.N. Hamaguchi Y. Honjo T. Kawaichi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2938-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were carried out as described elsewhere (35Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S., Wu, H.Y. Chung G. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell.

A10 cells derived from the smooth muscle of rat thoracic aorta (CRL 1476, ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Co-culture experiment was performed as described elsewhere (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Probes used for the Northern blot were nucleotides 576–1151 of mouse herp1 and nucleotides 465–1079 of mouse herp2 (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The rat HERP1 andHERP2 probes correspond to nucleotide 534–1066 of mouseherp1 and nucleotides 411–1002 of mouse herp2. The mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was excised with HindIII and PstI and used as an internal control. Radioactivities of each signal were measured by PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (STORM 840, Molecular Dynamics). The PCR products were subcloned into theEcoRI-BamHI site of pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene). The clones were verified by DNA sequencing (Microchemical Core Facility, University of Southern California). The accession numbers of these clones in GenBankTM are as follows: ratHERP1, AY059382; rat HERP2, AY059383. A10 cells cultured in two-well glass chamber slides were infected with the Adeno-NICD vector at an m.o.i. of 20 and were incubated for 2 days. Subsequently, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with goat anti-Notch1 antibody (2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-20) plus either the anti-HERP1 or -HERP2 antiserum (20 μg/ml) (1Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S., Wu, H.Y. Chung G.

Signals were observed by confocal microscopy (LSM 510, Zeiss). To determine whether HERP1 may be a downstream target gene of Notch, we first isolated aHERP1 genomic DNA clone and found therein several central core consensus sites for RBP-Jκ, GTGGGAA (11Ling P.D. Hsieh J.J. Ruf I.K. Rawlins D.R. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5375-5383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene spans 10.4 kb of genomic DNA and contains five exons as depicted in Fig.1 A. All the introns are located within the protein-coding regions, and the exon-intron boundaries meet GT-AG rules (Fig. 1 A). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of HERP1 and HES1 revealed remarkably conserved positions of introns in the two genes, suggesting that the genes have a common ancestral origin (arrowheads in Fig. 1 B) (32Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and further supporting the notion that HERP1 may also be a target of Notch. As noted previously, there is a Pro to Gly substitution in the basic region (shown as an arrow in Fig.1 B) and a WR to YQ substitution in the tetrapeptide motif (marked with asterisks in Fig. 1 B). There was no typical TATA box upstream of the coding region, although a similar sequence, TATTAA, was present at −291 bp relative to the start codon. Most importantly, we found that upstream of the coding region of theHERP1 genome contains three classical docking sites and several incomplete sites for the NICD DNA-binding adaptor, RBP-Jκ. These are listed in Fig. 2 C.Figure 2HERP1 can be a downstream target gene of Notch. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated reporter construct plus 2 μg of parental pEF-BOS empty vector or one of indicated Notch-expressing vectors. Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection. The luciferase activity of each reporter construct with no pEF-BOS plasmid was set at 1.0. Thebars show means of luciferase activity with standard deviations. A, the HERP1 promoter like theHES1 and HES5 promoters is activated by the constitutively active form of the NICD. Note that all three constructs were similarly and strongly activated by NICD. B, longer fragments of HERP1 promoter are more strongly activated by NICD. HERP1 reporter constructs with increasing lengths of promoter regions were created as described under “Materials and Methods.” The locations of the three complete consensus sequences for RBP-Jκ binding are indicated with open boxes. A reporter construct with the β-actin promoter was used as negative control (pGL2-β-actin). Note that all HERP1reporter constructs were activated by NICD, but longer fragments showed stronger induction.C, putative RBP-Jκ consensus binding sites found in theHERP1 upstream region, −3520 to −8 nucleotides relative to the translation start codon. Matching consensus sequence is shown inbold. Three nucleotides of both the 3′- and 5′-flanking sequences are also shown. D, requirement of each full RBP-Jκ-binding site for transactivation of HERP1 gene. Each of three consensus sites for RBP-Jκ was mutated within aHERP1 promoter construct (−2017 to −8). These constructs were designated μ1, μ2, and μ3 as indicated in the figure. Note that transactivation by μ1 was greatly diminished and that of μ2 mildly diminished, whereas that of μ3 was hardly affected.E, incomplete RBP-Jκ-binding sites may also play a role in transactivation of the HERP1 promoter by NICD. The three classical CBF1 sites in HERP1 promoter (−2017 to −8) were mutated as described under “Materials and Methods” (μ123). A reporter construct with the β-actin promoter was used as negative control (pGL2-β-actin). Note that transactivation of HERP1 promoter with three mutated RBP-Jκ sites was not completely abolished. F,RBP-Jκ-associated module (RAM) of NICD is required for transactivation of HERP1 promoter. Note that both NICD without RAM as well as full-length Notch1 failed to activate transcription of theHERP1 promoter. TM, transmembrane domain;ANK, ankyrin repeats; ICD, intracellular domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the regulation of HERP1 gene transcription, we first compared the HERP1 promoter activity with that ofHES1 and HES5 which are thus far the only known effectors of Notch in mammals (36Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutively active form of Notch1 (NICD) similarly and strongly activated the promoters ofHERP1, HES1, and HES5 in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A). This result strongly suggests thatHERP1 as well as HES1 and HES5 are targets of Notch. The transcriptional response of HERP1further confirms that the −2017 to −8 upstream region contains a physiologically relevant promoter. In order to study the functionality of the RBP-Jκ-binding sites, we first created several luciferase reporter gene constructs bearing different lengths of the HERP1 gene upstream regions. Cells were transfected with the respective luciferase reporter plasmids with or without expression vectors for NICD. Luciferase activities of all four reporter constructs were strongly activated by NICD, whereas a control β-actin promoter was hardly affected (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that transactivation by NICD depends on the presence of theHERP1 upstream sequences. Longer fragments showed stronger induction by NICD. Each deleted DNA region contained some complete and/or incomplete RBP-Jκ sites (Fig. 2 C). Although these findings do not identify any particular RBP-Jκ site as being required for NICD induced reporter gene activation, they suggest rather that multiple RBP-Jκ sites including the incomplete consensus sites may be involved in transactivation of HERP1 promoter by NICD. To determine the contribution of specific RBP-Jκ-binding sites, we next individually mutated each of the three complete RBP-Jκ sites (➁, ➀, and ③ in Fig. 2 C) in anHERP1-luciferase construct (−2017 to −8). Constructs with each mutant were named μ1, μ2, and μ3 (Fig. 2 D). Cells were transfected with these luciferase reporter plasmids in the presence or absence of expression vector for NICD. When compared with wild type HERP1 promoter, transcription of μ1 was strongly impaired whereas that of μ2 was moderately reduced. In contrast, no apparent difference was observed between wild type and μ3. One possible explanation for the observed difference among these mutants is the different flanking sequences of RBP-Jκ-binding site that might contribute to DNA binding activities of RBP-Jκ. Because each mutation did not completely abolish transactivation by NICD, we next mutated all three RBP-Jκ-binding sites within an HERP1 promoter (named μ123). As shown in Fig. 2 E, transactivation of the μ123 reporter by NICD was greatly diminished but was not completely abolished. The degree of reduction of μ123 was almost the same as that of μ1. Taken together, these results identify site ➁ for RBP-Jκ as an important sequence for NICD-mediated transcription, although other RBP-Jκ sites may also be involved to a lesser extent. Indeed, the μ123 construct retains four unmodified incomplete RBP-Jκ-binding sites whose functions, if any, remain to be determined. The full-length Notch receptor is functionally silent unless it is cleaved by the process called “regulated intramembrane proteolysis” (Rip) (37Brown M.S., Ye, J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). After the cleavage, the NICD is released from the membrane and functions as a transcriptional activator together with the nuclear protein RBP-Jκ (8Mumm J. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the subtransmembrane region, RAM (for RBP-Jκ-AssociatedModule), is essential for RBP-Jκ interaction and transactivation of target genes such as HES1 (33Nofziger D. Miyamoto A. Lyons K.M. Weinmaster G. Development. 1999; 126: 1689-1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura-Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T.

Accordingly, we next studied whether the same domain of Notch is necessary for transactivation of HERP1 by expressing Notch deletion mutants (Fig. 2 F). The Notch1-ICD encodes the complete RAM domain, whereas Notch1-ICDΔRAM lacks most of the RAM but contains an intact ankyrin repeat region involved in protein-protein interactions (23Miele L. Osborne B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As expected, Notch1-ICD strongly activated transcription of the HERP1 promoter, but both full-length Notc"

By using a combination of biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we identified minimal N- and C-terminal Gβγ-binding domains responsible for stimulation of GIRK4 channel activity. Within these domains one N-terminal residue, His-64, and one C-terminal residue, Leu-268, proved critical for Gβγ-mediated GIRK4 activity. Moreover, mutations at these GIRK4 sites reduced significantly binding of the channel domains to Gβγ. The corresponding residues in GIRK1 also showed a critical involvement in Gβγ sensitivity. In GIRK4/GIRK1 heteromers the GIRK4 His-64 and Leu-268 residues showed greater contributions to Gβγ sensitivity than did the corresponding GIRK1 His-57 and Leu-262 residues.

By using a chimeric approach between GIRK4 and IRK1, a critical C-terminal Leu residue was identified (GIRK4-L339 or GIRK1-L333), mutation of which abolished the Gβγ-mediated agonist-induced GIRK channel activation but not the Gβγ-mediated agonist-independent (basal) GIRK channel activity (24He C.

This result suggested that distinct channel sites may be involved in basal versus agonist-induced channel activation through the Gβγ subunits.

Two amino acid residues, the N-terminal GIRK4(H64) and the C-terminal GIRK4(L268), are shown to be critically involved in Gβγ-mediated currents. Moreover, mutation of each of these GIRK4 residues is shown to reduce binding to the Gβγ subunits. The corresponding GIRK1 residues are also found to be involved in the Gβγ sensitivity of GIRK1 subunits (GIRK1(H57) and GIRK1(L262)). In contrast to the mutation of GIRK4(L339) or GIRK1(L333), which selectively controlled agonist-induced but not agonist-independent Gβγ-mediated currents (24He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the two sites reported here are found to abolish all Gβγ-mediated currents. Human homologs of GIRK1 and GIRK4 (GenBankTMaccession numbers U39195 and U39196 (9Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen.

Hunt H.D., Ho, S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). PCRs, using Vent DNA polymerase, were performed for only 15 cycles to avoid errors. Point mutations were generated using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Sequencing facility, Cornell, Ithaca, NY). The βARK-PH construct (amino acids 452–689) (referred to as βARK) was used to sink Gβγ subunits away from the channel. For confocal studies GIRK1-GFP was used as described previously (27Chan K.W. Sui J.-L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All constructs were linearized with Nhel, and cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the “message machine” kit (Ambion). RNAs were electrophoresed on formaldehyde gels, and concentrations were estimated from two dilutions using RNA marker (Invitrogen) as a standard. Xenopus oocytes were surgically extracted, dissociated, and defolliculated by collagenase treatment and microinjected with 50 nl of a water solution containing the desired cRNA. Unless otherwise indicated, we used the following approximate quantities: GIRK channel subunits, 1.0 ng per species; IRK1 channel, 0.25 ng; M2receptor, 1.0 ng; Gβ subunits, 1.0 ng; Gγ subunit, 1.0 ng; βARK-PH, 1.0 ng. Gβ2 or Gβ1 with Gγ2 were used in all Gβγ coexpression experiments. Oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 19 °C. Whole oocyte currents were then measured by conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Agarose cushion microelectrodes were used with resistances between 0.1 to 1.0 megohms (28Schreibmayer W. Lester H.A. Dascal N. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Oocytes were constantly superfused with a high potassium solution containing (in mm) 91 KCl, 1 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 KOH/HEPES (pH 7.4). To block or activate currents, the oocyte chamber was perfused with solutions of the same composition with 3 mm BaCl2 or 5 μm ACh. Typically oocytes were held at 0 mV (E K ), and currents were constantly monitored by 500-ms pulses to a command potential of −80 mV for 200 ms followed by a step to +80 mV for another 200 ms, and the cycle was repeated every 2 s. Periodically, a protocol was applied with a command potential from −100 to +100 mV with 10-mV increments. Current amplitudes were measured at the end of the 200-ms pulse at each potential. Control currents were evaluated in this manner 2–5 min after impaling the oocytes just before application of ACh. ACh-activated currents were evaluated at the peak of the response to ACh, and Ba2+-insensitive currents were evaluated once steady-state inhibition was achieved, 1–3 min after application of 3 mm Ba2+. Basal current is the difference between control and Ba2+-insensitive currents, and ACh-induced (or ACh-sensitive) current is the difference between ACh-activated and control currents. Error bars in the figures represent S.E. Each experiment shown or described was performed on 3–5 oocytes of the same batch. A minimum of 2–3 batches of oocytes were tested for each experiment shown. Single channel recording was performed, as described previously (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15118) Google Scholar, 30Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen.

A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Single channel currents were filtered at 1 kHz with a 6-pole low-pass Bessel filter, sampled at 5 kHz. Single channel data were analyzed with pCLAMP8 software supplemented with some of our own programs. Base-line drifts were carefully adjusted with Clampfit8 before idealization. Only those records containing a few or no double openings were used for open time histogram fitting. Recordings were performed 2 days after injection. Recombinant bovine Gβ1γ2 subunits were purified from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses encoding for β1, γ2, and His6-αi1 as described (32Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding fragments of GIRK4 or IRK1 and the PH domain of βARK were generated by PCR and cloned in frame with the GST coding sequence in pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of fusion proteins was induced by 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h, and the fusion proteins were purified using glutathione 4B-Sepharose beads. The binding assay of Gβγ to the fusion proteins was performed as described by Huang and colleagues (16Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 μm GST fusion protein and 0.1 μm Gβγ were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Lubrol, and glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with 200 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Lubrol, the bound proteins were eluted from beads by heating in protein sample buffer at 70 °C for 10 min and were then electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-PAGE. GST fusion proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining, and Gβ1 was detected by immunoblotting using a Gβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was used to quantify the relative amounts of bound Gβγ. Detection of GFP-tagged channels in oocytes has been described previously in detail (33Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Sassaroli M. Lopatin A. Nichols C.G. Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 215-231Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–4 days after injections,Xenopus oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at room temperature. Fixed oocytes were embedded in 3% agarose, and 50-μm sections were cut using a Vibratome. The cut sections were mounted on coverslips and imaged using a Leica TCS confocal microscope. To compare fluorescence intensities between different oocyte sections, image acquisition parameters such as pinhole size, intensity, and offset were kept constant. To identify minimal Gβγ-binding domains within the N and C termini of the GIRK4 channels, we constructed and purified GST fusion proteins and tested their binding to purified Gβγ subunits. We tested Gβγ-binding of the full N and C termini of GIRK4 and of fragments harboring incremental deletions of ∼25 amino acids, until Gβγ binding was no longer detected. Gβγ binding of GIRK4 channel fragments was compared with that of the following: (a) the PH domain of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) (e.g. Ref. 24He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); (b) the corresponding full N- and C-terminal fragments of the IRK1 (or Kir2.1) channel, which is related to GIRK4 but is Gβγ-insensitive (e.g. Ref.24He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); and (c) the GST protein alone, which was common to all purified fusion proteins. Fig.1 A shows Gβγ binding for the full N terminus, GIRK4-(1–92) (denoted as G4-(1–92)), and for a minimal N-terminal Gβγ-binding fragment G4-(41–92). Fig.1 B shows Gβγ binding for the full C terminus G4-(184–419), and no binding for fragments smaller than G4-(253–322). In fact, maximal Gβγ binding was obtained with fragment G4-(253–348), whereas deletion to position 322, G4-(253–322), caused a reduction in Gβγ binding, consistent with our previous findings (24He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) implicating the 322–348 region as an important determinant of Gβγ sensitivity. On the other hand, the binding of the full N-terminal segment G4-(41–92) was consistently weaker than that of the smaller N-terminal segment G4-(41–92). Overall these results suggest that G4-(41–92) and G4-(253–348) are, respectively, minimal domains of the GIRK4 channel N and C termini capable of maximal binding to Gβγ. To identify regions within the two minimal Gβγ-binding domains of GIRK4 involved in stimulating channel activity, we constructed chimeras between the GIRK4 and IRK1 channels. GIRK4 regions of ∼25 amino acids, within the minimal N- and C-terminal Gβγ-binding domains, were replaced by the corresponding IRK1 regions. These chimeras were constructed in the background of GIRK4(S143T) (referred to as G4*), which has been shown previously to form functional homomeric channels (14Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Heterologous coexpression of control and mutant channels with muscarinic M2 receptors was carried out in Xenopus laevisoocytes. Measurement of K+ currents was performed using two-electrode voltage clamp. Fig.2 A shows that the N-terminal chimera G4*(IRK1S35-V56), which replaced the GIRK4 region between 40 and 61 with the corresponding IRK1 region between Ser-35 and Val-56, showed normal agonist-independent (basal) and agonist-induced G4* currents. Similarly, the C-terminal chimera G4*(IRK1V270-D291) replacing the GIRK4 region between 277 and 298 also showed normal basal and agonist-induced currents. These results suggested that neither the 40–61 nor the 277–298 GIRK4 regions possessed any key residues responsible for the differences in Gβγ sensitivity between GIRK4 and IRK1. Chimera G4*(IRK1L316-Y341) showed basal but not agonist-induced currents. This result agreed with previous work showing the corresponding GIRK region (e.g. G4-(323–348)), and in particular a Leu residue (G4Leu339 or G1Leu333) was critical in Gβγ-mediated agonist-induced activation as well as for maximal binding to Gβγ (Ref. 24He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar; also compare in Fig.1 B Gβγ binding to GST-G4-(253–322) versusGST-G4-(253–348)). In contrast, chimeras G4*(IRK1Q57-V86), G4*(IRK1D246-I269), and G4*(IRK1F292-Y315) replacing, respectively, the G4* regions 62–91, 253–276, and 299–322 were not functional. GIRK1 channels tagged with the green fluorescence protein (G1-GFP) showed minimal distribution on the cell surface (Fig.2 B). Because GIRK4 or GIRK4* localize efficiently to the plasma membrane (12Sui J.-L. Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 179-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), untagged GIRK4* was coexpressed with G1-GFP causing translocation of fluorescence signal to the cell surface. This indicated association of G4* with G1-GFP and successful targeting of G1-GFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B). To test whether the non-functional chimeras expressed proteins capable of associating with GIRK1 and localizing to the cell surface, the three non-functional G4* chimeras were coexpressed with G1-GFP. Indeed, the non-functional G4* chimeras were able to associate with and localize G1-GFP to the cell surface. Within the N-terminal GIRK4-(62–91) region that proved critical for the functional integrity of G4*, 13 residues are different from the corresponding amino acids in IRK1. Mutation of each G4* N-terminal residue within this region to the corresponding IRK1 amino acid revealed three differences critical for channel function. Each of the G4*(H64F), G4*(Y71Q), and G4*(L84I) mutants abolished completely channel activity (Fig.3 A). Similarly, within the C-terminal GIRK4-(253–276) and GIRK4-(299–322) regions that produced non-functional chimeras, there are 11 amino acid differences from IRK1. Two of the 11 mutants, G4*(L268I) and G4*(A318C), also abolished completely K+ currents. The effects of these mutations were more severe than those in the previously identified mutant G4*(L339E), which resulted in loss of agonist-induced currents but left intact Gβγ-mediated basal currents (24He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Inwardly rectifying K+channels, including GIRK subfamily members, depend on phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphate (PIP2) for their activity. In fact, gating molecules, such as the Gβγ subunits or Na+ ions, have been shown to strengthen channel-PIP2 interactions (34Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 35Zhang H., He, C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 36Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Logothetis D.E. Zhang H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 630Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that amino acids in the GIRK4 region (214–252) and the corresponding IRK1 region (207–245) are critical determinants of interactions of these channels with PIP2. One mutant, G4*(I229L), exchanging a GIRK4 residue for the corresponding one in IRK1, strengthened channel PIP2 interactions sufficiently enough to allow gating of the mutant channel by PIP2 alone in the absence of gating molecules, such as Gβγ or Na+ions. Yet this mutation preserved Gβγ stimulation of K+currents. Each of the three N-terminal and two C-terminal single point mutants that showed no K+ currents was paired with the I229L mutation, and each of the double mutant channels was expressed inXenopus oocytes and tested for activity. Fig.4 A shows that all three N-terminal mutants G4*(I229L,H64F), G4*(I229L,Y71Q), and G4*(I229L,L84I) showed convincing inwardly rectifying basal K+ currents. In fact, all of these mutants that now displayed basal currents also showed intact agonist-induced currents (Fig. 4, A right, and C right). Because activity of each of the “functionally lethal” point mutants H64F, Y71Q, and L84I was rescued by the I229L mutation, we proceeded to test whether Gβγ subunits were contributors to the rescued basal K+ currents. We have shown previously that molecules that bind Gβγ can serve as a “sink” to sequester Gβγ subunits away from the channel, inhibiting basal channel activity (24He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 Bshows βARK-PH coexpression with each of the rescued N-terminal double mutants and with the control single mutant, G4*(I229L). Of the three N-terminal mutants, only G4*(I229L, H64F) was insensitive to βARK, indicating that with the H64F mutation the Gβγ subunits were no longer contributing to the rescued basal currents. Fig. 4 Cshows a similar rescue approach for the two C-terminal “functionally lethal” mutants. Again, the rescued G4*(I229L,L268I) and G4*(I229L,A318C) currents were convincingly above background (∼4 μAversus <0.5 μA) and clearly inwardly rectifying (Fig.4 C). Again, these rescued C-terminal mutants showed intact agonist-induced currents. Of these two C-terminal rescued mutants, the L268I currents were not significantly affected by βARK coexpression (Fig. 4 D). Thus, of the five non-functional mutants, one in the N terminus, G4*(H64F), and one in the C terminus, G4*(L268I), did not show inhibition by the Gβγ sink, βARK-PH, suggesting that the His-64 and Leu-268 residues are critical for Gβγ sensitivity. The two identified Gβγ-sensitive residues in GIRK4 are identical in GIRK1. We proceeded to test their importance in GIRK1 in the background of GIRK1(F137S) (referred to as G1*), which has been shown previously to yield functional homomers (13Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows that G1*(L262I), the mutant corresponding to G4*(L268I), greatly reduced but did not abolish basal G1* currents. βARK-PH inhibited the remaining basal currents, suggesting that in GIRK1 additional residues may contribute to Gβγ-mediated basal currents. In contrast, the N-terminal GIRK1* mutant G1*(H57F) behaved as the corresponding G4*(H64F), abolishing completely K+ currents. As expected, the double mutant G1*(H57F,L262I), containing the non-functional H57F mutation, abolished all G1* currents.

The IP3sponge exhibited ∼1000-fold higher affinity for IP3 than the parental IP3R1 and specifically competed with the endogenous IP3R for binding to IP3. Trapping IP3 with the IP3 sponge inhibited IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) from cerebellar microsomes in a dose-dependent manner. The IP3sponge expressed in HEK293 cells also inhibited IICR in response to stimulation with carbachol or ATP. Its inhibitory effects were dependent upon the level of its expression over the increased IP3 contents. Moreover, the IP3 sponge significantly reduced the carbachol-induced phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein in HEK293 cells, indicating that the activation of cAMP-response element-binding protein by Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation may be partly attributable to IICR.

Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Thus, IP3R functions as a signal converter from IP3to Ca2+, which exhibits more complex dynamics in time and space inside cells and acts on thousands of downstream targets that play key roles in many aspects of cell physiology (1Berridge M.J.

Kohda K. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In our previous studies (7Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T. Iwasaki H. Tomomori-Satoh C.

We also found that the affinity of residues 1–604 (T604) of mIP3R1 for IP3 (K d = 45 nm) was comparable with that of the native cerebellar IP3R (83 nm) (4Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K.

We therefore inferred that such a high affinity IP3-binding protein could function as an IP3absorbent in living cells and compete with the native IP3R for binding to IP3.In this paper, we report the development of a novel recombinant IP3 absorbent, the “IP3 sponge,” which has hyperaffinity for IP3 (K d = 0.092 nm). The IP3 sponge was constructed on the basis of the ligand-binding site of mIP3R1, and we assumed that this hyperaffinity IP3 sponge could compete with IP3R for the IP3 signal. We showed that its application actually caused specific inhibition of in vitroIICR in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the IP3 sponge exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells could trap IP3 produced in response to stimulation with either carbachol (CCh) or ATP, resulting in inhibition of IICR. The IP3 sponge appeared to be effective in competing for IP3 with multiple types of tetrameric IP3R channels, because HEK293 cells expressed all three IP3R subunits (10Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of the IP3 sponge on IP3-Ca2+ signaling-dependent cell physiology was verified by providing an invaluable insight into the functional role of IICR in the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), which was previously thought to be activated mainly by Ca2+ influx (11Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 12Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Cruzalegui F.H. Bading H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have developed a novel recombinant IP3-absorbent protein, called the IP3 sponge, that has >1000-fold higher affinity for IP3 than the endogenous IP3R, and we found that it specifically and dose-dependently inhibited in vitro IICR in a competitive manner. Exogenously expressed IP3 sponge was also found to trap efficiently IP3 and inhibit IICR in living cells, depending on the level of expression. Trapping IP3 with the IP3sponge significantly reduced CCh-induced CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133.All of the inhibitors of IICR reported previously have targeted IP3R, and there have been problems with specificity, isoform selectivity, and/or permeability. Application of heparin, a competitive inhibitor for IP3 binding (31Ehlrich B.E. Kaftan E. Bezprozvannaya S. Bezprozvanny I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), is limited, because it performs actions on multiple targets in cells and is not membrane-permeable. Microinjection of the monoclonal antibody 18A10 specifically inhibits IICR via type 1 IP3R by binding to its C terminus (32Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M. Nakada K. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), but this approach cannot be applied to phenomena likely to involve type 2 or 3 IP3R, and it is difficult to deliver efficiently this antibody inside cells (33Takei K. Shin R.-M. Inoue T. Kato K. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1998; 282: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There are two potent membrane-permeable IICR inhibitors that do not block IP3 binding, the xestospongins, a group of macrocyclic bis-1-oxaquinolizidines isolated from the Australian sponge (34Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), and 2-aminoethoxy diphenylborate, which we developed previously (35Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). However, Missiaen and colleagues recently reported that xestospongin C (36Smet P.D. Parys J.B. Callewaert G. Weidema A.F. Hill E. De-Smedt H. Erneux C. Sorrentio V. Missaen L. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and 2-aminoethoxy diphenylborate (37Missiaen L. Callewaert H. De-Smedt H. Parys J.B. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) are not specific for IICR, because both equally block the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+pump. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the IP3 sponge could overcome these problems.One of the unique properties of the IP3 sponge is that it directly traps IP3 signals. The specificity of the IP3 sponge for various inositol phosphates was similar to that of native cerebellar IP3R (Fig. 1 D), indicating that the IP3 sponge retained specific IP3 binding properties that were the same as those of endogenous IP3R. The inhibitory effect of IP3sponge on in vitro IICR from microsomes (Fig. 2) resulted from trapping extravesicular IP3 in a dose-dependent manner rather than affecting the de novo production of IP3. In addition, the caffeine-induced Ca2+ response was unaffected by adding the IP3 sponge (Fig. 2 A, insets), indicating that the IP3 sponge had no effect on Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive stores. We also identified that the exogenously expressed IP3 sponge in HEK293 cells was distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm (Figs. 3 B,4 A, and 5 A) and had no effect on the activity of PLC (Fig. 3, D and E). Thus, IP3sponge could trap the increased intracellular IP3 without affecting the production of IP3. Because the inhibition of IICR by the IP3 sponge was due to the superiority in the affinity and specificity for IP3 over the parental IP3R, the inhibitory effect could be enhanced by using mutant R441Q, the substitution of Gln for Arg-441 on the IP3 sponge (G224), which had double the IP3binding activity of the IP3 sponge.Another unique feature of the IP3 sponge is the product encoded in its cDNAs, which allows trapping of intracellular IP3 by exogenously expressing the IP3 sponge. Moreover, HEK293 cells express all three subunits of the IP3R family (10Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and thus the IP3 sponge appears to be effective in competing for IP3 with multiple types of tetrameric IP3R channels, consisting of various subunit compositions. Therefore, spatiotemporally well controlled expression of the IP3sponge will enable it to trap intracellularly produced IP3and to approach IP3 signaling-dependent Ca2+ physiology, irrespective of cell or tissue type. Because the levels of IP3 trapping seem to influence Ca2+ oscillation, the IP3 sponge might be useful for the analysis of temporal Ca2+ dynamics. Moreover, targeting the expression of this recombinant IP3sponge protein would permit analysis of cell type- and cell stage-specific IICR events or intracellular compartment-specific miniature IICR events.We also used the IP3 sponge to measure whether inhibition of IICR would affect activation of the transcription factor CREB, which was crucially dependent on phosphorylation of Ser-133 (28Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 29Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Although it was well known that an increase in [Ca2+]i via L-type Ca2+ channels or NMDA receptors acts on CREB phosphorylation (11Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 12Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Cruzalegui F.H. Bading H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the involvement of IP3-Ca2+ signaling in CREB phosphorylation had never been directly investigated. Finkbeiner et al. (38Finkbeiner S. Tavazoie S.F. Maloratsky A. Jacobs K.M. Harris K.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1031-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) reported that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced activation of PLCγ stimulated CREB phosphorylation via IICR, and Hardinghamet al. (39Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) recently showed that IICR was critical for propagation of Ca2+ waves from synaptic NMDA receptors to the nucleus, which consequently induced Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of CREB. The present study showed that the up-regulation of CREB phosphorylation in response to 20 μm CCh was inhibited in the IP3 sponge-expressing C2 cells, in which the rise in Ca2+ evoked by 20 μm CCh was almost completely blunted. Thus, the application of the IP3 sponge provided the first direct evidence that IICR enhanced phosphorylation at Ser 133 of CREB. These data suggest a link between IICR and gene transcription via CREB phosphorylation, involved in many neuronal activities, such as development, plasticity, and survival (40Deisseroth K. Bito H. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 41Sala C. Rudolph-Correia S. Sheng M. J.

Trapping of IP3 by the IP3 sponge actually influenced cell physiology including a downstream cascade and would be beneficial for exploring cellular events mediated by IP3-Ca2+ signaling.In conclusion, we have characterized the recombinant hyperaffinity IP3 sponge protein, which is useful for exploring IP3-Ca2+ signal conversion. This novel inhibitory system should provide a powerful means of analyzing not only the signaling effects of different intracellular IP3 levels and dynamics but also a variety of aspects of IP3-Ca2+ physiology in vivo by expressing cell-, tissue-, and organelle-specific IP3sponge. Many cellular responses to diverse biological stimuli, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors, are mediated by the intracellular second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).1IP3 subsequently induces Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores by activating its receptor (IP3R) (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar,2Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). IP3R channels form homo- or heterotetramers via the co-assembly of distinct types of IP3R subunits (types 1–3) (3Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Sugiyama T. Yoneshima H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Furuichi T. Saruta T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14700-14704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and bind IP3 in a stoichiometric manner (4Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) not only results in a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) but also evokes complex spatiotemporal dynamics of [Ca2+]i called Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ oscillations (5Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Thus, IP3R functions as a signal converter from IP3to Ca2+, which exhibits more complex dynamics in time and space inside cells and acts on thousands of downstream targets that play key roles in many aspects of cell physiology (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar, 2Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Type 1 IP3R (IP3R1) is composed of 2749 amino acids (molecular mass about 313 kDa) and is structurally divided into three parts as follows: a large N-terminal cytoplasmic arm region (83% of the receptor molecule); a putative six membrane-spanning region clustered near the C terminus, which is thought to constitute an ion channel by forming a tetramer; and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail region (6Furuichi T. Kohda K. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In our previous studies (7Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T. Iwasaki H. Tomomori-Satoh C.

We also found that the affinity of residues 1–604 (T604) of mIP3R1 for IP3 (K d = 45 nm) was comparable with that of the native cerebellar IP3R (83 nm) (4Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), indicating that T604 could form a well folded or compact conformation for the functional IP3-binding pocket (7Yoshikawa F.

The N-terminal residues 1–223, which we assigned as a suppresser region, instead of being directly responsible for IP3 binding, suppressed the binding activity of the core region (7Yoshikawa F.

The specificity of the IP3 sponge for various inositol phosphates was similar to that of native cerebellar IP3R (Fig. 1 D), indicating that the IP3 sponge retained specific IP3 binding properties that were the same as those of endogenous IP3R. The inhibitory effect of IP3sponge on in vitro IICR from microsomes (Fig. 2) resulted from trapping extravesicular IP3 in a dose-dependent manner rather than affecting the de novo production of IP3. In addition, the caffeine-induced Ca2+ response was unaffected by adding the IP3 sponge (Fig. 2 A, insets), indicating that the IP3 sponge had no effect on Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive stores. We also identified that the exogenously expressed IP3 sponge in HEK293 cells was distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm (Figs. 3 B,4 A, and 5 A) and had no effect on the activity of PLC (Fig. 3, D and E). Thus, IP3sponge could trap the increased intracellular IP3 without affecting the production of IP3. Because the inhibition of IICR by the IP3 sponge was due to the superiority in the affinity and specificity for IP3 over the parental IP3R, the inhibitory effect could be enhanced by using mutant R441Q, the substitution of Gln for Arg-441 on the IP3 sponge (G224), which had double the IP3binding activity of the IP3 sponge. Another unique feature of the IP3 sponge is the product encoded in its cDNAs, which allows trapping of intracellular IP3 by exogenously expressing the IP3 sponge. Moreover, HEK293 cells express all three subunits of the IP3R family (10Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and thus the IP3 sponge appears to be effective in competing for IP3 with multiple types of tetrameric IP3R channels, consisting of various subunit compositions. Therefore, spatiotemporally well controlled expression of the IP3sponge will enable it to trap intracellularly produced IP3and to approach IP3 signaling-dependent Ca2+ physiology, irrespective of cell or tissue type. Because the levels of IP3 trapping seem to influence Ca2+ oscillation, the IP3 sponge might be useful for the analysis of temporal Ca2+ dynamics. Moreover, targeting the expression of this recombinant IP3sponge protein would permit analysis of cell type- and cell stage-specific IICR events or intracellular compartment-specific miniature IICR events. We also used the IP3 sponge to measure whether inhibition of IICR would affect activation of the transcription factor CREB, which was crucially dependent on phosphorylation of Ser-133 (28Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 29Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Although it was well known that an increase in [Ca2+]i via L-type Ca2+ channels or NMDA receptors acts on CREB phosphorylation (11Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 12Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Cruzalegui F.H. Bading H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the involvement of IP3-Ca2+ signaling in CREB phosphorylation had never been directly investigated. Finkbeiner et al. (38Finkbeiner S. Tavazoie S.F. Maloratsky A. Jacobs K.M. Harris K.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1031-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) reported that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced activation of PLCγ stimulated CREB phosphorylation via IICR, and Hardinghamet al. (39Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) recently showed that IICR was critical for propagation of Ca2+ waves from synaptic NMDA receptors to the nucleus, which consequently induced Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of CREB. The present study showed that the up-regulation of CREB phosphorylation in response to 20 μm CCh was inhibited in the IP3 sponge-expressing C2 cells, in which the rise in Ca2+ evoked by 20 μm CCh was almost completely blunted. Thus, the application of the IP3 sponge provided the first direct evidence that IICR enhanced phosphorylation at Ser 133 of CREB. These data suggest a link between IICR and gene transcription via CREB phosphorylation, involved in many neuronal activities, such as development, plasticity, and survival (40Deisseroth K. Bito H. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 41Sala C. Rudolph-Correia S. Sheng M. J.

Trapping of IP3 by the IP3 sponge actually influenced cell physiology including a downstream cascade and would be beneficial for exploring cellular events mediated by IP3-Ca2+ signaling. In conclusion, we have characterized the recombinant hyperaffinity IP3 sponge protein, which is useful for exploring IP3-Ca2+ signal conversion. This novel inhibitory system should provide a powerful means of analyzing not only the signaling effects of different intracellular IP3 levels and dynamics but also a variety of aspects of IP3-Ca2+ physiology in vivo by expressing cell-, tissue-, and organelle-specific IP3sponge.

https://openalex.org/W2077315541,"Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the sphingosine 1-phosphate (SSP) receptor “endothelial differentiation gene 1” (EDG1 or S1P1) receptor is increased in response to either SSP or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) exposure but not lysophosphatidic acid. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that SSP stimulated the accumulation of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but not phosphotyrosine. An inhibitor of PMA-stimulated EDG1 phosphorylation failed to block SSP-stimulated phosphorylation. Additionally, removal of 12 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of EDG1 specifically reduced SSP- but not PMA-stimulated phosphorylation, suggesting that SSP and PMA increase EDG1 phosphorylation via distinct mechanisms. In vitro assays revealed that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 may be at least partially responsible for SSP-stimulated EDG1 phosphorylation observed in intact cells. In addition, phosphorylation by PMA and SSP were associated with a loss of EDG1 from the cell surface by distinct mechanisms. Removal of 12 residues from the carboxyl terminus of EDG1 completely inhibited SSP-mediated internalization, suggesting that this domain dictates susceptibility to receptor internalization while retaining sensitivity to SSP-stimulated phosphorylation. Thus, we conclude that (a) EDG1 phosphorylation and internalization are controlled via independent mechanisms by agonist occupation of the receptor and protein kinase C activation, and (b) although determinants within the receptor's carboxyl-terminal tail conferring EDG1 sensitivity to agonist-mediated internalization and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase phos- phorylation exhibit a degree of overlap, the two phenomena are separable.

It is generated by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and the sequential action of ceramidase and sphingosine kinase and controls several important cellular phenomena, including proliferation, survival, the prevention and suppression of apoptosis, and changes in cell shape and motility (1Goetzl E.J.

Interestingly, SSP exerts its effects at both intracellular and extracellular sites of action. The extracellular effects are mediated by its binding to specific members of the so-called “EDG” family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although this family consists of eight members, termed EDG1–EDG8, EDG1 (alternatively referred to as S1P1), EDG3 (S1P3), EDG5 (S1P2), EDG6 (S1P4), and EDG8 (S1P5) have been shown definitively to respond selectively to SSP with high affinity (3Fukushima N.

Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have now shown that, although EDG1 activates multiple signaling pathways upon binding SSP, most of these occur via receptor interaction with the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi family of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (Gi-proteins) (5Windh R.T.

These include the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), phospholipase C-β isoforms, and the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (5Windh R.T. Lee M.J. Hla T., An, S. Barr A.J.

It has also been shown that EDG1 may stimulate the pertussis toxin-insensitive activation of G12 and/or G13, leading to the activation of the Rho family of small GTPases (7Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that EDG1, in conjunction with EDG3, controls signaling pathways necessary for endothelial cell migration and morphogenesis into capillary-like networks (8Lee M.J.

The role of EDG1 and EDG3 in promoting angiogenesis suggests that defective regulation of specific EDG1 and/or EDG3 signaling pathways may contribute to the excessive angiogenesis associated with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, and solid tumor progression. It also implies that therapeutics directed at EDG1 and EDG3 have enormous clinical potential for effective treatment of these conditions. For many GPCRs, sustained agonist exposure leads to a diminution, or “desensitization,” of receptor signaling. From work performed predominantly on the human β2-adrenergic receptor, it has been suggested that rapid termination of GPCR signaling is initiated by receptor phosphorylation events catalyzed by either second messenger-activated kinases or GPCR kinases (GRKs) (10Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The latter constitute a family of seven enzymes that specifically phosphorylate agonist-occupied GPCRs on serine and/or threonine residues (11Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). GRK-stimulated receptor phosphorylation can stimulate the binding of arrestin proteins (12Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). These serve at least three distinct functions: 1) uncoupling of plasma membrane receptors from heterotrimeric G-proteins, thereby leading to a desensitization of G-protein-linked signaling; 2) clustering of phosphorylated receptors into clathrin-coated pits; and 3) recruitment and activation of adapter molecules that can initiate either the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or ERK signaling pathways (13Luttrell L.M.

Although preliminary experiments have demonstrated that EDG1 is phosphorylated and internalized in response to agonist pretreatment (16Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S.

In this preliminary study, we have characterized in detail the molecular processes governing EDG1 phosphorylation and internalization. For the first time, we provide evidence to show that both phosphorylation and internalization of EDG1 can be controlled by two separate events; an agonist-dependent process and a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent process that occurs independently of agonist occupation. In addition, we present compelling evidence to suggest that GRK2 is an SSP-activated EDG1 kinase. All tissue culture reagents were from Sigma. Radiochemicals were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. SSP was purchased from Calbiochem. SSP was resuspended to desired concentrations in buffer or medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM were from Invitrogen. Pfu Turbo thermostable DNA polymerase was from Stratagene, and restriction enzymes were from Promega. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Interactiva. The human EDG1 cDNA in pcDNA3 was the generous gift of Dr. Jim Erickson (Atairgin Technologies Inc, Irvine, CA). Urea-treated bovine rod outer segments were generously donated by Dr. Julie Pitcher (University College, London, United Kingdom). The sources of all other materials have been described previously (18Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14833-14842Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L.

CCL39 hamster fibroblast cell lines stably expressing Myc epitope-tagged EDG1 and EDG1-GFP chimeras were generated using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation/glycerol shock procedure described previously (18Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14833-14842Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following selection in 0.6 mg/ml G418, antibiotic-resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and screened for receptor expression by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody 9E10. CCL39 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2. Stably transfected clones were cultured in medium supplemented with 0.6 mg/ml G418 to maintain selection pressure. For transient transfections, HEK293 cells at ∼80% confluence plated in six-well dishes were incubated for 3 h in 1 ml/well Opti-MEM containing 2 μg of cDNA and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE/well according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used for analysis 36–48 h after transfection. Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) and His6 sequences were added to the COOH terminus of the human EDG1 open reading frame by PCR using pcDNA3/EDG1 cDNA as the template. The primers used were 5′-CATTGAAGCTT CCACC ATGGGGCCCACCAGCGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATTGTCTAGAGGAAGAAGAGTTGA-3′ (antisense). The sense primer was designed to add a HindIII site (bold) upstream of a consensus Kozak sequence (underlined) and the EDG1 initiating Met (italics). The antisense primer was designed to remove the EDG1 stop codon and add a XbaI site (bold). This was to allow in-frame fusion of the EDG1 open reading frame with the Myc epitope and His6 sequences following subcloning of theHindIII/XbaI-digested PCR product into a similarly digested pcDNA3mycHis-A expression vector (Invitrogen). An analogous PCR strategy was used to generate epitope-tagged EDG1 truncation mutants in which either 12 or 32 amino acids had been deleted from the carboxyl terminus. An EDG1-GFP chimera was generated by fusing the Myc epitope-tagged EDG1 to the NH2 terminus of GFP by PCR using the Myc-tagged EDG1 cDNA as the template. The primers used were 5′-TCTGGCTAACTAGAGAACC (sense) and 5′-CATTGGGATCCCGATGGTGATGGTGATGATG (antisense). The sense primer was designed to anneal upstream of theHindIII site adjacent to the EDG1 initiating methionine, whereas the antisense primer was designed to remove the stop codon and add a BamHI site (bold). This was to allow in-frame fusion of the Myc-tagged EDG1 open reading frame with that of GFP following subcloning of the HindIII/BamHI-digested PCR products with a similarly digested modified pEGFP-N1 cDNA (CLONTECH) in which the initiating methionine of the GFP open reading frame was mutated to alanine. The integrity of both the Myc- and GFP-tagged EDG1 open reading frames was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Confluent CCL39 or HEK293 cells plated in six-well dishes were solubilized by scraping into 0.25 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A) and rotation for 60 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation to pellet-insoluble material, soluble extracts equalized by protein assay were added to an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer containing 12% (w/v) SDS and fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide resolving gels. Following transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked by a 60-min incubation in Blotto (5% (w/v) skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.02% (w/v) thimerosal). Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 9E10 (1 in 750 dilution) or a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH; 1:2000) diluted in Blotto. Following three washes with Blotto, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. After three further washes with Blotto and two washes with PBS, immunoreactive proteins were identified by enhanced chemiluminescence. Quiescent monolayers of confluent stably or transiently transfected cells in six-well dishes were washed twice in phosphate- and serum-free DMEM and incubated for 90 min in the same medium supplemented with 70 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. After stimulation with the indicated agonists, reactions were terminated by placing the cells on ice and washing the monolayers twice with ice-cold PBS. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Cells were solubilized by scraping into 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and rotation for 1 h. Following removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, soluble extracts were equalized for protein content and volume prior to receptor immunoprecipitation by a 90-min incubation with 40 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of 9E10-conjugated protein G-Sepharose beads in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) IgG-free bovine serum albumin. Immune complexes were isolated by brief centrifugation, washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and eluted from the beads by the addition of 30 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. After fractionation of immunoprecipitated receptors by SDS-PAGE, gels were dried under vacuum and phosphoproteins visualized by autoradiography for 24–72 h at −80 °C. Quantitation of phosphorylation experiments was by phosphorimaging. Following SDS-PAGE, resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After overnight autoradiography, the region of the membrane corresponding to phosphorylated EDG1 was excised, hydrated, and hydrolyzed at 110 °C in 0.2 ml of 5.7 n hydrochloric acid for 90 min. The hydrolysate was then lyophilized and resuspended in chromatography buffer supplemented with phosphoamino acid standards. After spotting onto cellulose-coated plastic-backed plates, samples were subjected to ascending chromatography in an isobutyric acid, 0.5m ammonium hydroxide (5:3, v/v) buffer system. Standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining and 32P-labeled amino acids identified by autoradiography. These were performed as described previously (21Palmer T.M. Benovic J.L. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15272-15278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of transfected cells in 100-mm dishes were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into lysis buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sodium chloride supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine). Following Dounce homogenization on ice (20 strokes), membranes were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended for immediate use in GRK assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 7.5 mm magnesium chloride) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Assays consisted of 40 μl of membrane suspension, 40 μl of kinase mix (GRK assay buffer supplemented with 0.25 mm ATP, 0.88 mmdithiothreitol, 0.15 μm okadaic acid, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 10 μl of vehicle or 50 nmpurified GRK, and 10 μl of vehicle or SSP. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, reactions were terminated by placing the tubes on ice and adding 0.5 ml/tube stop solution (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA). Membranes were pelleted by microcentrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min) and the resulting pellets solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer by rotation for 60 min at 4 °C. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, detergent extracts were equalized by protein assay prior to receptor immunoprecipitation with 9E10 and analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For rhodopsin phosphorylation experiments, urea-treated bovine rod outer segments were employed. In these experiments, reactions were terminated by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer prior to analysis of rhodopsin phosphorylation by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. This was performed using a sequential cell surface biotinylation-immunoprecipitation protocol described previously (18Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L.

Quiescent transfected cells in six-well dishes were washed and incubated at 37 °C with normal medium supplemented with the agonists indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were terminated by placing the cells on ice, removing the medium and washing monolayers twice with ice-cold PBS. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. First, cell surface glycoproteins were conjugated with biotin by sequential incubation with sodium periodate and biotin hydrazide. Cells were then solubilized and receptors immunoprecipitated with 9E10 and protein G-Sepharose as described above. After fractionation of immunoprecipitated receptors by SDS-PAGE, resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Biotin-labeled immunoprecipitated receptors were then identified by probing blots with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin prior to visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence. Quantitation was by densitometric scanning of exposed blots. These were performed as described by Beltman et al. (22Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, following stimulation of quiescent CCL39 cells in 100-mm dishes as described in the figure legends, reactions were quenched by placing the cells on ice and washing rapidly with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then solubilized in detergent lysis buffer, and clarified extracts equalized for protein content prior to immunoprecipitation for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose and an ERK1-specific antiserum. Immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. Immune complex kinase assays were then performed by adding a kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP). Kinase reactions took place at 30 °C for 30 min and were stopped by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. MBP samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 14% (w/v) polyacrylamide resolving gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gels were then dried and the amount of 32P incorporated into MBP determined by phosphorimaging. CCL39 cells stably expressing EDG1-GFP were plated onto glass coverslips in six-well dishes and grown to confluence. Following serum starvation for 16–24 h, cells were treated with agonists as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were terminated by placing the cells on ice and washing three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then fixed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 5% (w/v) sucrose-PBS. Following removal of the paraformaldehyde, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and mounted onto slides with 40% (v/v) glycerol in PBS. Cells were observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100) with a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63× 1.40 numeric aperture oil immersion objective, pinhole setting of 20, and electronic zoom of 1 or 3. GFP was excited using a 488-nm argon/krypton laser and detected using a 515–540-nm band pass filter. Collected images were analyzed using Metamorph software. Data are presented as means ± S.E. for the number of experiments indicated using GraphPad Prism version 2.0. Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed Studentt tests with significance assessed at p< 0.05. EDG1 regulation was studied predominantly in CCL39 hamster fibroblasts stably transfected with Myc epitope- and GFP-tagged forms of the receptor. Multiple clones exhibiting a range of receptor levels were isolated (data not shown). For this study, CCL39 clones were used that expressed similar levels of each recombinant receptor, as determined by immunoblotting with 9E10 (Fig.1 A). Although Myc epitope-tagged EDG1 migrated as a broad band centred at an approximate molecular mass of 55 kDa, EDG1-GFP migrated at ∼85 kDa, as identified by both 9E10 and an anti-GFP antibody, consistent with the successful fusion of GFP with the EDG1 open reading frame (Fig. 1 A). In addition, the Myc-tagged EDG1 was functional, as determined by its ability to potentiate SSP stimulation of ERK activity in stably transfected CCL39 cells as compared with parental controls (Fig.1 B). Concentration-response curve analysis of ERK activation at 10 min demonstrated that SSP produced a 6–10-fold activation of ERK (EC50 = 0.4 μm) in mycEDG1-expressing, but not parental, CCL39 cells (Fig. 1 B). It has been demonstrated previously that EDG1 is phosphorylated upon exposure to either serum or SSP (17Lee M.-J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To begin identifying the kinases responsible, a variety of activators of second messenger-regulated kinases were tested for their ability to stimulate EDG1 phosphorylation (Fig.2 A). Under conditions in which SSP produced a 12–25-fold increase in EDG1 phosphorylation (range from 20 experiments), PMA (an activator of conventional and novel PKC isoforms) produced a 4–8-fold increase compared with untreated cells (range from 16 experiments) (Fig. 2 A). However, stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with forskolin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase with A23187, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (with 8-bromo-cGMP) each failed to increase EDG1 phosphorylation significantly (Fig.2 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that SSP stimulated the accumulation of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but not phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2 B). Because EDG1 can stimulate phospholipase C-β to elevate intracellular calcium and diacylglycerol levels, it was possible that SSP-stimulated EDG1 phosphorylation was at least partly because of PKC activation. To quantitate the contribution of PKC to agonist-stimulated EDG1 phosphorylation, transfected CCL39 cells were pre-incubated with GF109203X, a potent inhibitor of conventional and novel PKC isoforms (23Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions in which PMA-stimulated phosphorylation was virtually abolished (phosphorylation reduced by 78 ± 8%, p < 0.05 versusvehicle-pre-incubated PMA-treated cells, n = 3), GF109203X inhibited SSP-stimulated receptor phosphorylation by only 18 ± 10% (significantly less than the effect on PMA phosphorylation, p < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 3). This suggests that the majority (>70%) of the SSP-stimulated receptor phosphorylation occurred independently of PKC activation. To further characterize the individual isoforms responsible for PKC-mediated EDG1 phosphorylation in CCL39 cells, the ability of isoform-selective inhibitors to inhibit PMA-stimulated receptor phosphorylation was assessed (Fig. 4). Gö6976 has been shown to inhibit conventional PKC isoforms, whereas rottlerin preferentially inhibits PKCδ, which does not require calcium for activation (24Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M. Miscak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachte C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Individually, each inhibitor caused only partial inhibition of PMA-stimulated EDG1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). However, simultaneous application of rottlerin and Gö6976 produced an additive inhibitory effect that was equivalent in magnitude to the inhibition observed with GF109203X (data not shown). Thus, although SSP and PMA-mediated activation of PKC can stimulate EDG1 phosphorylation, the effect of SSP on receptor phosphorylation is largely PKC-independent. In addition, PKC-dependent EDG1 phosphorylation can be mediated by both conventional and novel PKC isoforms. Exposure to either SSP or PMA produced a rapid increase in EDG1 phosphorylation (Fig.5). In the case of SSP, phosphorylation was detectable at the earliest time point examined (15 s), maximal after a 60-s exposure, and sustained for at least 20 min (Fig. 5). In contrast, exposure to 1 μm PMA produced a much slower phosphorylation than that observed in response to SSP, with phosphorylation only becoming maximal after 10 min (Fig. 5).

Activated C2IIa mediates cell binding and translocation of C2I into the cytoplasm. C2I ADP-ribosylates G-actin at Arg-177 to depolymerize actin filaments. A fusion toxin containing the N-terminal domain of C2I (residues 1–225) transports C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase from Clostridium limosum into cells (Barth, H., Hofmann, F., Olenik, C., Just, I., and Aktories, K. (1998) Infect. Immun. 66, 1364–1369). We characterized the adaptor function of C2I and its interaction with C2IIa. The fusion toxin GST-C2I1–225-C3 was efficiently transported by C2IIa, indicating that C2IIa translocates proteins into the cytosol even when the C2I1–225 adaptor was positioned in the middle of a fusion protein. Amino acid residues 1–87 of C2I were sufficient for interaction with C2IIa and for translocation of C2I fusion toxins into HeLa cells. Residues 1–87 were the minimal part of C2I to bind to C2IIa on the cell surface, as detected by fluorescence-activated cytometry. An excess of C2I1–87(but not of further truncated C2I fragments) competed with Alexa488-labeled C2I for binding to C2IIa. Also, the fragment C2I30–431 and the fusion toxin C2I30–225-C3 competed with C2I-Alexa488 for binding to C2IIa. C2I30–225-C3 did not induce cytotoxic effects on cells when applied together with C2IIa, indicating that amino acid residues 1–29 are involved in translocation of C2I but are not absolutely essential for binding to C2IIa.

Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin belongs to the family of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins. Further members of this toxin family are iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens (1Stiles B.G. Wilkens T.D. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 683-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Clostridium spiroforme toxin (2Simpson L.L. Stiles B.G. Zepeda H. Wilkins T.D. Infect.

These toxins are composed of two separated proteins, a binding/translocation component and an enzyme component, which must assemble on the surface of target cells to exhibit cytotoxicity. This mechanism of toxin up-take is also shared by anthrax toxin, whose binding and translocation component protective antigen (PA) is related to the binding components of the actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins (5Leppla S.H.

For cellular uptake of C2 toxin, trypsin-activated C2IIa forms a heptamer (6Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that interacts with the C2I enzyme component and binds to the cellular receptor, a hybrid and/or complex carbohydrate structure (7Eckhardt M. Barth H. Blöcker D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2328-2334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Both C2IIa and C2I are internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In an acidic endosomal compartment, the C2IIa oligomers insert in the membrane and form pores (6Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Most likely, C2I is translocated through this pore across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol to ADP-ribosylate G-actin at Arg-177 (8Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As a consequence, actin polymerization is blocked, and actin filaments disassemble. Site-directed mutagenesis of C2I (9Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and of the related ADP-ribosyltransferase iota from C. perfringens (10Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicate that the catalytic site of these enzymes is located in their C-terminal part. This is in line with the recently reported crystal structure and the suggested catalytic mechanism of the ADP-ribosyltransferase VIP2 (4Han S. Craig J.A. Putnam C.D. Carozzi N.B. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of C2I (amino acid residues 1–225) is enzymatically inactive but interacts with the C2IIa oligomer and mediates cellular uptake of C2I (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This allows C2I1–225to act as an adaptor for C2IIa-mediated delivery of fusion proteins into cells. In the C2I1–225-C3 fusion toxin, C2I1–225 was used to deliver C3 transferase fromClostridium limosum (M r ∼ 23,000) (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which inactivates Rho GTPase by ADP-ribosylation at Asn-41 (12Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C3 transferase by its own does not enter cells efficiently because it lacks any specific binding and translocation unit (13Aktories K. Mohr C. Koch G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar). We characterized the C2I/C2IIa contact site in more detail by the use of various truncations of C2I and their fusions with C3 transferase. Here, we report that amino acid residues 1–87 of C2I are sufficient for C2IIa-mediated delivery of C2I fusion toxins into cells. Cell culture medium was from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), fetal calf serum was from PAN Systems (Aidenbach, Germany), and cell culture materials were from Falcon (Heidelberg, Germany). The C2II binding component from C. botulinum C2 toxin was purified as recombinant GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli and activated with trypsin as described (6Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Antiserum against C2I and antiserum against C3 transferase were raised in rabbits. Donkey anti-rabbit antibody coupled to peroxidase and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.. The nitrocellulose blotting membrane was from Schleicher and Schuell. Molecular weight protein marker was obtained from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany), the pGEX2T vector (included in the GST gene fusion system) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc., DNA molecular weight marker (λ HindIII) and restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and T4 ligase and competent E. coli cells were from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). PCR was performed in the Gene Amp PCR System 2400 from Perkin-Elmer, and DNA sequencing was done with the cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (ABI PRISM) from Perkin-Elmer. Thrombin was from Sigma. [32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Alexa488 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). HeLa cells and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were cultivated in tissue culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 5% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were routinely trypsinized and reseeded twice a week. For cytotoxicity assays, cells were grown as subconfluent monolayers in 12-well plates and treated with trypsin-activated C2IIa together with the respective fusion toxin in serum-free medium or in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). HBSS contained 0.185 g/l CaCl2, 0.098 g/l MgSO4, 0.4 g/l KCl, 0.06 g/l KH2PO4, 8 g/l NaCl, 0.048 g/l Na2HPO4, and 1 g/l glucose to which 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) was added. At the indicated times, pictures were taken, and the total number of cells as well as the number of rounded cells per field were counted, and the percentage of rounded cells was calculated. All experiments were performed at least three times. A cysteine residue was introduced in C2I protein at amino acid position 16 instead of a serine residue by site-directed mutagenesis of the pGEX-C2I plasmid with the QuikChange kit from Stratagene and the 5′-primer CAA TAA ACC TGA ATG CGA AGC AAA AAA ATG G and the 3′-primer CCA TTT TTT TGC TTC GCA TTC AGG TTT ATT G. 2B.

A cysteine residue was introduced in the C2I30–225-C3 fusion toxin at amino acid residue 187 of C3 instead of a serine residue by site-directed mutagenesis of the pGEX-C2I30–225-C3 plasmid with the QuikChange kit and the 5′-primer GCA CCT ACA CTA TAT GTG ATA TGC AAA TAG C and the 3′-primer GCT ATT TGC ATA TCA CAT ATA GTG TAG GTG C. The mutations were confirmed by cycle sequencing. Labeling of C2IS16C, C2I30–431S408C, and C2I30–225-C3S187C proteins with Alexa488 was done as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes). Excess label was removed from the protein mixture by washing with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, in a Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad). Binding studies by cytometry were done with African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Cells were detached from flasks, and about 1 × 106 cells per sample were used. For direct binding of C2I1–225-C3-A488 and C2I30–225-C3-A488, cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with CIIa together with C2I1–225-C3-A488 or C2I30–225-C3-A488 in HBSS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were washed four times with HBSS plus BSA (for some controls, cells were not washed), and cell-associated fluorescence was detected by a FACSCalibur fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). For competition assays, cells were incubated for 30 min with C2IIa and C2I-A488 (with or without C2I-C3 fusion toxins as competitors) at 4 °C in HBSS plus BSA. Cells were washed twice with HBSS plus BSA, and cell-associated fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry. C2I-truncations were obtained by PCR with the pGEX2T-C2I plasmid (1296 base pairs fromC. botulinum strain 92–13; GenBankTM accession number AJ224480) (9Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J.

To generate these constructs, the 5′ primer, AGA TCT ATG CCA ATA ATA AAA GAA CCC, was used. For amplification of C2I10–225 and C2I110–225 the following 3′ primers containing aBglII-site were used: C2I10–225, AGA TCT TTT ATC AAT AAA CCT GAA TCT GAA; C2I110–225, AGA TCT GGA ATT ATT TTT TCT ATA AGA GAT. The 5′ primer, GAA TCC GGA TCC TCC TTT ATT ATA GAA ATC, for these constructs contained both an EcoRI- and aBamHI-site. The PCR program used for amplification was 2 min at 94 °C, 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, 2 min at 68 °C (20 cycles), and 10 min at 68 °C. These various C2I truncations were used for cloning of C2I-C3 fusion toxins as described for C2I1–225-C3 (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C2I30–431 and C2I30–225-C3 were obtained by PCR with the pGEX2T-C2I (9Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the pGEX2T-C2I1–225-C3 (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect.

This primer bound to a sequence in pGEX 2T. The fragments were cloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). From the pCR2.1 plasmid, the C2I30–431 fragment (2145 base pairs) was excised withBglII/PstI and ligated intoBamHI/PstI-digested pGEX 2T plasmid. C2I30–225-C3 (1300 base pairs) was excised from pCR2.1 plasmid with BglII/EcoRI and ligated intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX 2T plasmid. The constructs were sequenced using the sequencing primers 5′ pGEX2T-58 and 3′ pGEX2T-43. The cycle sequencing reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All proteins were expressed as recombinant GST fusion proteins in E. coli, harboring the respective DNA fragment in the plasmid pGEX-2T and cleaved with thrombin as described (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the methods of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207524) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the various proteins was performed as described (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitroADP-ribosylation assay for G-actin and for Rho was performed as described previously (8Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 15Aktories K. Just I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Just I. Mohr C.

Radioactively labeled proteins were detected by phosphorimaging. The fusion toxin C2I1–225-C3 is efficiently delivered into the cytoplasm of various cell lines via the C2IIa transport component (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study whether it is essential that the C2I1–225 adaptor is located at the N-terminal end of fusion toxins, we tested whether GST-C2I1–225-C3 (∼75 kDa) was delivered into HeLa cells by C2IIa. Therefore, 200 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml GST-C2I1–225-C3 were added to cells with or without C2IIa (200 ng/ml). Whereas GST-C2I1–225-C3 without C2IIa had no effect on cells (Fig. 1, A andC), cells showed “C3 morphology” (e.g.contraction of the cell body, formation of thin cell processes, and rounding up) when incubated for 3 h with GST-C2I1–225-C3 plus C2IIa (Fig. 1, B andD). This finding indicates that (i) the N terminus of C2I is not located necessarily at the very N terminus of the fusion proteins but is located at the inner part of a fusion toxin, and (ii) C2IIa delivers molecules into the cytoplasm that have a higher molecular mass than C2I (49.4 kDa). To investigate the role of the N-terminal part of C2I in interaction with C2IIa and in the enzyme activity of C2I, we cloned N-terminally truncated C2I30–431 and expressed the GST fusion protein. After cleavage with thrombin, the protein was analyzed for enzyme activity. The ADP-ribosylation assay revealed that the C2I30–431 protein possessed no enzyme activity (not shown). The reason for the loss of enzyme activity is not clear, but we suggest that the amino acid residues 1–29 have an important role in the folding of C2I. In a tryptic digest of C2I and C2I30–431, the truncated C2I30–431 protein yielded increased degradation products (not shown). Although the catalytic domain of C2I (amino acids 226–431) appears to need the N-terminal domain for expression of enzyme activity, C2I1–225 was functional with respect to binding to C2IIa and delivery of peptides into the cell. Therefore, we constructed various C2I deletions and made fusion toxins to study which part of the N-terminal domain of C2I interacts with C2IIa. The resulting fusion toxins were C2I1–187-C3, C2I1–137-C3, C2I1–87-C3, C2I1–67-C3, C2I1–47-C3, C2I1–27-C3, C2I110–225-C3, C2I30–225-C3, and C2I10–225-C3. The various C2I-C3 fusion toxins were expressed as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Each protein ran with the expected molecular mass (Fig.2 A). All fusion toxins were recognized in an immunoblot analysis with anti-C2I antiserum (Fig.2 B) and by anti-C3 antiserum (not shown). To analyze the various C2I-C3 fusion toxins for their enzyme activity and substrate specificity, in vitro ADP-ribosylation of cell lysates was performed. The autoradiography shown in Fig. 2 C confirmed that Rho was exclusively ADP-ribosylated by C2I-C3 fusion toxins. Cytotoxic activity of chimeric C2I-C3 toxins was tested on HeLa cells. Therefore, subconfluently growing monolayer cells were incubated in HBSS with C2IIa and C2I-C3 fusion toxins. For control, cells were incubated with C2IIa plus C3 or without any toxin. The finding that C2I1–87-C3 intoxicated cells (Fig.3) strongly suggests that amino acid residues 1–87 of C2I are sufficient for delivery of fusion toxins into cells. We compared the action of C2I1–87-C3 with C2I1–225-C3 on HeLa cells (Fig. 3). The single components C2IIa (not shown), C2I1–225-C3 (Fig.3 A), or C2I1–87-C3 (Fig.3 B) did not exhibit cytopathic effects, but cells exhibited C3 morphology when treated with C2I1–225-C3 plus C2IIa (Fig. 3 C) or with C2I1–87-C3 plus C2IIa (Fig.3 D) for 3 h. A more quantitative analysis is given in Fig. 4. At concentrations of 500 ng/ml C2I1–225-C3 or C2I1–87-C3 the fusion toxins caused similar cytotoxic effects when added to HeLa cells in the presence of C2IIa (Fig. 4 B). When 200 ng/ml respective fusion toxin were applied with C2IIa, the cytotoxic action of C2I1–87-C3 was delayed compared with C2I1–225-C3, but after 3 h, no significant difference in the action of both toxins was observed (Fig. 4 A). To confirm that the concentration of 200 ng/ml C2IIa was not a limiting factor in these experiments, we incubated HeLa cells with various concentrations of C2IIa (200, 500, and 1000 ng/ml) together with a constant concentration of 200 ng/ml C2I1–225-C3 fusion toxin. These studies showed that after 2, 4, and 6 h of incubation there was no detectable difference in the amount of intoxicated cells, indicating that the binding component was not limiting (data not shown).Figure 4Time course of cytotoxic effects of C2I 1–225 -C3 and C2I 1–87 -C3 fusion toxins. Subconfluent HeLa cells were incubated with C2IIa (200 ng/ml) with 200 ng/ml (A) and 500 ng/ml (B) C2I1–225-C3 (★) and C2I1–87-C3 (▾) at 37 °C. For control, cells were incubated with the single components C2IIa (●), C2I1–225-C3 (♦), or C2I1–87-C3 (▪). After the indicated time points, pictures were taken, and the percentage of cells showing C3 morphology was determined. Values are given as mean ± S. D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further truncations of C2I were made to identify the minimal length of C2I necessary to transport C3 into cells. No cytotoxic effects were observed when C2I1–67-C3, C2I1–47-C3, and C2I1–27-C3 were applied to HeLa cells together with C2IIa (not shown). These findings indicate that residues 1–87 of C2I were necessary to mediate binding to C2IIa and/or translocation of C2I into the cytosol. Next, we tested whether the N-terminal amino acid residues 1–9 and 1–109 were necessary for C3 delivery. HeLa cells were treated with C2I10–225-C3 and C2I110–225-C3. C2I110–225-C3 plus C2IIa showed only poor cytotoxic effects, but C2I10–225-C3 plus C2IIa was cytotoxic when applied together with C2IIa (Fig. 5). To study the minimal part of C2I that interacts with C2IIa, those fusion toxins that did not intoxicate cells were tested for competition for the C2IIa binding site with C2I1–225-C3. Therefore C2I1–67-C3, C2I1–47-C3, and C2I1–27-C3 (40 μg/ml medium) were added together with C2IIa (200 ng/ml medium) to HeLa cells for 30 min at 4 °C to allow binding but not endocytosis. For controls, cells were incubated without any protein or with C2IIa alone. Cells were washed to remove free protein, C2I1–225-C3 (200 ng/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. After 2, 4, and 6 h, pictures were taken, and the intoxicated cells were determined. No inhibitory effect on the intoxication of HeLa cells was observed when cells were pretreated with the fusion toxins C2I1–67-C3, C2I1–47-C3, and C2I1–27-C3 (data not shown). To make sure that the binding of C2I1–67-C3, C2I1–47-C3, and C2I1–27-C3 to C2IIa on the cells was not removed by the washing step, the same experiment was done without washing the cells after incubation with the proteins on ice. When C2I1–225-C3 was added directly to cells preincubated with C2IIa together with C2I1–67-C3, C2I1–47-C3, and C2I1–27-C3on ice, no delay in intoxication with C2I1–225-C3 was observed after shifting the cells to 37 °C. Next, we tested whether residues 1–87 of C2I show any competition with C2I1–225-C3 for C2IIa binding sites. Therefore, the C2I1–87 peptide was used because the C2I1–87-C3 fusion toxin was taken up via C2IIa and changed cellular morphology. HeLa cells were pretreated for 30 min at 4 °C with C2IIa (200 ng/ml) together with C2I1–87 (40 μg/ml). For the control, cells were treated without any protein or with C2IIa alone. Cells were washed, and C2I1–225-C3 (200 ng/ml) was added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C and after 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, pictures were taken. Fig. 6shows the intoxication of cells. After 1 h of incubation, cells showed no alteration in morphology. After 2 h, those cells that were incubated with C2IIa plus C2I1–225-C3 showed C3 morphology (Fig. 6 B). Less cells showed C3 morphology after pretreatment with C2I1–87 plus C2IIa (Fig. 6 F) compared with cells pretreated only with C2IIa (Fig. 6 B). After 3 (Fig. 6, C and G) and 4 h (Fig. 6,D and H), this protective effect was no longer detectable. Fig. 6 I gives the percentage of intoxicated cells after the indicated incubation periods. To make sure that the delay in C2I1–225-C3 action was due to a specific competition of this fusion toxin with C2I1–87, we tested the effect of C3 exoenzyme from C. limosum (40 μg/ml) in the competition assay with C2I1–225-C3 on HeLa cells. C3 is not able to enter cells and does not specifically interact with C2IIa and, therefore, can be used as a control. C3 had no influence on the intoxication of cells with C2I1–225-C3 together with C2IIa. The delay in intoxication of cells with C2I1–225-C3 after pretreatment of cells with C2I1–87 shows that C2I1–87 is not only the minimal part of C2I that mediates translocation of fusion toxins into the cytoplasm but also represents the minimal essential part of C2I for which binding to C2IIa was detected. This finding was confirmed by binding experiments of C2 toxin on Vero cells done by fluorescence-activated cytometry. Vero cells were incubated at 4 °C in solution with C2IIa together with the C2I-C3 fusion toxins C2I1–225-C3, C2I1–87-C3, C2I1–67-C3, C2I1–47-C3, and C2I1–27-C3 to allow binding of the proteins to the cells. After 15 min, C2I labeled with the fluorescence dye Alexa488 was added, and cells were further incubated in the cold for 15 min. Thereafter, cell-associated fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. The cell binding studies revealed that pretreatment of cells with C2I1–225-C3 and C2I1–87-C3 in the presence of C2IIa decreased the fluorescence signal from C2IA488 on the cell surface compared with cells, which were treated with C2IIa and C2IA488 (Fig. 7). This indicates that C2I1–225-C3 and C2I1–87-C3 proteins act as competitors for binding of C2IA488 to C2IIa on the cells when added in a 200-fold excess of C2IA488. The other fusion toxins, C2I1–67-C3, C2I1–47-C3, and C2I1–27-C3, showed no competition of binding of C2IA488 to C2IIa (Fig. 7). To study the role of the N-terminal 30 amino acid residues of C2I, we constructed the fusion toxin C2I30–225-C3 (Fig.8 A). C2I30–225-C3 was active in the ADP-ribosylation assay (Fig. 8 B) but was not cytotoxic when applied to HeLa cells together with C2IIa for 3 h (Fig. 8 D). By contrast, C2I1–225-C3 plus C2IIa showed a cytotoxic effect after a 3-h incubation period (Fig.8 C). Even at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, the C2I30–225-C3 fusion toxin induced no cytotoxic effect (not shown). Furthermore, in the cytotoxicity assay, C2I30–225-C3 was not able to compete with C2I1–225-C3 (not shown). Truncated C2I30–431, which was enzymatically inactive, was not able to bind together with C2IIa on Vero cells, as tested by fluorescence-activated cytometry with Alexa488-labeled protein (not shown). We used fluorescence-activated cytometry to test whether C2I30–431 and C2I30–225-C3 proteins compete with C2IA488 for binding to C2IIa on the surface of Vero cells (Fig.9 A). For controls, full-length C2I and the C2I1–225-C3 fusion toxin were also tested for competition in this assay. As shown in Fig. 9 A, all proteins decreased binding of C2IA488 to cells. C2I reduced the fluorescence signal to the control level and the truncated C2I30–431and C2I30–225-C3 proteins to about 50% of the signal obtained without competitors. All competitors were used in a 200-fold excess of C2IA488. Because C2I30–225-C3 decreased the binding of C2IA488 to cells, we tested whether the C2I30–225-C3 fusion toxin shows binding to C2IIa in a direct assay. Therefore, we introduced a cysteine residue into the C3 part of C2I1–225-C3 and C2I30–225-C3 and studied binding of the Alexa488-labeled proteins to cells. The recombinant proteins C2I1–225-C3(S187C) and C2I30–225-C3(S187C) both were able to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of Rho protein in vitro (not shown). Fig.9 B shows the relative fluorescence after binding of C2I1–225-C3(S187C)-A488 plus C2IIa (column 2) and of C2I30–225-C3(S187C)-A488 plus C2IIa (column 3) to Vero cells. For control, cells were treated with C2IIa only (column 1). When cells were washed four times after incubation with the proteins and analyzed by flow cytometry, C2I30–225-C3(S187C)-A488 showed some binding to C2IIa. However, the binding of C2I30–225-C3(S187C)-A488 plus C2IIa to cells was decreased compared with that of C2I1–225-C3(S187C)-A488 plus C2IIa (Fig.9 B). Taken together, our studies show that amino acid residues 1–87 of C2I are sufficient for C2IIa-mediated delivery of C3 fusion toxins into cells. Further C-terminal truncations of this adaptor were not able to transport C3 transferase into cells. Amino acid residues 10–29 are not absolutely essential for binding of C2I to C2IIa, but they are necessary for translocation of C2I-C3 fusion toxins. For cellular uptake of the binary C. botulinum C2 toxin, the activated binding component C2IIa forms heptamers, which bind to the cellular receptor, and eventually interacts with the enzyme component C2I. Both components are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most likely, in an acidic early endosomal compartment, the C2IIa heptamers insert in the membrane and form pores (6Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We assume that C2I translocates through the pores across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol. To this end, at least a partial unfolding of the C2I ADP-ribosyltransferase is necessary, because the inner diameter of the C2IIa pore appears to be ∼2 nm (6Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). After the translocation process, a proper refolding of C2I is a prerequisite to recover its enzymatic activity in the cytoplasm. Most likely, a specific adaptor region of the C2I protein is required for binding to C2II on the cell surface and/or for initiation of the translocation process in the acidic endosomal compartment. However, little is known about the interaction of the enzymatic component with the binding component C2II. We reported earlier that the N-terminal domain of C2I (residues 1–225) is sufficient to mediate the cellular uptake of C. limosum C3 transferase by means of the C2I1–225-C3 fusion toxin and the activated C2IIa binding component (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C3 by itself appears to enter cells via nonspecific pinocytosis when large amounts of C3 are applied because it lacks a receptor binding domain (13Aktories K. Mohr C. Koch G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal 225 amino acids of C2I (C2I1–225) represent an adaptor region that binds to C2IIa and coordinates the translocation of C2I and of the C2I1–225-C3 fusion toxin through the pore formed by C2IIa. The surprisingly efficient transport of C2I1–225-C3 fusion toxin by C2IIa may be explained by at least two reasons. First, C3 transferase shares structural features with the C-terminal part of C2I transferase (4Han S. Craig J.A. Putnam C.D. Carozzi N.B. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and second, C2I1–225-C3 (∼50 kDa) has nearly the same molecular mass as C2I (∼50 kDa) (11Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether the C2I1–225 adaptor molecule must be located at the N terminus or C terminus of the fusion toxins for efficient transport. Here we report that GST-C2I1–225-C3 was taken up by cells. We also constructed fusion toxins containing C2I1–225 and the catalytic domain of C. difficile toxin B. In one of these proteins the C2I1–225 adaptor was located at the N terminus, and in the other protein, at the C terminus. Both fusion toxins were delivered into HeLa cells by C2IIa (data not shown). This finding suggests that the part of C2I that functions as an adaptor to interact with C2IIa can be located at different parts of the fusion toxin. Obviously, it is not essential for interaction with C2IIa that the C2I1–225part is located at the very N terminus of the respective fusion toxin. Furthermore, using these fusion toxins in cytotoxicity assays, we observed that molecules of a higher molecular mass than that of C2I were also translocated into the cytosol. The GST-C2I1–225-C3 fusion toxin (∼75 kDa) exhibits a higher mass than C2I (∼50 kDa). Recently, the first member of the family of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins, VIP2, the enzymatic component of the VIP toxin (vegetative insecticidal protein) from B. cereus, was crystallized (4Han S. Craig J.A. Putnam C.D. Carozzi N.B. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In analogy to the two components C2I and C2II of C2 toxin, VIP toxin consists of VIP1 and VIP2. VIP1 is the membrane binding component (100 kDa) that mediates cellular uptake of the enzymatically active component VIP2 (52 kDa) into insect cells. According to recent crystal structure analysis (4Han S. Craig J.A. Putnam C.D. Carozzi N.B. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), VIP2 consists of two domains that are separated by a central cleft (see Fig.10). The N-terminal domain consists of amino acid residues 60–265 and the C-terminal catalytic domain of residues 266–461. VIP2 shares significant sequence homology with the enzymatic components of other binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins including C2 toxin from C. botulinum (see Fig.10 A) and iota toxin from C. perfringens (4Han S. Craig J.A. Putnam C.D. Carozzi N.B. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment between the N-terminal domains of VIP2 and C2I suggest that C2I1–225 is most likely also composed of 5 α-helices and 8 β-sheets (Fig. 10 A). The shortest part of C2I that allowed the transport of C3 transferase into cells, C2I1–87, contains the region covering helices α1–4 in the VIP2 structure (see Fig. 10), composed of helix α1 (amino acid residues 15–29 in C2I), helix α2 (residues 34–45 in C2I), helix α3 (residues 52–61 in C2I), and helix α4 (residues 69–86 in C2I). Pretreatment of cells with C2IIa plus an excess of the C2I1–87 peptide delayed intoxication of cells with C2I1–225-C3 toxin for about 2 h. Furthermore, C2I1–225-C3 and C2I1–87-C3 competed with C2I for binding to C2IIa on the cell surface, as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cytometry. These observations indicate that C2I1–87 competes with C2I1–225-C3 for the C2IIa binding sites. However, our findings show that binding of C2I1–87 to C2IIa is less stable than the interaction of C2I1–225 with C2IIa. C2I1–87was the shortest of the described C2I fragments that delayed intoxication of cells with C2I1–225-C3. The further truncations of C2I (e.g. C2I1–67) were not able to deliver C3 into the cytoplasm of cells and did not compete with C2I1–225-C3 for C2IIa on the cell surface. This suggests that helices α1–4 are essential at least for translocation of the protein into the cytoplasm and most likely also for interaction with the C2IIa binding component. To study the role of helix α1 (residues 15–29), amino acid residues 1–29 were deleted from C2I1–225, and C2I30–225 was fused to C3. This protein was not delivered into cells by C2IIa. When binding of C2I and truncated C2I30–431 to cell-bound C2IIa was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cytometry with Alexa-labeled proteins, no significant binding of C2I30–431 was measured. Furthermore, the C2I30–225-C3 fusion toxin did not inhibit or delay intoxication of HeLa cells with C2I1–225-C3 when the protein was tested for competition in cytotoxicity assays. In competition studies with fluorescence-activated cytometry with Vero cells, however, C2I30–431 and C2I30–225-C3, competed with full-length C2I for the C2IIa binding to cells. One possible explanation for the different findings in the binding (fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis) and the cytotoxicity assays is a weak interaction of C2I30–225-C3 with C2IIa. This weak interaction is detectable in fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis but not in the cytotoxicity assay, because the assay procedure requires an additional washing step. Direct binding of Alexa-labeled C2I30–225-C3 protein (together with C2IIa) to Vero cells revealed that this fusion toxin showed some binding to C2IIa but with apparent lower affinity than C2I1–225-C3. Therefore we suggest that the amino acid residues 1–29 of C2I are not absolutely necessary for interaction with C2IIa but most likely stabilize the interaction between C2I and C2IIa. Because the toxins, lacking residues 1–29, were not taken up via C2IIa, these amino acids seem to be involved in translocation of the enzyme component into the cytoplasm. The recombinant C2I30–431 protein was enzymatically inactive with respect to ADP-ribosylation of actin. This suggests that residues 1–29 of C2I are essential for the expression of a functional C-domain. Because the tryptic digestion of C2I30–431 was increased compared with the full-length C2I protein, amino acids 10–29 are most likely essential for proper folding of C2I. The binary lethal toxin from Bacillus anthracis represents the combination of the transport component PA and lethal factor (LF) or edema factor. LF (776 amino acids) interacts with PA to enter cells (5Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 543-572Google Scholar). Because PA shares homology with C2II, interaction of the binding components and the enzymatic components from anthrax toxin and C2 toxin may be similar. Arora and Leppla (17Arora N. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported earlier that amino acids 1–254 from LF are necessary for binding to PA and for translocation of LF and LF fusion toxins into the cytosol (17Arora N. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion proteins containing amino acids 1–198 of LF were inactive, suggesting that the PA binding domain of LF is located within residues 1–254. When amino acids 1–40 of LF were deleted, the resulting protein was not toxic because it did not bind to PA (17Arora N. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the C2II/C2I system and the PA/LF system share the importance of the N terminus of the enzyme component interacting with the binding component. Recently, Kumaret al. (18Kumar P. Ahuja N. Bhatnagar R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that residues Tyr-137, Tyr-138, Ile-140, and Lys-142 are required for binding of edema factor (767 amino acids) to the PA heptamer (18Kumar P. Ahuja N. Bhatnagar R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Obviously, the minimum length of C2I (C2I1–87) to function as an adaptor for interaction with C2IIa is shorter than that of LF to interact with PA. So far it is not clear whether LF1–254 and C2I1–87 share structural similarities that are responsible for the interaction with the binding components. However, it is important to note that the complete N-terminal domain,e.g. amino acids 1 to 225, was still more efficient as an adaptor for binding and transport of fusion toxins than the short C2I1–87 adaptor. Supported by the structure analysis of the related VIP2 (Fig. 10), we suggest that the complete N-terminal half of C2I (amino acids 1–225) forms a functional unit that is optimal for interaction with C2II. Interaction occurs mainly through the N-terminal four α-helices, which can be fused to variable parts of a “cargo” protein. Further studies are necessary to get more insight into the translocation process of C2I across the C2IIa pore and to understand the molecular interactions involved in binding, defolding, translocation, and refolding of cargo proteins.

In addition, the F plasmid and other low copy number plasmids encode programmed cell death systems: daughter cells, which did not inherit the plasmid, are killed. Such systems are called post-segregational killing or addiction systems (reviewed in Ref. 1Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The F plasmid encodes three such systems: srn (stable RNA degradation) (1Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Annu. Rev.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and remains the best studied. The ccd operon encodes a toxin (CcdB: 101 amino acids, 11.7 kDa) and its antidote (CcdA: 72 amino acids, 8.3 kDa). The synthesis of the ccd proteins is autoregulated at the level of transcription by a complex of both toxin and antitoxin (7de Feyter R. Wallace C. Lane D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Tam J.E. Kline B.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Tam J.E. Kline B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins are expressed, the toxic activity of CcdB being reversibly inactivated by the presence of CcdA. The stability (10Dao-Thi M.H. Messens J. Wyns L. Backmann J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1393-1406Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as in vivo life span (11Jaffé A. Ogura T. Hiraga S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 841-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of CcdB is higher than that of CcdA. It was postulated by us that the thermodynamic stability of CcdA is low enough to keep the protein close to unfolding in vivo conditions, whereby it facilitates its metabolization (10Dao-Thi M.H. Messens J. Wyns L. Backmann J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1393-1406Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Upon plasmid loss, CcdA is quickly degraded by the Lon protease (12Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Van Melderen L. Dao Thi M.-H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), leaving CcdB free to kill the cell. CcdB acts as a poison and inhibitor of DNA gyrase, an essential enzyme that catalyzes negative supercoiling of DNA (14Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 15Kampranis S.C. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CcdA inhibits the lethal action of CcdB by directly binding the toxin (inactivation) and by the extraction of the toxin from its complex with the target gyrase (rejuvenation) (17Maki S. Takiguchi S. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Bernard P. Kezdy K.E. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins P.N.

The crystal structures of CcdB as well as that of a gyrase fragment have been solved and a model for the CcdB-gyrase complex proposed (19Loris R. Dao-Thi M.H. Bahassi E.M. Van Melderen L.

Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Still, crucial mechanistic aspects of the ccd system have remained unrevealed. Even some basic parameters such as the stoichiometry and binding constants of the intermolecular interactions involved are unknown. In the present paper, we investigate in detail the interactions between CcdA, CcdB, and specific operator DNA using a range of biophysical and biochemical techniques. The purification of CcdA and CcdB was carried out as described before in (19Loris R. Dao-Thi M.H. Bahassi E.M. Van Melderen L. Poortmans F. Liddington R. Couturier M. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out in a Quattro II quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) having a m/z range of 4000, equipped with an electrospray interface as described previously (22Messens J. Hayburn G. Desmyter A. Laus G. Wyns L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16857-16865Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding between CcdA and CcdB was monitored in near-UV CD in the spectral range from 280 to 295 nm. The protein solutions were centrifuged and filtered (0.45 μm) to remove turbidity. Approximately 4 ml (exact volume determined using analytical balances) of ∼10 μm CcdB (concentration determined photometrically using the extinction coefficients from Dao-Thi et al. (10Dao-Thi M.H. Messens J. Wyns L. Backmann J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1393-1406Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) in the corresponding buffer (either 50 mm citrate, pH 5.6, 100 mm NaCl, or 50 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl) was placed in a thermostated cuvette with 1-cm optical path length and then titrated with ∼60 μl of ∼35 μm CcdA (exact concentration determined photometrically prior to titration) solution in the same buffer so that a molar ratio CcdB:CcdA of 2 was reached after around 10 additions. The progress of reaction was best monitored by the intensity of the negative peak at around 283 nm. HPLC1chromatography was carried out on a 600S Controller coupled to a 996 PDA detector (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with a Rheodyne 9125 (Cotati, CA) injector using a reverse phase C4 column (4.6 × 25 mm) (214TP54) (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated in 15% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min. The column was developed with a 50-min linear gradient from 10 to 50% acetonitrile at room temperature. Absorption data collection at 280 nm was performed under Millennium (Waters). The column was calibrated with 1:1 and 1:2 mixtures of CcdA-CcdB. Peak heights were found to be the most accurate to calculate CcdA:CcdB ratios and were used as such. For the size-exclusion experiments the CcdA:CcdB 1:2 complex was prepared by adding dropwise CcdA to CcdB in different buffer solutions to achieve a final concentration of 5 and 10 μm,respectively. The 500-μl mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to injection (450 μl) on a Superdex75 HR 10/30 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The buffer solutions are: 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 50 mmMops, pH 7.0, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 50 mmBicine, pH 9.0. The Superdex75 HR column was, respectively, equilibrated in 50 mm buffer solution, 150 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and calibrated with a gel filtration standard from Bio-Rad, i.e. γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12(1.35 kDa). All runs were performed at room temperature on anÄkta-Explorer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For the DNA complex binding experiments: the Superdex75 HR column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. The CcdA:CcdB 1:1 complex was prepared by adding dropwise CcdA to CcdB in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to achieve a final concentration of 15 μm each. The CcdA·CcdB·DNA complex was prepared by adding dropwise CcdA to the mixture of CcdB and the 85-bp MH12 DNA fragment (see Fig.5C) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to achieve a final concentration of 15 μm CcdA, 15 μm CcdB, and 80 μg/ml DNA or 5 μm CcdA, 10 μmCcdB, and 80 μg/ml DNA. In another experiment the CcdA2CcdB4 complex was formed, followed by a 10-min incubation with 60 μg/ml 85-bp MH12 DNA fragment in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Each mixture (500 μl) was incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to injection (450 μl). The procedure of preparing the mixtures is critical and has to be followed accurately to avoid possible precipitation. Binding of CcdA and CcdB proteins to specific 5′-end-labeled DNA fragments was determined according to the method described by (23Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with modifications. Protein-DNA complexes were formed in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol) in the presence of 0.1 μg of sonicated herring sperm DNA for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were loaded on preelectrophoresed 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA). Electrophoresis was performed in the same TBE running buffer at room temperature at 8 V/cm for 3 h. DNase I footprinting was performed according to the method described by Galas and Schmitz (24Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were incubated with 5′-end-labeled DNA fragments in 100 μl of binding buffer (see above, gel retardation) and further treated as described previously (25Charlier D. Hassanzadeh G. Kholti A. Gigot D. Pierard A. Glansdorff N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 392-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Binding studies with CcdA and CcdB were carried out with a MicroCalTM Omega isothermal titration calorimeter. The concentration of the samples in the cell and the syringe was determined spectrophotometrically. Both proteins were dialyzed prior to titration against the same buffer using Spectra/Por® CE (molecular weight cut-off, 5000; sample volume, 2 ml) at room temperature (cold room temperature causes precipitation of CcdA at high concentration) for 3 h. The titrations were carried out at a temperature of 25 °C. Due to the complexity of the interaction, the standard software could not be applied meaningful. The results were interpreted based on the inflection point and the shape of the thermograms. Semiquantitative conclusions on the strength of the involved microscopic interactions were obtained supposing that in the early stage of a titration, one type of interaction dominates the overall reaction. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms were simulated for different values of p =K·Ctot·n, whereK is the binding constant, Ctot the macromolecular concentration in the cell before starting the titration, and n is the number of binding sites. Only for pvalues of around 5–50 sigmoidal curves are obtained. For values around unity and below, the titration curve is featureless. For pvalues of 100 or above, an abrupt transition (“box car”) is observed. From the shape of the experimentally measured thermograms, the parameter p is about 2000 for the forward titration (CcdA into CcdB) and 20 for the reverse titration (CcdB into CcdA). This leads to the following limits for the binding constants involved: 105m−1 < KL< KH < 108m−1. The following model, where B2 represents the CcdB dimer and A2 the CcdA dimer, was set up. A2+B2↔KLA2B2A2B2+A2↔KLA2B2A2A2B2+B2↔KHB2A2B2A2B2+A2B2↔KHA2B2A2B2A2B2A2+B2↔KHA2B2A2B2B2A2B2+A2↔KLA2B2A2B2B2A2B2+A2B2↔KHB2A2B2A2B2A2B2A2+A2B2↔KHA2B2A2B2A2A2B2A2B2+B2↔KHB2A2B2A2B2A2B2A2B2+A2↔KLA2B2A2B2A2⋯etc.MODEL1Higher aggregates thanA2B2A2B2A2andB2A2B2A2B2were neglected. These aggregates could already be considered to have the tendency to precipitate. Combining the above expressions for the equilibrium constants and the following mass balances.A2,total=[A2]+KL[A2][B2]+KLKH[A2][B2]2+2KL2[A2]2[B2]+2KHKL2[A2]2[B2]2+3KHKL3[A2]3[B2]2+2KH2KL2[A2]2[B2]3(…)Equation 1 B2,total=[B2]+KL[A2][B2]+KL2[A2]2[B2]+2KLKH[A2][B2]2+2KHKL2[A2]2[B2]2+2KHKL3[A2]3[B2]2+3KH2KL2[A2]2[B2]3(…)Equation 2 The equilibrium concentrations were solved numerically using the Euler method. Iterations were carried out to minimize the differences between the calculated A2,total andB2,total and the actual values. The robustness of the model was checked by applying different binding constants within the same order of magnitude, giving essentially the same results. Two series of simulations were carried out. In the first one the total concentration of CcdB (B2,total) was kept constant at 10−5m dimer equivalents (0.47 mg/ml), and the total CcdA concentration (A2,total) was varied from the thousandth to the thousandfold. In a second series of simulation the CcdA concentration was restrained and the amount of CcdB altered in an analogous way. CcdA is thought to counteract the lethal effect of CcdB by forming a noncovalent complex that prevents CcdB to interact with gyrase (17Maki S. Takiguchi S. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,18Bernard P. Kezdy K.E. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins P.N. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of this complex is still not strictly defined (8Tam J.E. Kline B.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Maki S. Takiguchi S. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol.

Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium1995Google Scholar), and both CcdA2CcdB2 and CcdA2CcdB4 have been suggested (16Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bahassi E.M. Salmon M.A. Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have therefore used high resolution gel filtration chromatography experiments to observe such complexes and to determine experimental conditions suitable for a detailed characterization of their properties. CcdA:CcdB 1:2 and 1:1 mixtures were prepared and analyzed on an analytical gel-permeation column Superdex75 HR at different pH values (pH 5 to pH 9). For the 1:2 mixture, three major populations were observed (Fig.1): a 65.5-kDa peak (at an elution volume of 10 ml) that is in agreement with a CcdA2CcdB4 complex, a 24.4-kDa (elution volume 12 ml) peak corresponding to the dimer of CcdB, and a peak around 18-ml elution volume that contained aggregated and degraded CcdA and CcdB. The 16.6-kDa peak of the dimer of CcdA was only observed at pH 5. The 65.5-kDa peak was analyzed on a C4-reverse phase column (C4-RPC), and its chromatographic profile at 280 nm is shown on theinset in Fig. 1. The peaks obtained from the reverse phase step were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. CcdA elutes in two peaks with retention times of 39.4′ and 39.8′, both with identical masses of 8372 Da, while CcdB elutes with a retention time of 48.6′ with a mass of 11704 Da. The masses determined with electrospray mass spectrometry match the calculated masses of CcdA and CcdB. After calibration of the C4-RPC column for CcdA and CcdB, the ratio of CcdA:CcdB under the 65.5-kDa peak was found to be 1:2, confirming a CcdA2CcdB4 complex. The height of the gel filtration peak at around 18-ml elution volume is pH-dependent. It is largest in the experiment carried out at pH 9 (Fig. 1). Reverse phase chromatography on a C4-RPC showed that this peak also contains a mixture of intact CcdA and CcdB. The ratio of CcdA:CcdB under this elution peak is 2:3, which might correspond to a CcdA4CcdB6 complex. The fact that this peak is eluting before the salt peak of the size-exclusion column means that this aggregate is aspecifically interacting with the matrix or is able to enter the pores of the matrix. When CcdA and CcdB were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, a completely different elution profile was obtained. The chromatogram of this mixture at pH 8.0 is also shown in Fig. 1. A broad peak around an elution volume of 12 ml was observed, indicating the presence of different possible complexes together with free CcdB and CcdA. A peak around an elution volume of 18 ml containing aggregates was also observed. CcdA has a flat and featureless CD spectrum in the region from 260 to 300 nm, allowing the titration of CcdA into CcdB to be followed in the near-UV CD spectrum of CcdB. As can be seen in Fig.2A, two peaks between 280 and 300 nm shift in intensity as well as position (from 288.9 to 292.2 nm and from 282.2 to 283.8 nm). Fig. 2B shows the change in intensity of these two peaks when titrating CcdA into CcdB. A plateau is reached around a CcdA:CcdB ratio of 2. Around this ratio, addition of CcdA also causes local clouding. At a CcdA:CcdB ratio of 3 a persistent turbidity evolves. This coincides with a sagging of the intensity of the CD spectra. Similar, when adding CcdB to a CcdA solution, turbidity evolves at a very early stage. Furthermore isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to study the interaction between CcdA and CcdB. ITC has the advantage that it does not depend on the optical properties of a system but records a physical property inherent to almost all binding processes, the production or absorption of heat. Hence titrations can be carried out in both directions, i.e. having CcdB in the cell and adding small amounts of a concentrated CcdA solution as well as vice versa. For simple binding phenomena, both experiments are expected to produce the same results. Interestingly, different starting points lead to different apparent stoichiometries and affinities (Fig. 3,A and B). Starting from an excess of CcdB, saturation is reached at a ratio CcdA:CcdB of 1:2. In the reverse case, starting from an excess of CcdA, a binding signal was recorded until a ratio of above 1:1 was reached. In both cases, but especially noticeably in the second condition that lead to an approximately 1:1 stoichiometry, the contents of the calorimetric cell was slightly turbid after the experiment. This is indicative of the formation of insoluble aggregates. The two titration thermograms show a second difference: in the first case saturation is attained rather abruptly, whereas in the second case it is reached smoothly. This indicates that the interaction is characterized by more than one binding constant and/or might be partially irreversible. A thermogram obtained from such a complex interaction cannot be analyzed with the standard software to obtain the involved microscopic binding constants. Rough estimates of the binding constants can be obtained if we assume that in the early phase of the transition (when one of the reactants is in excess) one binding constant dominates the process. Assuming a model with two microscopic binding constantsKL and KH, one constant will dominate the early stages of the forward titration, while the other will dominate in the early stages of the reverse titration. Such a model is described in detail in the following paragraph. To understand the complex behavior observed for the interaction between CcdA and CcdB, we performed numerical simulations of the forward and reverse titrations. We assumed a model in which CcdA and CcdB can form long chains in a cooperative way. Such a model is realistic given the strong tendency of CcdA and CcdB for forming precipitates when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and the possibility of producing a soluble CcdA2CcdB4 complex. In this cooperative interaction model, initial binding of a single dimer of CcdB2 to CcdA2 occurs with a binding constantKL. Addition of a second molecule of CcdB2 to an existing CcdA2CcdB2complex involves a higher affinity constant KH. In a similar way, higher molecular weight species are produced by addition of more CcdA2 and CcdB2 dimers using the same binding constants. The equilibrium equations of the model are given in the experimental procedures section. This cooperative model assumes a conformational change on the part of CcdA. Most likely, CcdA is partly unfolded when not bound to CcdB. Binding of a first CcdB2dimer to CcdA2 results in proper folding and creates a more stable binding site for the second CcdB2 dimer. It is not possible to obtain correct values of KLand KH from the ITC experiments. However, the applied protein concentrations and the shape of the observed titration thermograms permit us to make a reasonable estimate for the range of the binding constants involved (105m−1 <KL <KH < 108m−1) (29Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman & Hall, New York1992: 1-17Google Scholar). Indeed a sigmoidal titration thermogram is only observed within this range. Smaller values result in a soft featureless increase, while larger values lead to an abrupt jump (Fig. 3C). Based on the above considerations we estimated two numerical values for the binding constants: KL = 106m−1 and KH = 5 107m−1. Typical results of our simulations are given in Fig.4. We calculated the distribution of the protein into different complexes mimicking the experimental conditions of the ITC titration experiments (relatively high concentrations: 2 10−5m protein). Because of the robustness of the model the result is only marginally influenced by variations of the binding constants in the same order of magnitude. The calculation shows that at equimolar amounts of CcdA and CcdB most of CcdA is present in the form of the higher aggregates of the type (A2B2)n. Only at a molar ratio CcdB:CcdA of above ∼3:1, the soluble hexamer CcdA2CcdB4 will be the dominant form of CcdA. In Fig. 4B it can be seen that at this excess a maximal fraction of CcdB will also be in this hexameric form. Above this molar ratio most of CcdB will be in the form of the free dimer, because all the available CcdA is consumed in complexes. On the other hand at close to equimolar concentrations and at molar ratios CcdB:CcdA below 1, especially between 0.1 and 1, CcdB is found in higher aggregates and the hexamer CcdA4CcdB2. Such a situation can be characterized as an aggregation scenario, confirmed by gel filtration experiments. It is known from literature that both ccd proteins participate in the autoregulation of the system (7de Feyter R. Wallace C. Lane D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Tam J.E. Kline B.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Tam J.E. Kline B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only few details on the interaction of the ccd proteins with the ccdoperator DNA are known. CcdA binds on DNA and CcdB does not (also see below). To better characterize the binding site(s) of CcdA and the role of CcdB, we examined the DNase I footprint to a 157-bp fragment (F4R1: fragment from start of F4 to end of R1; see Fig.5C). These experiments revealed a large region of interaction (∼110 bp; Fig. 5, Aand B), in agreement with previous data obtained with the lysate of a strain overexpressing the ccd proteins (9Tam J.E. Kline B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Tam and Kline (9Tam J.E. Kline B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) only detected protection of one strand, we definitely observed a complex footprint for each strand. Protected stretches of ∼7–10 nucleotides long are separated by 3–6-nucleotide-long segments that either remained normally accessible to the nuclease or became hyper-reactive to DNase I cleavage in the presence of both Ccd proteins. These alternating patches of protection and hypersensitivity toward digestion are mostly staggered by a few nucleotides toward the 3′-end on one strand with respect to the complementary partner (Fig. 5C). Such a pattern is consistent with a series of CcdA·CcdB complexes that spiral along a 120-bp region. Footprinting experiments were performed using different CcdA:CcdB ratios ranging from 1:1 to 3:1. The observed footprint patterns are indistinguishable (Fig. 5A). In the absence of CcdB, only a slight effect but in no way a clear pattern of protection was observed (Fig. 5B). Mobility-shift experiments performed with an aliquot of the very same samples (data not shown) clearly demonstrated binding of CcdA to the operator fragment. The lack of a distinct footprint most likely reflects the formation of unstable CcdA-operator DNA complexes with high on and off rates (see below). The region protected by the CcdA·CcdB complex against DNase I cleavage contains two interesting stretches, the promoter region, and a 6-bp palindrome sequence just downstream of the −10 promoter element (Fig. 5C). To better characterize the sequence requirements for binding of the Ccd proteins and to determine the minimal target site for CcdA-CcdB binding, we have performed gel retardation experiments with a variety of DNA fragments: the 157-bp F4R1 fragment and three subfragments thereof (OP12, Prom, and Pal; for a definition of these fragments, see Fig.5C) that were synthesized according to the nucleotide sequence described by Tam and Kline (9Tam J.E. Kline B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shift assays indicated that CcdA retards all four of these fragments, but CcdB does not. Fig.6A shows the titration of F4R1 with CcdA. The transition from unbound to CcdA-bound F4R1 DNA is very sharp, pointing to a strong cooperative interaction. Relatively low concentrations of CcdB (around 0.5 μm) are sufficient to provide an apparent increase in affinity of CcdA for F4R1. A larger shift of the DNA fragment is observed. The affinity of CcdA for F4R1 in the presence of CcdB is estimated to be about 10 times higher than that observed in its absence as measured by the amount of CcdA necessary to produce a band shift. Similarly, we demonstrated binding of CcdA alone and the CcdB-induced increase in the apparent binding constant and “supershifting,” for the 34-bp-long OP12 fragment (Fig.6C). In contrast, binding of CcdA on the 25-bp fragment containing the palindrome sequence (Pal) was only detectable in the presence of CcdB, whereas binding on the 21-bp-long promoter sequence (Prom) was hardly detectable (Fig. 6C). Combined (see also DNase I footprinting), these results indicate that the palindrome region might constitute the nucleation site for binding of multiple CcdA-CcdB molecules to the control region of the ccdoperon.

This implicates polarized sorting mechanisms in the production and accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). We have now studied polarized sorting of β-secretase (BACE) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The majority of BACE is sorted to the apical surface of MDCK cells where very little β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) is observed, because βAPP undergoes basolateral sorting. Consistent with the usage of similar mechanisms for polarized sorting, BACE was also found to be targeted to axons of hippocampal neurons. The remaining basolaterally sorted BACE competes with the highly polarized basolateral α-secretase activity. Therefore, substantial amounts of BACE are targeted away from βAPP to a non-amyloidogenic compartment, a cellular mechanism that limits Aβ generation. In addition, no α-secretase activity was observed on the apical side whereas γ-secretase activity is observed on the basolateral and the apical side. Consistent with this finding, substantial amounts of Aβ can be produced apically upon missorting of βAPP to the apical surface. These data demonstrate that Aβ production is limited in polarized cells by differential targeting of BACE and its substrate βAPP.

This suggests that polarized sorting mechanisms may be involved in the production and accumulation of Aβ. As a model system to study polarized sorting of βAPP and the three secretase activities, we used the well characterized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, because they allow the generation of stably transfected cell lines with moderate expression levels and appear to use similar mechanisms for polarized sorting as neuronal cells (20Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments on polarized sorting of βAPP in this cell line provided first evidence for the cellular mechanism underlying the enhanced Aβ production caused by the Swedish mutation (21Lo A.C.

A targeting signal containing a tyrosine within the cytoplasmic domain of βAPP is required for polarized sorting of membrane-associated βAPP (24Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).

We therefore analyzed the sorting of BACE and its enzymatic activity in terms of Aβ production in polarized cells. Parallel investigation of the α- and γ-secretase activity revealed differential sorting of the two amyloidogenic secretases and their substrate βAPP. This sorting mechanism apparently limits Aβ production, by allowing efficient competition of the exclusive basolateral α-secretase activity with the low amounts of basolaterally sorted BACE.DISCUSSIONBased on the results described above the following picture of polarized βAPP processing and its interaction with the secretase activities is emerging (Fig. 6). Membrane-bound full-length βAPP is targeted predominantly to the basolateral cell surface. In contrast to its substrate, BACE is sorted preferentially to the apical surface. This is observed upon overexpression, however, endogenous BACE activity also undergoes similar sorting. The α- and β-secretase-generated βAPP CTFs, which are the immediate precursors for the γ-secretase cleavage to produce Aβ and p3 (1Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), are targeted to the basolateral membrane, because they contain their cytoplasmic basolateral sorting signal. At the basolateral membrane or close to it the final γ-secretase cleavage takes place, which liberates either Aβ or p3 (Fig. 6). In contrast, γ-secretase activity is sorted to both cell surfaces. Consequently, βAPP can be a substrate for γ-secretase at or close to both surfaces. This does not necessarily imply that PSs are also targeted to both surfaces, because PSs do not overlap with βAPP in late secretory compartments, a phenomenon described as the spatial paradox (40Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. George-Hyslop P.S. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). α-Secretase activity is located on the basolateral side, because its products p3 as well as APPsα are both almost exclusively detected within the basolateral compartment (Fig.6). Thus α- and β-secretase can compete for their substrates only on the basolateral sorting pathway, a cellular mechanism that apparently determines the levels of Aβ generation in polarized cells.Basolateral sorting of α-secretase activity explains the previous paradoxical finding on the sorting of βAPP upon the deletion of its cytoplasmic sorting signal. Under these conditions the holoprotein is targeted to both surfaces, although APPsα continues to be secreted basolateral (24Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that this is due to the predominantly basolateral activity of α-secretase, which consequently supports preferential basolateral secretion of APPsα and p3 even if half of the βAPP molecules are mistargeted to the apical surface.In contrast to APPsα, APPsβ is secreted from both surfaces in almost equal amounts. However, as described above only small amounts of βAPP reach the apical surface, whereas the majority is targeted to the basolateral side. The equal amounts of secreted APPsβ on the apical and basolateral side of MDCK cells expressing endogenous BACE are due to cellular mechanisms, which support BACE-mediated cleavage on the way to the apical surface but reduce BACE-mediated cleavage on the basolateral side. First, on the way to the basolateral side βAPP is cleaved by the competing α-secretases, which consequently reduces the amounts of βAPP available for BACE cleavage. Second, because α-secretory activity was only observed on the basolateral side, the rather small amounts of βAPP, which are targeted to the apical side, are an almost exclusive substrate for BACE. Upon overexpression of BACE, very efficient β-secretory processing is observed at the expense of α-secretory processing. Under these conditions BACE appears to cleave before α-secretase. Thus it is likely that overexpressed BACE has cleaved βAPP already before it reaches thetrans-Golgi network, the compartment known to be required for polarized sorting in MDCK cells (41Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 42Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the strongly increased APPsβ undergoes unpolarized secretion. In contrast, the membrane-bound cleavage products of BACE, the βAPP CTFs, which are the immediate precursors for Aβ generation, still contain their cytoplasmic sorting signal and are consequently targeted to the basolateral side where they can be further processed to Aβ (see above).Finally, our data suggest that, at least in MDCK cells, βAPP is not the major physiological substrate of BACE, because both are targeted in the opposite direction. This is supported by the observation that the β-secretase activity in mice is unable to efficiently cleave endogenous βAPP whereas human βAPP, which has a slightly different amino acid sequence in its Aβ domain, is cleaved normally (43De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, βAPP cannot be the major BACE substrate in mice as well. Indeed, while this report was under review, a novel BACE substrate was identified (44Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K.

A third secretase, the α-secretase, prevents Aβ generation by cleaving in the middle of the Aβ-domain.

This suggests that polarized sorting mechanisms may be involved in the production and accumulation of Aβ. As a model system to study polarized sorting of βAPP and the three secretase activities, we used the well characterized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, because they allow the generation of stably transfected cell lines with moderate expression levels and appear to use similar mechanisms for polarized sorting as neuronal cells (20Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments on polarized sorting of βAPP in this cell line provided first evidence for the cellular mechanism underlying the enhanced Aβ production caused by the Swedish mutation (21Lo A.C.

A targeting signal containing a tyrosine within the cytoplasmic domain of βAPP is required for polarized sorting of membrane-associated βAPP (24Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Deletion of the cytoplasmic sorting signal of βAPP leads to an equal surface distribution of membrane-associated βAPP, whereas APPsα continues to be secreted predominantly from the basolateral surface (24Haass C.

Understanding the cellular sorting pathways associated with proteolytic processing of βAPP and, specifically, the mechanisms that allow the secretase activities to come into contact with their substrate βAPP will help reveal and prevent amyloidogenesis. We therefore analyzed the sorting of BACE and its enzymatic activity in terms of Aβ production in polarized cells. Parallel investigation of the α- and γ-secretase activity revealed differential sorting of the two amyloidogenic secretases and their substrate βAPP. This sorting mechanism apparently limits Aβ production, by allowing efficient competition of the exclusive basolateral α-secretase activity with the low amounts of basolaterally sorted BACE. DISCUSSIONBased on the results described above the following picture of polarized βAPP processing and its interaction with the secretase activities is emerging (Fig. 6). Membrane-bound full-length βAPP is targeted predominantly to the basolateral cell surface. In contrast to its substrate, BACE is sorted preferentially to the apical surface. This is observed upon overexpression, however, endogenous BACE activity also undergoes similar sorting. The α- and β-secretase-generated βAPP CTFs, which are the immediate precursors for the γ-secretase cleavage to produce Aβ and p3 (1Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), are targeted to the basolateral membrane, because they contain their cytoplasmic basolateral sorting signal. At the basolateral membrane or close to it the final γ-secretase cleavage takes place, which liberates either Aβ or p3 (Fig. 6). In contrast, γ-secretase activity is sorted to both cell surfaces. Consequently, βAPP can be a substrate for γ-secretase at or close to both surfaces. This does not necessarily imply that PSs are also targeted to both surfaces, because PSs do not overlap with βAPP in late secretory compartments, a phenomenon described as the spatial paradox (40Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. George-Hyslop P.S. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). α-Secretase activity is located on the basolateral side, because its products p3 as well as APPsα are both almost exclusively detected within the basolateral compartment (Fig.6). Thus α- and β-secretase can compete for their substrates only on the basolateral sorting pathway, a cellular mechanism that apparently determines the levels of Aβ generation in polarized cells.Basolateral sorting of α-secretase activity explains the previous paradoxical finding on the sorting of βAPP upon the deletion of its cytoplasmic sorting signal. Under these conditions the holoprotein is targeted to both surfaces, although APPsα continues to be secreted basolateral (24Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that this is due to the predominantly basolateral activity of α-secretase, which consequently supports preferential basolateral secretion of APPsα and p3 even if half of the βAPP molecules are mistargeted to the apical surface.In contrast to APPsα, APPsβ is secreted from both surfaces in almost equal amounts. However, as described above only small amounts of βAPP reach the apical surface, whereas the majority is targeted to the basolateral side. The equal amounts of secreted APPsβ on the apical and basolateral side of MDCK cells expressing endogenous BACE are due to cellular mechanisms, which support BACE-mediated cleavage on the way to the apical surface but reduce BACE-mediated cleavage on the basolateral side. First, on the way to the basolateral side βAPP is cleaved by the competing α-secretases, which consequently reduces the amounts of βAPP available for BACE cleavage. Second, because α-secretory activity was only observed on the basolateral side, the rather small amounts of βAPP, which are targeted to the apical side, are an almost exclusive substrate for BACE. Upon overexpression of BACE, very efficient β-secretory processing is observed at the expense of α-secretory processing. Under these conditions BACE appears to cleave before α-secretase. Thus it is likely that overexpressed BACE has cleaved βAPP already before it reaches thetrans-Golgi network, the compartment known to be required for polarized sorting in MDCK cells (41Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 42Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the strongly increased APPsβ undergoes unpolarized secretion. In contrast, the membrane-bound cleavage products of BACE, the βAPP CTFs, which are the immediate precursors for Aβ generation, still contain their cytoplasmic sorting signal and are consequently targeted to the basolateral side where they can be further processed to Aβ (see above).Finally, our data suggest that, at least in MDCK cells, βAPP is not the major physiological substrate of BACE, because both are targeted in the opposite direction. This is supported by the observation that the β-secretase activity in mice is unable to efficiently cleave endogenous βAPP whereas human βAPP, which has a slightly different amino acid sequence in its Aβ domain, is cleaved normally (43De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, βAPP cannot be the major BACE substrate in mice as well. Indeed, while this report was under review, a novel BACE substrate was identified (44Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K.

Human infection by the protozoan pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis causes one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases throughout the world (1Honigberg B.M. Kreier J.P. Parasitic protozoa. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1978: 275-754Google Scholar). Although this protozoan infection usually manifests itself as self-limiting in males, it can impose serious health problems for female patients especially during pregnancy, and it is also implicated as a risk factor for cervical cancer and as a predisposition to human immunodeficiency virus contagion (2Meysick K.

As one of the deepest branches of the eukaryotic lineage, this organism exhibits interesting features that deviate from higher eukaryotes and represents an important model system in phylogenetic studies (4Gunderson J.

With the recent advent of gene transfer techniques for T. vaginalis (5Delgadillo M.G. Liston D.R. Niazi K. Johnson P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

T. vaginalis trophozoites colonize the epithelial surface of the human urogenital tract in which they obtain nutrients, multiply, and face a constant challenge from host immune surveillance. Iron, which is an essential nutrient for almost every organism, is particularly important for T. vaginalis as it regulates growth rate, metabolic activities, and the expression of certain virulence phenotypes such as cytoadherence and resistance to complement lysis (6Peterson K.M.

At the molecular level, iron has been shown to up-regulate the expression of a number of cellular proteins including a group of putative adhesin molecules, the identities of which are still controversial (8Lehker M.W.

Iron has also been shown to regulate the phosphorylation level of a major surface immunogen P270, which may be responsible for immune evasion (20Alderete J.F. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4298-4302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that iron is a key modulator in the versatile cellular activities in T. vaginalis. Because the expression of some of the putative adhesin proteins can be inhibited by actinomycin D (8Lehker M.W. Arroyo R. Alderete J.F. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), iron-induced gene expression may be regulated at the transcription level. The knowledge of transcriptional regulation in T. vaginalisis still very limited. T. vaginalis has been shown to use a metazoan initiator-like element spanning the transcription initiation site(s) to initiate transcription of messenger RNA (21Liston D.R. Johnson P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2380-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the α-succinyl Co-A synthetase gene (α-scs) 1The abbreviations used are:α-scsα-succinyl Co-A synthetase geneapadhesin protein genelucluciferase geneANOVAanalysis of variance promoter also revealed two novel DNA elements within the −98/−69 region as essential for transcription initiation (22Liston D.R. Carrero J-C. Johnson P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the TATA boxes and other distal DNA regulatory elements commonly used in higher eukaryotes to regulate the basal transcription of messenger RNA have not been identified in T. vaginalis (22Liston D.R. Carrero J-C. Johnson P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that transcription machinery in T. vaginalis may deviate significantly from the well known machinery operating in higher eukaryotes. α-succinyl Co-A synthetase gene adhesin protein gene luciferase gene analysis of variance In this study, the ap65-1 gene, which encodes a 65-kDa protein reputed to be one of the surface adhesin proteins (12Alderete J.F.

The DNA regulatory elements in theap65-1 promoter were characterized by promoter analysisin vivo in conjunction with DNA-protein interaction assaysin vitro. The DNA regulatory elements distributed within −110/−54 were found to regulate iron-induced gene expression, whereas those flanking this region were found to regulate basal transcription. A distal region was found to activate both basal and iron-induced transcriptional activities of the ap65-1 promoter. These findings provide a useful model system for future investigations of basal as well as iron-induced transcriptional regulation in T. vaginalis. T. vaginalis axenic cultures were maintained at 37 °C in TYI-S33 medium as described previously (23Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

The medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum without iron-fortification (Hyclone), and the iron concentration in this medium was estimated to be 1 μm. Ferrous ammonium sulfate was added to the desired concentrations as described previously (8Lehker M.W. Arroyo R. Alderete J.F. J. Exp.

AGATCT, BglII; GAATCC, EcoRI. Open table in a new tab A Sau3AI genomic DNA library derived from T. vaginalis JH32A#4 was constructed in pBluescriptIIKS+ (Stratagene). The sequence flanking 5′ of the ap65-1 gene was amplified from the library using a gene-specific 3′- primer ap1 and either T7 or T3 on the vector as 5′ primer by PCR amplification. The PCR products were then cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega), and a positive clone pAP5′ with a 0.25-kb DNA sequence spanning the −235/+35 region of the ap65-1 gene was obtained (Fig. 1 A). An overlap DNA sequence spanning the −217/+217 region was amplified from T. vaginalis T1 genomic DNA by a second PCR amplification using primers p−217 and ap2 and cloned into pGEM-T to produce pAP(−217/+217). The 3′-untranslated region of the ap65-1 gene was amplified by PCR using the primer pair ap3 and ap4 from genomic DNA and cloned into pGEM-T to produce pAP3′. Cellular RNA was extracted using the UltraSpec RNA reagent (Biotek). Primer extension was performed as described previously (24Sun C.H. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with the exception that the γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide was purified using a NAP-5 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and that primer extension was performed at 52 °C by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotides ap5 and tub3 were used to prime ap65-1 messenger RNA and tubulin messenger RNA, respectively (Table I). pAP5′ was digested byBglII/SalI and fused together with a 1.7-kbluc+ fragment excised from pSPluc+ (Promega) byBglII/XhoI digestion, resulting in pAPluc+3′Δ. The insert from pAP3′ was excised byEcoRI/NdeI digestion and cloned intoEcoRI/NdeI-digested pAPluc+3′Δ to produce pAPluc+ (Fig. 2 A). The sequence spanning the −234/+399 region of the β-tubulin gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR amplification using primers tub1 and tub3′ (25Katiyar S.K. Edlind T.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and cloned into pGEM-T to produce pTUB5′. The region spanning the −234/+32 region of pTUB5′ was then amplified by primers tub1 and tub 2 and cloned into pGEM-T. The insert was excised by digestion with SacII and BglII, and the resulted DNA fragment was cloned into SacII/BglII-digested pAPluc+ to produce pTUBluc+ (Fig.2 B). 5′ deletion mutants with the exception of p−114 were constructed by amplifying DNA from pAPluc+ using one of the 5′ primers at the defined site (Table I) and a 3′ primer luc344R derived from theluc+ gene (24Sun C.H. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T. The inserts were then excised by SacII/NarI and cloned into pAPluc+ to replace the originalSacII/NarI sequence. TheSacII/EcoRV fragment was removed from pAPluc+ by restriction enzyme digestions, and the resulting DNA was treated with Klenow DNA polymerase before ligation to produce p−114. All deletion constructs are named according to the location of the 5′ end relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 3). Targeted mutagenesis was performed by PCR to create mutations in pAPluc+. A restriction enzyme site was designed on oligonucleotides for each region to be mutated (TableII). To create mutations within the −230/−192 region, a PCR product was amplified from pAPluc+ using a 5′ primer with clustered mutations at the target site and luc344R as the 3′ primer. To create two point mutations in the initiator region, a PCR product was amplified from pAPluc+ using ap5′ as the 5′ primer and an antisense 3′ primer m(+1/+3)-3′. To create mutations within the −187/−3 region with the exception of the −109/−102 and −101/−96 regions, a 5′-PCR product was amplified from pAPluc+ using ap5′ as the 5′ primer and an antisense 3′ primer at the target site, and a 3′-PCR product was amplified using a 5′ primer at the target site and luc344R as the 3′ primer. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T. The inserts were excised by appropriate enzymes and ligated withSacII/NarI-digested pAPluc+ to produce a series of mutant constructs (see Fig. 4). To create mutations in the −109/−102 and −101/−96 regions, a PCR product was amplified from pAPluc+ using a 5′ primer at the target site and luc344R as the 3′ primer. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T. The inserts were excised by EcoRV and NarI and ligated withEcoRV/NarI-digested pAPluc+ to produce respective mutant constructs (see Fig. 4).Table IIOligonucleotides used to construct mutants of pAPluc+NameSequence (5′ → 3′)2-aRestriction enzyme sites are underlined.

Open table in a new tab T. vaginalis T1 cells grown to 1.5 × 106trophozoites ml−1 were diluted 10-fold with fresh medium and incubated overnight until cell density reached 1.5 × 106 trophozoites ml−1. Cells were harvested from cultures by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min (GPR centrifuge, Beckman) and resuspended in fresh medium at a final concentration of 108 trophozoites ml−1. The cells were passed through a 23-gauge needle gently four times using a 5-ml syringe to disperse cell clumps. An aliquot of 300 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 60 μg of plasmid DNA in a 0.4-cm gap ice-cooled electroporation cuvette (Invitrogen). Electroporation was performed at 300 V, 1000 microfarads, and 720 ohms using a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX). Cells were kept on ice for 15 min after electroporation and divided into two tubes with fresh medium. A preliminary study using pTUBluc+ (see below) to transfect cells from various T. vaginalis isolates revealed that transfection efficiency of cells from the T1 isolate was at least 100-fold higher than cells from JH32A#4, NIH-C1, or T068II isolates under our experimental conditions. 2Y.-F. Liu, and J.-H. Tai, unpublished observations. TheT. vaginalis T1 isolate was therefore selected for the transfection experiments performed in this report. Luciferase activity of transfected cells was performed as described previously (24Sun C.H. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with the exception that 200 μg ml−1 N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone was used as protease inhibitor to replace aprotinin and that the cell lysate was directly assayed without pretreatment at −70 °C. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS software version 8.0 (1997). Nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (24Sun C.H. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with the exception that 200 μg ml−1 N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone was used as protease inhibitor instead of aprotinin and that a Dounce-type homogenizer (Wheaton) was used to homogenize cells. A BCA protein quantification kit was used to determine protein concentration in nuclear lysate as described by the supplier (Pierce). Probe labeling and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed as described previously (24Sun C.H. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking sequence of the ap65-1 gene was first cloned from the T. vaginalis JH32A#4 and T1 isolates by two separate PCR amplifications, and an identical 0.25-kilobase pair DNA sequence was obtained (Fig.1 A) (GenBankTMaccession number AF364546), indicating that theap65-1 gene is conserved between the two isolates. The transcription start site of ap65-1 messenger RNA was then mapped by primer extension using RNA extracted from T. vaginalis T1 cells grown in 12 μm iron. A major extension product of 71 nucleotides and a minor extension product of 72 nucleotides were consistently produced in reactions priming 50 μg of cellular RNA with γ-32P-labeled ap5 (Fig.1 B, lane 1). The major extension product is mapped to an adenosine 14 upstream of the translation start site, indicating that the initiator-like sequence most proximal to the translation start site serves as the initiator element of the ap65-1 promoter. The adenosine residue in this initiator element is defined as +1 in the text. Primer extension reactions were then performed to analyze transcriptional regulation of the ap65-1 gene by iron using RNA samples from a cloned T. vaginalis T1 cell line. In each of these reactions, 50 μg of cellular RNA was primed with γ-32P-labeled ap5 or tub3. Overall extension signals of ap65-1 messenger RNA from cells treated with 250 μm iron were 3-fold higher than those from cells treated with 1 μm iron (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and3, respectively). Consistent with previous findings (25Katiyar S.K. Edlind T.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the primer extension of β-tubulin messenger RNA resulted in a major product of 58 nucleotides, and the intensity of this band only changed slightly in response to changing iron supply (Fig.1 B, lanes 4 and 5). Two luciferase expression plasmids, pAPluc+ and pTUBluc+ (Fig.2), were used to monitor transcriptional activities of the ap65-1 and β-tubulinpromoters, respectively, in T. vaginalis T1 cells. In these experiments, luciferase activity in cells transfected with pSPluc+ was taken as background. A low level of luciferase activity (∼80-fold above background) was first detected in pAPluc+-transfected cells at 11 h post-transfection. The activity increased steadily until reaching an optimal level (∼750-fold above background) at 32 h post-transfection and declined slowly as the stationary phase of cell growth was reached. Luciferase activity of pAPluc+-transfected cells measured at 30 h post-transfection exhibited an iron-dependent increase from 1 to 500 μm iron and leveled off at a higher concentration (Fig. 2 A). Iron concentration below 1 μm was not tested, because it requires the addition of the iron-chelator 2–2′-dipyridyl, which retards the growth of transfected cells in our experimental conditions. Luciferase expression in pTUBluc+-transfected cells was 370-fold and nearly 30,000-fold above background at 13 and 28 h post-transfection, respectively. However, luciferase activity in pTUBluc+-transfected cells was independent of iron concentration (Fig. 2 B). Whereas transcriptional activity of the ap65-1 promoter was enhanced by 15-fold in the presence of 250 μm iron, it was rather insensitive to other divalent metal ions such as Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ at a similar concentration (Fig. 2 C), indicating that this promoter is specifically responsive to ferrous ion. In subsequent experiments, luciferase activities in cells grown in 1 and 250 μm iron measured at 30 h post-transfection were taken as basal and inducible transcriptional activities, respectively. Luciferase activity measured in pAPluc+-transfected cells from low iron cultures was taken as the original activity (100%). The regulatory regions in the ap65-1 promoter were first mapped by testing the transcription efficiency of a series of pAPluc+ 5′ deletion mutants in transfected cells (Fig.3). In these experiments, pAPluc+-transfected cells exhibited an average ∼16-fold induction with iron treatment. Basal luciferase activity was reduced to ∼35%, ∼24%, and ∼18% original level with deletions to −217, −204, and −184, respectively, and iron-induced luciferase expression was reduced to ∼5.5-, ∼3.3-, and ∼3-fold, respectively. Basal luciferase activity remained at ∼18% original level with deletions to −133, −114, and −80, but the induction level with iron treatment reduced to 2.2-, 1.3-, and 0.9- fold, respectively. Basal luciferase activity dropped to 11 and 7% original level with deletions to −40 and −12, respectively, without obvious iron-induced gene expression. With the deletion of the 3′-untranslated region (pAPluc+3′Δ), luciferase activity decreased to 10% original level, but the induction level remained at 14-fold with iron treatment. These findings suggest that iron-inducible gene expression is primarily regulated by the DNA element(s) distal to the transcription start sites. The 5′-flanking sequence in pAPluc+ was further studied by scanning mutagenesis (Fig. 4). Significant reduction in basal luciferase expression was observed in mutants with clustered mutations spanning the −121/−102 (Fig. 4, pm−121/−118, pm−114/−111, and pm−109/−102) and −52/−39 (Fig. 4, pm−52/−48 and pm−44/−39) regions. Their activities were reduced to ∼30% original level. The most severe reduction in basal transcription was seen in a mutant with two point mutations in the reputed initiator region (Fig. 4, pm+1/+3), which was only ∼2% original level. On the other hand, a significant reduction in iron-induced luciferase expression was seen in mutants with clustered mutations spanning the −109/−56 region (Fig. 4, pm−109/−102, pm−101/−96, pm−95/−81, pm−80/−66, and pm−61/−56). These findings suggest that the basal transcription of the 65-1gene is regulated by the DNA elements spanning the −121/−102 and −52/−39 regions in concert with the proximal initiator sequence, and iron-induced gene expression is regulated by the DNA element(s) spanning the −109/−56 region. In conjunction with the deletion mapping experiments (Fig. 3), these results also suggest that the −230/−184 region may contain DNA regulatory elements essential for optimal transcriptional activity of the ap65-1 promoter. Nuclear proteins interacting with the DNA regulatory elements in the iron-responsive region of the ap65-1promoter were then studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A major DNA-protein complex was detected in 8% polyacrylamide gel testing for binding of nuclear proteins to 32P-labeled −68/−45 (Fig. 5). Similar banding patterns were observed in reactions using nuclear lysate from cells treated with either low or high iron (data not shown). Complex formation was greatly inhibited by 250× molar excess of (−68/−45) but was only slightly inhibited by 1000× molar excess of (−107/−85) (Fig. 5 A). Further competition assays were performed using 1000× molar excess of mutated sequences m(−68/−45) series, each with 3-bp mutation within the −68/−45 region (Fig. 5 B). The results showed that−59ATTTTT−54 is a nuclear protein binding site. Mutation of the adenosine residue to a guanosine or cytosine residue in this binding site resulted in less efficient competition (Fig. 5 C), indicating that a sequence with five contiguous thymine residues is a potential nuclear protein binding site and that the adenosine residue preceding the thymine residues is preferred for optimal DNA-protein interaction. A similar protein-DNA complex was also formed in reactions using 32P-labeled (−85/−68), and the protein binding site was localized to−78ATTATT−73 (data not shown). Visual examination reveals a third T-rich sequence−110ATTTTT−105, which may also serve as a nuclear protein-targeting site. These T-rich sequences are referred to as T-boxes subsequently. On the other hand, two major DNA-protein complexes were detected in 8% polyacrylamide gel testing for binding of nuclear proteins to32P-labeled (−107/−85) (Fig.6 A). Similar banding patterns were observed in reactions using nuclear lysate from cells treated with either low or high iron (data not shown). The formation of both complexes was abolished by 250× molar excess of (−107/−85) but not by 250× molar excess of (−133/−110). Further competition assays were performed using 250× molar excess of the mutated sequences m(−107/−85) series, each with a 3-bp mutation within the −107/−85 region (Fig. 6 B). The results showed that−95TAACGATAT−87 contains a nuclear protein binding site. The sequence −95TAACGATAT−87 is similar to the DNA binding sequences of the MYB-family transcription factors (consensus (c/t)AACG(g/t)) in higher eukaryotes (26Luscher B. Christenson E. Litchfield D.W. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 27Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P.

In contrast to another distinct MYB-like protein binding site (−44TATCGT−39) in the ap65-1promoter, 3H.-W. Liu and J.-H. Tai, unpublished observations. the sequence−95TAACGATAT−87 interacting with larger nuclear MYB-like proteins is referred to as the tvMYBl binding site. The detection of potential iron-induced nuclear protein-DNA complex was further explored by using a 32P-labeled m7(−107/−85) probe in which the 3′ moiety of the tvMYBl binding sequence is mutated (see sequence in Fig. 6 B). As expected, nuclear protein-DNA complexes targeting to the tvMYBl binding site were abolished in binding reactions using nuclear proteins from cells without iron treatment (Fig. 7 A, lane 1). By contrast, two major DNA-protein complexes, which migrated slower than the complexes targeting to the tvMYBl binding site, formed in binding reactions using nuclear proteins from iron-treated cells (Fig.7 A, lane 2). These complexes were displaced efficiently by 50× molar excess of m7(−107/−85) (Fig. 7 A, lanes 3–5) but not by up to 500× molar excess of (−133/−110) (Fig. 7 A, lanes 6–8). Further competition assays were performed using 200× molar excess of (−107/−85) and the mutated sequences m(−107/−85) series. The DNA-protein complexes were completely displaced by m7(−107/−85) (Fig. 7 B, lane 10). They were not displaced by m5(−107/−85) and m6(−107/−85) but were displaced to a lesser extent by m4(−107/−85) than by any other mutated sequences or (−107/−85) (Fig. 7 B). These observations indicate that the DNA sequence centered at −98AGATAACGA−90contains a targeting site for iron-induced nuclear proteins, and its flanking sequences may also contribute to binding affinity. This possibility remains to be investigated. The DNA sequence−98AGATAACGA−90 is referred to as the iron-responsive DNA element. In conjunction with Fig. 6, these observations indicate that the 3′ moiety of the iron-responsive DNA element overlaps with 5′ moiety of the tvMYBl binding site. Transcriptional regulation has been implicated as one of the major regulatory mechanisms in modulating expression of certain T. vaginalis virulence phenotypes in response to changing iron supply (8Lehker M.W. Arroyo R. Alderete J.F. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, the ap65-1 gene was selected as a model system to investigate iron-mediated transcriptional regulation inT. vaginalis. Using primer extension and transient luciferase expression assays (Figs. 1 B and 2), we found that steady-state ap65-1 messenger RNA as well as transcriptional activity of the episomal ap65-1 promoter in T. vaginalis T1 cells are positively regulated by iron (Fig.2 A). We also found that the transcriptional activity of theap65-1 promoter is insensitive to other divalent metal ions (Fig. 2 C). On the other hand, β-tubulinmessenger RNA and transcriptional activity of the episomalβ-tubulin promoter are independent of changing iron supply (Fig. 2 B). These findings are consistent with previous results describing the expression features of the ap65 gene family in other T. vaginalis isolates (8Lehker M.W. Arroyo R. Alderete J.F. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Alderete J.F. O'Brien J.L. Arroyo R. Engbring J.A. Musatovova O. Lopez O. Lauriano C. Nguyen J. Mol.

Pathog. 1996; 20: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and show that our experimental system is suitable for the study of iron-regulated expression of the ap65-1 gene. Primer extension experiments and mutational analysis of theap65-1 promoter in pAPluc+ revealed that the basal transcription of the ap65-1 gene in T. vaginalis T1 cells is primarily regulated by a conserved initiator element closest to the translation start site (Figs. 1 B and4). In good agreement with the properties of the metazoan initiators (30Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 31Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), this initiator is both essential and sufficient to confer nearly 7% basal transcriptional activity (Figs. 3 and 4). This minimal transcriptional activity can be activated nearly up to 15- and 250-fold in low and high iron environments, respectively, in concert with distinct sets of distal DNA elements grouped into overlapping basal and iron-responsive regions at the proximal site and a discrete activation region at the distal site (Figs. 3 and 4). Unlike the distal DNA regulatory elements identified in the α-scs promoter (22Liston D.R. Carrero J-C. Johnson P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the mutation of any one of these distal DNA regulatory elements only resulted in at most 3-fold reduction in basal transcriptional activity (Fig. 4). Common DNA regulatory elements used by the α-scsand ap65-1 promoters were not found other than the conserved initiator elements. The most intriguing feature of the ap65-1 promoter is the presence of multiple closely spaced DNA regulatory elements spanning −110/−54 to regulate iron-induced transcription. These DNA elements include an iron-responsive DNA element overlapping with a tvMYBl binding site and three flanking T-boxes as summarized in Fig.7 C. It appears that the inaccessibility of the iron-responsive DNA element to iron-induced nuclear proteins in electrophoretic mobility shift assays is resulting from preoccupation of the site with constitutively expressed MYB-like nuclear proteins (Figs. 6 and 7), and these two distinct types of nuclear DNA-binding proteins may compete for same binding site in vivo to fine tune the transcription of the ap65-1 gene in response to environmental stimuli. This possibility remains to be examined. It is tempting to speculate that the constitutively expressed nuclear proteins targeting to the flanking T-boxes may actively participate in the formation of iron-induced transcriptional complex surrounding the iron-responsive DNA element, because mutation of any one of these three T-boxes resulted in a significant loss of iron-responsiveness (Fig. 4). Whether iron induces de novo biosynthesis of certain transcription factor(s) or modifies certain existing transcription factor(s) to interact with the iron-responsive DNA element has yet to be determined. The iron responsive region alone is also insufficient to confer iron-inducible gene expression without the distal activation region (Fig. 3), indicating close interactions of potential transcription factors targeting to each DNA regulatory element in these regions. It is clear that iron-mediated transcriptional regulation inT. vaginalis is distinct from other iron-mediated transcriptional regulations of iron acquisition, storage, or detoxification in prokaryotes (32Bagg A.

Because the sequences in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of ap65-1 messenger RNA are not involved in the iron-induced transcriptional activity of pAPluc+ (Fig. 3), the iron-regulated ap65-1 gene expression is unlikely to occur at a post-transcriptional or translation level similar to the iron-induced gene expression in more complex organisms (39Kuhn L.C.

In summary, our study of the ap65-1 promoter provides an excellent model system for future investigations on basal transcription as well as iron-induced transcription in T. vaginalis, one of the earliest diverging eukaryotic single cells.

https://openalex.org/W2043249965,"We investigated the ability of a baculovirus-insect cell system to produce sialylated glycoproteins. Despite the presence of enzymes for synthesizing complex-typeN-glycans, the most frequent structure of insectN-glycan is the paucimannosidic type, Man3GlcNAc2(±Fuc). The reason for the overwhelming assembly of paucimannosidic N-glycans is not yet well understood. We hypothesized that this predominance might be due to insect-specific, Golgi-associated β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GlcNAcase)-mediated removal ofN-acetylglucosamine residues from the precursorN-glycan, thereby preventing its galactosylation and terminal sialylation. As we expected, the suppression of intrinsic GlcNAcase activity with a specific inhibitor, 2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxynojirimycin, allowed the accumulation of sialylated glycoproteins in the supernatants of insect cell cultures after baculoviral infection. Our observation indicates that GlcNAcase-dependent depletion ofN-acetylglucosamine residues from intermediateN-glycans is critical for the assembly of paucimannosidicN-glycans in insect cells and, more importantly, that insect cells (under specific conditions) retain the ability to construct sialylated N-glycans like those in mammalian cells.

Insect cells have similarities to mammalian cells with regard to posttranslational events such as proteolytic processing (1Leonova T., Qi, X. Bencosme A. Ponce E. Sun Y. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol.

These properties of insect cells are thought to be useful for the production of recombinant mammalian proteins by baculovirus-insect cell systems because the produced proteins are expected to be structurally and biologically equivalent to native ones. In addition to these posttranslational events, glycosylation (particularlyN-glycosylation and terminal sialic acid modification) is important for the biological activity and stability of synthesized proteins (5Hotchkiss A.

In mammalian cells, the N-glycosylation pathway starts by the transfer of a dolichol-linked precursor oligosaccharide (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) to a nascent polypeptide. Then, this precursor oligosaccharide is sequentially processed by glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, such as α-mannosidase I, α-mannosidase II, acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, acetylglucosaminyltransferase II, fucosyltransferase, and galactosyltransferase. The resulting N-glycan is finally sialylated by sialyltransferase at the trans-Golgi (9Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). The precursor oligosaccharide and the requisite enzymes (except sialyltransferase) have been identified previously in insect cells (10Hsieh P. Robbins P.W. J. Biol.

Although these findings suggest the presence of anN-glycosylation pathway in insect cells similar to that seen in mammalian cells, the most frequent structure of insectN-glycans is the paucimannosidic type, Man3GlcNAc2(±Fuc), which is not found in mammalian cells (19Voss T.

One striking difference between insect and mammalian N-glycosylation pathways is the biological property of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GlcNAcase) 1The abbreviations used are:GlcNAcaseβ-N-acetylglucosaminidaseGlcNAcN-acetylglucosamineboIFN-τbovine interferon τrboIFN-τrecombinant bovine interferon τ2-ADN2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxynojirimycinmAbmonoclonal antibodyGM-CSFgranulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factorILinterleukinSNASambucus nigra agglutinin 1The abbreviations used are:GlcNAcaseβ-N-acetylglucosaminidaseGlcNAcN-acetylglucosamineboIFN-τbovine interferon τrboIFN-τrecombinant bovine interferon τ2-ADN2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxynojirimycinmAbmonoclonal antibodyGM-CSFgranulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factorILinterleukinSNASambucus nigra agglutinin activity. Mammalian GlcNAcase is localized in a soluble fraction of lysosomes and hydrolyzes β-linked terminal GlcNAc residues on degrading glycoconjugates (22Conzelmann E. Sandhoff H. Adv. Enzymol. 1987; 60: 89-216PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, insect GlcNAcase is detected in both soluble and membrane-associated fractions and hydrolyzes β-1,2-linked terminal GlcNAc residues only from α-1,3-bound mannosyl cores (23Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glosl J. Marz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This membrane-associated GlcNAcase has been reported to be located at the Golgi (24Marchal I. Mir A.M. Kmiecik D. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the insect-specific, membrane-associated GlcNAcase may play a key role in the synthesis of paucimannosidic N-glycans by preventing the galactosylation and subsequent sialylation of expressed glycoproteins. β-N-acetylglucosaminidase N-acetylglucosamine bovine interferon τ recombinant bovine interferon τ 2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxynojirimycin monoclonal antibody granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor interleukin Sambucus nigra agglutinin β-N-acetylglucosaminidase N-acetylglucosamine bovine interferon τ recombinant bovine interferon τ 2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxynojirimycin monoclonal antibody granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor interleukin Sambucus nigra agglutinin To prove our hypothesis, we produced recombinant glycoproteins by using a baculovirus-insect cell system in the presence of a GlcNAcase inhibitor and determined the terminal carbohydrate structure of these glycoproteins. A mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against bovine interferon τ (boIFN-τ) was kindly provided by Katakura Industries (Saitama, Japan). The GlcNAcase inhibitor, 2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxynojirimycin (2-ADN), was purchased from Tront Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada).p-Nitrophenyl-β-d-N-acetylglucosaminide was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) was obtained from EY Laboratory (San Mateo, CA). Arthobacter ureafaciens sialidase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 3′-Sialyllactose and 6′-sialyllactose were purchased from Sigma. To obtain boIFN-τ cDNA, template mRNA was prepared from primary bovine trophoblast cells as described previously (2525. Takahashi, M., Hamano, S., Takahashi, H., Ogawa, H., and Okano, A. (2000) Cloned Anim. Placentation 146-150.Google Scholar), and cDNA encoding the open reading frame of boIFN-τ was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and then cloned into plasmid vector pCRII (Invitrogen). The cDNA was excised and inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector (pAcYM1) to obtain the recombinant transfer vector, pAcBIFNτ. The recombinant baculovirus, AcBIFNτ, was then established by using pAcBIFNτ according to a method described previously (26Inumaru S. Kokuho T. Denham S. Denyer M.S. Momotani E. Kitamura S. Corteyn A. Brookes S. Parkhouse R.M. Takamatsu H. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The other recombinant baculoviruses, AcBGM (27Inumaru S. Kokuho T. Mori Y. Watanabe S. Takamatsu H. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 901Google Scholar) and AcPIL2 (28Inumaru S. Kokuho T. Yada T. Kiuchi M. Miyazawa M. Biotech. Bioprocess. Eng. 2000; 5: 146-149Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which encode bovine GM-CSF and porcine interleukin (IL)-2, respectively, were obtained similarly. To produce the recombinant proteins, the Trichoplusia ni-derived cell line BTI TN 5B1-4 (TN5) was infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 and then cultured in serum-free EX-CELL401 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) at 28 °C for 3 days. The culture supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at −20 °C until use. To inhibit N-glycosylation, recombinant baculovirus-infected TN5 cells were cultured in medium containing 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 3 days. To suppress GlcNAcase activity, TN5 cells were precultured in medium containing 0–5 mm 2-ADN for 3 days, inoculated with the recombinant baculovirus, and then cultured for another 3 days in the presence of 2-ADN at the same concentration used in the preculture. Aliquots (20 μl each) of the supernatants were subjected to tricine-SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (29Schagger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The treated membrane was sequentially probed with 0.2 μg/ml anti-boIFN-τ mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) at room temperature for 1 h each. Reacted proteins were made visible by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining. The supernatants (600 ng recombinant protein/lane) were subjected to tricine-SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The treated membrane was washed with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in 200 mm Tris-buffered saline. The membrane was probed with 5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-labeled SNA for 1 h at room temperature. Reacted carbohydrates were made visible on x-ray film by using the Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To confirm the specificity of SNA, we incubated the membrane with the transferred proteins in 0.02 m citrate buffer (pH 5.0) alone or with sialidase (0.5 unit/200 μl) for 20 h at 37 °C. In addition, we preincubated horseradish peroxidase-labeled SNA with 10 mm 3′-sialyllactose or 0.1 mm 6′-sialyllactose for 2 h at room temperature before use. TN5 cells (2.0 × 107) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g, the supernatants were used as sources of enzyme. We mixed 50 μl of the enzyme source with 200 μl of substrate solution (1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl-β-d-N-acetylglucosaminide in 0.2 m citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.0) and incubated this mixture in the presence of 0–5 mm 2-ADN for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of 1m Na2CO3, and the absorbance at 420 nm (indicative of p-nitrophenol release) was measured. boIFN-τ is a glycoprotein containing 196 amino acids with a potential N-glycosylation site at Asn-78. Thus, boIFN-τ is an ideal molecule for analysis of the N-glycosylation process in insect cells. rboIFN-τ was expressed by TN5 cells infected with AcBIFNτ. Proteins of ∼19.5 and 22 kDa were secreted and accumulated in the culture supernatant (Fig.1 A). Western blot analysis using anti-boIFN-τ mAb showed that these two molecules were structurally related (Fig. 1 B). AfterN-glycosylation was inhibited with tunicamycin, only the 19.5-kDa molecule was detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 3). These results indicate that the 22-kDa molecule wasN-glycosylated, whereas the 19.5-kDa molecule was not. Because Woynarowska et al. (30Woynarowska B. Wikiel H. Sharma M. Carpenter N. Fleet G.W.J. Bernacki R.J. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 161-166PubMed Google Scholar) reported that maximum inhibition (∼80%) of mammalian GlcNAcase was achieved by using 5 mm 2-ADN, we initially used this concentration. To examine the effect of GlcNAcase inhibition on expression of rboIFN-τ, TN5 cells were treated with 2-ADN as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that 5 mm 2-ADN did not affect cell growth (data not shown) or the quantity of expressed rboIFN-τ (Fig. 2 A). The molecular mass of N-glycosylated rboIFN-τ increased from 22 to 23.3 kDa, but that of non-N-glycosylated rboIFN-τ (19.5 kDa) did not (Fig. 2). This result indicates that the shift in the molecular mass was due to an increase of oligosaccharide moiety. To investigate the difference between the oligosaccharide structures of the 22- and 23.3-kDa molecules, we produced rboIFN-τ in the presence of various concentrations of 2-ADN and examined the terminal structures of the rboIFN-τ N-glycans by lectin blot analysis. The GlcNAcase activity in these cells decreased proportionally to the dose of 2-ADN, and 79.1% ± 1.2% (mean ± S.D.) of the activity in TN5 cells was inhibited at 5 mm 2-ADN, as was reported to occur in mammalian cells (Fig.3 A) (30Woynarowska B. Wikiel H. Sharma M. Carpenter N. Fleet G.W.J. Bernacki R.J. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 161-166PubMed Google Scholar). SNA, which recognizes α-2,6-linked sialic acids, reacted with the 23.3-kDa glycoprotein expressed in the presence of more than 0.5 mm2-ADN, and the intensity of the SNA-reactive bands increased proportionally to the dose of 2-ADN without affecting total amounts of expressed rboIFN-τ (Fig. 3, B and C). The reaction of SNA with rboIFN-τ was diminished by treatment with sialidase (Fig. 4, A andB) or by preabsorption of SNA with 6′-sialyllactose but not with 3′-sialyllactose (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectin, which recognizes α-2,3-linked sialic acid, did not react with rboIFN-τ (data not shown). These findings indicate that α-2,6-linked sialic acid but not α-2,3-linked sialic acid is present at the terminus of the N-glycan on rboIFN-τ expressed under GlcNAcase-inhibited conditions.Figure 4Confirmation of the α-2,6-linked sialylation of rboIFN-τ expressed by TN5 cells. The rboIFN-τ expressed in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 5 mm 2-ADN was analyzed by lectin blotting with SNA. The membrane was treated with buffer alone (A) or with sialidase (B) before the SNA staining. Untreated membrane was probed with SNA preincubated with 0.1 mm 6′-sialyllactose (C) or 10 mm 3′-sialyllactose (D). Wild-type virus (lane 1); AcBIFNτ (lanes 2 and3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the effect of GlcNAcase inhibition on the assembly of N-glycans on other recombinant glycoproteins, we produced recombinant bovine GM-CSF and recombinant porcine IL-2 in the presence of 5 mm2-ADN and performed lectin blot analysis with SNA. The molecular masses of glycosylated recombinant bovine GM-CSF and recombinant porcine IL-2 expressed by TN5 cells markedly increased in the presence of 5 mm 2-ADN (Fig.5 A), and SNA reacted with the molecules expressed under GlcNAcase-inhibited conditions (Fig.5 B, lanes 1 and 3). These results demonstrate that the α-2,6-linked terminal sialylation occurred not only on rboIFN-τ but also on other recombinant proteins expressed under the same conditions. We produced bovine interferon τ, bovine GM-CSF, and porcine IL-2 in the presence of 2-ADN by using a baculovirus-insect cell system, and we investigated the N-glycan structure of these recombinant molecules by using lectin blot analysis. It is widely known that the major structure of the N-glycans on insect glycoproteins is Man3GlcNAc2(±Fuc), which may be derived from GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 through mannosidase-mediated excision of α-linked mannosyl residues, followed by GlcNAcase-mediated depletion of a β-1,2-linked terminal GlcNAc residue (Fig. 6). The distribution of GlcNAcase activity in insect cells has been reported to be unique. Whereas mammalian GlcNAcase activity is detectable only in a lysosomal compartment, the activity of insect cells is detected in a membrane-associated fraction as well as in the cytosol (23Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glosl J. Marz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Marchal et al. (24Marchal I. Mir A.M. Kmiecik D. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that GlcNAcase activity in insect cells was located at the Golgi in the form of a membrane-bound molecule. This insect-specific GlcNAcase hydrolyzes β-1,2-linked GlcNAc residues on α-1,3-bound mannosyl cores in a strict manner, and the temporal formation of such GlcNAcase-susceptible structures in the N-glycosylation pathway has been reported (24Marchal I. Mir A.M. Kmiecik D. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that the activity might be involved in the removal of β-1,2-linked GlcNAc residues from intermediateN-glycans on their way to the formation of complex typeN-glycans. As we expected, suppression of the intrinsic GlcNAcase activity with 2-ADN induced the extension and terminal sialylation of N-glycans on recombinant proteins expressed by baculovirus-infected insect cells (Figs. 4 and 5). The observation that the accumulation of sialylated proteins was inversely correlated with GlcNAcase activity in TN5 cells confirmed our hypothesis (Fig. 3). Wagner et al. (31Wagner R. Geyer H. Geyer R. Klenk H.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the increase of β-1,2-linked terminal GlcNAc residues on influenza hemagglutinin expressed by baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells under GlcNAc-inhibited conditions. Although these investigators did not examine the intrinsic galactosylation and sialylation activities of those cells, their observation suggested that the inhibition of GlcNAcase prevented the processing of paucimannosidic structures and allowed the accumulation of substrates for the synthesis of complex-type glycans. Despite many investigators' attempts to identify sialyltransferase activity in insect cells, this issue had remained unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated the presence of α-2,6-linked sialic acid but not α-2,3-linked sialic acid at the terminus of the rboIFN-τ N-glycan synthesized by baculovirus-infected cells under GlcNAcase-inhibited conditions. We obtained a similar result for the N-glycans of recombinant bovine GM-CSF and recombinant porcine IL-2 synthesized under the same conditions. In an experiment using the Spodoptera frugiperda-derived SF21AE and Bombyx mori-derived Bm-N insect cell lines, we found sialylation of N-glycans on the recombinant proteins expressed under the same conditions (data not shown). These findings indicate that those insect cell lines contain a significant α-2,6-sialyltransferase activity even at low levels. Thus, we considered that an insect cell line of lepidopteran origin would be able to synthesize sialylated N-glycans on any glycoprotein when GlcNAcase is inhibited. As we discussed previously, the treatment of insect cells with 2-ADN would enhance the accumulation of substrates possessing a β-1,2-linked GlcNAc residue, thereby leading to further processing by galactosyltransferase and sialyltransferase to form sialylated N-glycans. In contrast, we did not observe terminal sialylation under conventional (non-GlcNAcase-inhibited) culture conditions. Previous studies on recombinant human plasminogen demonstrated the presence of α-2,6-linked sialic acids on recombinant human plasminogen expressed by a similar system under conventional culture conditions (32Davidson D.J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6165-6174PubMed Google Scholar). Although the reason for the apparently discrepant results between recombinant human plasminogen and other proteins remains unclear (Refs. 33Altmann F. Staudacher E. Wilson I.B. Marz L. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and 34Marchal I. Jarvis D.L. Canan R. Verbert A. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and the present report), previous observation about the intrinsic sialyltransferase activity of insect cells does not contradict our results. Because posttranslational glycosylation can influence the biological and pharmacokinetic properties of synthesized glycoproteins when they are used in vivo for clinical applications, researchers have attempted to modify baculovirus-insect cell systems to express glycoproteins with “mammalianized” N-glycans, particularly those with terminal sialylation. Recently, Jarvis and co-workers reported the occurrence of galactosylation and terminal sialylation on the baculoviral glycoprotein gp64 expressed by infection of Sf9 cells with a bovine galactosyltransferase/rat sialyltransferase dual recombinant baculovirus (35Jarvis D.L. Howe D. Aumiller J.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6223-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or by infection of TN5 cells expressing both enzyme genes with a wild-type baculovirus (36Breitbach K. Jarvis D.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 74: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Collectively, the insufficient synthesis of sialylatedN-glycans by insect cells may depend on, at least in part, the intense activity of insect-specific GlcNAcases and the significant but low activities of galactosyltransferase and sialyltransferase. The biological significance of such insufficient synthesis remains to be elucidated. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that it might help innate immune systems of insects. For example, insect lectins, which are major factors in host defense, recognize components of complex-typeN-glycan such as GlcNAc and galactose (37Boucias D.G. Pendland J.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Shin S.W. Park D., S. Kim S., C. Park H.Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, insect-specific N-glycosylation may contribute to self and non-self recognition upon microorganism infections. In the present study, we demonstrated the expression of terminally sialylated recombinant proteins in insect cells after simply inhibiting their GlcNAcase activity and showed that this phenomenon was not protein-specific. Our system can be applied to various combinations of baculovirus-insect cells to produce recombinant glycoproteins with “mammalianized” N-glycans."

This suggested transmission of a positive allosteric interaction from NBD2 to NBD1. To assess whether ATP binding at NBD1 can enhance the trapping of ADP at NBD2, photoaffinity labeling experiments with [α-32P]8-N3ADP were performed and revealed that when presented with this compound labeling of MRP1 occurred at both NBDs. However, upon addition of ATP, this labeling was enhanced 4-fold mainly at NBD2. Furthermore, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), bound preferentially to NBD1, but upon addition of a low concentration of 8-N3ATP, the binding at NBD2 increased severalfold. This suggested that the positive allosteric stimulation from NBD1 actually involves an increase in ATP binding at NBD2 and hydrolysis there leading to the trapping of ADP. Mutations of Walker A or B motifs in either NBD greatly reduced their ability to be labeled by [α-32P]8-N3ADP as well as by either [α-32P]- or [γ-32P]8-N3ATP (Hou et al.(2000), see above). These mutations also strongly diminished the enhancement by ATP of [α-32P]8-N3ADP labeling and the transport activity of the protein.

In the case of P-gp, the two NBDs have been shown to be functionally equivalent with identical ATP hydrolysis steps occurring alternatively at each NBD (21Senior A.E. Acta. Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar, 22Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

A working model of coupling ATP hydrolysis alternatively at each NBD and solute transport in each cycle (one solute transport per ATP hydrolysis) has been proposed (26Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In one other report, the two NBDs of P-gp were found to be essential for its function but not entirely symmetric (27Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Germann U.A. Cheng P.W. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Ambudkar's group (28Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) reported recently that there are two independent ATP hydrolysis events in a single catalytic cycle of P-gp, one associated with efflux of drug and the other to bring about conformational changes that “reset” the molecule (29Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this interpretation, the ATP-binding sites of P-gp are recruited in a random manner during hydrolysis events and only one is utilized at any given time because of the conformational change in the catalytic site that drastically reduces the affinity of the second site for nucleotide binding (29Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the case of MRP1, however, the two NBDs definitely do not seem to be functionally equivalent. Sequence dissimilarities (7Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C.

Mutations of the consensus Walker motifs in the two NBDs have different effects on solute transport. For example, mutation of the Walker A lysine residue in NBD2 (Lys1333) abolished leukotriene C4 transport almost completely (1Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G.

Photoaffinity labeling experiments with 8-azido-ATP also revealed an asymmetry between NBD1 and NBD2, with [γ-32P]8-N3ATP preferentially labeling NBD1 (1Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E.

However, experiments to date have not clearly determined whether ATP bound at NBD1 is hydrolyzed and the product, ADP, trapped there in the presence of vanadate. To assess the interaction of the NDP directly we examined photolabeling with [α-32P]8-N3ADP. We have found now that [α-32P]-8-N3ADP labels NBD2 to a much greater extent than NBD1. This labeling by the nucleoside diphosphate was enhanced 4-fold by a low concentration of ATP. Hence it appears that binding of ATP at NBD1 promotes the association of ADP with NBD2. Furthermore, photolabeling by the non-hydrolyzable [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP, which in the absence of other nucleotides occurred predominately at NBD1, was enhanced at NBD2 by a low concentration of 8-N3ATP. Thus NTP interaction with NBD1 consistently increased binding of NTP or NDP at NBD2, reflecting a positive allosteric action of NBD1 on NBD2.

After releasing the pressure, the cell homogenate was adjusted to 1 mm EDTA. The homogenate was diluted 5-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl and 25 mm sucrose, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was overlaid on a 35% sucrose solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmEDTA and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes at the interface were collected, diluted 5-fold with a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 250 mm sucrose and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mmsucrose, and 1 × protease inhibitors. After passage through a LiposofastTM vesicle extruder (200 nm filter, Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) they were aliquoted and stored in −80 °C. Vanadate preparation and photoaffinity labeling of MRP1 protein were performed according to procedures described previously (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, the photolabeling experiments were carried out in a 10-μl solution containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ouabain, and 0.1 mm EGTA for 10 min at 37 °C. The amount of membrane vesicle, divalent cation, 32P-labeled nucleotide, and vanadate are specifically indicated in each of the figure legend. The samples were then transferred to ice and diluted with 500 μl of ice-cold Tris-EGTA buffer (0.1 mm EGTA and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The membranes were pelleted in a microcentrifuge in a cold room (4 °C), resuspended in 10 μl of Tris-EGTA buffer, placed on ice, and irradiated for 2 min in a Stratalinker UV Cross-linker (λ = 254 nm). The labeled proteins were separated on a polyacrylamide gel (7%) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane. To determine which NBD was labeled, the samples after UV irradiation were resuspended in 20 μl of solution containing 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA and the amount of TPCK-treated trypsin indicated in the figure legend. TPCK-treated trypsin was prepared and diluted in 10 mm HCl. The same amount of 10 mm HCl was added in the control sample. The labeled membrane proteins were digested with TPCK-treated trypsin at 37 °C for 15 min, brought back to ice, dissolved in gel sample buffer, and electrophoresed. We first determined if the vanadate trapping of [α-32P]8-N3ADP by MRP1 that occurs after hydrolysis of [α-32P]8-N3ATP (1Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J.

Fig.1, A and B, indicate that this does occur and is absolutely dependent on the presence of a divalent cation just as in the case of ATP hydrolysis by this protein and trapping with vanadate of the transition state for hydrolysis (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In all three cases Mn2+ is more potent than Mg2+ which supports labeling to a similar extent as Ni2+ but much more effectively than Ca2+. Of the labeling that occurs, approximately half is dependent on the presence of vanadate (Fig. 1, C and D) and presumably reflects the transition state complex as when [α-32P]8-N3ATP is used. The vanadate independent half is a measure of the binding and retention of the nucleoside diphosphate. Sauna et al. (33Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21199-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) found that formation of the vanadate-trapped transition state intermediate of P-glycoprotein had a high energy of activation. Examination of the temperature dependence of its formation in MRP1 (Fig. 1, Eand F) indicated this is also the case with this protein. While there is only a modest increase in vanadate-independent binding as temperature is increased, there is a steep increase in vanadate-dependent trapping, especially between 20 and 37 °C. Earlier studies had shown that trapping of [α-32P]8-N3ADP formed by MRP1 catalyzed hydrolysis of [α-32P]8-N3ATP was more prevalent at NBD2 than at NBD1 (1Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17626-17630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To assess the distribution of the trapping directly from [α-32P]8-N3ADP, trypsin digestion was used to separate fragments derived from the two NBDs (Fig.2). The NBD2-derived fragments were labeled more strongly than those from NBD1. These experiments demonstrated that a stable vanadate-induced nucleotide complex of MRP1 can be formed using [α-32P]8-N3ADP and divalent cation which after photoactivation results in greater covalent labeling of NBD2 than NBD1. This is consistent with the finding that vanadate trapping of [α-32P]8-N3ADP from hydrolysis of [α-32P]8-N3ATP also occurred predominantly at NBD2 (1Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17626-17630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because we had found previously that the vanadate trapping of N3ADP which occurred at NBD2 allosterically promoted the binding of N3ATP at NBD1 (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we wondered if the interaction between the two domains which this implies might also be detectable in the opposite direction. Therefore we tested the influence of both ATP and N3ATP on the trapping of [α-32P]8-N3ADP (Fig.3). Clearly biphasic responses were observed in both cases (Fig. 3, A–D). At low concentrations, ATP had a strong stimulatory effect; at 10 μm ATP, for example, there was an approximately 4-fold elevation in the labeling of the whole MRP1 protein. At higher concentrations this effect was overcome and labeling was inhibited probably in a competitive manner. Although its stimulatory influence was slightly less marked than ATP, N3ATP also enhanced the labeling, then inhibited as its concentration was increased. These relationships were remarkably similar to those seen when the influence of ADP on ATP binding was examined (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To confirm that the nucleoside triphosphates were promoting the labeling by [α-32P]8-N3ADP at NBD2, limited trypsin digestion was carried out. This revealed that most of the increased labeling did occur at NBD2 (Fig. 3 E). These observations support the notion there is indeed a positive allosteric interaction in the direction from NBD1, where nucleoside triphosphate binding is most prominent, to NBD2, the predominant site of nucleoside diphosphate trapping. Significantly, although most photolabeling detected with [α-32P]8-N3ATP as substrate also reflects trapping of its hydrolysis product, [α-32P]8-N3ADP, its stimulation by N3ATP is not detectable because of simple displacement or dilution of [α-32P]8-N3ATP by the non-radioactive 8-N3ATP (Fig. 3, F andG). To gain further evidence that the vanadate trapped complex formed directly from [α-32P]8-N3ADP was the same as that from [α-32P]8-N3ATP and assess which NBD was involved in the ATP stimulation of labeling the influence of mutagenesis of the Walker A lysines and Walker B aspartates was tested. As with [α-32P]8-N3ATP labeling (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) all these mutants trapped much less [α-32P]8-N3ADP than the wild-type (Fig.4, A and B), those in NBD1 having a somewhat greater effect than those in NBD2. However, in no case was labeling completely eliminated and hence it was possible to examine how the stimulatory effect of ATP was influenced by these mutations. Essentially the stimulation was much reduced in the NBD1 mutants, K684L and D792A (Fig. 4, C and D), and in the NBD2 mutants, K1333L and D1454L/E1455L (Fig. 4, E andF), and the stimulation effects were shifted to higher ATP concentrations (Fig. 4, C–F). Trypsin digestion of either [α-32P]8-N3ATP or [α-32P]8-N3ADP-labeled K1333L and D1454L/E1455L proved that the mutated NBD2 fragment can still be labeled (data not shown). These results presumably imply that the mutations of Walker motifs greatly diminish nucleotide binding abilities rather than abolish their binding completely. Since most observations indicated that just the binding of ATP, as distinct from binding, hydrolysis, and product trapping at NBD2, occurred at NBD1, we asked whether the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, would exert a similar stimulatory influence on [α-32P]8-N3ADP labeling. Fig.5, A and B, indicate that there is a much weaker stimulation than that caused by ATP. This result could be due either to the fact that hydrolysis of ATP at NBD1 is required for its full stimulatory action or that AMP-PNP simply binds with much lower affinity than ATP. To test the latter possibility, we compared its ability to compete with labeling by [α-32P]8-N3ATP with that of ATP. As seen in Fig. 5, E and F, compared with Fig. 5,C and D, AMP-PNP competes very much less effectively than ATP, indicating that indeed it does bind less well. As AMP-PNP, like ATP, does interact preferentially at NBD1 (see below), its weak stimulation of [α-32P]8-N3ADP trapping at NBD2 very likely reflects this diminished binding. However, these observations do not eliminate the possibility that the ability of ATP to be hydrolyzed may contribute to its greater influence than the non-hydrolyzable AMP-PNP. To directly characterize the interaction of AMP-PNP with MRP1, photolabeling with the radiolabeled 8-azido derivative was performed. Fig. 6 A shows that this labeling is not very much influenced by vanadate as would be expected, as no hydrolysis product is formed to be trapped by the phosphate analogue. Hence this labeling reflects binding of the intact compound rather than formation of a complex approximating the transition state for hydrolysis. To attempt to confirm that its preferred site of binding was NBD1 as we suggested above, limited trypsin digestion was performed after labeling. Fig. 6 C(lanes 1–4) indicates that in the absence of additional nucleotides this is the case. Interestingly, however, when 5 μm N3ATP is also present, [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP binding occurs predominantly at NBD2 (Fig. 6 C, lanes 5–8). Effective competition of the binding of NBD1 is not unexpected on the basis of the relative affinities of ATP and AMP-PNP revealed in Fig. 5but the switch of [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP binding from NBD1 to NBD2 was not anticipated. However, its interaction there was also found to be stimulated by N3ATP (Fig.7) much like the binding of [α-32P]8-N3ADP at NBD2. This may mean that when the favored substrate, N3ATP, is bound at NBD1, there is a conformational change at NBD2 resulting in increased [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP binding there. That the sites of [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP binding and [α-32P]8-N3ADP trapping at NBD2 are likely to be the same is further indicated by the influence of vanadate (compare Fig. 7, A and B, with C andD). Where vanadate is present (Fig. 7, C andD) to support trapping of N3ADP formed on hydrolysis of 8-N3ATP there is a competition by N3ADP for the binding of [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP to NBD2 and hence the stimulatory effect of N3ATP is less than in the absence of vanadate (Fig. 7, A and B) where there is no trapping of N3ADP at NBD2.Figure 7Influence of 8-N3ATP on labeling with [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP in the absence or presence of vanadate. The photolabeling experiments were carried out in a 10 μl of solution containing 100 μm [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP (1.65 μCi), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μg of MRP1-containing membrane vesicles.

Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the present study attention has been focused on the influence of the interaction of both hydrolyzable (N3ATP) and non-hydrolyzable (N3AMP-PNP) nucleoside triphosphate with NBD1 on nucleotide binding to NBD2. Several different sets of photolabeling experiments employing [α-32P]8-N3ADP or [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP as well as [α-32P]8-N3ATP pointed to a strong positive allosteric interaction between NBD1 and NBD2. Initially it was found that the protein could be photolabeled with [α-32P]8-N3ADP in a divalent cation dependent, orthovanadate-stimulated manner (Fig. 1). Hence as was recently shown with P-gp (33Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21199-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) vanadate trapping of N3ADP presumably as a mimic of a Mg·ADP·Pi post-hydrolysis transition state complex can occur when MRP1 is presented with N3ADP as well as with N3ATP where hydrolysis must first take place. The labeling with [α-32P]8-N3ADP was found to occur predominantly at NBD2 (Fig. 2) just as was the case when [α-32P]N3ATP was employed as substrate (1Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus these results confirmed that NBD2 was the main site of NDP trapping by MRP1. However, there are several recent indications largely from structural studies that each catalytic site in an ABC protein may include residues from both NBD sequences (34Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 35Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore it may not be possible to simply ascribe the hydrolysis reactions entirely to the sites whose photolabeling is detected. Nevertheless, both in experiments where the two domains (N-half and C-half) were co-expressed using a single dual-expression baculovirus vector (1Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or when separated from the intact protein by trypsin digestion (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) there was greater trapping of [32P]8-N3ADP formed by hydrolysis of [α-32P]8-N3ATP at NBD2 than NBD1, whereas bound intact [γ-32P]8-N3ATP was detected predominantly at NBD1 (1Gao M.

Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Labeling with [32P]8-N3ATP at NBD2 is 2–3-fold greater than at NBD1 (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These findings could be interpreted as reflecting immediate hydrolysis at NBD2 to form ADP that is trapped there by vanadate but little hydrolysis at NBD1 so that primarily binding of intact ATP is detected there. Results of our present experiments with [32P]8-N3ADP do show that the trapped ADP·Vi complex can be formed at NBD1 although to a much lesser extent than at NBD2 (Figs. 2 A and 3 E). It was then found that NDP trapping at NBD2 was strongly promoted by the addition of low concentrations of ATP or N3ATP (Fig.3). This striking effect of itself and through the subsequent experiments to which it lead shed a great deal of light on the allosteric interactions that occur between the two NBDs. It is important to emphasize that this effect was only detectable through the use of [α-32P]8-N3ADP or [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP as the labeling reagents even though the binding and hydrolysis of 8-N3ATP at NBD2 is also promoted by the effects of these same low concentrations of ATP or 8-N3ATP at NBD1 (see below). This stimulating influence, however, cannot be detected using [α-32P]8-N3ATP as labeling reagent since it is simply diluted by the addition of increasing concentrations of non-radioactive 8-N3ATP (Fig. 3, F andG). This interpretation is supported by the finding that [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP labeling of NBD2 is also strongly stimulated by low concentrations of 8-N3ATP (Figs.6 and 7). In the absence of other added nucleotide 8-N3AMP-PNP, like [γ-32P]8-N3ATP (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which preferentially labels NBD1 (Fig. 6 C) and in so doing increases N3ADP labeling of NBD2 (Fig. 5 A). The labeling of NBD2 with [γ-32P]8-N3ATP was not detected (2Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), simply indicating that the [γ-32P]phosphate in the bound [γ-32P]8-N3ATP was removed by hydrolysis. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP was bound primarily to NBD1 in the absence of other nucleotides (Fig. 6 C). This fact hints that NBD1 has higher affinity for nucleoside triphosphate than NBD2. Interestingly, however, binding to NBD2 was enhanced upon the addition of a low concentration of 8-N3ATP (Fig.6 C). This change from greater binding at NBD1 to NBD2 probably reflected a higher affinity for 8-N3ATP than AMP-PNP but the consequence for NBD2 is more interesting and appears to parallel the positive effect of ATP binding at NBD1 on N3ADP labeling of NBD2 (Fig. 3 E). Thus ATP or N3ATP binding to NBD1 brings about enhanced binding of either hydrolyzable ATP or non-hydrolyzable AMP-PNP to NBD2. In the former case this results in an elevated amount of trapped ADP at NBD2 and in the latter case more bound AMP-PNP. Since mutagenesis of the Walker A motif lysine and Walker B aspartate residues in the NBDs of MRP1 reduced but did not completely eliminate photolabeling by [α-32P]8-N3ADP, it was possible to evaluate their effect on the response of this labeling to the nucleoside triphosphate (Fig. 4). Essentially the stimulatory effect was greatly reduced and shifted to a requirement for higher concentrations of the NTP. These effects were somewhat expected since the residues in NBD1 were required as the site of action of the NTP and those in NBD2 for labeling by N3ADP. In addition to providing stronger evidence for a positive allosteric interaction between NBD1 and NBD2 with respect to nucleoside triphosphate interaction, these experiments have further emphasized the differences between the properties of the two domains. While both are sites of ATP binding and hydrolysis, bound intact NTP is detected at NBD1 indicating that hydrolysis is less rapid there than at NBD2 where most NDP trapping is found when the protein is presented with either NTP or NDP. These distinctive properties of the two domains provide a fundamental asymmetry which may facilitate their allosteric coupling and thereby achieve increased overall efficiency of ATP hydrolysis and perhaps drug transport.

Based on their biochemical properties, the DAP complex can be subdivided into three subcomplexes as follows: the dystroglycan complex, the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex, and the cytoplasmic complex (dystrophin, syntrophin, and dystrobrevin) (4Yoshida M. Suzuki A. Yamamoto H. Noguchi S. Mizuno Y. Ozawa E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits of dystroglycan constitute the core of the DAP complex because they establish a transmembrane link between laminins and dystrophin (5Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J.

Integrins, heterodimeric (α/β) transmembrane receptors, are widely recognized as mediators of cell-extracellular matrix interaction involved in the regulation of such fundamental processes as proliferation, migration, differentiation, adhesion, and survival. The α7β1 integrin, a highly expressed receptor on the surface of myoblasts and myotubes, also binds laminins and is critical for muscle fiber survival and differentiation (6Burkin D.J. Kaufman S.J.

Most relevant to human diseases are observations that mutations in the α7 integrin subunit gene produce a congenital myopathy that appears to result from disruptions in the myotendonous junctions (15Mayer U.

Furthermore, an increase in α7B integrin transcript and protein levels is seen in cases of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and in the murine mdx model (18Hodges B.L. Hayashi Y.K. Nonaka I.

This up-regulation suggests that integrins may attempt to compensate for the loss of dystrophin/DAP-mediated linkage. Interestingly, sarcolemmal disruption is not an obligatory step in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies as, for example, in the “classical” form of congenital muscular dystrophy and in the dy mouse. The severe dystrophy observed both in congenital muscular dystrophy patients and in the dymouse is caused by mutations in the laminin-α2 gene and does not appear to involve damage to the sarcolemma. The muscle-specific form of caveolin, caveolin-3, is a major structural component of caveolae that has recently been implicated in the etiology of muscular dystrophy (20Galbiati F. Volont D.

Lisanti M.P. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), caveolin-3 was recently found to bind directly to the same domain as dystrophin on the cytoplasmic tail of β-dystroglycan (24Sotgia F.

The pathogenic mechanism of caveolin-3 remains elusive, but precise regulation of expression levels appears to be important for normal muscle function because a null mutation (27Hagiwara Y.

A. 2000; 97: 9689-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) both lead to muscle pathology in mice. In a previous report (30Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that chimeric mice with little or no dystroglycan had a severe histopathology closely resembling that of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and that was more severe than that of the mdx mouse. In the present study, we have explored the composition of the DAP complex in dystroglycan-deficient muscle to determine whether interactions inferred from biochemical studies or from mutations of dystroglycan-interacting proteins are confirmed by depletion of dystroglycan in situ. We find that the depletion of dystroglycan-interacting proteins results not only from displacement from the sarcolemma toward the cytosol but also from a decrease in overall protein levels. Furthermore dystrophin was found not to be absolutely dependent on β-dystroglycan for membrane targeting. We have also examined the distribution of caveolin-3 in dystroglycan-deficient muscle and found its distribution identical to that of the mdx mouse. Finally, the α7B splice variant of the integrin α7 subunit was found to be selectively up-regulated. Because dystroglycan-deficient muscles have basement membranes that are indistinguishable from controls (30Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), this receptor may compensate for the loss of dystroglycan in basement membrane assembly. Embryonic stem (ES) cell lines rendered null for dystroglycan were described previously (30Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, we generated two targeting vectors, one harboring a hygromycin resistance gene at the 5′ end of the second exon of the dystroglycan gene (Dag1) and one with the neomycin resistance gene also at the 5′ end of the second exon. R1 ES cells (31Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) were electroporated with the hygromycin resistance vector and submitted to drug selection, and homologous recombinants were identified by Southern blotting. The same procedure was repeated on single copy Dag1 mutants with the neomycin resistance targeting vector to target the other copy. Two dystroglycan null clones, 3C12 and 3H1, were chosen for blastocyst injection. Mice from the resulting litters were selected initially on the basis of their coat color for further analysis. Mice with mutations in the dystrophin (B6Ros.Cg-Dmd mdx-3Cv) and α2-laminin (129/ReJ-Lama2 dy) gene were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Themdx-3Cv mice are deficient in muscle and non-muscle dystrophin isoforms as a result of a mutation in a consensus splice acceptor site (32Cox G.A. Phelps S.F. Chapman V.M. Chamberlain J.S. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The animals were maintained and humanely sacrificed in accordance to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Approximately 0.5 ml of blood was collected from mice that were anesthetized by using 13 mg/kg xylazine and 100 mg/kg ketamine. Total creatine kinase (CK) levels in serum was measured with an Hitachi 917 automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Hitachi, San Francisco, CA) using a CK assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In cases where CK levels exceeded 2300 units/liter, samples were diluted to ensure that measurements taken were within the linear range of the assay. Blocks of muscle (2–3 mm3) were postfixed for 3 h in 3.5% glutaraldehyde, rinsed, and fixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide. The samples were dehydrated and embedded in Durcupan (Sigma). Ultrathin sections were collected (60–65 nm) on 100 or 200 square mesh grids, counterstained with lead citrate, and examined with a CM10 Philips transmission electron microscope. Anti-β-dystroglycan and anti-α-sarcoglycan antisera were generated in-house by injecting rabbits with a polypeptide (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) corresponding to 15 of the last 16 amino acids of the C terminus of β-dystroglycan and to the 19 amino acids at the C terminus of α-sarcoglycan, respectively. Generation of monoclonal antibody 1B7 against α-dystroglycan was described previously (33Moukhles H. Roque R. Carbonetto S. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 420: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Antisera against α1-dystrobrevin (DB638 and DB670), α2-dystrobrevin (DB2), α1-syntrophin (Syn17), and β1-syntrophin (Syn37) were gifts from S. C. Froehner (University of Washington). Anti-dystrophin antiserum was provided by P. Holland (McGill University, Montréal, Canada). Antisera against the A (Bur109) and B (number 1726) splice variants of the α7 integrin subunit were donated by E. Engvall (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The anti-γ-sarcoglycan polyclonal antiserum is a gift from E. M. McNally (University of Chicago). Antiserum raised against the N terminus of nNOS was obtained from Diasorin (Stillwater, MN), and monoclonal antibodies against β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans were obtained from Novocastra (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). Antiserum against caveolin-3 was obtained from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). Hindlimb muscles (gastrocnemius, soleus, and femoral biceps) were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura, Torrance, CA). Remaining hindlimb muscles were isolated from the bone and frozen in liquid nitrogen for the preparation of protein extracts. In chimeric mice, the contribution from dystroglycan null ES cells to the hindlimb musculature was assessed by glucose-phosphate isomerase (GPI) assay (34DeLorenzo R.J. Ruddle F.H. Biochem. Genet. 1969; 3: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) on cellulose acetate plates (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX) as well as by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry using an antiserum against β-dystroglycan. Fresh frozen muscle was sectioned at 10 μm in a cryostat; sections were collected on gelatin-coated slides and stored at −80 °C until required. Experimental and control tissues were placed on the same slide to ensure they were submitted to the same experimental conditions. Slides were thawed at 37 °C, incubated in 10% normal goat serum in Dulbecco's PBS (blocking solution) for 30 min at room temperature, incubated overnight with the primary antibody in blocking solution at 4 °C, washed with Dulbecco's PBS, incubated with Oregon Green 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with Dulbecco's PBS. As required, slides were then incubated with rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled α-bungarotoxin and/or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Molecular Probes), before mounting with ImmunoFluor (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). For the analysis of serial sections of transversally sectioned muscle, corresponding areas on adjacent sections were identified in phase contrast using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ), and then photographs were taken on a Axioscope fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Hindlimb muscles from wild-type control, mdx, dy, and chimeric mice were minced in Dulbecco's PBS with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and spun gently at 150 ×g. The pellet was used for total protein extraction using a rotating Teflon Dounce homogenizer at 800 rpm in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). A wild-type control sample was always processed alongside the experimental sample under identical conditions. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). To confirm that there was a high contribution of dystroglycan-null ES cells to muscle, a sample of protein extract from chimeric mice was analyzed by GPI assay (Fig. 4 A, results were replicated in two additional chimeras) (30Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Each sample (40 μg per lane) was electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of appropriate percentage depending on the protein examined and electrotransferred for 1 h at 100 V onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibody in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antisera (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at a 1/2000 dilution. Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed using the NIH image analysis program. Chimeric mice with reduced levels of dystroglycan develop histopathologic signs typical of dystrophic muscle (30Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, they have CK levels 20–100 times above normal (Fig.1 A) consistent with a breakdown in cell surface permeability. Electron microscopy analysis of the gastrocnemius muscle from chimeric mice shows major disruptions in the ultrastructure of some muscle fibers (Fig. 1, B andC). The nuclei often contained vacuoles and prominent nucleoli (Fig. 1 B). The sarcoplasmic reticulum was dilated (Fig. 1 B) similar to skeletal muscle in mdx mice and patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (35Cullen M.J. Jaros E. Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 77: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 36Watkins S.C. Cullen M.J. J. Neurol. Sci. 1987; 82: 181-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have also observed “cytomembrane swirls” (Fig. 1 C) that appear as concentric layers of intracellular membranes with a morphology distinct from “fingerprint bodies” that are seen in several myopathies (37Engel A.G. Angelini C. Gomez M.R. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1972; 47: 377-388PubMed Google Scholar,38Carpenter S. Karpati G. Pathology of Skeletal Muscles. Churchill Livingstone, New York1984: 314-321Google Scholar). In a previous study (30Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) we had observed several fibers that were positively labeled for dystrophin even within chimeric muscle that appeared to be null for dystroglycan when muscle extracts were assayed by immunoblotting or by GPI electrophoresis. At the time we were unable to monitor dystroglycan expression within single myofibers because the anti-mouse IgG secondary antiserum used to recognize the dystroglycan monoclonal antibody also reacted with endogenous immunoglobulins that had infiltrated the dystroglycan-depleted muscle (30Coôté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, the localization of dystrophin to the sarcolemma of a subset of these fibers could be due to dystroglycan expression in chimeric myofibers with a small number of wild-type nuclei. Therefore, we generated a rabbit anti-β-dystroglycan antiserum, which revealed that in muscle that was dystroglycan-deficient by immunoblotting and GPI assays, ∼1–3% of the fibers were dystroglycan-positive (Fig.2 G and not shown). By staining serial sections of muscle and identifying the same region on all the sections, it was possible to determine the make-up of the whole DAP complex in a single fiber. In the vast majority of myofibers in dystroglycan-deficient chimeras dystroglycan was undetectable (Fig.2 G) as were dystrophin (Fig. 2 J), the sarcoglycans (Fig. 2, H and I), and the cytoplasmic complex (α1-syntrophin and nNOS) (Fig. 2,K and L). These fibers had an immunohistochemical profile similar to dystrophin null muscle (Fig. 2, S–X) but distinct from merosin null muscle (M–R) where DAPs are largely unaffected (12Ohlendieck K. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In a few instances where fibers in dystroglycan-deficient muscle had detectable levels of dystroglycan, dystrophin, the sarcoglycans (α and γ), and the cytoplasmic DAP complex (syntrophin and nNOS) were localized at the plasmalemma (Fig.2, G–L, arrowheads) at levels similar to that in wild-type mice (Fig. 2, A–F). However, even when dystroglycan was poorly expressed, it was often concentrated at neuromuscular junctions, identified by double labeling with α-bungarotoxin (39; not shown), and co-localized with molecules of the DAP complex. Presumably, recruitment of residual dystroglycan to junctions during development (40Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Godfrey E.W. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) can stabilize the complex at those sites (39Jacobson C. Coôté P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and may help render these regions resistant to disruption. In some fibers where there was no trace of dystroglycan or α-sarcoglycan (Fig. 3, A andB), dystrophin was clearly detectable at the plasmalemma, and these fibers were typically found in small groups in the muscle (Fig. 3 C). In these instances syntrophin and nNOS co-distributed with dystrophin at the cell surface (Fig. 3,D and E). Thus, dystrophin and a cytoplasmic complex of at least syntrophin and nNOS can be localized at the plasma membrane independently of dystroglycan or the sarcoglycans. The membrane anchor responsible for this interaction is unknown as are member(s) of the cytoplasmic complex that can interact with it (discussed below). It is important to note, however, that the complex lacking dystroglycan was insufficient to prevent muscle degeneration because these myofibers were atrophic and/or had central nuclei typical of myofiber regeneration (Fig. 3 F) and were occasionally found to contain high levels of endogenous immunoglobulins (not shown) indicative of a breakdown in the sarcolemma. To assess whether the reduced immunohistochemical labeling at the sarcolemma of mutant muscle reflects a reduction in expression of the DAPs or simply a displacement from the sarcolemma to the cytosol, we performed immunoblots for dystrophin and members of the DAP complex. The expression level of the DAP complex in total protein extracts (1% Triton X-100) of dystroglycan-deficient chimeric mice was compared with that of mdx and dy mice. Replicate blots were made and probed with antibodies to α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan, α-sarcoglycan, β-sarcoglycan, γ-sarcoglycan, dystrophin, α1-syntrophin, β1-syntrophin, and nNOS (Fig. 4 B). As shown previously, the absence of dystrophin in the mdx mouse leads to a reduction in the expression of DAP components including dystroglycan, sarcoglycans, syntrophin, dystrobrevin, and nNOS (12Ohlendieck K. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar,41Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P.

Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9142-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Dystrophin levels were considerably reduced in dystroglycan-deficient chimeric muscle, and the effect of dystroglycan depletion mirrored that of dystrophin depletion in the mdxmouse resulting in a significant reduction of the sarcoglycan complex and α2-dystrobrevin. nNOS, which binds to syntrophin, was also substantially decreased in dystroglycan-deficient mice but only moderately affected in mdx mice. The reduction in these DAPs did not appear merely to result from the degeneration of myofibers in these animals because dy mice, which have a severe muscular dystrophy, expressed these DAPs in amounts equal to those in wild-type skeletal muscle (Fig. 4 B and Fig. 2, M–R). In contrast, α1-syntrophin showed little change in expression levels in dystroglycan-deficient muscle. Thus targeting to the membrane of α1-syntrophin rather than expression,per se, seems disrupted in the absence of dystroglycan. Consistent with this an internal pool of α-syntrophin is visible immunohistochemically in some myofibers (Fig. 2 K). This pattern is different from that in dystrophin null muscle where α1-syntrophin is essentially undetectable (Fig.2 W). In mdx, dy, and dystroglycan-deficient muscle the anti-β1-syntrophin a"

Like other GCK-III subfamily kinases, MASK does not activate any mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Wild type MASK, but not a form lacking the C terminus, exhibits homophilic binding in the yeast two-hybrid system and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Additionally, deletion of this C-terminal region of MASK leads to an increased kinase activity toward itself as well as toward an exogenous substrate, myelin basic protein. A potential caspase 3 cleavage site (DESDS) is present in the C-terminal region of MASK, and we show that MASK is cleaved in vitro by caspase 3. Finally, wild type and C-terminally truncated forms of MASK can both induce apoptosis upon overexpression in mammalian cells that is abrogated by CrmA, suggesting involvement of MASK in the apoptotic machinery in mammalian cells.

Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar).The GCK family members are distinguished from PAK family kinases in that they have a kinase domain at their N terminus instead of at the C terminus, as is the case with PAK kinases (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, although the kinase domain operationally defines this family, the non-catalytic regions likely direct the scope of intermolecular interactions and may be responsible for functional distinctions between various family members (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). As the number of identified GCK family kinases has increased, so has the variety of non-catalytic regions of these molecules (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The GCK family was historically classified into two subfamilies, but recent extensive analyses on human,Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes has led to their reclassification into eight phylogenetically distinct subfamilies (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the newly established phylogenetic relationship, each subfamily is represented by a distinct Drosophila andC. elegans kinase with two to four human orthologs (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). One of the most crucial subjects in the study of the mammalian GCK family kinases in the post-genome era is to establish distinct features of a kinase in reference to the other members in the same subfamily and to kinases in different subfamilies. In this sense, the most peculiar subfamily may be the GCK-III subfamily consisting of two mammalian kinases, SOK1/YSK1 and Mst3, and their Drosophilaand C. elegans orthologs, CG5169 and T19A5.2 (1Dan I.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Unlike other GCK family kinases, neither SOK1/YSK1 nor Mst3 has been shown to activate JNK or p38 MAPK pathways (5Schinkmann K. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28695-28703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J.M. Force T.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The only distinct physiological function demonstrated to date is an activation of SOK1 by oxidant stress and chemical anoxia (6Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Pombo C.M. Tsujita T. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Force T. J. Biol.

Although GCK-IIIs are closely related to GCK-IIs, including Mst1/Krs2 and Mst2/Krs1, which are activated during apoptosis, no involvement in apoptosis has been reported for GCK-IIIs thus far (9Creasy C.L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Here, we report cloning of a novel kinase of the GCK-III subfamily that has been designated MASK (Mst3 andSOK1-related kinase), whose existence was first described in our systematic screening of Ste20 group kinases in the human genome (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Shortly after our first mention of MASKgene, another group described an identical gene as MST4 and showed that it is a kinase but did not assign any function (14Qian Z. Lin C. Espinosa R. LeBeau M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MASK is a protein kinase ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. Analogous to other GCK-III subfamily members, MASK was found to activate none of the MAPK pathways. The C-terminal non-catalytic region of MASK is involved in self-association and is inhibitory to its kinase activity. Using a polyclonal antibody generated against the C terminus of MASK, we show that it is expressed as a 47-kDa protein in several cell lines. MASK is cleaved in vitro by caspase 3 to generate a C-terminally truncated form presumably cleaved at a putative caspase 3 cleavage site. Most notably, both full-length and C-terminally truncated forms of MASK, but not a kinase dead version, induce apoptosis when overexpressed in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This apoptotic effect is abrogated upon coexpression of CrmA, a virally encoded inhibitor of caspases. Finally, a kinase dead version of MASK cannot inhibit apoptosis induced by the TNF receptor. Taken together, our results implicate MASK in the apoptotic pathways in cells.DISCUSSIONThe GCK family of protein kinases represents an emerging large family of protein kinases with eight subfamilies (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To study such a large family of protein kinases, a phylogenetic analysis is indispensable. Most of the GCK family of protein kinases characterized so far activate either JNK or p38 MAPK signaling pathways upon overexpression (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

However, there are several exceptions to this rule. LOK from the GCK-V subfamily does not activate either pathway, but its closely related homolog SLK activates JNK (25Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Kuramochi S. Moriguchi T. Kuida K. Endo J. Semba K. Nishida E. Karasuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22679-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). OSR1 from the GCK-VI subfamily is yet to be shown to activate either pathway, but its homolog PASK/SPAK activates p38 MAPK (36Tamari M. Daigo Y. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4290-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, these kinases may be able to activate either pathway under different physiological conditions. Studies addressing the involvement of the most recent members of the GCK-VII subfamily, MYO3A and MYO3B, in MAPK signaling pathways are underway (39Dose A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2000; 67: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 2A. C. Dose, personal communication. The most notable exceptions are found in the GCK-III subfamily of kinases consisting of SOK1/YSK1 and Mst3 in addition to MASK, which is described in this report. All of them are active kinases when overexpressed but do not activate JNK or p38 MAPK pathways (5Schinkmann K. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28695-28703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J.M. Force T.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that they participate in other less characterized MAPK pathways such as ERK3/4 or ERK5 (3Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar).Four GCK family kinases, Mst1/Krs2, Mst2/Krs1 (GCK-II), HPK1 (GCK-1), and SLK (GCK-V) have been reported to be directly or indirectly involved in apoptosis to date (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 12Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K.

They are suggested to be activated upon cleavage by caspase 3 to produce the free kinase domain with enhanced activity during apoptosis (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 12Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S.

This may also be the case with MASK for two reasons. First, both wild type and C terminus-truncated forms of MASK can induce apoptosis of cultured cells upon overexpression. Second, MASK can be cleaved by caspase 3 in vitro. Our findings indicate that the pro-apoptotic effect of MASK is enhanced by loss of the region C-terminal to the putative caspase cleavage site. In addition, this effect is abrogated upon treatment with a caspase inhibitor, CrmA. Because activation of the NF-κB pathway confers protection against apoptosis in several instances, the lack of activation of this pathway is consistent with the apoptosis-inducing ability of MASK (40Taglialatela G. Robinson R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Given these observations, it is possible that MASK participates in the apoptotic cascade in cells. Whether this involvement in apoptosis is specific to MASK or common to other GCK-III subfamily members is yet to be tested. SOK1 is activated during the initial stages of chemical anoxia-induced necrotic cell death, but its involvement in apoptosis remains uncertain (8Pombo C.M. Tsujita T. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29372-29377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the recognition motif for caspase 3 is present only in MASK, it may be that the induction of apoptosis is a property restricted to MASK.The demonstration that overexpression of MASK alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis is interesting for several reasons. Like other GCK-IIIs, MASK is ubiquitously expressed among tissues that do not undergo apoptosis under physiological conditions (5Schinkmann K. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28695-28703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 7Osada S. Izawa M. Saito R. Mizuno K. Suzuki A. Hirai S. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus endogenous MASK is likely to be silenced so as not to induce apoptosis in the normal intracellular environment. Our demonstration that a fraction of the overexpressed MASK remains resistant to caspase 3 cleavage suggests that there might exist a protective mechanism that keeps MASK from participating in apoptotic events. One of such mechanisms is steric inhibition by oligomerization. Indeed, we have shown by yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vivo experiments that the direct self-association of MASK molecules requires its C terminus region. The C terminus region corresponding to 359–391 amino acids is predicted to form a coiled-coil motif, which often mediates oligomerization (26Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 30Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Another possibility is involvement of inhibitory factors, which are yet to be found. To determine whether the oligomerization of MASK regulates apoptosis especially by preventing cleavage requires further studies.The GCK-II subfamily kinases consisting of Mst1/Krs2 and Mst2/Krs1 are also known to induce apoptosis (12Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, their mechanism of action seems different from that of MASK. Mst1 activates JNK and p38 pathways during apoptosis (13Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Recent observations suggest that Mst1 acts directly upstream of a MAPK kinase kinase, MEKK1 (41Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This is unlikely to be the case with MASK, which probably induces apoptosis via some other pathway. We have shown that the kinase activity of MASK is necessary for its induction of apoptosis, but its physiological phosphorylation substrate is still unidentified.Points of similarity that we have noticed between MASK and Mst1 are their ability to oligomerize and the inhibitory effect on kinase activity of their respective C-terminal regions. Creasy et al. (29Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have identified two distinct domains in the C-terminal region of Mst1, a dimerization domain and an inhibitory domain that reduces its kinase activity. Multicoil computer program predicts MASK to prefer a higher degree of oligomerization whereas Mst1 has been shown to dimerize by cross-linking experiments (26Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 29Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). GCK-II, GCK-III, and GCK-VI subfamily kinases are often put together in the same category due to presence of a short C terminus region, but such an oversimplification should be avoided inasmuch as their C terminus regions are structurally distinct from each other (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar).While this report was in preparation, a report describing the cloning of a gene, designated MST4, that is identical toMASK was published (14Qian Z. Lin C. Espinosa R. LeBeau M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cDNA reported for Mst4 is 1372 bp, whereas the length of MASK cDNA that we have cloned is 3263 bp. Given that our Northern blot shows a single band migrating at ∼3.3 kb, it is likely that we have identified the full-length cDNA, whereas the Mst4 sequence represents a partial clone. Nevertheless, both of the cDNAs contain the entire open reading frame and code for the same protein of 416 amino acids. Additionally, Qian et al. (14Qian Z. Lin C. Espinosa R. LeBeau M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have described an alternatively spliced transcript that they designate as Mst4a, which encodes a protein of 354 amino acids. Although, the role of Mst4/MASK in apoptosis was not investigated, Qian et al. (14Qian Z. Lin C. Espinosa R. LeBeau M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) also did not detect any activation of ERK, p38, or JNK MAPK pathways upon overexpression of Mst4/MASK.In conclusion, we have identified and cloned a novel GCK family kinase,MASK, that belongs to the GCK-III subfamily. MASK shows widespread expression and does not activate ERK, p38, JNK, or NF-κB pathways. The C-terminal region of MASK is essential for its self-association and has an inhibitory effect on its kinase activity. The C-terminal region can be cleaved by caspase 3 in vitro. Most importantly, MASK and its C-terminal truncated form can induce apoptosis upon overexpression, with the latter inducing a more potent apoptotic effect. These findings represent an important step toward elucidating the physiological role of MASK and other GCK-III subfamily kinases.

https://openalex.org/W1965862787,"Icap1α is a 200-amino acid protein that binds to the COOH-terminal 13 amino acids (786AVTTVVNPKYEGK798) of the integrin β1 subunit. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region revealed that Val787, Val790, and792NPKY795 are critical for Icap1α binding. The NPXY motif is a known binding substrate for phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain proteins. The sequences of Icap1α, residues 58–200, and the β1 integrin, residues 786–797, were aligned to the available PTB-peptide structures to generate a high quality structural model. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Leu135, Ile138, and Ile139 of Icap1α, residues predicted by the model to be in close proximity to 792NPKY795, and Leu82 and Tyr144, residues expected to form a hydrophobic pocket near Val787, are required for the Icap1α-β1 integrin interaction. These findings indicate that Icap1α is a PTB domain protein, which recognizes the NPXY motif of β1 integrin. Furthermore, our date suggest that an interaction between Val787 and the hydrophobic pocket created by Leu82 and Tyr144of Icap1α forms the basis for the specificity of Icap1α for the β1 integrin subunit. Icap1α is a 200-amino acid protein that binds to the COOH-terminal 13 amino acids (786AVTTVVNPKYEGK798) of the integrin β1 subunit. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region revealed that Val787, Val790, and792NPKY795 are critical for Icap1α binding. The NPXY motif is a known binding substrate for phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain proteins. The sequences of Icap1α, residues 58–200, and the β1 integrin, residues 786–797, were aligned to the available PTB-peptide structures to generate a high quality structural model. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Leu135, Ile138, and Ile139 of Icap1α, residues predicted by the model to be in close proximity to 792NPKY795, and Leu82 and Tyr144, residues expected to form a hydrophobic pocket near Val787, are required for the Icap1α-β1 integrin interaction.

The binding of integrins to ligands in the extracellular matrix is linked to cell attachment and spreading, which in turn activates various cytosolic signal cascades to promote cell migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation (3Clark E.A.

The regulation of the activation status of integrins and the post-ligand binding activation of various signaling cascades require the integrin cytoplasmic domains. Mutagenesis studies have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of β subunit is important for cell adhesion and migration (7O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H.

In addition to these proteins, which can bind to the cytoplasmic domains of several different β subunits, there are proteins with binding specificity toward a particular β integrin cytoplasmic domain. For example, Cytohesin-1 interacts specifically with the β2 integrin (21Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and regulates the leukocyte-specific αLβ2 integrins (22Geiger C. Nagel W. Boehm T. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Kremmer E. Hogg N. Zeitlmann L. Dierks H. Weber K.S. Kolanus W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2525-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, β3-endonexin binds to the β3 integrin (23Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and may play a role in the affinity regulation of platelet integrin αIIBβ3 (24Kashiwagi H. Schwartz M.A. Eigenthaler M. Davis K.A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Another of these proteins is Icap1α,1 which displays a restricted binding toward the β1 integrins (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although the precise function of Icap1α has not been established, its role in integrin-dependent cell adhesion was suggested from the finding that Icap1α undergoes an adhesion-dependent phosphorylation (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a mutant Icap1α with a T38D mutation interferes with cell spreading (26Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Icap1α binding site on the β1 integrin has been mapped to the COOH-terminal region of β1 integrin (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which includes one of the two NPXY (or NXXY) motifs present in several integrin β subunits. These NPXY motifs are important for the localization of integrins to focal contacts (10Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), integrin-mediated endocytosis (27Van Nhieu G.T. Krukonis E.S. Reszka A.A. Horwitz A.F. Isberg R.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The functions of β1 and β3integrins can also be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation at the NPXY motifs (29Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Sequence homology and molecular modeling reveal that Icap1α has a PTB fold. The PTB domains bind their target peptides through extensive hydrogen bonding and packing interactions in which the target peptide is bound to a characteristic grove on the PTB domain. Furthermore, some PTB domains are specific for peptides with sequences and conformation that are similar to canonical NPXpY (where pY is phosphotyrosine) peptides but that have Tyr or Phe in place of Tyr(P) (32Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Z. Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All known PTB domain proteins contain additional protein-protein interaction module(s) and are believed to function as adaptor proteins in cell signaling (e.g. Shc, IRS-1), lineage determination (e.g. Numb), and receptor internalization (e.g. X11, Fe65, Disabled) (34Borg J.P. Margolis B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 23-38PubMed Google Scholar). Structures of PTB domains in the PDB (Protein Data Bank) were identified with SCOP. One undeposited structure was kindly provided by M. Eck (35Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E.

The superimposed structures and the resulting structure-sequence PIR alignment were opened in Look (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA). There appeared to be a correlation with structural quality and superposition, with those structures of the best quality superimposing with one another the best. Structures with high quality and similar bound peptides were chosen for a final round of superposition with a gap penalty of 3 Å: PDB code 1AQC, chains A and C; PDB code1X11, chains B and D; PDB code 1DDM, model 1; and an IRS-1 crystal structure (see Table I).Table IStructural quality of the Icap1α-β1 peptide model compared with crystal and NMR structures of PTB domain-peptide complexesStructure or modelMethodPDB code & chainsResiduesQUACHK1-aStructural average packing environment quality score with the quality check (QUACHK) option of WHATIF (47).

Open table in a new tab For the starting sequence alignment between the structures, superposition with a gap penalty of 5 Å was used to obtain a more condensed alignment. Multiple gaps within each loop were condensed into a single gap, leaving insertions/deletions near turns or midpoints of loops. The sequence of human X11 protein, GenBankTMaccession number 6226838, was added to reveal the sequence and position of disordered loops that are missing from the X11 structures. The sequence of human Icap1α, residues 58–200, as well as human β1 residues 786–798, were then aligned. The alignment largely followed the BLAST alignment of human Icap1α to the SMART sequences in the conserved domain data base (37Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar), which include two of the structures, Numb and Shc, and mouse Icap1α. However, human and mouse Icap1α were aligned differently in two different sequence blocks. Furthermore, the Numb and Shc sequence alignment was offset by two residues from the structure-based alignment in a block of 18 residues corresponding to β-strands 2 and 3. A good alignment of Icap1α with Numb but not Shc sequence in this region made alignment clear. Otherwise, only minor alignment adjustments were required. The β1 peptide could be readily aligned to the peptides in the PDB domain structures using the NPXY motif. Two modeling programs were used, each of which has proved superior in the past depending on the modeling problem (38Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 39Springer T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 40Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A.

Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) with each of the three longer structures as templates (see Fig. 1) and using MODELLER 4 (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) with individual templates and combinations of up to all four templates. Models with the best QUACHK scores and native-like hydrogen bond patterns in the peptide binding cleft were produced by Segmod. The final model utilized as template chains A (X11 protein) and C (β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) peptide) of PDB code 1AQC (33Zhang Z. Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the first two residues of chain D of PDB code 1X11 (βAPP peptide) (33Zhang Z. Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) because of the longer length of the peptide in this structure. For the last three residues of the β1 peptide, the Numb-associated kinase (Nak) peptide from PDB code 1DDM (42Zwahlen C. Li S.C. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used, which has an extended conformation in this region, instead of the 3–10 helix of the βAPP peptide bound to X11. The PDB code 1DDM peptide was superimposed on that of PDB code 1AQCusing the peptide residues MSF and PTY, respectively. QUACHK and NQACHK of WHATIF identified no problematic residues in the peptide or its binding groove on Icap1α. Two long loops were deleted from the model, residues 99–106 and 147–152, because these could not be templated by the X11 structures, in which the corresponding loops were disordered and therefore missing. These loops are not interacting with the PTB groove. The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession number: 1K11). The LexA fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal 21 aa (778GENPIYKSAVTTVVNPKYEGK798) of the integrin β1 subunit (pNlex-β1cyto) and clone E16–1 containing residues 54–200 of Icap1α in the yeast pJG4–5 vector were described previously (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the β1 cytoplasmic domain and Icap1α (aa 54–200) was carried out using standard methods. Each clone used in this study was sequence-verified. Interaction between the β1 cytoplasmic domain and Icap1α (aa 54–200) was determined in a yeast two-hybrid assay as described previously (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative measurement of the binding was carried out measuring the β-galactosidase activity of the yeast strain EGY48 (Mat α his3 trp1 ura3–52 leu2::pLeu2-lexAop6(ΔUAS leu2) that had been transfected with the JK103 β-galactosidase reporter construct, pNlex-β1cyto, and pJG4–5/Icap1α (aa 54–200). Expression of the B42 acidic domain-Icap1α fusion proteins was verified by an immunoblot analysis using the transformed yeast cells cultured in galactose. The binding of β1 integrins to Icap1α or a mutant Icap1α (I138A) was tested by expressing the PTB domain region of Icap1α (aa 54–200) as a GST fusion protein in 293T cells (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (non-reducing), run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with the mAb TS2/16 or anti-GST antibodies as described previously (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of the human integrin β1 subunit and β1(V787A) mutant was cloned into the SRα retroviral vector. The virus stock was prepared from the conditioned media of 293T cells that have been transfected with the SRα/β1 integrin constructs and Ψ-packaging vector. Two ml of the supernatant was used to infect NIH3T3 cells that were seeded the previous night at a density of 250,000 cells/100-mm plate. 48 h later, the infected cells were harvested and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using the mAb TS2/16 to determine the surface expression of the human β1 integrin. The infected cells were then replated on a fibronectin-coated glass coverslip for 4 h and then incubated with the mAb TS2/16 to localize the human β1 integrins on the cell surface. We introduced Ala substitutions at the COOH-terminal 13 amino acids of the β1 cytoplasmic domain, which comprises the minimal Icap1α binding site (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An alanine substitution at Asn, Pro, or Tyr of the 792NPKY795 motif, Val787, or Val790 within this 13-amino acid region effectively abolished the Icap1α binding in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig.1). Tyr795, however, could be changed to Phe without affecting the interaction, indicating that the binding of Icap1α to the peptide target does not require a Tyr(P) residue. Among different integrin β subunits, only the β1cytoplasmic domain fulfilled the requirement of an NPXY motif and Val residues at the −8 and −5 position relative to the Tyr residue (Fig. 1). It is of interest that the β2cytoplasmic domain, which has Thr at the −8 position, can be mutated to bind Icap1α by replacing this Thr with Val. Therefore, the Val787 residue on the β1 integrin likely represents the specificity determinant that allows Icap1α to discriminate different β integrin cytoplasmic domains. The requirement of the NPXY motif and the hydrophobic Val residues on the β1 cytoplasmic domain for the Icap1α binding was reminiscent of the interaction between the IR and Shc or IRS-1 in which the NPXY motif in the juxtamembrane region of the IR, upon tyrosine phosphorylation, binds to the PTB domain of Shc or IRS-1 (35Eck M.J.

BLAST searches with the Icap1α sequence failed to yield any significant homology to the PTB domain of Shc or IRS-1 or any other polypeptides in the NCBI data base. However, a “reverse position-specific iterative BLAST” search (46Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) with the Icap1α sequence revealed homology to an alignment of PTB domains compiled by SMART (37Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar) with a highly significant expectation value of 2 × 10−10 (data not shown, see Fig. 2). Based on the resulting sequence alignment, amino acids 58–200 of Icap1α can be classified as a single PTB domain. This assignment of the Icap1α PTB domain is in agreement with the minimal region of Icap1α (aa 54–200) required for binding to the β1 cytoplasmic domain (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that Icap1β, an alternatively spliced isoform, does not bind the β1 cytoplasmic domain (25Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The 50 amino acids that are missing in Icap1β correspond to residues 128–177 of Icap1α, which span β-strands 4 to 7, a deletion of which would disrupt the PTB fold. We constructed a model of Icap1α bound to a β1 cytoplasmic domain peptide (β1 peptide:786AVTTVVNPKYEG797). Seven different PTB domains with bound peptides were compared structurally (see Table I). The two X11 structures, one of the Numb structures, and the two IRS structures bind peptide very similarly; the Numb structure PDB code2NMB binds to a different peptide that lacks an NPXY consensus. Superposition of the first five structures revealed many structurally equivalent residues in the PTB domains and in the bound peptides. The Icap1α sequence could be readily aligned to the structure-based sequence alignment of these structures (Fig.2). The Icap1α-β1 peptide model (Fig.3) was found to be of high structural quality using objective tools for structure evaluation that are independent of refinement methods (47Vriend G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 48Wilson K.S. Butterworth S. Dauter Z. Lamzin V.S. Walsh M. Wodak S. Pontius J. Richelle J. Vaguine A. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 417-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The average structural quality packing environment scores of the model given by QUACHK and NQACHK are within the normal ranges for crystal and NMR structures (Table I and footnote a and b of TableI). Furthermore, the scores for the model are comparable with those for PTB domain crystal structures and comparable with or superior to those for PTB domain NMR structures. The only problematic areas in the structure were in untemplated loops distant from the PTB peptide binding groove, and no structural quality warnings were noted in the PTB domain groove or in the bound peptide. The hydrogen bonding pattern in the model found for the peptide-PTB β-sheet interaction and the internal hydrogen bonds in the β-turn present in the NPXY motif are remarkably well preserved relative to those revealed in the crystal structure templates. The model preserves the hydrogen bond between the backbones of Asn792 and Tyr795 that form the β-turn in the 792NPKY795 motif. Residues 788–791 of β1 integrin form a β-strand that adds onto the edge of the Icap1α β-sheet, and the hydrogen bond is preserved in the model from the side chain of Asn792 to the Icap1α β-sheet that caps the β1 integrin β-strand. Conserved features of PTB domains were noted in the Icap1α-β1 peptide interaction. For example, a short segment connecting the fourth and fifth β-strands of the Icap1α PTB domain is in close contact with Asn792 of the β1 peptide (Fig. 3). Located within this segment are Leu135 and Ile138. Analogous positions in the IRS-1 PTB domain are occupied by Leu and Val, whose carbonyl groups accept hydrogen bonds from the side chain amide group of the Asn of the NPXY motif (35Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). As predicted, Ala substitution of Leu135 or Ile138 abolished binding to the β1 cytoplasmic domain (Fig.4 A). This effect was specific because these amino acid substitutions did not alter the expression levels of the mutated Icap1α proteins (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, when the Icap1α PTB domain region (aa 54–200) was expressed as a GST fusion protein in 293T cells, the wild type GST-Icap1α PTB, but not the I138A mutant, co-purified with the endogenous β1 integrins (Fig. 4 C). Our model also revealed interactions that would determine the specificity of Icap1α for the β1 peptide, including those that are unique for Icap1α compared with other PTB domains (Fig. 2). The Tyr795 residue of the792NPKY795 motif buries Ile139 of Icap1α in an extensive hydrophobic contact. In the structure of IRS-1 bound to the IR peptide, the side chain of Tyr(P)1009 of the IR buries the aliphatic portion of the structurally homologous Arg212 side chain and hydrogen bonds to its guanido group (35Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). By contrast, the PTB domains of X11, Numb, and Shc contain a Ser at the homologous position (33Zhang Z. Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 49Li S.C. Zwahlen C. Vincent S.J. McGlade C.J. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which is a more typical residue in PTB domains. In agreement with the prediction of its functional importance, mutation of Ile139 of Icap1α to alanine abolished the Icap1α-β1 peptide interaction (Fig.4 A). The binding of IRS-1 PTB to the IR peptide is also favored by Arg227 of the IRS-1 PTB, whose side chain extends from the loop connecting the β6 and β7 strands of the IRS-1 PTB to donate hydrogen bonds to the phosphate of Tyr(P)1009 of the IR (35Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In Icap1α PTB, the equivalent position is occupied by Thr160, whose hydroxyl group, together with the hydroxyl group of Tyr167, creates a small pocket to accommodate the hydroxyl group of Tyr795 of the β1 peptide (Fig. 2). In our model, the binding of Icap1α PTB to tyrosine-phosphorylated β1 peptide is disfavored because Thr160 and Tyr167 fill the space that would be occupied by a phosphate and because Ile139 endows a hydrophobic character to the pocket. The Val787 residue of the β1 cytoplasmic domain is a critical determinant of the Icap1α binding specificity (Fig. 1). Only the approximate position of Val787 could be deduced from the model because it is the first templated residue in the peptide, and random perturbation of initial conditions for modeling resulted in different orientations of the Val787 side chain in five different models. However, the model predicted three residues of Icap1α, Leu82, Leu86, and Tyr144 to form a hydrophobic pocket near Val787(Fig. 2). Leu82 and Leu86 are both in the first α-helix of the Icap1α PTB domain. When Leu82 was changed to Ala, a residue with a propensity for the α-helix, the binding to the β1 peptide was severely diminished (Fig.4 A). Introduction of a structurally neutral Gln at either Leu82 or Leu86 did not affect binding. Tyr144 is predicted to be near the end of the fifth β-sheet of Icap1α PTB. Changing Tyr144 to Thr completely abolished the β1 peptide binding. Thr has a propensity for the β-sheet, and therefore, the loss of the side chain interaction between Val787 of the β1 integrin and Tyr144 of Icap1α, rather than the disruption of the Icap1α PTB domain, is likely to account for the loss of interaction. The792NPKY795 motif on the β1cytoplasmic domain is required for the β1 integrins to be localized to the focal contacts (9Hayashi Y. Haimovich B. Reszka A. Boettiger D. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To assess the significance of the Val787 of the β1 cytoplasmic domain, we introduced a V787A substitution to the β1 integrin and expressed either the wild type human β1 integrin or this β1(V787A) mutant in NIH3T3 cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using mAb TS2/16 confirmed equivalent surface expression of the wild type β1 and β1(V787A) mutant in the transduced cells (data not shown). In situ immunofluorescence revealed that the wild type β1 integrins were distributed in streaks, in a pattern typical for the distribution of focal contacts in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5). The V787A mutant, however, was distributed diffusely, suggesting that Val787 of the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain is involved in both Icap1α binding and the localization of the β1 integrins to the focal contacts. We have shown that Icap1α has a PTB domain, which recognizes the conserved 792NPKY795 motif on the β1 cytoplasmic domain. Icap1α is the only known example of a protein that essentially consists of a single PTB domain. The binding of Icap1α to the β1 peptide can occur with unphosphorylated Tyr795 or when Tyr795 is mutated to Phe. In fact, our model strongly disfavors the binding of Icap1α to the β1 peptide with Tyr(P)795, raising the possibility that Icap1α may dissociate from the β1 integrins when the β1 cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated at the 792NPKY795 motif."

We have now generated knockout (KO) mice that lack CL1 and analyzed them alone or in combination with neurexin 1α KO mice. Mice lacking only CL1, or both CL1 and neurexin 1α, were viable and fertile. Ca2+-independent binding of α-latrotoxin to brain membranes was impaired similarly in CL1 single and in CL1/neurexin 1α double KO mice (∼75% decrease) but not in neurexin 1α single KO mice. In contrast, Ca2+-dependent binding (∼2 times above Ca2+-independent binding) was altered in both CL1 (∼50% decrease) and neurexin 1α single KO mice (∼25% decrease) and was decreased further in double KO mice (∼75% decrease). Synaptosomes lacking CL1 exhibited the same decrease in α-latrotoxin-stimulated glutamate release in the presence and absence of Ca2+(∼75%). In contrast, synaptosomes lacking neurexin 1α exhibited only a small decrease in α-latrotoxin-triggered release in the absence of Ca2+ (∼20%) but a major decrease in the presence of Ca2+ (∼75%). Surprisingly, synaptosomes lacking both CL1 and neurexin 1α displayed a relatively smaller decrease in α-latrotoxin-stimulated glutamate release than synaptosomes lacking only CL1 in the absence of Ca2+ (∼50versus ∼75%), but the same decrease in the presence of Ca2+ (∼75%). Our data suggest the following two major conclusions. 1) CL1 and neurexin 1α together account for the majority (75%) of α-latrotoxin receptors in brain, with the remaining receptor activity possibly due to other CL and neurexin isoforms, and 2) the two receptors act additively in binding α-latrotoxin but not in triggering release. Together these data suggest that the two receptors act autonomously in binding of α-latrotoxin but cooperatively in transducing the stimulation of neurotransmitter release by α-latrotoxin. α-Latrotoxin triggers massive neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals by binding to at least two distinct presynaptic receptors, neurexin 1α and CIRL1/latrophilin1 (CL1).

Together these data suggest that the two receptors act autonomously in binding of α-latrotoxin but cooperatively in transducing the stimulation of neurotransmitter release by α-latrotoxin. α-Latrotoxin is a 130-kDa component of black widow spider venom that is initially synthesized as a 160-kDa precursor protein and is then processed proteolytically at the N and C terminus (1Kiyatkin N.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3250-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Latrotoxin is a potent neurotoxin, causing massive release of neurotransmitter in nerve terminals by exocytosis (4Frontali N.

It seems that the toxin triggers release by first binding to neuronal surface receptors and then directly inserting into the presynaptic plasma membrane (3Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3250-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most studies imply that the toxin is active in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and directly stimulates the secretory apparatus (6Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. J.

Two classes of cell surface receptors for α-latrotoxin have been identified. Neurexins are neuron-specific proteins with a single transmembrane domain (9Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 10Sugita S. Khvochtev M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 22: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). They function at least partly as cell adhesion molecules; one isoform, neurexin 1α, binds α-latrotoxin with high affinity in a Ca2+-dependent manner. CLs (CIRLs and latrophilins) 1CLCIRL/latrophilinKOknockout 1CLCIRL/latrophilinKOknockout are G-protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains and unusually large intra- and extracellular domains (11Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol.

CL1 and CL3 are highly enriched in brain, whereas CL2 is expressed ubiquitously. Although CL1 and neurexin 1α appear to be the most important receptors for α-latrotoxin, most of the other neurexin and CL isoforms also constitute functional α-latrotoxin receptors (10Sugita S.

Furthermore, consistent with the α-latrotoxin binding data, experiments on neurexin 1α KO mice showed that release triggered by α-latrotoxin does not require neurexin 1α in the absence of Ca2+ but does require neurexin 1α in the presence of Ca2+ (16Geppert M. Khvotchev M. Krasnoperov V. Goda Y. Missler M. Hammer R.E. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Despite extensive work that includes the identification of multiple receptors, the mechanism by which α-latrotoxin triggers release has remained elusive (reviewed in Ref. 17Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 933-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Studies using a recombinant mutant of α-latrotoxin revealed that high affinity binding of α-latrotoxin to its receptors is essential but not sufficient to trigger neurotransmitter release (18Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Kiyatkin N. Simpson L. Sugita S. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression of neurexin 1α or CL1 in PC12 cells highly sensitizes them to α-latrotoxin; this occurs even when deletion mutants of both receptors lacking intracellular sequences are expressed (10Sugita S. Khvochtev M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 22: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Sugita S. Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5491-5498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because the mutant receptors lack intracellular sequences, they are presumably incapable of transducing a surface signal into the cell interior, suggesting that α-latrotoxin does not trigger release by activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways dependent on neurexin 1α and CL1. Moreover, thein vivo importance of the various proposed α-latrotoxin receptors is largely unclear. The fact that deletion of neurexin 1α severely impaired the α-latrotoxin response in the presence but not in the absence of Ca2+ confirms the importance of neurexin 1α as an α-latrotoxin receptor, although it is also puzzling. Specifically, because α-latrotoxin-triggered release is similar in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (8Khvotchev M. Lonart G Südhof T.C. Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it would have been expected that because neurexin 1α only binds to α-latrotoxin in the presence of Ca2+, CL1 should be sufficient to elicit a complete α-latrotoxin response. Thus the fact that the neurexin 1α KO had an effect at all is puzzling, even though as predicted, a large effect was only observed in the presence of Ca2+. Together these data raise exciting new questions. For example, is CL1 responsible for the ability of α-latrotoxin to trigger neurotransmitter release in the absence of Ca2+ under conditions where α-latrotoxin release is not severely impaired in neurexin 1α KO mice? Are neurexin 1α and CL1 truly the primary α-latrotoxin receptors, and do they function independently of each other or cooperatively?In the current study, we have addressed these questions by generating KO mice that lack CL1. By mating these mice with neurexin 1α KO mice, we established double KO mice, which are deficient in both of the two major known α-latrotoxin receptors. We then examined the effect of the various knockouts on α-latrotoxin binding to brain membranes and on neurotransmitter release triggered by α-latrotoxin from isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes). Our results demonstrate that CL1 is the major Ca2+-independent α-latrotoxin receptor in glutamatergic nerve terminals, mediating the exocytosis of ∼75% of released glutamate. Surprisingly, nerve terminals lacking CL1, neurexin 1α, or both respond to α-latrotoxin in the presence of Ca2+ in an indistinguishable manner, suggesting that CL1 and neurexin 1α cooperate at the cell surface to release glutamate in response to α-latrotoxin.DISCUSSIONα-Latrotoxin is a potent excitatory toxin in black widow spider venom that triggers massive neurotransmitter release. α-Latrotoxin stimulates secretion of classical transmitters contained in small clear synaptic vesicles (e.g. GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine) in the presence and absence of Ca2+. In contrast, transmitters and neuropeptides contained in dense core vesicles (e.g. norepinephrine and neuropeptides) are secreted in response to α-latrotoxin only in the presence of Ca2+(see Refs. 8Khvotchev M. Lonart G Südhof T.C. Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 17Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 933-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and references cited therein). α-Latrotoxin acts by binding to specific high-affinity cell surface receptors (5Tzeng M.C. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4016-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and inserting partially into the plasma membrane (3Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3250-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Latrotoxin forms pores in the plasma membrane, but the pores alone do not appear to explain α-latrotoxin action because cadmium blocks the pore conductance (29Lishko V.K. Sichenko E.A. Storchak L.G. Gimmerl'reikh N.G. Biokimiia. 1990; 55: 1578-1583PubMed Google Scholar) but enhances α-latrotoxin action (18Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Kiyatkin N. Simpson L. Sugita S. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of action of α-latrotoxin has remained unclear. One surprising discovery was that α-latrotoxin binds to at least two distinct high affinity receptors on neurons (9Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C.

When the two different receptors for α-latrotoxin were discovered, three possible explanations for the existence of double receptors were raised.

However, the finding that neurexin 1α is widely expressed in most neurons but largely absent from chromaffin cells (9Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and that KO of neurexin 1α impairs α-latrotoxin-triggered release of classical neurotransmitters in the presence of Ca2+invalidated this possibility (16Geppert M. Khvotchev M. Krasnoperov V. Goda Y. Missler M. Hammer R.E. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A second explanation was that neurexin 1α is simply not a functional α-latrotoxin receptor. Again, this possibility was ruled out by the demonstration that the ability of α-latrotoxin to trigger neurotransmitter release is impaired in neurexin 1α-deficient neurons (16Geppert M. Khvotchev M. Krasnoperov V. Goda Y. Missler M. Hammer R.E. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and by the finding that expression of neurexin 1α conferred an enhanced α-latrotoxin response onto neuroendocrine PC12 cells (10Sugita S. Khvochtev M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 22: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A third possible explanation for the presence of two α-latrotoxin receptors was that neurexin 1α and CL1 are co-receptors, which act as heteromultimers, analogous to some G-protein-linked receptors (reviewed in Ref. 30Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). This possibility, however, was made improbable by the demonstration that each receptor separately binds to α-latrotoxin with the requisite high specificity and affinity expected of a physiological receptor (10Sugita S. Khvochtev M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 22: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23903-23905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); thus the receptors do not function as heteromultimers in binding to α-latrotoxin. Furthermore, both receptors were shown separately to cause a similar sensitization of α-latrotoxin-triggered release in transfected PC12 cells, and no increase in release was observed upon co-expression of both receptors (10Sugita S. Khvochtev M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 22: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Together these findings document that other explanations have to be found for the unusual presence of two receptors for this toxin, and for the uncommon properties of how this toxin works. In an attempt to address this, we have now generated KO mice that lack the second receptor, CL1, analyzed the action of α-latrotoxin in these KO mice, and compared the changes in α-latrotoxin response in these mice to those observed in KO mice that lack neurexin 1α alone or both CL1 and neurexin 1α.Our data demonstrate that single and double KO mice that lack CL1 and/or neurexin 1α are viable and fertile, although they probably exhibit more subtle neuronal and behavioral phenotypes that have not been analyzed in the present experiments. Furthermore, we show that α-latrotoxin binding to brain membranes from these animals is decreased in a pattern that largely follows expectations based on previous studies (11Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol.

Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar): Total binding of α-latrotoxin to wild type membranes in the presence of Ca2+ was two times higher than the binding observed in the absence of Ca2+ as described (16Geppert M. Khvotchev M. Krasnoperov V. Goda Y. Missler M. Hammer R.E. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); CL1 accounts for the majority of both the Ca2+-dependent and -independent binding whereas neurexin 1α only contributes to Ca2+-dependent binding; and the deficits in binding observed in the individual knockouts are additive in the double KO (Fig. 3). However, our data reveal surprising effects of the knockouts on the ability of α-latrotoxin to trigger neurotransmitter release. These effects cannot be explained in terms of α-latrotoxin binding alone. Specifically, we found the following.1) In the absence of Ca2+, deletion of CL1 depresses the majority of α-latrotoxin induced glutamate release, confirming the hypothesis that CL1 constitutes the major Ca2+-independent α-latrotoxin receptor (11Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21504-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 12Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N., Wu, D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, we also observed a small but significant effect of the neurexin 1α KO on release that may reflect a participation of neurexin 1α in the release process itself. This effect was small, explaining why it was not observed in a previous study (16Geppert M. Khvotchev M. Krasnoperov V. Goda Y. Missler M. Hammer R.E. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but was reproducible at different α-latrotoxin concentrations (Fig. 6 A). Curiously, in the absence of Ca2+ α-latrotoxin was more potent in triggering release from synaptosomes lacking both CL1 and neurexin 1α than from synaptosomes lacking only CL1 (Fig. 5 A); this effect was independent of the α-latrotoxin concentration (Fig.6 A).2) In the presence of Ca2+, we observed a very simple effect of each single KO and of the double CL1/neurexin 1α KO on glutamate release: No matter which receptors were deleted, release was strongly inhibited, with the impairment in α-latrotoxin-triggered release being equal for all three genotypes.Overall, these results allow two major conclusions. First, they unequivocally establish that both CL1 and neurexin 1α are physiologically the most important α-latrotoxin receptors. Minor receptor activity remains in the absence of CL1 and neurexin 1α, which may be explained by the presence of CL2 and CL3, and of neurexins 1β, 2α, 2β, 3α, and 3β that are known to function at least partly as α-latrotoxin receptors (10Sugita S. Khvochtev M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 22: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Sugita S. Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5491-5498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and have not been deleted in the CL1 and neurexin 1α knockouts. Second, these results demonstrate that the two types of α-latrotoxin receptors do not function independently of each other in vivo, despite their autonomous α-latrotoxin binding activities. Multiple lines of evidence support this conclusion. For example, both in the presence and the absence of Ca2+, the effects of the CL1 and neurexin 1α knockouts on α-latrotoxin-triggered release were not additive, although their effects on α-latrotoxin binding were. In the presence of Ca2+, both receptors are equally required, and the impairment observed in the double KO is no more severe than that of each single KO, suggesting that under these more physiological conditions the two receptors are essential components of the same machinery that mediates the action of α-latrotoxin. In the absence of Ca2+, we also observed a non-additive effect which, however, went in the opposite direction. Although we do not currently understand the molecular basis for these intriguing observations, they clearly demonstrate that the two receptors act autonomously in α-latrotoxin binding, but interdependently in α-latrotoxin action in neurotransmitter release.Apart from these major conclusions, however, our data raise important questions that we cannot currently answer. Why does the neurexin 1α KO decrease α-latrotoxin-triggered release in the absence of Ca2+, even though the decrease is small, but increase release on the background of the CL1 KO? Because neurexin 1α does not bind α-latrotoxin without Ca2+, the most plausible explanation is that neurexin 1α is part of the machinery by which α-latrotoxin binding to CL1 triggers neurotransmitter release, as described above. As part of this machinery, neurexin 1α has incongruous effects on α-latrotoxin action: It is required for full activation of release by α-latrotoxin binding to Ca2+-independent receptors when all of these receptors are present, but slows down release when the major Ca2+-independent receptor (CL1) is absent. A possible explanation for this finding that would also be consistent with the equal requirement for both receptor types in the presence of Ca2+ is that the precise stoichiometry of Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent receptors (i.e. neurexins and CLs) is important, especially in the absence of Ca2+. Thus creating an excess of one over the other inhibits, whereas deleting both reactivates. However, precise definition of this hypothesis will require further insight into how precisely the two receptors types cooperate in α-latrotoxin action, the next experimental challenge in this interesting field. α-Latrotoxin is a 130-kDa component of black widow spider venom that is initially synthesized as a 160-kDa precursor protein and is then processed proteolytically at the N and C terminus (1Kiyatkin N. Dulubova I. Grishin E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Dulubova I.E. Krasnoperov V.G. Khvotchev M.V. Pluzhnikov K.A. Volkova T.M. Grishin E.V Vais H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3250-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Latrotoxin is a potent neurotoxin, causing massive release of neurotransmitter in nerve terminals by exocytosis (4Frontali N.

Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4016-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It seems that the toxin triggers release by first binding to neuronal surface receptors and then directly inserting into the presynaptic plasma membrane (3Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3250-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most studies imply that the toxin is active in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and directly stimulates the secretory apparatus (6Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. J.

We have uncovered a cellular model system, which selectively induces the ribosomal protein S25 gene in hepatoma cells that are stressed by nutrient deprivation. Our results indicate that p53 along with two other identified proteins, MTF-1 and La, post-transcriptionally regulate the synthesis of the S25 protein by controlling the nuclear export of the stress-induced S25 mRNA. This system is unique in that the nuclear-retained S25 mRNA is exported to the cytosol only upon replenishment or alternatively after prolonged starvation to participate in a p53-mediated apoptotic sequence of events. This p53-dependent survival or death pathway involves a previously unreported protein relationship among these three actors, one of which, MTF-1, has not yet been shown to have RNA-binding characteristics.

Ribosome biogenesis is coordinately controlled by a variety of mechanisms including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in response to changes within or outside the cell such as carbon source and nutrient availability (1Mager W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 949: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,2Laine R.O. Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1996; 53: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Control of transcription within the cell by metabolites is a mechanism that allows cells to respond to changes in their nutritional environment. There is a number of genes for which transcription is enhanced following nutrient deprivation by amino acid starvation, among these include asparagine synthetase (ASNS)1 and ribosomal protein S25 (RPS25) (2Laine R.O. Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1996; 53: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The initial cellular response to amino acid limitation results in increased AS mRNA and thereby increased functional AS and asparagine protein (3Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lacking in AS activity and thus in asparagine exhibit cell cycle arrest (5Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and induction of apoptosis (6Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Stephens L.C. Meyn R.E. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 32: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Bussolati O. Belletti S. Uggeri J. Gatti R. Orlandini G. Dall'Asta V. Gazzola G.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). S25 mRNA levels also are increased in the initial response to amino acid deprivation (8Laine R.O. Shay N.F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but unlike AS, the selective uncoordinated increase in S25 expression signals the induction of apoptosis (9Wang W. Chapin R.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 56: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, the studies using ribosomal protein S6-deficient versus wild-type liver cells suggest that a defect in ribosome biogenesis can cause activation of a p53-mediated checkpoint, leading to cell cycle block and potential DNA damage (10Volarevic S. Stewart M.J. Ledermann F.Z. Terracciano L. Montini E. Grompe M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2000; 288: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) of cellular arrest and programmed cell death in response to cellular stress such as oncogenic signals and nutrient deprivation remain poorly understood. Interestingly, in our experimental model, the cells have devised a mechanism in the early stages of starvation to coordinate the levels of the S25 protein with those of the other ribosomal protein genes by preventing the export of the increased S25 mRNA, thus making it unavailable for translation. Preliminary analysis in response to theRPS25 up-regulation and nuclear retention of its mRNA suggested that the storage of mRNA could permit an elevated rate of synthesis for this particular ribosomal protein to be initiated immediately upon cellular replenishment (8Laine R.O. Shay N.F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Stress conditions in the form of salt, heat, and ethanol have been reported to induce nuclear retention of the bulk of poly(A) RNA but not mRNAs encoding heat shock proteins. The export competence of the heat shock protein mRNAs seems to result from differences in nature of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) package (12Saavedra C. Tung K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopper A.K. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Gallouzi I. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, we explored the RNA-trafficking portion of this sequence of events to determine whether specific protein(s) or protein complexes might be associated with and/or responsible for the up-regulation and nuclear retention of the S25 mRNA and thus to better characterize this phenomenon. Fao and H4IIE hepatoma cells were grown in modified minimum Eagle's medium, pH 7.4, whereas H5 hepatoma cells were grown in modified Ham's F-12 medium in which 5% CO2 was added to the atmosphere as described previously (5Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and were either transferred to Hanks'-buffered saline solution or MEM lacking serum as the amino acid-starved and fed conditions, respectively. Monolayers of Fao, H4IIE, and H5 rat hepatoma cells were harvested after growth for 9 or 24 h in either amino acid-starved or fed medium. Cytosolic and nuclear extract fractions were then separated and isolated using a stepwise lysis of cells that gives functional nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions (NE-PER, Pierce) following the manufacturer instructions. Protein content was determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce), and samples were stored at −80 °C. Biotinylated RNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase following a modified Maxiscript kit protocol (Ambion). The rCTP was replaced with [32P]αCTP or biotinylated rCTP containing an 11-carbon linker to achieve a labeling of ∼4–6 biotin groups/100 nucleotides of RNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA templates corresponded to the complete transcript of rat ribosomal protein S25 (466 nucleotides in length) and a 900-nucleotide fragment of rat asparagine synthetase. Pleuronectes americanusp-glycoprotein (pgpB) DNA template was used for the synthesis of an unrelated RNA control. Electromobility shift assay method was followed as described with minor modifications (14Rodgers J.T. Patel P. Hennes J.L. Bolognia S.L. Mascotti D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled RNA (diluted by 50–100-fold) was incubated in the presence or absence of nuclear or cytoplasmic protein extracts pre-treated with RNase T1 and from either amino acid-starved or fed cells. Potential RNA-protein complexes were resolved by agarose electrophoresis and then electroblotted to positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond N). RNA was detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate using North2South chemiluminescent nucleic acid hybridization and detection kit (Pierce) and evaluated by Fluor-S multi-imager (Bio-Rad). Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts (50 μg) were separated by 3–8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins of interest were detected using appropriate antibodies and West femto chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts from amino acid-starved or fed cells (20 μg) were size separated and electroblotted as mentioned above. Membrane bound proteins were renatured overnight as described previously (37Bichsel V.E. Walz A. Bickel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and washed twice after incubation with either radiolabeled S25 or pgpB RNA for 2 h at room temperature. The dried membranes then were exposed overnight to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics, Inc). SELDI-time-of-flight mass spectometry was performed using ProteinChip array analysis (Ciphergen Biosystems). The epoxy group substrate of the PS2 chip features were initially coupled with streptavidin to allow subsequent binding of 150 ng of biotin-labeledin vitro transcribed S25 RNA. Following a wash step, 25 μg of nuclear extract protein in a total volume of 50 μl was incubated with each target feature using a bio-processor aspect of these chips that allows the incubation of larger volumes. The targets are then fixed with sinapinic acid and then transferred into the chip reader for analysis. All PS2 protein chip arrays were analyzed according to an automated data collection protocol. Data interpretation was augmented by the use of the ProteinChip software, version 2.0.1. Protein A-Sepharose beads were swollen in Tris-based buffer supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 5% bovine serum albumin. A 50-μl aliquot of the protein A-bead slurry was incubated overnight at 4 °C with excess immunoprecipitating antibody. The antibody-coated beads were split into two aliquots, each containing 100 μg of nuclear extract from either amino acid-starved or fed Fao cells. The immunoprecipitation reactions were incubated at room temperature for 2 h followed by a 1m urea wash. For RNA extraction, these washed beads were resuspended in Tris-based buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS and proteinase K, and the RNA was then phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. For protein, the washed beads were incubated in sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using appropriate antibody. First strand cDNA was prepared from the immunoprecipitated RNA using Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the supplier. S25 and AS messages were amplified with gene-specific primers. For relative quantitation, the number of amplification cycles was restricted to the exponential phase of the PCR reaction. The respective products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gel and positively confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Monolayers of Fao, H4IIE, and H5 rat hepatoma cells were harvested after growth for 24 h in either amino acid-starved or fed medium and treated with lysis buffer per the recommendations of the apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems). The resultant lysate was treated with DNA extraction buffer prior to DNA precipitation and resuspension in Tris-based buffer. DNA was resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the resulting gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized on a UV transilluminator. DNA laddering of 180–200 base pairs is characteristic of apoptosis. Potential RNA-protein interactions were evaluated by agarose-based electromobility shift assays using biotin-labeled full-length S25 RNA as a probe (14Rodgers J.T. Patel P. Hennes J.L. Bolognia S.L. Mascotti D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNP) was performed using the S25 riboprobe incubated in the presence of nuclear extracts pre-treated with RNase T1 to digest the endogenous RNA. At least three proteins are bound to the S25 mRNA from the starved nuclear extracts, thus causing a shift in the mobility of the probe compared with the fed samples (Fig.1A). The addition of 100-fold molar excess unlabeled probe to the reaction mixture eliminated the visibility of the shifted complex (data not shown). Also, the addition of 10-fold molar excess of an unrelated and unlabeled mRNA (the 1 kb of 3′-end fragment of pgpB (GenBankTM accession numberAY053461) to the mixture had no effect on the shifted complex (data not shown). These observations suggest that the S25-protein interactions are sequence-specific. To confirm the formation of RNA-protein complexes and to estimate the molecular mass of the RNA-binding proteins Northwestern analysis was performed, again using the full-length S25 RNA as a probe. Results from this assay support the gel-shift data and demonstrate that this probe interacts more strongly with 4–5 different protein bands in starved nuclear extracts when compared with the fed or control nuclear extract samples (Fig.1B, lanes 1 and 2). Protein bands with relative mobilities of ∼73, 53, 43, and 36 kDa were detected in the nuclear extracts assayed from stressed cells. The visible binding by the probe was significantly reduced in the presence of excess unlabeled S25 RNA (Fig. 1B, lane 3), and no probe-binding differences were seen when substituting the S25 RNA probe for the unrelated pgpB RNA probe (data not shown). In addition, no S25 probe-binding differences were seen between fed and starved samples using cytosolic extracts (data not shown). A novel application of the ProteinChip SELDI mass spectrometry (Ciphergen Biosystems) was used to confirm the findings from the Northwestern analysis and to more precisely identify the molecular mass of the potential protein candidates in amino acid-starved nuclear extracts that interacted with the S25 RNA probe. The biotin-labeled RNA probe was bound to the streptavidin-coated chip surface to which nuclear extracts were applied. A SELDI analysis of four different pairs of fed/starved extracts identified two distinctive protein peaks (43,537 and 72,830 Da) in the starved extracts compared with the fed nuclear extracts that approximated the relative mobility of polypeptides observed in Northwestern evaluation of starved nuclear samples (Fig.1C). A search of the protein data base to identify proteins within a small window of these molecular masses gave two potential candidates, tumor suppressor protein p53 (43,451 Da) and zinc finger metal response element-binding transcription factor MTF-1 (72,633 Da, mouse). A third candidate, the RNA-binding phosphoprotein La antigen (47,777 Da) was identified from studies performed in another laboratory 2D. J. Kenan, personal communication. that analyzed mRNA subsets in ribonucleoprotein complexes using cDNA arrays (15Tenenbaum S.A. Carson C.C. Lager P.J. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The above in vitroreconstitution techniques established a framework for examining S25 mRNA-protein interactions. To faithfully reflect the structure of the native complexes, IP experiments were performed to detect messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes involved in the post-transcriptional regulation/retention of S25 mRNA. IP experiments performed on the nuclear extracts and subsequent immunoblot assays indicated that p53, MTF-1, and the La antigen form or are included in a complex associated specifically with the nuclear extracts in amino acid-starved but not fed Fao cells (Fig.2A). The immunoblots prepared using nuclear and cytosolic extracts from both fed and starved cells showed no obvious increase in protein expression or any apparent translocation of protein levels from one compartment to another for any of these three proteins in response to the starvation (Fig.2B). RNase treatment of starved nuclear extracts prior to the immunoprecipitation step eliminated co-precipitation of the other two proteins, demonstrating the RNA dependence of the complex (data not shown). mRNA associated with the mRNP complexes isolated by IP were amplified by gene-specific primers by RT-PCR techniques. S25 transcripts could be amplified from the IP reactions from starved but not fed nuclear extracts (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and3). Because AS is also increased in Fao cells in response to amino acid starvation (3Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the presence of As mRNA in the complex was analyzed as a control. We checked for the presence of AS mRNA, but after 40 cycles of amplification, there was no indication of this message included with the starvation-induced protein complex (Fig.2C, lanes 4 and 5). This finding fits with the known regulation of the AS message, which unlike S25 mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm where it is translated into the functional AS protein that is necessary for cell survival. Therefore, the three proteins are included in a RNA-dependent complex associated specifically with the nuclear-retained S25 mRNA under starved conditions. The random diffusion-based transport model to transport RNA from the nucleus suggests that hnRNPs bind to all transcripts and escort the pre-mRNAs through the maturation process and allow these messages to become nuclear export-competent (16Politz J.C. Pederson T. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins, such as hnRNP A1, K, and E, actually shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm accompanied by their respective mRNAs (17Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Other proteins, such as hnRNPs C1 and C2, are restricted to the nucleus and are thought to perform, in conjunction with their nuclear/cytoplasm shuttling partners, an important post-transcriptional regulatory step in the pathway of gene expression (18Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis indicated that both hnRNPs A1 and C1 were found associated with normal or fed S25 nuclear mRNAs, whereas only hnRNP C1 co-precipitated with the starvation-dependent retained complex (Fig. 2, C, lanes 6–9, andD). Thus, at least for this situation, the nuclear retention of S25 under starved conditions was not dependent or a result of the interaction with nucleus-restricted hnRNP C1. Instead, the S25 mRNA nuclear retention is unique by the lack of involvement of hnRNP A1 and by its shuttle mechanism of mRNA export. The hnRNP literature suggest that there is a struggle between RNA-binding proteins that are nuclear-restricted and nuclear export-competent (18Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both protein forms bind transcripts in which the nuclear-retained form is released from the mRNP prior to export, and the shuttling form remains part of the complex during export through the pore and association with the polysomes. The mechanism leading to the retention of S25 mRNA within the nucleus could be a result of the starvation-induced binding of p53, MTF-1, and La proteins along with the hnRNP C to make the S25 mRNA export incompetent. Alternatively, the addition of hnRNP A to the mRNP complex might be essential to signal the export competency and/or to remove the nuclear retention signal, namely hnRNP C from the complex. Under starvation conditions, the association of p53, MTF-1, and La with the S25 mRNA might interfere with the binding of hnRNP A, thus obstructing the export signal. To further investigate the role of p53 in our model system, the rat hepatoma cell line H5, which contains mutant p53, was evaluated for changes in S25 expression under conditions of nutrient deprivation. The H5 cells compared with the p53 wild-type H4IIE rat hepatoma parental line do not express functional p53 as demonstrated by the absence of p53-dependent induction of p21 and methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and by the failure of p53-dependent cell cycle blockage upon ionizing radiation (19Grombacher R. Eichhorn U. Kaina B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Within our 9-h time period of amino acid starvation, Fao cells undergo little or no change in morphology in overall protein or RNA synthesis rates or in the levels of p53 expression compared with fed Fao cells (Fig. 2A). Examination of S25 expression in these cells compared with the parent H4IIE showed that the RNA level was not increased upon starvation (Fig.3), and consequently no nuclear retention of the mRNA is realized. Therefore, a functional p53 protein is not only implicated in the nuclear retention of the S25 mRNA but very well may be involved in its initial transcriptional up-regulation observed with the stress condition. There is no change in the AS expression characteristics in the H5 compared with Fao or H4IIE cells in which increased AS mRNA levels are observed in amino acid-starved versus fed cells (Fig. 3). In addition, no AS mRNA is associated with the nuclear-retained RNA-protein complex in starved Fao cells (Fig. 2C). These observations taken together suggest that the signaling for AS up-regulation in response to amino acid starvation is p53-independent and by a different mechanism than observed in S25 regulation. Ribosomal protein S25 has been found to play a growth-suppressive role in the nonproliferating liver, but its expression is reduced during liver regeneration (20Sun D. Kar S. Carr B.I. Cancer Lett. 1995; 89: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the suggestion was that S25 expression is reduced during cell growth and increased during cell death. Recent studies looking at increased gene expression associated with the apoptotic process identified ribosomal protein S25 as one of the up-regulated genes in the apoptotic pathway leading to primary spermatocyte cell death (9Wang W. Chapin R.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 56: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Sun D. Kar S. Carr B.I. Cancer Lett. 1995; 89: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a programmed process and is thought to involve orderly changes in gene expression (21Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), therefore, any involvement of S25 at the early stage of this process might suggest some pivotal role. In an attempt to understand the relationship between S25 expression and the induction of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and S25 protein levels were determined throughout the starvation process. DNA fragmentation analysis confirmed that prolonged amino acid starvation induces apoptosis in Fao and H4IIE cells, which also now exhibit increased levels of S25 protein (Fig.4). The p53-deficient H5 cells show no induction of apoptosis or increase in S25 protein levels under the prolonged starvation (Fig. 4). These observations strongly suggest that the induced apoptosis and increased S25 protein levels are p53-mediated. The overall logic for the selection of factors p53, MTF-1, and La by the cell to exert this stringent control of the expression of S25 protein remains to be elucidated. MTF-1 has been shown to be impacted by oxidative stress (22Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), hypoxia (23Murphy B.J. Andrews G.K. Bittel D. Discher D.J. McCue J. Gren C.J. Yanovsky M. Giaccia A. Sutherland R.M. Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1315-1322PubMed Google Scholar), and essential for metal ion regulation of metallothionein gene expression in which MTF-1 serves as an intracellular zinc sensor to activate metallothionein gene expression (23Murphy B.J. Andrews G.K. Bittel D. Discher D.J. McCue J. Gren C.J. Yanovsky M. Giaccia A. Sutherland R.M. Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1315-1322PubMed Google Scholar, 24Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The activation of the latent cyotosolic MTF-1 with zinc results in nuclear translocation of MTF-1 followed by increased binding to metal response elements in the metallothionein promoter (25Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9377-9384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, numerous signal transduction pathways apparently interact with the activities of MTF-1 that have resulted in MTF-1 to be considered an essential gene (26Gunes C. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Muller K.H. Lichtlen P. Bluthmann H. Marino S. Aguzzi A. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Under amino acid-starvation conditions, there is no obvious translocation of MTF-1 from the cytosol to the nucleus of the cell (Fig. 2E). The implication would be that the signal for MTF-1 to bind the nuclear-retained S25 mRNA under the conditions of amino acid deprivation is neither metal ion-dependent nor MTF-1 nuclear translocation-dependent and therefore governed by a mechanism independent of its transcriptional regulation of metallothionein that is associated with heavy metal homeostasis or oxidative stress (24Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 27Dalton T.P. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, MTF-1 has not been described previously to have RNA-binding properties or any function that directly involves p53 or La proteins. Our observations preview a new and novel biological function for MTF-1 and increase speculation on its overall significance on gene regulation. The role for the La phosphoprotein in transcription remains somewhat obscure, particularly for binding polymerase II transcripts (28Maraia R.J. Intine R.V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Yet, there are reports of La interacting with ribososmal protein mRNAs mediating the transport of RNAs as a chaperone in post-transcriptional processing, processing transcripts into specific ribonucleoproteins, and a proteolysis-mediated mechanism of La relocation to the cytoplasm during apoptosis (28Maraia R.J. Intine R.V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Carter M.S. Sarnow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28301-28307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Croslo C. Boyl P.P. Loreni F. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Amaldi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2927-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At this point we have no other biochemical information to elucidate the purpose or role of La in the up-regulation and/or nuclear retention of S25 mRNA in response to amino acid starvation. If uncoordinated increased levels of ribosomal protein S25 are involved in the signaling process for initiating apoptosis, exacting control of the increased levels of S25 mRNA would be required to regulate S25 translation and thus precisely determine the ultimate fate of the cell. Replenishment of the cells would reduce S25 mRNA levels and associated retention and allow the expression of the S25 protein to become coordinated with expression levels of the other ribosomal proteins, thus restoring the balance for the translation machinery (8Laine R.O. Shay N.F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, prolonged deprivation of nutrients would result in further deterioration of cellular metabolism, eventually exceeding some critical metabolic threshold for survival and then followed by initiation of pathway(s) leading to programmed cell death. In the proposed mechanistic model, this phase would signal the release of the nuclear accumulated S25 mRNA leading to elevated levels of S25 protein, which we did observe (Fig. 4B), and initiation of yet an undefined role of ribosomal protein S25 in apoptosis (Fig.5). Increased ribosomal protein S25 mRNA levels were reported in adriamycin-resistant HL60 cells without concurrent S25 protein increase (31Li M. Center M.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and common nuclear- and nucleolar-targeting features were observed between S25 protein and the HIV-1 REV protein (32Kubota S. Copeland T.D. Pomeantz R.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1503-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), both examples supporting the premise of a more complex and encompassing regulatory role for this ribosomal protein. Our observations illustrate the biochemical flexibility of p53 and that it engages in a multitude of pathways to mediate metabolic control. Although there is evidence for p53-dependent cross-talk between ribosome biogenesis and the cell cycle (33Pestov D.G. Strezoska A. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4246-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), there are limited examples of the role p53 in gene and cellular growth regulation resulting from its RNA-binding properties or of p53-mediated transcription-independent apoptosis (21, 34–36). The relationship of p53 and S25 mRNA gives an example fulfilling both of these roles and illuminates an unique pathway of cellular regulation involving both survival and programmed death. Therefore, in addition to the previously described S25 nutrient anticipatory-response, we are proposing the identification of a transcription-independent p53-mediated apoptotic process as the second phase of cellular response to the mRNA nuclear retention from nutrient deprivation (See Fig.5).

https://openalex.org/W2076693588,"Bloodfeeding hookworms, which currently infect over a billion people in the developing world, are a leading cause of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and iron deficiency anemia. The major anticoagulant inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa has been identified from the hookworm parasite Ancylostoma ceylanicum using reverse transcription PCR and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. This is the first anticoagulant cloned from a hookworm species for which humans are recognized permissive hosts. Despite ∼50% amino acid similarity, A. ceylanicum anticoagulant peptide 1 (AceAP1) is both immunologically and mechanistically distinct from AcAP5, its homologue isolated from the dog hookworm Ancylostoma caninum. Studies using plasma clotting times and single stage chromogenic assays of factor Xa activity have demonstrated that the recombinant AceAP1 protein is substantially less potent than AcAP5 and that soluble whole worm protein extracts of adult A. ceylanicum possess less anticoagulant activity than extracts ofA. caninum. These values correlate with previously reported differences in bloodfeeding capabilities between these two species of hookworm, suggesting that factor Xa inhibitory activity is predictive of hookworm bloodfeeding capabilities in vivo. These fundamental differences in the mechanism of action and immunoreactivity of the major anticoagulant virulence factors from related Ancylostoma hookworm species may have significant implications for human vaccine development.

Bloodfeeding hookworms, parasitic nematodes of the gastrointestinal tract, remain a leading cause of anemia throughout much of the developing world (1Gilles H.M. Rev. Infect.

Interestingly, recent data suggest that there may be significant structural and mechanistic differences between the canine hookworm factor Xa inhibitor AcAP5 and its homologue from A. ceylanicum (12Harrison L.M.

We report here the cloning and characterization of the major inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa from the human hookworm parasite A. ceylanicum. Evidence from in vitrostudies suggests that A. ceylanicum anticoagulant peptide 1 (AceAP1), despite significant amino acid sequence homology to its counterpart from the dog hookworm A. caninum, is both immunologically and mechanistically distinct. All animal studies were approved by the Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee. The life cycle of A. ceylanicum hookworms was maintained as described previously (13Milstone A.M. Harrison L.M.

Adult hookworm ES products were prepared by incubating live, freshly harvested adult worms in filter-sterilized PBS at 37 °C for 6–8 h.

The resulting PCR products were ligated into the pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) plasmid cloning vector, and One Shot INVαF′Escherichia coli competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the ligation product as per the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid DNA from transformed colonies was sent to the William Keck Biotechnology Laboratory at Yale School of Medicine for nucleotide sequencing. Gene sequences were analyzed for homology to other known sequences using the BLAST algorithm through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. A second PCR using an antisense 3′ TTTT primer (5′ GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT ACT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT 3′) and a 5′ primer designed from known internal sequence (5′ GTG GAA AAT CTG TGA AGA AAT GTG GTC TCA ATG AAA GG 3′) was used to amplify the complete 3′ end of the AceAP1 cDNA. A PCR product of ∼380 bp in length was ligated into the pCR2.1 cloning vector as before and transformed into INVαF′-competent cells. The coding sequence for the predicted mature AceAP1 protein was directionally cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid vector pET28a (Novagen), and the resulting ligation product was used to transform ultra-competent E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Recombinant protein expression was induced in 2-liter cultures by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration = 1 mm) and monitored using immunoblots with an HRP-labeled monoclonal antibody (Sigma) to the polyhistidine sequence present on the amino-terminal of the recombinant AceAP1 fusion protein.

For detection of antibodies against hookworm proteins following natural infection, the membrane was incubated 16 h at 4 °C in PBS, 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 containing a 1:2000 dilution of pooled serum collected from five hamsters that had been followed for 102 days post-infection with 50 third stage (L3)A. ceylanicum larvae (18Cappello M.

The blots were washed as described, and the peroxidase label was detected using the West-Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposure to autoradiography film. For experiments aimed at defining cross-reactive epitopes between the two Ancylostomafactor Xa inhibitors, blots of rAceAP1 and rAcAP5 were probed with purified rabbit polyclonal IgG raised against either rAcAP5 or rAceAP1 (12Harrison L.M.

Inhibitor (HEX, ES, or purified recombinant protein) was added in duplicate to wells containing 20 μl of aPTT FS reagent (Sigma) and 50 μl of normal human plasma. The total volume per well was adjusted to 80 μl with sterile PBS. After incubating for 15 min at 37 °C, 20 μl of 50 mm CaCl2 was added to each well to initiate the clotting reaction. Absorbance readings at 630 nm (A 630) were obtained every 7 s for 3 min using a Dynex MRX HD kinetic microplate reader (Dynex Laboratories, Chantilly, VA). Under these conditions, plots ofA 630 versus time (in seconds) demonstrated a highly reproducible sigmoid-shaped curve. By using the software provided with the microplate reader (Revelation 2.2), the aPTT clotting time result was defined as the time (in seconds) at which clot formation was initiated. The linear increase in clotting time with inhibitor concentration was then used to derive the concentration of rAceAP1 that causes a doubling of the aPTT clotting time. This doubling time concentration has been used previously to measure the potency of recombinant hookworm anticoagulants (5Cappello M. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P. Huang S. Hotez P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

After addition of the appropriate chromogenic substrate, the rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm(mA/min) over 5 min using a kinetic microplate reader. The final concentrations (200 μl of total volume) of enzymes/substrates were as follows: human coagulation factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories) 250 pm/S2765 (DiaPharma) 250 μm; human α-thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories) 1 nm/S2238 (DiaPharma) 250 μm; human kallikrein (Hematologic Technologies, Burlington, VT) 5 nm/S2302 (Diapharma) 250 μm; human factor XIIa (Hematologic Technologies) 5 nm/S2302 (Diapharma) 250 μm; α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) 3 nm/Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Bachem) 200 μm; pancreatic elastase (Sigma) 1.5 nm/Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-p-nitroanilide (Bachem) 250 μm. Initial results were expressed as percent inhibition using the following formula: percent inhibitory activity = (1 − inhibited rate/uninhibited rate) × 100. Inhibitory activity against the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex was measured using the Actichrome TF Activity Assay kit (American Diagnostica, Inc., Greenwich, CT) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Factor Xa (final concentration 500 pm) activity was assayed using the substrate S2765 (DiaPharma, final concentration 125 μm). The inhibitor concentration ranged between 0 and 300 nm for rAceAP1 or 0 and 2.5 nm for rAcAP5. Initial reaction velocities (mA/min at 405 nm) were determined using the platereader software, after which the experimental data (initial velocity versus inhibitor concentration) were subjected to nonlinear least squares regression using two independent software packages, SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.) and DYNAFIT (BioKin Ltd., Pullman, WA).

The soluble lysate from an induced cell pellet contained an activity that prolonged the aPTT clotting time of human plasma and inhibited the catalytic activity of coagulation factor Xa using a single stage chromogenic activity. The rAceAP1 protein was then purified to homogeneity using nickel resin affinity chromatography and rpHPLC. Individual protein fractions eluted from the C18rpHPLC column were tested for activity using the aPTT clotting time assay and single stage chromogenic assays of factor Xa inhibition. A single protein fraction contained both inhibitory activities, and this material was subjected to ESMS to determine its molecular mass and degree of purity. ESMS revealed a single major protein species with a mass of 13,311 Da, which corresponds to the predicted mass of the translated AceAP1/pET28 fusion protein cDNA (13,306 Da). Previous studies using a polyclonal IgG raised against the dog hookworm anticoagulant rAcAP5 demonstrated species-specific neutralizing activity (12Harrison L.M. Cordova J.L. Cappello M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This purified IgG, although effective at neutralizing the anticoagulant activity of soluble extracts from A. caninum, failed to neutralize the comparable activities from extracts of adult A. ceylanicum. In light of the significant amino acid sequence homology between the two anticoagulants, we probed immunoblots of both rAcAP5 and rAceAP1 with the α-rAcAP5 or α-rAceAP1 polyclonal IgG to determine the degree to which shared epitopes might be identified in these two functionally related proteins. As shown in Fig.3, the polyclonal α-rAcAP5 IgG failed to recognize rAceAP1. Likewise, the α-rAceAP1 IgG appropriately recognized rAceAP1 but not rAcAP5. These data suggest that the two proteins share no prominent immunoreactive epitopes. Pooled serum collected from hamsters 102 days following infection with 50 third stage larvae of A. ceylanicum (18Cappello M. Clyne L.P. McPhedran P. Hotez P.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 1474-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) contains antibodies that recognize rAceAP1 by immunoblot (Fig.4). This pooled post-infection sera also recognized multiple protein bands present in adult A. ceylanicum ES products and HEX. Among those proteins recognized in ES and HEX is a prominent band with an estimated mass of 8–10 kDa, which is the predicted size of the native AceAP1 protein (9626 Da). Importantly, sera collected from animals prior to hookworm infection failed to recognize rAceAP1 or any of the hookworm proteins present in soluble extracts or ES products of A. ceylanicum (data not shown). These data suggest that hamsters are exposed to AceAP1 during the course of natural infection and that the native protein is sufficiently immunogenic to stimulate a specific IgG response. The anticoagulant activity of the purified rAceAP1 protein was characterized using a microtiter plate based aPTT clotting time assay. Increasing amounts of purified rAceAP1 caused a concentration-dependent prolongation in the time to clot formation, as measured by A 630. As shown in Fig.5 A, a plot of the aPTT clotting time versus rAceAP1 concentration demonstrates that the anticoagulant effect of the recombinant protein is linear within a concentration range of 20–100 nm. Linear regression analysis was then used to derive the concentration of rAceAP1 that causes a doubling of the aPTT clotting time (5Cappello M. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P. Huang S. Hotez P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6152-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Stanssens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L. Laroche Y. Huang S. Maki S. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Cappello M.

Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on extrapolation from the curve shown in Fig. 5 A, the doubling time concentration of rAceAP1 was estimated to be 73 nm. Similar analysis of the data shown in Fig. 5 B reveals that the doubling time concentration of rAcAP5 in this assay is 560 pm, suggesting that the anticoagulant from A. caninum is more than 100-fold more potent (560 pm versus 73 nm) in the aPTT assay than rAceAP1 from A. ceylanicum. The purified rAceAP1 protein was then tested for inhibition of a panel of coagulation proteases using a single stage chromogenic assay. The purified rAceAP1 was found to inhibit the catalytic activity of human factor Xa, with no effect on thrombin, kallikrein, or coagulation factor XIIa. In addition, the rAceAP1 protein also failed to inhibit factor VIIa/tissue factor using a commercially available kit assay. Single stage chromogenic assays using serine proteases not involved in coagulation revealed that rAceAP1 has no inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin or pancreatic elastase. The initial velocities from inhibition of factor Xa by purified rAceAP1 and rAcAP5 are shown in Fig. 6. In the first round of statistical analyses, the initial velocities from factor Xa inhibition were fit to the Morrison equation (3Hotez P.J. Pritchard D.I. Sci.

The solid curve in Fig. 6 a represents the least squares fit of rAcAP5/factor Xa data to Equation 3, which yielded a best fit value for the apparent inhibition constant (K i (app)) of 0.19 ± 0.01 nm. Because rAcAP5 is a competitive inhibitor of factor Xa (6Stanssens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L. Laroche Y. Huang S. Maki S. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Cappello M. Hotez P.J. Lasters I.

In Fig. 6 a, the experimental data and the theoretical curve, based on Equation 3 and Scheme 1, are in close agreement. In contrast, the least squares fit of inhibitory data for rAceAP1 to Equation 3, represented by the dashed curve in Fig.6 b, suggests that the mechanistic Scheme 1 on which Equation3 is based does not fit the experimental data. A corresponding linearized plot (a modification of the Dixon plot) is shown as asolid straight line in Fig. 6 c (rAcAP5) and adashed straight line in Fig. 6 d (rAceAP1).

Identification of potent, orally active, small molecule inhibitors of the extracellular binding of these co-stimulatory molecules faces a number of thermodynamic challenges common to protein-protein interactions between opposing cell surfaces. Principally, these present obstacles to identifying inhibitors with sufficient binding kinetics (slow enough off-rates) to compete effectively.

Med. 1997; 185: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), each of the other challenges mentioned above for inhibiting protein-protein interactions applies to small molecule antagonism of CD28 binding to the B7s as well. Consequently, the small molecule binding site on human B7.1 identified here may represent an exceptional, albeit challenging opportunity. In a high throughput screen we identified a number of inhibitors of B7.1/CD28 binding, two classes of which were studied further. Equilibrium dialysis demonstrated that these compounds bound specifically to human B7.1 at a common site. Occupancy of this site by the inhibitors blocked B7.1 binding not only to CD28, but also to CTLA4, although at much higher concentrations of inhibitors. Mapping of the binding of these small molecules then located this unique site to the GFCC′C“ face of the N-terminal V-set domain of human B7.1, very near to the site of its interactions with counter receptors. Production and characterization of antibodies to human B7.1 (EW3.1F1 and EW3.3B5), B7.1-Fc chimeras (including domain swaps and point mutants), and CTLA4- Fc were as described previously (23Stamper C.C.

F. Tobin, and D. V. Erbe (2001), submitted for publication. CD28-Fc was produced similarly and kindly provided by Drs. James Wilhelm and Pranab Chanda. Fab fragments of the 1F1 antibody were made by digestion with papain and purified by protein-A affinity chromatography. The affinity of the Fab fragments for human B7.1 were determined with a BIAcore 2000 by surface plasmon resonance measurements using immobilized human B7.1. A calculated K d was obtained by first determining the dissociation rate constant, k off, and then the association rate constant, k on.k off was determined by fitting the data contained in the dissociation phase of the sensorgram to a monoexponential decay function. k on was determined by fitting the data contained in the associations phase of the sensorgram to the integrated rate equation using the calculatedk off.

The detection complex was formed as follows: B7.1-Fc-biotin, prepared using NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce 21335) according to the manufacturer's instructions (4.1 mol of biotin/mol of Fc) was added at 0.8 μg/ml to streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Caltag SA1008) at 1:1000 in TBS. Inhibitors or Me2SO (1% final) were added to this complex and incubated 30 min at 22 °C. Detection complex (± inhibitors) was then added to the CD28-coated wells for 25 min at 22 °C, washed five times with TBS, developed with the colorimetric substrate pNPP (Pierce 34045) in diethanolamine/MgCl2 buffer (pH 9.5) and read at 405 nm. The high throughput screen for antagonists used this CD28/B7.1 ELISA in an automated format to test the Wyeth Research library of proprietary compounds, a collection resulting from both historical in-house synthetic efforts as well as compounds acquired from commercial and academic sources. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Tris-buffered saline dimethyl sulfoxide p-nitrophenyl phosphate Chinese hamster ovary Wells were coated with 300 ng of CTLA4-Fc in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 1 h at 22 °C, and then washed three times in TBS prior to assay. B7.1-Fc-biotin was added at 0.5 μg/ml with or without inhibitors for various time points before washing five times in TBS. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase at 1:1000 in TBS was then added for 1 h for detection, followed by washing and color development with pNPP as above. For the antibody washout experiments, after washing out unbound B7.1-Fc-biotin, anti-B7.1-blocking antibody 1F1 was added at 10 μg/ml for various times prior to re-wash and detection with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. Dialysis experiments were performed in teflon microdialysis chambers from Amicon by dissolving compounds and proteins in phosphate-buffered saline and placing each on opposite sides of a 5,000 molecular weight cutoff, regenerated cellulose membrane, and allowing to stand 1–3 days. To quantify compound concentrations, an aliquot was removed from each chamber side, an equal volume of acetonitrile/0.15% trifluoroacetic acid was added, followed by vortexing and spinning at 12,000 g to pellet precipitated protein. Supernatant samples were loaded onto a monomeric C18 column from VYDAC (cat. 238TP54) equilibrated with water/0.15% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min and eluted with a 30-min gradient from 0 to 90% acetonitrile/0.15% trifluoroacetic acid. Absorbance was monitored at various wavelengths and comparedversus standards for quantification of the integrated peaks. Unless otherwise indicated, proteins were used at 10 μmwith compounds at 5 μm prior to any binding equilibria. All solutions contained 1% Me2SO. For antibody blocking experiments, each monoclonal was added at a molar excess to each side of the dialysis membrane. For the small molecule competition experiments, dialysis chambers with B7.1-Fc and compound 1 were equilibrated as above along with a 14-fold molar excess of compound 2. Aliquoted samples from each chamber were then extracted in CH2Cl2 to separate compound 1 from compound 2 (which remains in the aqueous phase). The CH2Cl2 was then evaporated, and the compound 1 was dissolved in Me2SO and loaded onto the C18column for quantification as before. Stable CHO cell lines were established expressing full-length human B7.1 or CD28. CHO/CD28 cells were grown to confluence and washed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to assay. CHO/B7.1 cells were harvested by incubating with EDTA, scraping and washing in assay buffer (Hanks'-buffered saline solution + 2% fetal calf serum). CHO/B7.1 cells were then labeled with 5 μmCalcein AM (Molecular Probes, cat. C-3099) for 20 min at 37 °C, washed in assay buffer, and re-suspended at 106 cells/ml. Labeled CHO/B7.1 cells were incubated with inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C, added to plates of confluent CHO/CD28 cells, and incubated 30 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. Plates were then gently washed with assay buffer by pipetting and aspirating. Bound fluorescent cells were quantified by exciting at 485 nm and measuring the resulting emission at 530 nm. In a screen for antagonists of the binding of CD28 to B7.1, a number of compounds were identified, which reversibly inhibited this interaction with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Two of these, compound 1 (IC50 = 60 ± 17 nm) and compound 2 (IC50 = 30 ± 6 nm) whose structures are shown in Fig. 1, were selected for further characterization. Equilibrium dialysis employing various receptor-Fc chimeras was used to establish the binding partner and specificity for each compound. As shown in Fig.2, compound 1 is selectively enriched only in the presence of the human B7.1-Fc protein. No binding to CD28-Fc, CTLA4-Fc, B7.2-Fc or a control IgG1 Fc was detected. Importantly, this compound also did not bind to mouse B7.1-Fc. An identical binding pattern with these proteins was seen for the second compound, compound 2 (not shown). Thus, these two compounds appear to bind specifically to human B7.1 and not to the very related mouse B7.1 homolog. These results were confirmed by inhibition experiments in which neither compound inhibited CD28's interaction with B7.2 or mouse B7.1 when tested by ELISA at concentrations as high as 10 μm (not shown).Figure 2Compound 1 binds only to human B7.1.Equilibrium dialysis measurements of compound 1 binding to various Fc fusions is shown as fold enrichment with the protein side of each membrane compared with the buffer-alone side (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because these small molecules do not bind the mouse B7.1 protein, their binding epitopes can be mapped based upon amino acid differences between the two species, as was recently reported for a small molecule that binds to the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1 R) (25Tibaduiza E.C. Chen C. Beinborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37787-37793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, one can use the known binding epitopes of antibodies to human B7.1 to explore small molecule binding as was done for an LFA-1 antagonist (17Kelly T.A. Jeanfavre D.D. McNeil D.W. Woska J.R., Jr. Reilly P.L. Mainolfi E.A. Kishimoto K.M. Nabozny G.H. Zinter R. Bormann B.-J. Rothlein R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5173-5177PubMed Google Scholar). We had previously constructed human-mouse mutant B7.1 chimeras in which mouse residues were substituted for their human counterparts in the human B7.1-Fc chimera background. 1S. Wang, M. Stahl, Y. Xing, J. F. Tobin, and D. V. Erbe (2001), submitted for publication.These were then used to map the binding epitopes for an entire panel of blocking antibodies to the GFCC′C“ face of the N-terminal V-set domain of human B7.1. 1S. Wang, M. Stahl, Y. Xing, J. F. Tobin, and D. V. Erbe (2001), submitted for publication. Fig. 3 shows the results when these reagents are employed in equilibrium dialysis experiments with each of the small molecules. Compound 1 appears to bind to the N-terminal V-set domain of human B7.1. One sees binding with a construct containing the human V-set domain fused to the mouse C1-set domain (hVmC1) and not with a construct containing the mouse V-set domain fused to the human C1-set domain (mVhC1) (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, preincubation of human B7.1-Fc in the presence of an antibody specific for the V-set domain prevented binding of compound 1, whereas preincubation with a C1-set domain-specific antibody had no effect (Fig. 3 A). As seen in Fig.3 B, compound 2 also appears to bind the V-set domain, one again sees binding with hVmC1 and not with mVhC1. The human B7.1 V-set domain appears to be sufficient for binding of compound 2 because a construct consisting of only this domain fused directly to the IgG1 Fc gives enrichment in the dialysis chamber (Fig. 3 B). In fact, these two small molecules appear to share a binding site within this N-terminal domain of B7.1. A 14-fold molar excess of compound 2 is able to significantly block binding of compound 1 to B7.1 (Fig. 4). This common binding site is shared (at least in part) with the blocking antibody to B7.1 (EW3.1F1), which binds to residues within the two loops T41-I49 and L85-E95 on the GFCC′C“ face of the B7.1 N-terminal IgSF domain as previously reported. 1S. Wang, M. Stahl, Y. Xing, J. F. Tobin, and D. V. Erbe (2001), submitted for publication. Consequently, human B7.1-Fc chimeras with amino acid substitutions in and near these loops were used in dialysis experiments (Fig. 5). Here, we see similar (although not identical) binding patterns for the two small molecules. Compound 1 does not bind a B7.1 chimera with the loop D46-I49 mutated (Fig. 5, M2) nearly as well as wild type B7.1. It also does not bind a construct with the neighboring residue (Trp-50) mutated to alanine (Fig. 5, M3). Compound 2 also shows diminished binding to these two mutants, although not as much. Control mutants away from this region (M1, M4) showed no differences with either small molecule. Importantly, mutation of Trp-50 to Ala in B7.1 also results in loss of binding to both of B7.1's natural ligands (26Fargeas C.A. Truneh A. Reddy M. Hurle M. Sweet R. Sekaly R.-P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating a possible direct overlap in the binding epitopes for both small molecules identified here with CD28 and CTLA4.Figure 5Small molecule binding localizes to distinct loops within human B7.1. Equilibrium binding of compound 1 (black bars) or compound 2 (gray bars) was measured using a panel of mutant B7.1 proteins (M1,M2, M3, M4) and compared with enrichment seen with wild type human B7.1. Amino acid changes present in each B7.1 mutant were as follows: for mutant M1: N19Q, N64Q, N152Q, N177Q, N192Q, N198Q; for mutant M2: D46K, M47L, N48K, I49V; for mutant M3: W84A, and for mutant M4: T101M.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the binding sites for these small molecules appeared to overlap with the proposed sites for both CD28 and CTLA4, their ability to block B7.1's binding to CTLA4-Fc was tested. When tested near their IC50 values for inhibition of CD28 binding, no inhibition of CTLA4 binding to B7.1 in the ELISA by either compound was seen (not shown). This is possibly due to the fact that the dissociation rate constant of CTLA-4 for B7.1 is slower than that of CD28 for B7.1, and could even reflect a difference in stoichiometry if CD28 binds monovalently to B7.1 as opposed to the multivalent binding, which has been demonstrated for CTLA4 (22van der Merwe P.A. Bodian D.L. Daenke S. Linsley P. Davis S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 23Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L.

Davis S.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 51-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, more extensive analysis of small molecule inhibition of B7.1 binding to CTLA4 was pursued at higher concentrations and various time points (Fig. 6). Here, the CTLA4/B7.1 ELISA was used to measure inhibition by compound 1 at various times, and at a concentration of 10 μm, more than 100 times its IC50 for inhibition of CD28 binding to B7.1. One sees clear inhibition at this concentration during early time points (∼65%), which then decreases as the binding is allowed to continue beyond 1 h. Thus, over time, CTLA4 appears to compete more effectively for B7.1 than the small molecule. Control experiments with CD28-Fc showed no such decrease in inhibition over time (not shown). Furthermore, even after 4 h of CLTA4/B7.1 binding in the ELISA, addition of a blocking antibody to B7.1, with a much slower dissociation rate constant, is able to effectively compete with CTLA4 (Fig. 6). Thus, B7.1/CTLA4 binding at these later time points is still at an equilibrium, which the antibody inhibits while the small molecule does not. These data confirm that the small molecule binding site on B7.1 identified here is likely near both the binding sites for CD28 and CTLA4. Blockade of co-stimulatory signals through CD28 and CTLA4 would be expected to have the opposite effect in disease states. So, this difference in potency in inhibition by these small molecule antagonists of B7.1 could provide an advantage if a concentration of inhibitor could be used which would distinguish between CD28 and CTLA4 inhibition. Therefore, we next explored the concentrations of compound 1 needed to inhibit CD28/B7.1 interactions in cell-based assays. In simple adhesion assays using COS cells overexpressing CD28 adhering to cells overexpressing B7.1, no inhibition by compound 1 was seen at concentrations up to 100 μm (TableI). Furthermore, in a variety of assays dependent on B7.1-mediated T cell co-stimulation through CD28, no specific inhibition was seen with compound 1 at up to 10 μm (not shown). As with inhibition of CTLA4 binding by B7.1, this was likely due to the relatively fast off-rate of the small molecule and its inability to compete with the avid interactions between cells. To explore this, we generated a monovalent Fab fragment of the blocking antibody EW3.1F1. This Fab, with a 10 nm K d for B7.1 binding by surface plasmon resonance and a dissociation rate constant 20 times faster than the divalent parent antibody (Fig. 7 A), inhibited CD28/B7.1 binding with an IC50 in this range (3.4 ± 0.3 nm, Table I). We then selected an analog of compound 1, compound 3, which was more than 10-fold more potent in the CD28 ELISA (Table I) with an IC50 of 4 nm. This molecule, whose structure is shown in Fig. 7 B, resulted from a detailed synthesis effort directed at improved potency for CD28/B7.1 inhibition which we have reported separately. 3N. J. Green, J. Xiang, L. Chen, J. Chen, A. Davies, J. Shim, S. Tam, Y. Zhang, D. V. Erbe, and J. F. Tobin (2001), submitted for publication. Importantly, it has an IC50 in the B7.1/CD28 ELISA equivalent to the antibody Fab fragment. When these two reagents are used in a cell-based assay of B7.1/CD28 binding, however, one sees different results. No inhibition by compound 3 is seen at concentrations up to 100 μm, while the Fab fragment inhibits with an IC50 of 900 nm. This shift in potency for the Fab fragment from 3 nm in the ELISA to 900 nmin cells probably reflects the effects of increased avidity present in the cell-based assay. Although the Fab fragment and compound 3 may have similar binding constants for B7.1 (as estimated from their ELISA IC50), the small molecule probably has much faster on- and off-rates. This faster off-rate probably limits its ability to inhibit CD28 interactions in the cellular milieu. (Our attempts to measure this dissociation rate constant of the small molecule for B7.1, indicated an off-rate faster than the limits of the assay (seconds).) Importantly, more sensitive tests may be required to see an effect of these inhibitors in cells, such as examining early signaling events upon stimulation of CD28 by B7.1. 3N. J. Green, J. Xiang, L.

Open table in a new tab Some of the most desirable drug targets may also be the most challenging to inhibit with small molecules: protein-protein interfaces consisting of relatively shallow surfaces without binding sites for small ligands. Although thermodynamically favored hot spots are sometimes used to drive protein-protein binding (29Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), the occurrence of invaginations sufficient for high affinity small molecule binding (30Kuntz I.D. Chen K. Sharp K.A. Kollman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9997-10002Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) may be limited in the protein universe. In fact, although computational methods can identify numerous sites on protein surfaces for potential ligands, very few of these sites are ever seen experimentally, perhaps due to solvent effects (31Ringe D. Mattos C. Med. Res. Rev. 1999; 19: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Miranker A. Karplus M. Proteins. 1991; 11: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 33Goodford P.J. J.

Consequently, recent efforts have sought to permit identification of even low affinity (micromolar to millimolar) ligands for proteins that can then be systematically optimized (and even combined) for improved affinity (24Erlanson D.A. Braisted A.C. Raphael D.R. Randal M. Stroud R.M. Gordon E.M. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 28Shuker S.B. Hajduk P.J. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). The results of such efforts emphasize the challenges to small molecule intervention at protein interfaces. Importantly, the results presented here indicate that a small molecule binding pocket does exist on B7.1, one which is sufficient for the binding of at least two classes of small molecules with nanomolar affinities. The evidence indicates that this pocket may be unique among the B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules. This binding site for small molecules on B7.1 maps near its counter receptor binding site, which has been recently characterized by crystallography (23Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of B7.1 alone revealed a protein with an amino-terminal domain with the immunoglobulin V-set topology followed by a membrane proximal domain with C1-set topology (27Ikemizu S.

In contrast to other interacting cell surface molecules, B7.1 binds CTLA4 with a relatively small interface with an unusually high degree of shape complementarity, which accounts for their binding kinetics (11Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22van der Merwe P.A. Bodian D.L. Daenke S. Linsley P. Davis S.J. J. Exp.

Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In the co-crystals with CTLA4, it is only the N-terminal V-set domain of B7.1 that contacts CTLA4 (23Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that this domain of B7.1 also makes all contacts with CD28 for reasons previously outlined (23Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Of particular importance are two surface loops on the GFCC′C“ face of this domain. B7.1/CTLA4 binding is dominated by the loop of CTLA-4 which contains the conserved, hydrophobic MYPPPYY sequence contacting a largely nonpolar surface of B7.1 consisting of Tyr-31, Met-38, Thr-41, Met-43, Val-83, Leu-85, Ala-91, Phe-92, and Leu-97 (23Stamper C.C.

These contacts probably contribute the majority of the binding energy. Specificity at the binding interface is likely added through hydrogen bonding including a dominant one between Glu-33 on CTLA-4 and Arg-29 on B7.1. This region of B7.1 is likely the sole determinant for CD28 and CTLA4 binding, as emphasized by the fact that binding epitopes for an entire panel of blocking antibodies also mapped here. 1S. Wang, M. Stahl, Y. Xing, J. F. Tobin, and D. V. Erbe (2001), submitted for publication. Although the small molecule antagonists appear to bind near this site, upon examination of the structure of B7.1 in this region, no obvious cavity is apparent (see Refs. 23Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar and 27Ikemizu S. Gilbert R.J.C.

It seems possible, therefore, that some surface loop movement creates a cleft or pocket that then permits small molecule binding to occur. Interestingly, binding of the inhibitors to B7.1 is time-dependent (data not shown) and could be explained by a loop movement within B7.1 or an energetic change in the small molecules themselves. It is also of interest to note that the two separate classes of antagonists identified here appear to bind to this same site. Thus, this portion of B7.1 may represent a fortuitous occurrence of a thermodynamically favored small molecule binding site, one which is not present in mouse B7.1 or in human B7.2. These results highlight the importance of this region along the GFCC′C“ face of the V-set domain as the crucial site for B7.1 antagonist design. That the small molecule B7.1 antagonists reported here do not inhibit CD28-mediated co-stimulation in cell-based readouts perhaps indicates the limits of such an approach at blocking high avidity protein-protein complexes. It is possible that through B7.1 co-structures with bound inhibitors, more potent compounds (with slower off-rates) can be synthesized. Such compounds could provide a novel means of inhibiting co-stimulation, yielding an exciting approach to immune modulation in autoimmune disease and graft acceptance in transplantation.

https://openalex.org/W2078424920,"A DNA sequence upstream from the polyhedrin gene of baculovirus Autographa californicanucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) was found to activate strongly the expression of full or minimal promoters derived from AcMNPV and other sources. Promoters tested included the minimal CMV (CMVm) promoter from human cytomegalovirus, the full heat shock 70 promoter fromDrosophila, and the minimal p35 promoter from baculovirus. Deletion and mutagenesis analyses showed that this functional polyhedrin upstream (pu) activator sequence contains three open reading frames (ORFs), ORF4, ORF5, andlef2. In plasmid transfection assays, the pusequence was able to confer high level luciferase expression driven by all of these full or minimal promoters in insect Sf21 cells. A known baculovirus enhancer, the homologous region (hr) of AcMNPV, further enhanced the expression of these promoters. Experiments showed that although multiple hr sequences function in an additive manner, pu and hr together function synergistically, resulting in as much as 18,000-fold promoter activation. Furthermore, a modified CMVm promoter containingpu and/or hr was inserted into the baculovirus genome to drive the luciferase coding region. The CMVm promoter expressed luciferase much earlier, and although it expressed a bit less than did the p10 promoter, the CMVm promoter gave rise to greater luciferase activity. Therefore, we have uncovered a cryptic viral sequence capable of activating a diverse group of promoters. Finally, these experiments demonstrate that synthetic sequences containing pu, hr, and different full or minimal promoters can generate a set of essentially unlimited novel promoters for weak to very strong expression of foreign proteins using baculovirus.

Deletion and mutagenesis analyses showed that this functional polyhedrin upstream (pu) activator sequence contains three open reading frames (ORFs), ORF4, ORF5, andlef2. In plasmid transfection assays, the pusequence was able to confer high level luciferase expression driven by all of these full or minimal promoters in insect Sf21 cells. A known baculovirus enhancer, the homologous region (hr) of AcMNPV, further enhanced the expression of these promoters. Experiments showed that although multiple hr sequences function in an additive manner, pu and hr together function synergistically, resulting in as much as 18,000-fold promoter activation. Furthermore, a modified CMVm promoter containingpu and/or hr was inserted into the baculovirus genome to drive the luciferase coding region. The CMVm promoter expressed luciferase much earlier, and although it expressed a bit less than did the p10 promoter, the CMVm promoter gave rise to greater luciferase activity. Therefore, we have uncovered a cryptic viral sequence capable of activating a diverse group of promoters. Finally, these experiments demonstrate that synthetic sequences containing pu, hr, and different full or minimal promoters can generate a set of essentially unlimited novel promoters for weak to very strong expression of foreign proteins using baculovirus. In a previous study, we established a tetracycline-responsive expression system (TRES) 1The abbreviations used are:TREStetracycline-responsive expression systemAcMNPVAutographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirusCMVmminimal CMV promoterhpihours postinfectionhrhomologous regionLucluciferaseORFopen reading framePCmpromoter contains pu and CMVmPHCmpromoter contains pu, hr, and CMVmPHHpromoter contains pu, hr, and heat shock 70 promoterpupolyhedrin upstream activator sequenceSf21Spodoptera frugiperda celltetOtetracycline operatorTREa sequence containing seven copies of thetetO elementTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl] glycinetTAtetracycline-controllable transactivator in insect cells (1Wu T.Y. Lin D.G. Chen S.L. Chen C.Y. Chao Y.C. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 80: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The insect TRES contains two components. The first component is a plasmid containing the p10 promoter, which drives the tetracycline-controllable transactivator (p10-tTA); the second component is a plasmid containing the tetracycline operator (tetO) DNA sequence fused to a minimal CMV (CMVm) promoter and a reporter luciferase sequence further downstream from the promoter (tetO-CMVm-Luc (2Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar)). The CMVm is a sequence derived from the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (2Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). In the insect TRES, tTA is expressed from a transfected plasmid and binds to the fusedtetO and CMVm (tetO-CMVm) promoter to activate the expression of luciferase. Essentially no luciferase activity can be detected if the second component, tetO-CMVm-Luc, is transfected alone; with cotransfection of the first component (p10-tTA), which expresses tTA, strong luciferase activity can be observed (1Wu T.Y. Lin D.G. Chen S.L. Chen C.Y. Chao Y.C. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 80: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In a previous set of experiments, we found that other than plasmid transfection, the first component, p10-tTA, can also be expressed in a recombinant baculovirus to make the TRES functional (1Wu T.Y. Lin D.G. Chen S.L. Chen C.Y. Chao Y.C. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 80: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study, we tested whether the second component, tetO-CMVm, could be inserted and expressed in the genome of baculovirus for TRES functioning. Surprisingly, although we found that the activity of the full CMV promoter is extremely weak in insect cells (1Wu T.Y. Lin D.G. Chen S.L. Chen C.Y. Chao Y.C. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 80: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the CMVm promoter can be stimulated strongly in the genome of a baculovirus without tTA activation. The strong expression of the CMVm promoter could be seen by either inserting this minimal promoter in the transfer plasmid pAcUW21 (PharMingen) or in the baculovirus genome. We reason that this may be caused by the functioning of some genes or unknown enhancer sequences in the baculovirus genome, and thus the structure and function of these auxiliary sequence are worthy of further investigation. tetracycline-responsive expression system Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus minimal CMV promoter hours postinfection homologous region luciferase open reading frame promoter contains pu and CMVm promoter contains pu, hr, and CMVm promoter contains pu, hr, and heat shock 70 promoter polyhedrin upstream activator sequence Spodoptera frugiperda cell tetracycline operator a sequence containing seven copies of thetetO element N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl] glycine tetracycline-controllable transactivator Baculoviruses consist of a group of viruses that contain circular double-stranded DNA genomes of 90–160 kb (3Blissard G.W. Rohrmann G.F. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1990; 35: 127-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The circular 131-kb DNA genome of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is composed almost entirely of unique DNA sequences, except for several small repeats known as homologous regions (hrs). The hrs, interspersed within the viral genome (4Ayres M.D. Howard S.C. Kuzio J. Lopez-Ferber M. Possee R.D. Virology. 1994; 202: 586-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 5Cochran M.A. Faulkner P. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 961-970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been found to be enhancers for early gene transcription (6Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Guarino L.A. Gonzalez M.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 224-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and as origins of DNA replication (8Kool M. Voeten J.T. Goldbach R.W. Tramper J. Vlak J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2661-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Pearson M. Bjornson R. Pearson G. Rohrmann G. Science. 1992; 257: 1382-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The hrs form a complex directly or indirectly with IE-1, an early viral regulatory protein (10Choi J. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4548-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kovacs G.R. Choi J. Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7429-7437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and with insect cellular proteins (12Guarino L.A. Dong W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3676-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In infection of host insect cells by baculoviruses, three phases of viral gene expression, namely early, late, and very late, can be distinguished (13Morris T.D. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7397-7405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells undergo significant changes during the first 6 h of infection, a time period that constitutes the early phase of infection and precedes viral DNA replication. This early phase is followed by the late phase, a period of extensive viral DNA replication, late gene expression, and budding virus production. The late phase extends from 6 h postinfection (hpi) to ∼20–24 hpi. The very late phase, also known as occlusion-specific phase, begins around 20 hpi. In this phase, the very late gene products, p10 and polyhedrin, are produced in large amounts, and there is a clear microscopic indication of the formation of inclusion bodies. The baculovirus expression vector system is one of the most popular systems for production of recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins are expressed at very high levels under the control of two very late polyhedrin and p10 promoters (11Kovacs G.R. Choi J. Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7429-7437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Guarino L.A. Dong W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3676-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various sources have suggested that the expression from a very late promoter is 10–20-fold (13Morris T.D. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7397-7405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 50-fold (14Jarvis D.L. Weinkauf C. Guarino L.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) stronger than that from an early promoter or from an insect promoter. However, the cellular machinery critical for post-translational processing is generally in a deteriorated condition during the late and very late phases of baculovirus infection. Therefore, the use of early promoters for recombinant protein expression is an alternative approach to improve protein quality, although activities of the currently available early promoters are low compared with those of the very late promoters. In this article, we found that although the full CMV promoter is not functioning properly in insect cells or baculoviruses, by the stimulation of a baculovirus sequence upstream of the polyhedrin gene, the CMVm promoter can be strongly activated. This polyhedrin gene upstream activator sequence contains at least three open reading frames (ORFs) and can strongly enhance the expression of various exogenous and endogenous promoters. Some of these promoters could be activated synergistically by this upstream sequence and hr and become stronger than the p10 promoter in transient expression assays. During the early phase of viral infection, CMVm was expressed strongly in the recombinant baculoviruses. The proteins expressed by the CMVm promoter were much less degraded with an activity better than those produced by the p10 promoter. Thus, this upstream activator sequence is a novel type of activator identified from baculovirus. The Spodoptera frugiperda IPLB-Sf21 (Sf21) cell line was cultured as monolayers in TNM-FH insect medium containing 8% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (15Lee J.C. Chen H.H. Chao Y.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9157-9165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lin J.L. Lee J.C., Li, M.L. Chao Y.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 128-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was used for propagation and infection of wild type AcMNPV. All viral stocks were prepared and titers determined according to the standard protocol described by O'Reilly et al. (17O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). All infections and coinfections of virus AcMNPV were performed using a multiplicity of infection of 1. Plasmids tested for expression of protein tTA or luciferase were transfected into 4 × 104 Sf21 cells seeded in wells of a 96-well plate. Each plasmid at 0.1 μg was transfected using 0.5 μg of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) per well in 50 μl of serum-free TNM-FH according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After transfection for 8–14 h at 27 °C, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl of TNM-FH medium containing 8% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. After incubation at 27 °C for 24 h, wild type AcMNPV at a multiplicity of infection of 1 was added into Sf21 cells to assist the proper expression of the transfected promoters. Luciferase activity was assayed 3 days after infection. Cells of each well were lysed for 10 min in 100 μl of culture cell lysis reagent containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the lysate supernatant (5–50 μl) was incubated in 180 μl of luciferase assay reagent containing 25 mm Tricine (pH 7.8), 15 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. 50 μl of 0.2 mm luciferin (Promega) solution was autoinjected, and relative light units were measured by a luminometer (Berthold, Lumat LB 9501). The concentration of total protein in cell lysate was determined using a Coomassie protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Data (mean ± S.D.) were collected from triplicate assays of three independent transfections or viral infection experiments. Deletion constructs are shown in the various figures together with their activity assays. All PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The CMVm and TRE-CMVm promoters were originally constructed by Gossen and Bujard (2Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The CMVm promoter encompasses the sequence from +75 to −53 of the full CMV promoter, and the TRE-CMVm promoter contains seven copies of the 42-bp tetO sequence derived from Tn10 which are fused to the CMVm promoter (2Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The luciferase coding sequence from the pTRE-Luc plasmid (bp positions 507–2187, CLONTECH), driven by CMVm or TRE-CMVm promoters, was inserted into pAcUW21 (PharMingen, Fig. 1) to replace the p10promoter originally located in this plasmid. The resulting plasmids were named pAPcmL and pAPtcmL, respectively (Fig. 1). The same luciferase coding sequence from the pTRE-Luc plasmid was also cloned into pAcUW21 under the control of the p10 promoter of AcMNPV in the plasmid pAcUW21, and the resulting plasmid was named pAP10L (Fig. 1). The full CMV promoter derived from pTet-Off (from bp positions 68 to 673, CLONTECH) together with the luciferase coding region were inserted into pAcUW21 in place of thep10 promoter, and the resulting plasmid was named pAPcL (Fig. 1). The coding region of the tTA transactivator protein, from plasmid pTet-Off (CLONTECH) was cloned into pAcUW21 under control of the p10 promoter, and the resulting plasmid was named pAP10T (Fig. 1). The polyhedrin gene (polh) downstream sequences were deleted from plasmid pAPcmL (see Fig.3 A), and the resulting plasmid was named pAPcmLΔpd (see Fig. 3 B). Plasmid pAPcmLΔpd (see Fig. 3 B) was generated by first digesting pAPcmL (see Fig. 3 A) with AlwNI, blunt ending it with T4 DNA polymerase, and then cutting it withXhoI. The resulting fragment was subcloned intoXhoI-SmaI-digested plasmid pBluescript (pBSKSM+, Stratagene). Plasmid pAPcmLΔpdu (see Fig.3 B) contains only partial polyhedrin gene upstream sequences. This deletion construct was obtained by digesting pAPcmL (see Fig. 3 B) with BstXI, blunt ending it with T4 DNA polymerase, then further digesting it with XhoI, followed by subcloning this BstXI-XhoI-digested fragment into XhoI-SmaI-digested pBSKSM+ (see Fig. 3 B). Plasmids pAPcmLΔpu1 to pAPcmLΔpu7 were constructed for deletion analysis of the pu sequence (see Fig. 3 C). The pAPcmLΔpu1 was made by MluI digestion followed by self-ligation of pAPcmL. Plasmids pAPcmLΔpu2 and pAPcmLΔpu3 were generated by cutting pAPcmL with MluI and BglII and then ligating, respectively, with a 5′-MluI/3′-BglII PCR-amplified product containing pAPcmL nucleotides 1877–2562 and 2218–2562 (see Fig. 3 C). Plasmid pAPcmLΔpu4 was constructed by cutting pAPcmL withMluI and BglII, blunt ending with T4 DNA polymerase, and re-ligating with T4 DNA ligase. To generate pAPcmLΔpu5 and pAPcmLΔpu6, pAPcmL was digested with MluI and BglII, and respectively ligated with the 5′-MluI/3′-BglII PCR-amplified product containing pAPcmL nucleotides 546–883 and 546–1198 (see Fig. 3 C). Plasmid pAPcmLΔpu7 was constructed by digesting pAPcmL withBstXI and BglII, blunt ending with T4 DNA polymerase, and re-ligating with T4 DNA ligase. The ORF603 deletion construct pAPcmLΔ603 was generated by partial digestion of pAPcmL with MluI and complete digestion withBglII followed by blunt ending and re-ligation. Plasmid pAPcmLΔ4–5 was produced from pAPcmLΔpd first by MluI partial digestion and then BglII complete digestion followed by blunt ending and re-ligation. The derived plasmid (pBSKcmL), which lacks ORF603, was digested further with NotI (in multiple cloning sites at the 3′-end of ORF4) and partially cut withMluI. These restriction sites were further blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase, re-ligated, and resulted in deletion of ORF4 and part of the 5′-end of ORF5. This resulted plasmid pAPcmLΔ4–5. 3′-MluI and 5′-blunt ends were introduced into two PCR-generated fragments from pAPcmL containing nucleotides 377–626 and 183–626 (Fig. 3 C). Subcloning these intoNotI/blunt ended and MluI-digested pBSKcmL produced the ORF4 deletion constructs of pAPcmLΔ41 and pAPcmLΔ42, respectively. To test the role played by ORF5 alone, a frameshift mutation was introduced into this ORF in plasmid pAPcmLΔpd. The dinucleotide GC was inserted at positions 20 and 21 from the translational initiation site of the ORF5 (original sequence: ATGTATCGCACGTCAAGAATT; after GC insertion: ATGTATCGCACGTCAAGAAGCTT) to create a frameshift mutation. The plasmid carrying this frameshift mutation was named pAPpu-5FcmL (see Fig. 3 C). All plasmids described in this paragraph are listed in Fig. 3. Fragment cmL was derived from pTRE-Luc (CLONTECH) containing only the CMVm promoter and a luciferase coding sequence (Fig. 3). To produce pApu(D)cmL (Fig. 4), pAPcmLΔ603 (see Fig. 3 C) was digested withAlwNI, blunt ended, and then cut with XhoI (forAlwNI and XhoI sites, see Fig. 3 A). The resulting fragment was subcloned intoXhoI-SmaI-digested pBSKSM+(Stratagene). pApu(U)cmL (Fig. 4) was generated by inserting a 5′-AatII/3′-XhoI pu fragment amplified by PCR containing the full-length ORF4, ORF5, and lef2 intoAatII-XhoI-digested pcmL (Fig. 1). The (D) and (U) indicate that the pu sequence is located downstream or upstream, respectively, from the CMVm promoter. All plasmids constructed as described in the following paragraph are listed in Fig. 8. Construction of plasmid pAPhcmL is described below. AnXhoI-digested hr1 PCR fragment (4Ayres M.D. Howard S.C. Kuzio J. Lopez-Ferber M. Possee R.D. Virology. 1994; 202: 586-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 18Lee J.C. Chao Y.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2293-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was cloned into pcmL to generate phcmL. Using PCR, a fragment containing hr1-CMVm promoter-luc was produced from phcmL and ligated into pAPtcmL, which had been digested by XhoI and EcoRV to remove thetet operators, CMVm promoter, and luc gene. This resulted in pAPhcmL. Plasmid phL was constructed from plasmid pTRE-Luc (CLONTECH) by removing aXhoI-BamHI fragment containing tetoperators and the CMVm promoter and replacing with an hsp70promoter from pKih35hN (18Lee J.C. Chao Y.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2293-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A PCR fragment that contains the 457-bp hr1 region (4Ayres M.D. Howard S.C. Kuzio J. Lopez-Ferber M. Possee R.D. Virology. 1994; 202: 586-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 18Lee J.C. Chao Y.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2293-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was generated from AcMNPV genomic DNA by PCR using primers carrying XhoI site at both ends. The fragment was ligated in front of the hsp70promoter in phL to generate phhL. Primers to 5′ ofhr1 and 3′ of SV40 poly(A) of the luc gene in phhL were used to generate a blunt ended PCR product containing hr1-hsp70-luc. The product was ligated into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) to generate an intermediate plasmid pCRhhL, from which the fragment containinghr1-hsp70-luc was obtained by digestion and then ligated into pAcUW21 (PharMingen) to generate pAPhhL. Using the megaprimer PCR technique (19Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 173-182PubMed Google Scholar), a 45-bp minimal p35promoter (20Rodems S.M. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5776-5785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) fused to the luc gene was generated from AcMNPV genomic DNA and pTRE-Luc. The product was cloned into pCR-Blunt vector to yield p35ml. An XhoI-digested hr1 fragment was cloned into the XhoI site in front of the minimal p35 promoter to yield ph35ml. A fragment containing hr1, minimal p35 promoter, and theluc gene was obtained from ph35ml byApaI digestion, blunt ended, and cloned into pAcUW21 to generate pAPh35ml. All PCR-generated fragments mentioned above were verified by sequencing. Protein samples, at 0.1 μg each, were fractionated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a Hyperbond P membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TTBS: 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking on an orbital shaker. The membrane was incubated with 1:5,000 diluted anti-luciferase antibody (Cortex Biochem) in TTBS overnight at room temperature. Unbounded antibodies were removed by two 15-min washes and two 5-min washes in fresh TTBS buffer at room temperature with shaking. Then the membrane was incubated with 1:2,500 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After removing the unbound secondary antibody by the same washes in TTBS buffer as described above, protein bands bound by the antibody were visualized by developing the membrane using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In the present study, the baculovirus transfer plasmid pAcUW21 (PharMingen) was the primary plasmid used for further constructions. This plasmid contains an intact polyhedrin gene and ap10 promoter; both the gene and the promoter are sandwiched between lateral DNA fragments adjacent to the polyhedrin gene of the baculovirus. In Fig. 1, the luciferase coding region, as driven by the CMV, p10, CMVm, and tetO-CMVm promoters, was cloned into plasmid pAcW21 to result in plasmids pAPcL, pAP10L, pAPcmL, and pAPtcmL, respectively. The resultant recombinant viruses were termed vAPcL, vAP10L, vAPcmL, and vAPtcmL, respectively. The promoterp10 was also used to drive tTA to yield plasmid pAP10T and virus vAP10T. Finally, plasmid pTRE-Luc (CLONTECH) was used as a necessary control. This is a plasmid that lacks any baculovirus sequence, and the tetO-CMVm promoter is used to drive the luciferase coding region. Previously, we showed that luciferase activity is extremely low when pTRE-Luc is transfected into insect cells, but it can be strongly stimulated by coinfection with vAP10T (1Wu T.Y. Lin D.G. Chen S.L. Chen C.Y. Chao Y.C. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 80: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, we found that when the tetO-CMVm promoter was inserted into plasmid pAcUW21, resulting in the plasmid pAPtcmL (Fig. 1), the luciferase activity could be increased without stimulation by tTA. More interestingly, luciferase activity was further highly stimulated upon coinfection with wild type AcMNPV (Fig. 2 A). Viral stimulation of luciferase expression remained for the plasmid pAPcmL (Fig. 2 A). The only difference between plasmids pAPtcmL and pAPcmL is the omission of a tetO sequence in plasmid pAPcmL (Fig. 1). These experiments showed that although thetetO element did not influence luciferase expression by the CMVm promoter (in pAPtcmL, Fig. 2 A), a short CMVm promoter sequence (in pAPcmL) could give rise to strong luciferase expression in the presence of baculovirus lateral fragments surrounding the polyhedrin promoter. Contrarily, a longer sequence containing a full CMV promoter (in pAPcL) blocked its high level expression. In addition to not being expressed by plasmid transfection (Fig. 2 A), the full CMV promoter was also only weakly expressed upon infection of recombinant baculovirus, regardless of the presence of the same baculovirus lateral fragments (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the viral activation appeared to be restricted to a short CMVm promoter sequence and required the presence the of polyhedrin gene lateral DNA fragments of the baculovirus (Figs. 1 and 2). To determine whether viral activation of the CMVm promoter only occurs in the plasmids or can also occur in the genome of the virus, we further tested luciferase expression by infection of recombinant viruses vAPcL, vAPtcmL, vAPcmL, and vAP10L. In order not to miss clones with particularly high levels of luciferase expression, multiple clones of separate recombinant viral constructs were isolated, and the activities of promoters in different clones were tested individually. All three tested individual vAPcL clones only expressed weak luciferase activities. However, all individual vAPtcmL, vAPcmL, and vAP10L clones gave rise to strong luciferase activities (Fig.2 B). The stimulation was obviously not related to the TRES machinery because the luciferase activity of vAPtcmL infection was neither further stimulated by the coinfection of vAP10T nor significantly suppressed upon the addition of tetracycline (Fig.2 C). To identify the viral DNA sequences responsible for the activation of the CMVm promoter, viral lateral fragments appearing in the transfer vector were deleted separately using convenient sites. According to genetic computer group (GCG) comparison, pAPcmL (Fig. 3 A) contains seven baculovirus genes and ORFs that flank the CMVm promoter. To investigate the roles of specific baculovirus genes or sequences in the activation of CMVm promoter activity in baculoviruses, two deletion plasmids were first constructed. The polyhedrin and the downstream genes were deleted, which resulted in pAPcmLΔpd. With further deletion of all or part of ORF4, ORF5, and lef2, a new construct, pAPcmLΔpdu, resulted. The full luciferase activity in cells transfected with pAPcmL followed by AcMNPV infection was used to normalize the luciferase activity (as 100%) of the deleted plasmid constructs. High luciferase activity remained in the transfection of plasmid pAPcmLΔpd, suggesting that the polyhedrin downstream sequence is not critical for the activation of the CMVm promoter (Fig.3 B). The construct pAPcmLΔpdu, which contains intact ORF603, failed to support high luciferase expression (Fig.3 B). Therefore, viral sequences upstream of the polyhedrin gene are responsible for activation of CMVm promoter and thus deserve further examination. Results of further deletions in the polyhedrin upstream sequence are shown in Fig. 3 C. All transient expression experiments were done with coinfection of wild type AcMNPV. Because the only difference between plasmids pAPcmLΔpd and pAPcmLΔpdu is the removal of ORF4, ORF5, and lef2 from the former plasmid, these ORFs were further analyzed separately. Plasmids pAPcmLΔpu1, pAPcmLΔpu2, pAPcmLΔpu3, and pAPcmLΔpu4 are constructs that contain ORF4 with a gradual removal of the ORF603 region. Transfection of these plasmids showed that the existence of ORF4 alone has no effect on the activation of the CMVm promoter. Plasmids pAPcmLΔpu5, pAPcmLΔpu6, pAPcmLΔpu7, and pAPcmLΔ603 are constructs containing a gradual extension of the viral DNA sequence from ORF4 to the lef2 region. Transfection of these constructs showed that plasmid pAPcmLΔ603, the only plasmid that contains all three ORFs (ORF4, ORF5, and lef2), gave rise to full activation of the CMVm promoter. Deletion of ORF4 (pAPcmLΔ4–5, pAPcmLΔ41, and pAPcmLΔ42), or both ORF4 and ORF5 (pAPcmLΔ4–5), from plasmid pAPcmLΔ603, again, completely suppressed the activity of the CMVm promoter. A previous set of experiments showed that the existence of ORF4, ORF5, and lef2 confer full promoter activity. We have also demonstrated that the deletion of individual ORFs, lef2 (pAPcmLΔpu5, pAPcmLΔpu6, pAPcmLΔpu7) or ORF4 (pAP- cmLΔ41), and pAPcmLΔ42 alone, abolished promoter activity. To test the role played by ORF5 alone, a frameshift mutation in this ORF was also constructed. It was found that the promoter activity was abolished without having functional ORF5 (pAPpu-5FcmL, Fig. 3 C). Thus, with viral coinfection, all th"

Through time course analysis, we demonstrate that changes in Cdk4 activity in response to estrogen or antiestrogen treatment do not correlate directly with cyclin D1 protein levels or association. In contrast, Cdk4 activity does correlate with changes in the level of the Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1. Furthermore, we show that extracts of antiestrogen-treated cells contain a factor capable of inhibiting the Cdk4 activity present in extracts of estrogen-treated cells, and immunodepletion experiments identify this factor as p21WAF1/Cip1.

Cdk activation requires association with a cyclin partner as follows: Cdk4/6 associates with D-type cyclins, whereas Cdk2 associates with either cyclin E or cyclin A (16Draetta G.F. Curr. Opin.

Cdk activity can be inhibited by two different families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CdkIs).

Cyclin D binds to Cdk4/6, resulting in an increase in Cdk4/6 kinase activity, pRb phosphorylation, and synthesis of cyclins E and A. Increasing the cellular concentration of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes also provides additional binding targets for p21 and/or p27, thereby titrating these CdkIs from their inhibitory association with Cdk2 complexes (19Parry D.

Although both total Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2 activities are highly regulated, cyclin E protein is expressed at constant levels in estrogen- and antiestrogen-treated MCF-7 cells. The lack of activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes in the presence of antiestrogen is believed to be due to inhibition by p21 and/or p27 (31Planas-Silva M.D. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell.

Although p21 and p27 are found in association with Cdk4, evidence for a physiological role in inhibiting Cdk4 is lacking. The CdkI p21 is reported to be both an activator and an inhibitor of Cdk4, so its function in the regulation of Cdk4 activity by antiestrogen is unclear. In the current report, we investigate the mechanisms by which 17β-estradiol (E2) and the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI) regulate Cdk4 activity in MCF-7 cells. We find that Cdk4 activity is not directly correlated with cyclin D1 protein levels or association. By utilizing an in vitromixing assay, we demonstrate that extracts of ICI-treated cells contain a factor that inhibits the Cdk4 activity present in extracts of estrogen-treated cells and that this inhibitory factor is specifically removed by immunodepletion of p21 but not p27. These studies identify p21 as an important physiological target of antiestrogen action that inhibits Cdk4 in addition to Cdk2 in human breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were obtained from Dr. Michael Johnson of the Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University. They were routinely passaged in improved modified Eagle's medium (BioFluids), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For experiments, cells were cultured in improved modified Eagle's medium without phenol red (BioFluids) containing 5% charcoal-stripped serum (HyClone) and penicillin/streptomycin, with either 10−8m E2 (Sigma) or 10−8m ICI (Astra Zeneca). Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), suspended in PBS + 10% fetal bovine serum, fixed with 80% cold ethanol, and stored at −20 °C. Prior to analysis, cells were washed twice with PBS and then suspended in PBS + 1 mg/ml RNase A, 0.2 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then analyzed for red fluorescence on a FACSVantage flow cytometer; cell cycle distribution was determined using ModFit software. Three 60-mm plates were analyzed for each time point. Immunoprecipitations (IP) and Cdk4 activity measurements were performed using a modification of a published method (41Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, all manipulations were carried out on ice. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping in PBS and pelleted; the pellets were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until the day of analysis. Cells were resuspended and lysed by sonication in IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNaVO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were quantitated using the protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad. For IPs, 75 μg of total protein was diluted to 500 μl with IP buffer and then incubated for 60 min by rocking at 4 °C with 1.5 μg of antibody (anti-Cdk4 H-22-G or normal goat IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound to 7.5 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Beads were pelleted and washed four times with 100 μl of IP buffer and twice with 100 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm NaF). Pellets were then suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm cold ATP, and 1.0 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) to which ∼2.0 μg of a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and amino acids 792–928 of human pRb were bound (GST-Rb bacterial expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. William Kaelin of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with occasional mixing, after which they were boiled in SDS loading buffer containing mercaptoethanol. Beads were pelleted, and the supernatants were transferred to clean tubes. Aliquots of the reaction products were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and exposed to autoradiography film. Phosphorylated GST-Rb bands were quantitated by PhosphorImaging with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software. Either total cell lysates (20 μg), IP supernatants, or IP pellets were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to membranes, and probed with antibodies for cyclin D1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog number 06 137), p21Waf1 (p21-c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p27Kip1 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cdk4 (H22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or actin (Sigma clone AC-40). Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad) or goat anti-mouse (American Qualex) secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive proteins were detected using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Cells were harvested, stored, and lysed as described above. Seventy five μg of protein from E2-treated cells were mixed with 7.5–75 μg of protein from ICI-treated cells and diluted to 500 μl with IP buffer. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with occasional agitation. The mixed lysates were then subjected to the Cdk4 kinase assay as described above. Phosphorylated substrate band intensities were quantitated by storage PhosphorImaging. For immunodepletion studies, 300 μg of lysates were diluted to 600 μl with IP buffer and incubated by rocking at 4 °C with 22.5 μl of protein G-agarose beads to which was bound 4.5 (Figs. 4 and 5) or 9 μg (Fig. 6) of antibody (p21-C-19-G, p27-C-19-G, Cdk4-H22-G, or normal goat IgG, all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was incubated with fresh antibody-bound beads a second time. Supernatants were then analyzed by Cdk4 assay, lysate mixing assay, and Western blotting as described. In Fig. 6 B, the antibody/bead pellets used for the sequential immunodepletions were washed once in IP buffer, boiled in SDS buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting as described. Statistical analysis for data presented in Fig. 5 was performed using Microsoft Excel.Figure 5Effects of p21 immunodepletion on the Cdk4 inhibitory activity in extracts of ICI-treated cells.

To determine whether changes in cyclin D1 protein levels and/or association correlate directly with Cdk4 activity and cell cycle progression in these cells, we investigated the effects of ICI and E2 on cell cycle distribution, Cdk4 activity, and cyclin D-Cdk4 complex formation. The experiments were performed in the presence of charcoal-stripped serum, which is free of steroid hormones. To study the inhibition of proliferation by ICI, MCF-7 cells were plated at low density and incubated in the presence of E2 for 48 h to generate an asynchronous, proliferating population. The E2-containing medium was then removed, and fresh medium containing ICI was added to block ER signaling, and cells were harvested at 6-h intervals. As shown in Fig.1 A, ICI caused a gradual decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase beginning by 18 h after treatment and reaching a minimum of 5% by 48 h. Under these conditions, Cdk4 activity was reduced 50% by 12 h and 90% by 24 h (Fig. 1 B). The decrease in Cdk4 kinase activity preceded the observed changes in cell cycle phase distribution, consistent with the concept that the loss of Cdk4 activity was responsible for the cell cycle arrest observed. To determine whether the decrease in Cdk4 activity shown in Fig.1 B correlated with changes in cyclin D1 and/or CdkI protein levels, Western blot analyses were performed (Fig. 1 C). No changes in Cdk4 protein levels were detected, confirming that the decrease in Cdk4 activity was not due to a decrease in the level of the catalytic subunit. These analyses also indicate that Cdk4 activity did not correlate directly with cyclin D1 protein levels. At 24 and 30 h after antiestrogen treatment, when there was virtually complete inhibition of Cdk4 activity, the cyclin D1 levels in the lysates were similar to those observed in asynchronous MCF-7 cells prior to antiestrogen treatment (0 h). More significantly, the amount of cyclin D1 co-immunoprecipitating with Cdk4 did not change or decrease detectably during the time course. Whereas the levels of p27 remained relatively constant during this experiment, the levels of p21 increased after ICI treatment, and this increase correlated with Cdk4 inactivation (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that the inhibition of Cdk4 activity following antiestrogen treatment is independent of changes in cyclin D1 levels and suggest that increased p21 levels may inhibit Cdk4. To examine further the effects of ICI and E2 on Cdk4 activity, the above experiment was performed in reverse. Cells were pre-arrested with ICI, released by the removal of ICI and the addition of E2, and harvested at 6-h intervals. At each time point, samples were analyzed for cell cycle distribution, for Cdk4 levels and activity, and for cyclin D1, p21, and p27 protein levels and Cdk4 association. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the percentage of cells in S phase remained low until 18 h and then increased to 40–50% at the 24- and 30-h time points. Cdk4 activity was undetectable at 0 h and increased by 24 and 30 h (Fig.2 B). In agreement with the results presented in Fig. 1, activation of Cdk4 did not correlate with changes in the levels of cyclin D1 or in its association with Cdk4. A transient increase in cyclin D1 was reproducibly observed at 6 and 12 h after treatment in both the total lysate and the Cdk4 IP, but this increase was not coincident with Cdk4 activation. When Cdk4 activity was highest, at 24 and 30 h after E2 treatment, cyclin D1 protein levels were similar to before treatment (Fig. 2 C). In this experiment, both p21 and p27 levels decreased after E2 treatment in both the total cellular lysate and Cdk4 IP. These data, taken together with the results of Fig.1, suggest that Cdk4 activity in E2- or ICI-treated cells is not directly determined by the total amount of cyclin D1 in the cell or by the amount of cyclin D1 in complex with Cdk4. Both experiments provide correlative data suggesting that p21 and/or p27 might be responsible for the inhibition of Cdk4 activity in response to ICI treatment. The results presented above provide correlative data that accumulation of p21 and/or p27 might be responsible for the inhibition of Cdk4 activity in ICI-treated cells. We therefore designed in vitro mixing experiments to test this possibility directly. MCF-7 cells were pre-arrested in ICI for 48 h and then treated with medium containing either E2 or fresh ICI for an additional 24 h. Lysates were prepared, and increasing amounts of lysate from ICI-treated cells were mixed with a constant 75 μg of lysate from E2-treated cells. The single and mixed lysates were diluted to a constant volume, incubated for 30 min, and then subjected to a Cdk4 activity assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” This experiment was designed to distinguish between three potential mechanisms for regulating Cdk4. If the lack of Cdk4 activity in ICI-treated cells was due to a post-translational modification of the complex, such as a change in phosphorylation state, we would expect the Cdk4 activity in the lysate of E2-treated cells to be unaffected by the addition of the lysate from ICI-treated cells. If the lack of Cdk4 activity was due to the absence of a Cdk4 activator (such as a D-type cyclin), we might expect to see an increase in total activity in the mixed lysates. Finally, if the lack of Cdk4 activity was due to the presence an inhibitory factor, we would expect the addition of the extract of ICI-treated cells to lower the activity present in the E2-treated lysates. The results of one representative mixing experiment are shown in Fig.3. As predicted from the time course experiments described above, only background levels of Cdk4 activity were recovered from the ICI-treated cells, and a 10-fold increase in Cdk4 activity was observed after E2 treatment (Fig. 3 A,1st and 2nd lanes). Under these experimental conditions, the amount of immunoprecipitating antibody was limiting, so that the Cdk4 activity recovered was not the total activity in the lysate but rather a representative fraction thereof. This is demonstrated by the fact that equal activity was detected in a second sequential Cdk4 IP of the same lysate (Fig. 3 A,5th to 7th lanes, marked 2nd IP). Because the IPs were performed in “lysate excess,” we predicted that the mixed lysates would exhibit decreased Cdk4 activity in the absence of any activating or inhibitory activities. Because Cdk4 is present at equal levels in active and inactive extracts and IPs (see Western blots in Fig. 2 C; note the constant level of Cdk4 detected in Cdk4 IPs despite differences in kinase activity), and because the mixed reactions contained a greater amount of total cellular protein, the"

Using murine Ba/F3 cells, here we demonstrate that the βc-mediated signals stimulate NF-κB-driven gene expression of not only the reporter construct but also endogenous target genes such as IL-6. Analyzing the effects of several inhibitors or mutant receptors revealed that this NF-κB activation is mediated neither by MEK/ERK/MAPK nor by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway but by STAT5. Overexpression experiments of the wild-type or constitutive active form of STAT5 further confirmed this notion. In addition, STAT5-dependent NF-κB activation is mediated not through an inducible nuclear translocation but via up-regulation of both DNA binding activity and transactivation potential of NF-κB. Furthermore, we also show that as yet undefined humoral factor(s) may be involved in this NF-κB activation process. Taken together, we may propose that cytokine receptor-mediated STAT5 activation and expression of its target genes culminates in a unique mode of NF-κB activation and gene expression.

These cytokines bind to their cognate receptors and trigger a cascade of signaling events leading to various biological responses. The receptors for GM-CSF (GMR) and IL-3 (IL-3R) are composed of two subunits, the cytokine-specific α and the common β subunit (βc), the latter of which is also shared by the receptor for IL-5 (2Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both subunits belong to the type I cytokine receptor superfamily, and the βc, having a relatively large cytoplasmic domain, plays a pivotal role in downstream signal transduction (2Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors lack intrinsic kinase activity but interact with and activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in response to binding ligand (3Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A.

Subsequently, the cytoplasmic domain of the βc becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and then cue multiple signaling pathways (4Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A.

Among seven known members of STAT family, both STAT5A and STAT5B, closely related isoforms, are the most predominant members activated by the βc (10Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Upon cytokine stimulation, JAK2 phosphorylates STAT5 on a tyrosine residue near the C-terminal transactivation domain in the cytoplasm (15Gouilleux F. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Wakao H. Haldosen L.A. Norstedt G. Levy D. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated STAT5 proteins dimerize and translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA elements and thereby activate target gene expression (10Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Using murine IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells, we have reported previously that STAT5 participates in growth-promoting signals downstream of the βc (16Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K.I. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mui A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that STAT5 is a key regulator of not only proliferation but also differentiation or apoptosis in these cells (19Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In particular, pim-1, JAB/SOCS-1/SSI-1, and p21WAF1/Cip1, all of which are transcriptionally regulated by STAT5, are suggested to be involved in a variety of biological outcomes induced by STAT5 (19Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of the gene expression profile regulated by STAT5, however, has been extremely limited. A recent study using microarray analysis revealed that more than 300 genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by IL-3 signaling in murine pro-B cells (20Brachat A. Pierrat B. Brungger A. Heim J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that more complicated mechanisms than described previously are operated in these cytokine- or STAT5-dependent biological responses. It was recently reported that several growth factors, including GM-CSF (21Zhang M.Y. Harhaj E.W. Bell L. Sun S.C. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and IL-3 (22Besancon F. Atfi A. Gespach C. Cayre Y.E. Bourgeade M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8081-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), could induce the activation of another transcription factor NF-κB in cells of hematopoietic lineages, although underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. NF-κB was originally described as a regulator of immune and inflammatory responses. NF-κB consists of a dimer from five related proteins, most typically a heterodimer composed of p65/RelA and p50 subunits (23Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 24Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 25Kawakami K. Scheidereit C. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4700-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The regulation of NF-κB is achieved through interaction with a family of inhibitory protein known as IκB that binds to NF-κB and sequesters it in the cytoplasm (26Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Once cells are stimulated with inducers such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and IL-1, two serine residues of the IκB protein are phosphorylated by IκB kinases (27DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 28Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB targets it for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome and renders the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB unmasked (29Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar,30Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Then NF-κB translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and regulates the transcription of target genes. In addition to this “classical” milieu, recent reports have suggested that alternative pathways lead to NF-κB activation through several nuclear mechanisms (31Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C.

As well as its well established role in activating the transcription of genes involved in immunological responses, it is indicated that NF-κB is one of the central mediators of hematopoiesis (36Denk A. Wirth T. Baumann B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears to be of importance to elucidate the linkage between the GM-CSF or IL-3 signaling and NF-κB activation for a better understanding of biological responses under the control of these cytokines. In the present study, we demonstrated that in Ba/F3 cells, GM-CSF as well as IL-3 activates NF-κB-dependent transcription, and STAT5 is essential for this process. Of note, STAT5 affected neither IκB degradation nor nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In contrast, we indicated that STAT5 increases not only the DNA binding activity but also the transactivational potential of NF-κB, possibly through a mechanism involving STAT5-dependent synthesis of as yet undetermined humoral factor(s). A murine (m) IL-3-dependent proB cell line, Ba/F3 (37Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), 4 ng/ml mIL-3 (Pepro Tech EC, London, England), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Various Ba/F3 cell clones stably expressing human (h) GMRα together with hGMRβc (Ba/F3-wild) or hGMRβc mutant Y6 or Fall (Ba/F3-Y6 or Ba/F3-Fall, respectively) have been described elsewhere (16Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K.I. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These engineered cells were grown in medium in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Another clone of Ba/F3 cells in which STAT5A1*6 is stably transfected (Ba/F3-STAT5A1*6), as well as a murine myelomonocytic cell line (WEHI 3B cells), was maintained with the same medium but without IL-3 (tentatively termed as depletion medium). In all experiments, cells were extensively washed with the depletion medium three times and stimulated with either 4 ng/ml mIL-3, 5 ng/ml hGM-CSF (kindly provided from Kirin Brewery, Tokyo, Japan), or indicated concentrations of mTNFα (Pepro Tech EC), mIL-6 (Sigma), m-oncostatinM (OSM, Sigma), or mIL-1β (Pepro Tech EC) or left nonstimulated. Conditioned medium was prepared by culturing either parental Ba/F3 or Ba/F3-STAT5A1*6 cells at a density of 1 × 107 cells/30 ml for 24 h in the depletion medium. The culture supernatant was subsequently collected, cleared by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 20 min), and freshly used as a conditioned medium for stimulating cells. The reporter plasmids NF-κB-Luc (formerly pNFκBHL) and AP-1-Luc (formerly pAP-1HL), in which expression of the luciferase gene is under the control of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, respectively, were described elsewhere (38Hiramoto M.

To construct the wild-type (WT) STAT5A expression vector pCMX-WT STAT5A, anEcoRI-NotI fragment containing cDNA for mSTAT5A was excised from a retrovirus vector pMX-STAT5A (18Onishi M. Nosaka T.

A pCMX-STAT5AΔ749 encoding a mutant of STAT5A in which C-terminal 44 amino acids are deleted was derived by exchanging theNsiI and NheI fragments of pCMX-WT STAT5A with the PCR-generated fragment: primers used in the PCR reaction were 5′-GAGTTCGTCAATGCATCCAC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-AGTCAGTCGCTAGC TGAGCCATCTTGGTCAAGGAC-3′ (antisense primer).

A pCMX-STAT5AVVV encoding a DNA-binding defective mutant of STAT5A (42Ilaria R.L. Hawley R.G. Van Etten R.A.

Primers used here were 5′-AGAAGCAGCCTCCTCAGGTC-3′ (sense primer-1), 5′- ATGGACGATAGCGGCCGCAGGGAGGGACAG-3′ (antisense primer-1), 5′-TCCCTCCCTGCGGCCGCTATCGTCCATGGC-3′ (sense primer-2), 5′-GTTGTAGTCCTCGAGGTGGT-3′ (antisense primer-2), and two independent PCR reactions were carried out with either set of primers, respectively, using a pCMX-WT STAT5A as a template. The second step of the PCR reaction was performed with the outer primers, sense primer-1 and antisense primer-2, using combined products of the first round PCR as templates. The Bsu36I andXhoI fragment within the STAT5A coding region of a pCMX-WT STAT5A was replaced with the PCR-amplified fragments. Underlined sequences are sites for Bsu36I (sense primer-1) andXhoI (antisense primer-2), respectively, and the bold letters indicate introduced mutations at codons 466, 467, and 468.

Primers used here were 5′-AGTCAGTCGAATTCATGGACGAACTGTTCCCC-3′(sense primer) and 5′-AGTCAGTCGATATC TGATTCCATGGGCTCACTGAA-3′(antisense primer) for pCMX-Gal4-p651–285 and 5′-GTGAGCCCATGGAATTCCAG-3′(sense primer) and 5′-AGTCAGTCGATATC TGAGGAGCTGATCTGACTCAG-3′ (antisense primer) for pCMX-Gal4-p65286–549, respectively, and the PCR reaction was performed using pCAGGS-m-p65 (a gift from Dr. H. Handa, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan) as a template. Underlined sequences indicate recognition sites ofEcoRI for sense primers or EcoRV for antisense primers. Bold sequences indicate the introduced stop codon. All plasmids constructed as above were verified by sequencing. Plasmids were transiently transfected into Ba/F3 cells or WEHI 3B cells by electroporation as described previously (16Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K.I. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were cultured in appropriate conditions, and cellular extracts were isolated as described below. When indicated, either PD98059 (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) or wortmannin (Sigma) was added in the culture medium 1 h prior to the addition of cytokines. Anti-mouse TNFα antibodies (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) were also added in the culture medium 2 h prior to the cellular stimulation. For reporter gene assay, cells were harvested and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing after 12 h (Ba/F3 cells) or 18 h (WEHI 3B cells) of cellular stimulation. Cell lysates were subjected to luciferase assays, and relative light units (RLU) were normalized to the protein amount determined with protein assay reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total amounts of plasmid DNA were adjusted to 10 μg/transfection using pGEM 7Z (Promega, Madison, WI). Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidine method using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Twenty μg of total RNA was subjected to 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto a MAGNACHARGE nylon membrane filter (Osmonics, Westborough, MA). Equal amounts of loading and the transfer efficiency of RNA samples were verified by ethidium bromide staining of 28 and 18 S rRNAs on the gel and the membrane. The cDNA probe corresponding to nucleotides 16–761 of the m IL-6 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from an RNA sample of parental Ba/F3 cells cultured under usual conditions. The probe was labeled with [α−32P]dCTP by random priming using RediPrime II (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization was carried out under ULTRAHyb conditions (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) at 42 °C overnight. For preparation of whole cell extracts, 1 × 106 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and incubated on ice for 15 min in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4). After centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was used as whole cell extracts. Cytosol and nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (45Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, after two cycles of washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 2 × 107 cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4). After incubation on ice for 5 min, cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used as cytosol. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in 75 μl of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 484 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μmpepstatin, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear debris were pelleted with centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was used as nuclear extracts. Protein concentration was determined using protein assay reagent (Pierce). Ten μg of protein was subjected to EMSA. The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes harboring NF-κB (top strand, 5′-AATTCAAGGGACTTTCCGCGTC-3′; bottom strand, 3′-GTTCCCTGAAAGGCGCAGCCGG-5′) and STAT5 (top strand, 5′-GATCCGAATTCCAGGAATTCA-3′; bottom strand, 3′-GCTTAAGGTCCTTAAGTCTAG-5′) binding sequences were annealed and filled in by BcaBEST DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) using [α−32p]dCTP and unlabeled dNTPs. Proteins were incubated with 0.7 ng of the radiolabeled probe in 20 μl of the reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, and 100 mm KCl in the presence of 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for NF-κB or 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for STAT5. For competition experiments, a 2-, 5-, or 20-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides of NF-κB or STAT5 or 20-fold excess of nonspecific oligonucleotide containing glucocorticoid responsive element (43Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3182-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was added prior to the oligonucleotide probe. In supershift assays, 2 μg of antibodies against either p65 (sc-372), p50 (sc-1190), p52 (sc-298), RelB (sc-226), c-Rel (sc-70), Bcl-3 (sc-185), or STAT5 (sc-836) (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the nuclear extracts for 1 h prior to the addition of oligonucleotide probe. Samples were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature and electrophoresed on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (1× TBE is 89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) buffer. Gels were run at 300 V for 2 h at 4 °C, dried, and autoradiographed. Ten μg of protein was separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% non-fat dried skim milk. The membranes were probed with either anti-p65 (sc-372), anti-p50 (sc-1190), or anti-IκBβ (sc-945, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies at 1:1000 dilution and then incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For analysis of IκBα protein, the membranes were first probed with anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser-32) antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 1:1000 dilution followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Subsequently, after detection of proteins, the same membranes were stripped, reprobed for anti-IκBα antibody (sc-371, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:500 dilution, and probed with a secondary antibody. In all experiments, proteins were visualized with ECL detection systems (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunocytochemical analysis, Ba/F3-wild cells were collected and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then 2 × 105 cells were cytospined to a silane-coated glass slide. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in TBS for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized for 30 min using TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin, and washed twice with TBS. Slides were then treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase for 1 h at 37 °C. Incubation with 1:1000 dilution of anti-p65 antibody was performed for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing two times with TBS, and then incubation was carried out for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200 dilution. The slides were rinsed and exposed to propidium iodide for 2 h at room temperature, and coverslips were mounted for viewing by a laser scanning confocal microscopy (Fluoview FV500, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). To analyze signaling events downstream of the βc, we used an engineered subline of m IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells stably expressing both wild-type α and βc subunits of the h GMR (Ba/F3-wild cells, Fig.1 C) (16Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K.I. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because signals evoked by the hGMR in these cells are able to substitute for those of endogenous IL-3R. To test whether NF-κB-dependent gene expression is induced by IL-3 or GM-CSF, both Ba/F3-wild and parental Ba/F3 cells were transiently transfected with an NF-κB-inducible reporter plasmid NF-κB-Luc and cultured in the absence or the presence of these cytokines, and then cellular lysates were assayed for luciferase activities. As shown in Fig. 1 A, treatment with IL-3 induced nearly 3-fold induction of reporter gene expression in both of these cells. In contrast, treatment with GM-CSF resulted in 5-fold increase of reporter gene expression only in Ba/F3-wild cells. These results suggested that not only the endogenous IL-3R but also transfected hGMR could activate NF-κB-dependent gene expression in Ba/F3 cells and that cells exp"
https://openalex.org/W2130636284,"Overexpression of Sam68 functionally substitutes for, as well as synergizes with, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev in RRE (Rev response element)-mediated gene expression and virus replication. In addition, COOH-terminal deletion and/or point mutants of Sam68 exhibit a transdominant negative phenotype for HIV replication. Sam68 is a member of KH domain family that includes SLM-1, SLM-2 (Sam68 like mammalian); and QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7 (mouse quaking) proteins. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of these KH family proteins on RRE- and CTE (constitutive transport element of type-D retrovirus)-mediated transactivation. We now report that SLM-1 and SLM-2 proteins, which are the closest relatives of Sam68, marginally enhanced RRE-mediated transactivation, while QK isoforms that are distant relatives of Sam68 had no effect. Interestingly, these proteins still enhanced the effect of Rev in RRE-mediated gene expression. The increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was also reflected at the levels of cytoplasmic RRE-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNAs, indicating that Sam68 and KH proteins may have been involved in the stability or export of unspliced RNA. The increase in Rev activity was sensitive to leptomycin B, but not to olomoucine, indicating that the effect of SLM-1, SLM-2, QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7 is exerted through a CRM-1-dependent mRNA export pathway. Thus, KH family proteins play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of HIV."

Direct binding of three types of N-glycans to the α-amylase was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. Binding with biotin-polymer sugar probes revealed that the α-amylase has affinity to α-mannose, α-N-acetylneuraminic acid, and β-N-acetyllactosamine, which are components ofN-glycans. The binding of glycoproteins or carbohydrates enhanced the enzyme activity, indicating that the recognition site forN-glycans is different from its catalytic site. The binding activity was unique to porcine pancreatic α-amylase and was not observed for α-amylase from saliva, wheat, and fungus.

The binding activity was unique to porcine pancreatic α-amylase and was not observed for α-amylase from saliva, wheat, and fungus. α-Amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) is a well known starch hydrolase discovered in 1830 that has important roles in energy acquisition in animals, plants, and microbes. It is an endo-type enzyme that typically cleaves α1,4-glucose linkages in starch which is further processed by the exoenzymes. Because in vivo modulation of α-amylase activity in pancreatic secretions is important in nutrition and for developing therapies for diabetes mellitus, interaction between porcine pancreatic α-amylase (PPA) 1The abbreviations used are:PPAporcine pancreatic α-amylaseBSMbovine submaxillary mucinBSAbovine serum albuminBP-biotinylated polymeric-CTAC. trichotomum lectinPA-pyridylamino- and its inhibitors, including antinutrients, has been investigated (1Bowman D.E.

The mechanisms of the antinutrient effect of lectins on pancreatic α-amylase activity have been studied by several groups (4Sgarbieri V. Whitaker J. Adv. Food Res. 1982; 28: 93-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Thompson L.U. Food Technol. 1988; 42: 123-131Google Scholar, 6Fish B.C. Thompson L.U. J. Agric.

Because cDNA of the α-amylase inhibitor from kidney bean,Phaseolus vulgaris, exhibits homology with a lectin from the same source (PHA) (8Moreno J. Chrispeels M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7885-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and because PHA inhibits the growth of insect larvae in vivo (9Chrispeels M.J. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), PHA together with arcelin and α-amylase inhibitor are classified as members of a family of defense proteins (10Mirkov T.E. Wahlstrom J.M. Hagiwara K. Finardi-Filho F. Kjemtrup S. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Plant α-amylase inhibitors inhibit only animal α-amylase, exhibiting species specificity toward insect larvae but not its plant homologue. However, purified legume lectins of various kidney beans were found instead to increase the PPA activity in vitro (11You X.-M. Chang S.K.C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1992; 40: 638-642Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and factors other than direct interactions of lectins with pancreatic α-amylase are considered to lower the rate of starch digestion (12Pusztai A. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 1993; 47: 691-699PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the antinutrient effect of dietary lectins has been attributed to the fact that lectins bind to glycoproteins in the intestinal mucosa of mammals and insects, and it is hypothesized that lectin toxicity results from this initial binding, which interferes with immune function, gut bacterial population, or metabolic or hormonal reactions (13Pusztai A. Bardocz S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 149-165Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Most plant lectins and α-amylase inhibitors are glycoproteins. Because PPA possesses three potential glycosylation sites, we studied the possibility that carbohydrate-dependent interaction between α-amylase and various glycoproteins occurs in the physiological processes. PPA specifically recognizesN-linked glycans. The novel carbohydrate binding activity of PPA may provide new insight into the secretion, targeting, and modulation mechanism of this long known enzyme, and the antinutrient activities of plant lectins in the digestive tract. PPA was purchased from Elastin Products Co., Inc. (Owensville, MO), for use in most experiments and from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma for comparison. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated PPA, α-amylase from barley (a mixture of α- and β-amylase; the β-amylase was inactivated by heat treatment at 70 °C for 15 min) and human saliva, wheat α-amylase inhibitor, ovalbumin, calf fetuin, bovine submaxillary gland mucin (BSM), ribonuclease B, yeast mannan, and human apotransferrin were purchased from Sigma. Bacillus subtilis α-amylase and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals Co. Biotinyl polymer (BP-) sugar probes were purchased from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Clerodendron trichotomum lectin (CTA) was purified as described previously (14Kitagaki-Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. Seno N. Takahashi N. Endo S. Arata Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex was from Amersham Biosciences. Pyridylamino(PA-)oligosaccharides Man8GlcNAc2, Manα1–2Manα1–6(Manα1–3)Manα1–6(Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc, NeuAc2Gal2Man3GlcNAc2, NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6(NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc, and NeuAc3Gal3Man3GlcNAc5, NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6(NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4(NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2)Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). PPA-Sepharose was prepared by coupling 15 mg of PPA with formyl-Sepharose (2 g) (15Ito Y. Seno N. Matsumoto I. J. Biochem. 1985; 97: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in 20 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 60 mg of NaCNBH3 at 4 °C for 2 days. Excess formyl groups were blocked with 40 ml of 1 mTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 124 mg of NaCNBH3 at room temperature for 1 h. About 5 mg of protein per ml of gel was immobilized. A PPA-Sepharose column (0.75 × 6 cm) was equilibrated with 15 mm sodium succinate buffer containing 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 m NaCl (pH 5.6). 200 μl of each glycoprotein solution (1 mg/ml) was applied to the column and washed with the same buffer. The bound glycoproteins were eluted with 0.2 m methyl α-d-mannoside, methyl β-d-galactoside in the same buffer, or 0.1m citrate buffer (pH 3.0) and monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. IAsys (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK), a biosensor based on optical resonance, was used for kinetic analyses of interactions between PPA and glycoproteins. Immobilization was performed with 200 μl of PPA solution (1 mg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.2 m methyl α-d-mannoside by adding it to a CM-dextran-coated cuvette that had been activated withN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and reacting it at room temperature for 30 min. After immobilization of PPA, excess reactive groups were blocked by 1 methanolamine (pH 8.0). To measure binding curves, various concentrations of glycoproteins in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 were added to the cuvette, and after 200 s the cuvette was washed with the same buffer. Glycoproteins that bound to the cuvette were eluted with 0.1 m methyl α-d-mannoside to regenerate the cuvette or 3 m NaCl in the same buffer or diluted NaOH (pH 10) for extensive washing. Binding constants were calculated from their binding curves using connected software, according to the equation, dR/dt = k a[S]0 R max −(k a[S]0+k d)R, whereR is response (arc seconds), [S]0 is initial concentration of ligand, and R max is maximum response that will be seen at concentrations of ligand high enough to saturate the binding site of α-amylase. On introducingk on = k a[S]0 + k d, k onis obtained from the slope of dR/dt versus R plot. The association constant,K a, is calculated according to the equation,K a= k a/k d, from the slope and the intercept of k on versus [S]0 under various concentrations of ligands. For binding studies between PPA and PA-oligosaccharides, a BIAcore 2000 SPR apparatus (BIACORE AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used. After equilibration with HEPES-buffered saline on a CM5 sensor chip, the surface of the sensor chip was activated with an amine coupling kit, and PPA (3 mg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3) containing 0.2m methyl α-d-mannoside was injected onto the activated surface, and then the remainingN-hydroxysuccinimide esters were blocked by the addition of 1.0 m ethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.0). Each step was performed for 14 min at a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min to immobilize PPA maximally. The reference flow cell was prepared with BSA as a ligand. The PA-oligosaccharides were separately injected onto a PPA-immobilized sensor chip at concentrations of 25.0 μmMan8GlcNAc2-PA and 25.8 μm each of NeuAc2Gal2Man3GlcNAc4-PA and NeuAc3Gal3Man3GlcNAc5-PA in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 for 150 s at a flow rate of 2 μl/min at 25 °C. α-Amylases of various origins were immobilized overnight in TBS (10000–9.8 ng/100 μl) on each well of a microtiter plate (Immulon 1, Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) at 4 °C. All other procedures were performed at room temperature using TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2, according to the procedure described (16Ueda H. Kojima K. Saitoh T. Ogawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The incubation time with sugar-BP probes was 4 h. In the case of inhibition assays, the concentration of PPA added to each well was fixed at 100 μg/ml. Various concentrations of saccharides were preincubated with immobilized PPA in the wells for 1 h, and 50 μl of Man-BP probe (10 μg/ml) was added, and they were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Enzyme activity was measured according to Bernfeld (17Bernfeld P. Nord F.F. Advances in Enzymology. 12. Interscience Publishers, New York1951: 379Google Scholar). PPA solution in PBS (0.1 ml) was preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min, and various concentrations of glycoproteins (10 μl) were added. After incubation for 1 h, 0.2 ml of 1% starch in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 0.006 m NaCl was added, and the mixture was reacted at room temperature for 30 min. To stop the reaction, 0.2 ml of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid was added, and it was boiled in a waterbath for 5 min to develop the color. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with 2 ml of water, and measured at 540 nm. Maltose was used as a standard for reducing sugar. Neutral carbohydrate analysis was carried out from blotted polyvinylidene difluoride membranes according to the method described previously (18Uchibori-Iwaki H. Yoneda A. Oda-Tamai S. Kato S. Akamatsu N. Otsuka M. Murase K. Kojima K. Suzuki R. Maeya Y. Tanabe M. Ogawa H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Lectin reactivity was examined on the membrane according to the method described previously (16Ueda H. Kojima K. Saitoh T. Ogawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using biotinyl lectins, concanavalin A,Psathyrella velutina lectin, and P. vulgarisleukoagglutinin. Fig. 1 shows the affinity of glycoproteins on a PPA-immobilized Sepharose chromatography column. As shown in Fig. 1 A, fetuin bound to the column and was dissociated from it by pulse elution with 0.2 m Me α-d-Man (arrows, b andd) but not with Me β-d-Gal (arrows,a and c). As shown in Fig. 1, B andC, the bound ovalbumin and RNase B, respectively, were eluted with methyl α-d-mannoside but not with methyl β-d-galactoside (data not shown). On the contrary, α-amylase inhibitor bound to the column and eluted with 0.1m sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.0) as reported previously (8Moreno J. Chrispeels M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7885-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but it was not eluted with 0.2 m methyl α-d-mannoside, in contrast to other glycoproteins tested here (data not shown). For immobilization of PPA in the cuvette, methyl α-d-mannoside was necessary to protect the carbohydrate-binding site; otherwise, fetuin did not bind to the PPA-immobilized cuvette (data not shown). Changes of the resonance angle caused by the immobilization or interaction were measured in arc seconds, a response unit of IAsys (163 arc s = 1 ng/mm2), and plotted versus time in the binding curves. The total amount of immobilized PPA was about 2,000 arc s. The optimum condition for interaction analyses was examined using fetuin. As shown in Fig.2 A, fetuin bound to PPA-immobilized cuvettes at pH 4.0–7.4 with optimal binding at pH 4.5. Between pH 4.5 and 5.0, however, binding occurred too quickly to produce a biphasic curve, and pH 5.5 was adapted for quantitative interaction analyses because it is closer to the pH of pancreatic fluid. As shown in Fig. 2 B, transferrin and fetuin bound to the PPA cuvette at pH 5.5, but BSM and BSA did not. Asialofetuin, CTA, and ovalbumin also bound to the PPA cuvette (data not shown). The bound glycoproteins were eluted with 0.2 m methyl α-d-mannoside, but when the elution was incomplete, 3m NaCl was used to complete it. When 10 mm NaOH was used to wash the cuvette, the addition of Ca2+ was necessary to restore the binding activity of PPA. CTA, a galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin, was not eluted from the cuvette with 0.2 md-galactose, indicating that the binding was not caused by the carbohydrate recognition of CTA. Binding constants were measured for each glycoprotein from the plots of k on versus [S]0 from the binding curves at various ligand concentrations, as shown in Fig. 2 C. Association rate constants (k a), dissociation rate constants (k d), and affinity constants (K a) were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are summarized in Table I. Transferrin bound best among the samples, with a k a of 2.3 × 105m−1 s−1 and aK a of over 2.3 × 107m−1. Desialylation of fetuin markedly decreased k a and consequently K ato 1/30 of fetuin, suggesting that sialyl residues contribute to the binding. On the other hand, the k d values of all the samples tested were close. All the bound glycoproteins haveN-linked oligosaccharides of various types, i.e.complex types (transferrin and fetuin), plant complex types with β-1,2-linked xylose and α-1,3-linked fucose (CTA), oligomannose, and hybrid types (ovalbumin) as summarized in Table I. On the contrary, of the unbound glycoproteins, BSM possesses only O-linked oligosaccharides, and BSA does not contain any glycans. These results suggest that a common trimannosyl moiety of N-glycans may play an essential role in the interaction of glycoproteins with PPA.Table IBinding parameters for the interaction between PPA and glycoproteins●, GlcNAc; ⧫, Man; ▨, Gal; ○, NeuAcα 2→6; ▵, NeuAc α2→3; ■, Fuc; ⊠, Xyl.

Interactions between PPA and glycoproteins are measured in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2using IAsys. k a shows association rate constant;k d, dissociation rate constant; and Ka, association constant. Ka =k a/k d was calculated from the slope and the intercept of the k on versus[S]0 in Fig. 2 C as described in the text. Except RNase B, the glycoproteins examined here bound to PPA optimally at a pH lower than 5, whereas RNase B bound optimally at pH 7–7.5 as well as at pH 5 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 D, RNase B bound to PPA better than its unglycosylated isoform RNase A, especially at pH 5.5, suggesting that a high mannose type N-glycan is involved in the interaction. Because RNase B and A adsorbed significantly to underivatized CM-dextran cuvettes, probably due to electrostatic interaction, quantitative parameters could not be obtained. The total amounts of immobilized PPA and BSA were 24,381 and 18,392 BIAcore resonance units (1000 resonance units = 1 ng/mm2), respectively. The changes of resonance units induced by binding of analytes to PPA-immobilized flow cell were corrected for bulk effect by subtracting the changes on the BSA-immobilized reference cell. As shown in Fig.3, the binding and dissociation occurred rapidly at the start and end of the injection of PA-oligosaccharides, demonstrating the specific binding of the PA-oligosaccharides to PPA with quick association and dissociation rates. From the changes in response units and the molecular weight of each PA-oligosaccharide, the bound amounts were calculated to be 0.22, 0.18, and 0.044 pmol/mm2 for NeuAc2Gal2Man3GlcNAc4-PA, NeuAc3Gal3Man3GlcNAc5-PA, and Man8GlcNAc2-PA, respectively. The differential binding of PPA to PA-oligosaccharides clearly indicates its relative binding affinity toward oligosaccharides; PPA binds best with NeuAc2Gal2Man3GlcNAc4-PA, and then NeuAc3Gal3Man3GlcNAc5-PA, and to a lesser extent Man8GlcNAc2-PA. Although absoluteK a values could not be obtained because the amount of the samples was limited, the oligosaccharide specificity shown here agreed well with the binding affinities of PPA for glycoproteins that possess these oligosaccharides, that is transferrin, fetuin, and ovalbumin (Table I). As shown in Fig.4 A, PPA bound best with α-mannose and α-mannose 6-phosphate-BP probes among the probes examined. The binding was not restricted to the mannosyl residue, but Galβ1-4GlcNAc (LacNAc)-, α-NeuAc-, and α-GalNAc-BP probes bound to a lesser extent than α-mannose-BP. β-GlcNAc-, β-Lac-, β-Gal-3-sulfate-, or 3-O-sulfo-Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAc-BP probes did not bind, suggesting that the binding is not caused merely byN-acetyl-specific or electrostatic interaction. α-Glc-BP probe did not bind, suggesting that catalytic subsites of PPA (19Ishikawa K. Matsui I. Kobayashi S. Nakatani H. Honda K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6259-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are not involved in the interaction with the sugar-BP probes. In the inhibition test, 50 mm mannan inhibited the interaction between PPA and the α-mannose-BP probe by about 75%, but methyl α-d-mannoside, methyl β-d-galactoside, or methyl α-d-glucoside did not, even at the concentration of 0.1 m (data not shown). From these results, the glycoprotein binding is considered to be due to the affinity of PPA for multiple carbohydrate residues that are components of N-linked glycans. As shown in Fig. 4 B, PPA from three manufacturers all exhibited the mannose-BP binding activity. In contrast, α-amylases of barley, Bacillus, and human saliva origins did not exhibit obvious binding activity toward the mannose-BP probe. Carbohydrate analyses indicated that PPA contained 0.04 mol each of d-mannose andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine per 1 mol of PPA, and a trace amount of d-galactose, which is lower than the reported carbohydrate contents for PPA (20Beaupoil-Abadie B.R.M. Cozzone P. Marchis-Mouren G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 297: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). l-Fucose,N-acetyl-d-galactosamine andd-xylose were not detected. The results indicate that although it has three potential glycosylation sites, most parts of PPA are unglycosylated, and a very small amount (<1% of potential sites) is N-glycosylated. PPA electroblotted onto the membrane after SDS-PAGE was very slightly stained with concanavalin A and only weakly stained with P. velutina lectin and P. vulgaris leukoagglutinin, suggesting that the glycosylated molecules contain sialylated tri- or tetraantennary branchedN-glycans. As shown in Fig. 5, glycoproteins that interacted with PPA did not inhibit the enzyme activity but rather enhanced it to various degrees with the exception of the wheat PPA inhibitor only. When transferrin was added at 5-, 30-, and 100-fold excess in molar ratio to PPA, it enhanced the enzyme activity by 125, 134, and 145%, respectively (Fig. 5 A). Fetuin similarly enhanced the enzyme activity by 110% at 30-fold excess in molar ratio to PPA, whereas ovalbumin and BSA did not affect the enzyme activity, and wheat PPA inhibitor inhibited it to 80% at the same concentration (Fig.5 B). This paper demonstrates that PPA binds to glycoproteins by carbohydrate-specific interaction. The affinity chromatography and quantitative analyses with IAsys indicated that immobilized PPA interacted with glycoproteins possessing N-glycans at aK a of 105–7m−1 at acidic pH, whereas mucin did not bind at all. The binding studies of PA-oligosaccharides to PPA with BIAcore indicated that sialylated complex-type oligosaccharides bound better than high mannose oligosaccharides at pH 5.5. Microplate assay using sugar-BP probes indicated that the interaction is due to the affinity of PPA for component saccharide residues of the N-linked complex type, i.e. for α-mannose, α-NeuAc, and for β−LacNAc. Supportingly, the glycoproteins that bound to immobilized PPA were most effectively eluted with methyl α-mannoside among the saccharides tested. Because the sugar-BP probe is a multivalent probe exhibiting an affinity constant higher than free sugar by 102–105m−1 (21Abramenko I.V. Gluzman D.F. Korchagina E. Yu. Zemlyanukhina T.V. Bovin N.V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Bovine N.V. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 42-49Google Scholar), it was successfully used to reveal the binding specificity of PPA. The affinity of PPA toward free mono- or disaccharide would not be enough to elute completely the bound glycoproteins from a PPA-immobilized cuvette. The glycoprotein binding was inhibited in the presence of EDTA, although once bound, glycoproteins were hardly eluted with EDTA. When the PPA-immobilized cuvette was washed with 10 mm NaOH, the carbohydrate binding of PPA was inactivated, but equilibrating the cuvette with the buffer containing Ca2+ restored the binding activity of PPA. These observations indicate that the carbohydrate recognition of PPA is Ca2+-dependent and that the bound glycoprotein might prevent EDTA from accessing Ca2+ located near the lectin site of PPA. The interaction of glycoproteins with PPA did not inhibit its enzyme activity but instead enhanced it to various degrees. On the other hand, the N-glycan binding activity was completely lost in diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated PPA that had been modified at serine residues to inactivate protease activity while maintaining the amylase activity (data not shown). These observations suggest that the N-glycan recognition is exhibited at a site different from the catalytic subsites of PPA. The Man-BP binding activity is unique to PPA and was not observed for α-amylase isolated from barley, B. subtilis, or human saliva, indicating that the N-glycan binding activity has been acquired during evolution to adapt PPA to the pancreas-specific environment. Because mature PPA is almost unglycosylated, the receptor glycan for PPA may be present on other glycoconjugates. The N-glycan-binding site may play a role in targeting PPA to intestinal membrane surfaces after secretion because the surface epithelium of the gut is extensively glycosylated and PPA is localized at the luminal surface. In this case, an oligomannosylN-glycan, such as that of RNase B, may be a first candidate for the receptor glycan due to the slightly alkaline to neutral pH of pancreatic fluid and the intestinal lumen. The epithelium of the small intestine is organized into crypts and villi; the less differentiated crypt cells usually contain oligomannosyl glycans on the membrane glycoproteins, and upon differentiation of the cells, the glycosylation changes to express complex glycans on the fully mature cells of the villi (23Roth J. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 687-710PubMed Google Scholar, 24Roth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 405-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Pusztai A. Ewen S.W.B. Grant G. Peumans W.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Coates M.E. Bardocz S. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Binding to the membranous glycans on the epithelium would concomitantly protect PPA from proteolysis, stabilize it to extend its life, and/or activate it at the intestinal surface. Furthermore, the binding of PPA to intestinal surface glycans would make the product spatially available as a substrate for the exo-type enzymes that are naturally anchored to the intestinal brush border membranes, e.g. maltase-glucoamylase or sucrase-isomaltase complexes (26Nichols B.L. Eldering J. Avery S. Hahn D. Quaroni A. Sterchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3076-3081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), to metabolize starch efficiently. Like many proteins anchored to the brush-border membrane, human maltase-glucoamylase is a glycoprotein with 32–38% carbohydrates that possesses unsialylated complex N-glycans at 19 potential glycosylation sites (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of PPA to complex glycans is rather weak at neutral pH, but the multivalent glycans on one molecule usually increase the affinity toward carbohydrate-binding proteins. Therefore, maltase-glucoamylase as well as other highly glycosylated membrane enzymes or receptors may also bind pancreatic α-amylase. When the mature epithelial cells are shed from the villus tips into the lumen as part of normal cell turnover, the cellular material is digested, but the liberated pancreatic α-amylase might bind to the next receptor. In this context, the antinutrient activity of plant lectins is primarily explained by the predominant binding of lectins to glycan receptors at the intestinal surface and blocking them from PPA. Alternatively or compatibly, the carbohydrate binding activity of PPA found here might be involved in the formation of zymogen granules in the exocrine pancreas. PPA in zymogen aggregates may sort the aggregates into zymogen granules via binding to theN-glycans of the intragranular submembranous glycoprotein matrix and/or to the Man3-GlcNAc portion of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins located on rafts of the trans-Golgi network or granular membrane for envelopment. This hypothesis is consistent with the report that glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and rafts play an important role in the granule formation and regulated apical secretion of zymogen in rat pancreas and that the inhibition of raft assembly results in missorting of pancreatic amylase to constitutive secretion (28Schmidt K. Scharader M. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14315-14323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The binding characteristics of PPA found in this study,i.e. that PPA exhibits the highest binding to various types of N-glycan at around pH 5 but not at alkaline pH in the presence of Ca2+, is consistent with the fact that the association events take place Ca2+-dependently at mildly acidic pH (29Leblond F.A. Viau G. Laine J. Lebel D. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and that PPA would dissociate from the granular membrane at the alkaline pH of pancreatic fluid. The carbohydrate binding activity found for PPA was not observed for salivary α-amylase in this study, and that may indicate the lack of universality of the aggregation-sorting pathway among secretory tissues. Carbohydrate-binding specificity might be present but different in salivary α-amylase because component glycoproteins are not common to the luminal aspect of all secretory granule membranes (29Leblond F.A. Viau G. Laine J. Lebel D. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The function of carbohydrate-specific binding of PPA is still unknown and needs to be elucidated.

It is composed of a HPr binding α-helical subdomain and an α/β subdomain, structurally similar to the phosphohistidine swivel domain of pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Phospho-EIN transfers the phosphoryl group to HPr, but it requires the presence of the carboxyl-terminal domain (EIC) to become phosphorylated by PEP (8LiCalsi C. Crocenzi T.S. Freire E. Roseman S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and plays a crucial role in dimerization (16Zhu P.P. Szczepanowski R.H. Nosworthy N.J. Ginsburg A. Peterkofsky A.

Lee B.R. Zhu P.P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). EIC is proteolytically unstable and flexible. Its structure is not yet known. However, the amino acid sequence similarity between EIC and the PEP binding domain of PPDK ofClostridium symbiosum points toward similar fold and structure. There is also sequence similarity with PEP synthase (18Pocalyko D.J. Carroll L.J. Martin B.M. Babbitt P.C. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The mode of action of EI and the way its activity is controlled are not yet fully understood. The protein dimerizes in a temperature-dependent manner (19Kukuruzinska M.A. Turner B.W. Ackers G.K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11679-11681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant has been reported to shift from 20 μm at 6 °C to 0.9 μm at 30 °C. The presence of divalent cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+) and PEP also affects the equilibrium and the association and dissociation rate constants (20Chauvin F. Brand L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20270-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Chauvin F. Brand L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20263-20269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association rate constant is 2–3 orders of magnitude slower than in other dimeric proteins, indicating that dimerization is accompanied by major conformational rearrangements of the interacting EIC domains (20Chauvin F.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1996-2003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that the dimer is the catalytically active form: (i) in vitro PTS activity increases during a long lag time, which was explained by the slow dimerization of EI to form the active species (23Misset O. Brouwer M. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); (ii) PTS activity at rate-limiting concentrations of wild-type EI was enhanced upon addition of the inactive H189G and G338E EI mutants (24Seok Y.J. Zhu P.P. Koo B.M. Peterkofsky A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); (iii) activity and fluorescence of pyrene-labeled EI changed in parallel as a function of temperature, which was interpreted as a correlation between function and dimerization (20Chauvin F.

The objective of the present work was to find irreversible inhibitors (compounds 1–4, Scheme FSI) and use them to characterize the PEP binding site of EI and to study its catalytic properties. Theoretically, compounds 1–3 are suicide inhibitors. They will release chloropyruvic acid (from 1 and2) or chloroacetone (3) after transferring their phosphate group to EI. These molecules might then label catalytic residues of the protein. Compound 4 has been designed to react directly with nucleophiles present in the active site of EI, presumably His-189. In general, substrate analogs have been widely employed to study PEP-utilizing enzymes. For instance, C3-substituted halo-PEP analogs were used with pyruvate kinase (PK) (33Duffy T.H. Nowak T.

PEP (cyclohexylammonium salt) and NADH (disodium salt) were from Sigma. Chloropyruvic acid was synthesized as described previously (44Cragoe E.J. Robb C.M. Org.

They were characterized by 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The purity of compounds1 and 2 was higher than 99%, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (not shown). Rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase and yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Proteins were overexpressed in an Escherichia coli K12 strain ZSC112LΔHIC (ptsG, manZ,Δ ptsHIcrr, glk). EI, HPr, IIAGlc, and IIABMan were purified as described (45Stolz B. Huber M.

The coding regions for EI- and IIAGlc were cloned in the expression vector pJF119EH (47Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), and the H189A, C502A mutants of EI and the H90Q mutant of IIAGlc were prepared by recombinant circle PCR to afford plasmids pMSEI189, pMSEI189H6, pMSEI502, pMSEI502H6, and pMSIIA90 (48Jones D.H.

In vitro PTS activity was coupled to the oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone, catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Reactions were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. The formation of NADPH at 30 °C was monitored continuously at λ = 340 nm in a Spectramax-250 plate reader. Initial rates were determined from the maximal slope of the absorption curves. Assay mixtures contained (150 μl/well): 1 μmHPr, 20 μm IIAGlc, 1 μl of membrane extract, 0.1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1 mm NADP+, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm NaF, and 5 mmMgCl2. The concentrations of EI and PEP are indicated in the figure legends. EI was always rate-limiting. The rates did not exceed 25% of the activity attained at saturating EI. The reactions were started by the addition of 10 μl of 15 mm glucose, PEP, or the PEP analog, to 140 μl/well of the assay mixture containing the rest of components preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C. EI (0.051–5.1 μm) was shaken for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 0.5 μmHPr, 5 μm IIAGlc (or 0.5 μmIIABMan), 0.01 μl/μl membranes containing IICBGlc (or IICDMan), 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 mm NADH. Compounds 1–4, chloro- or bromopyruvic acid were added to a final concentration of 0–5 mm, as indicated in the figure legends or in the text. Aliquots were withdrawn at intervals, and the reaction was stopped by dilution into at least 10 volumes of cold (4–10 °C) buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm NaF, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.3–1 mm PEP. PTS activity of inactivated EI was assayed in the PEP:glucose phosphotransferase assay at 0.017 μm final EI concentration and 1 mmPEP. In the case of incubation of 0.051 μm EI, the aliquots (50 μl) were assayed directly by addition to 100 μl of a mixture of the rest of components incubated at 30 °C and containing 3 mm PEP. Background activity was determined in the absence of EI, and it was subtracted before subsequent calculations. To measure protection of EI by substrate, the inhibitor and the protecting substrate were mixed in the desired concentration ratio and added simultaneously to the incubation mixture. TheKm and k cat values were calculated by least squares fit of the initial rates measured in the presence of variable concentrations of PEP or PEP analogs1–4 to a Michaelis-Menten hyperbola. The inhibition constant KI andKm were obtained by linear regression from the plot of K mapp versus [I] according to the equationK mapp =Km (1 + [I]/KI). In the inactivation assays, the percent of residual EI activityversus time was fitted to the second-order rate equation % activity = 100/(1 + k inact t) +Res, where Res represents the residual activity remaining at long incubation times. k inactvalues measured at a given EI concentration were plottedversus inhibitor concentration and fitted to a hyperbolak inact =k Imax[I]/(K minact + [I]). From these curves the maximum inactivation rate (k Imax) and the Michaelis constant for inactivation (K minact) could be determined at different EI concentrations. It must be noticed that the reported k inact values (units: min−1) are not real second-order rate constants (units: concentration−1 time−1). In fact,k inact =k realinact [E], where [E] represents the unknown concentration of the reactive form of EI. EI (30 μm, 1 ml) was treated under turnover conditions with 2 mm Z-Cl-PEP (see above). After 60 min NaBH4 was added to a final concentration of 20 mm and the reaction allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 min. A second sample of EI was subjected to the same treatment without Z-Cl-PEP. Both samples were cooled on ice, dialyzed against 100 volumes of buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmDTT, 0.4 m NaCl), and EI was purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex-200, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., same buffer). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated (Centricon-50, Amicon) to a volume of 1 ml, and dialyzed overnight against 100 mm Tris buffer. 50 μl of the solution was treated with 20 μl of 200 μg/ml modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) at 25 °C for 5 h. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of formic acid to a final concentration of 1%. The volume was reduced to 20 μl by evaporation in a Speed-Vac centrifuge. Peptides were transferred to tips containing POROS R2 (C-18 reverse phase), desalted by washing with 0.01% formic acid, eluted with 0.1% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ESI-MS and tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) measurements were done on an Applied Biosystems/Sciex QSTAR Pulsar hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) mass spectrometer (Sciex Concord, Canada), equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Protana, Odense, Denmark), under standard conditions. The spray capillary supplies a flow rate of 10–20 nl/min. A typical voltage of 900 V was applied, and nitrogen was used as the curtain gas. Precursor ions were selected in the quadrupole Q1 within an m/z window of ±0.7 and subjected to collision-induced dissociation using nitrogen as the collision gas. Collision energies in the range of 20–40 eV were applied. The molecular masses of the peptides were calculated from the series of multiply charged ions obtained by ESI-MS. The product ions of selected peptides were subsequently analyzed by the second stage of mass spectrometry. The accuracy of time of flight (reflectron) lies within 10 ppm. The mass spectrometer was calibrated externally using a mixture of cesium iodide and reserpine. The Applied Biosystems Analyst QS software package was used for data acquisition and processing. Protein sequences (from the Swiss Protein Database) were aligned using the PILEUP program from the Wisconsin package, using standard values for the gap creation and extension penalties (49Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). The resulting multiple alignments were shaded using the BoxShade 3.21 program (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). Three-dimensional structural comparisons of PEP-consuming proteins were done using Swiss-Pdbviewer, version 3.5b1 (www.expasy.ch/spdbv/mainpage.htm). Compounds1–4 are phosphate and phosphonate enol esters, and as such they are potential substrates of EI. The Z- andE-isomers of 3-Cl-PEP (compounds 1 and2, respectively) function as alternative substrates in the phosphotransferase assay, whereas the PEP derivatives with modifications in the carboxylic (3) or phosphate group (4) do not (Fig. 1 and TableI). Because Z-Cl-PEP also acts as a suicide inhibitor (see below), EI becomes irreversibly inhibited during the time of the assay. More than 50% inactivation was detected at the highest concentration of 1 after 2 min. For that reason, the initial rates measured for Z-Cl-PEP have been also corrected for the progressive inactivation.Table IKinetic data from compounds 1–4 as phosphoryl donors to EI and as inhibitors of PEP phosphorylationSubstrate[EI]1-aConcentration of EI used to derive the kinetic data.k catK mk cat/K mK I 1-bDetermined at 0.017 μm EI.μmmin −1mmmm −1 min −1mmPEP0.0172,200 ± 400.14 ± 0.0116,000 ± 1,240Z-Cl-PEP2.516 ± 10.04 ± 0.01400 ± 1060.42 ± 0.03Z-Cl-PEP1-cInitial rates were corrected for irreversible inactivation occurring during the assay (Fig. 1) before fitting.2.542 ± 20.08 ± 0.02500 ± 110E-Cl-PEP12.53.6 ± 0.20.12 ± 0.0230 ± 4>101-dNo inhibition detected.

For further details, see “Experimental Procedures.” The Km values of EI for 1 (0.04–0.08 mm) and for 2 (0.12 mm) are comparable with the Km determined for PEP (0.14 mm), which is also close to the published one (0.18 mm) (28Waygood E.B. Steeves T. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the turnover numbers (k cat) of EI for Z-Cl-PEP andE-Cl-PEP are 2 and 3 orders of magnitude smaller, respectively, than for PEP (Table I). It is important to point out that the EI concentration had to be increased 100–1,000-fold to detect turnover with compounds 1 and 2. Consequently, the EI dimer:monomer ratio is expected to increase. Because the dimer probably is the most active species, the difference between the catalytic constants for PEP and the 3-Cl-PEP analogs might be underestimated. Similar results have been reported for other PEP-consuming enzymes. For example, Z-Cl-PEP and Z-F-PEP are 3 orders of magnitude worse substrates than PEP for pyruvate kinase and enolase (33Duffy T.H. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Stubbe J.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 50Liu J.

Enzymatic preference for the Z-isomer is also a common feature of PEP-utilizing enzymes, e.g. PEPCK, PPDK, and enolase (33Duffy T.H. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and it had been already observed with EI (43Hoving H. Nowak T. Robillard G.T.

Because the catalytic efficiencies of 1–4 are very small, compared with PEP, these compounds can also be studied as inhibitors.Z-Cl-PEP inhibits PEP phosphoryl trans"

MAP kinases are regulated by a cascade composed of a three-kinase module in which a MAP/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK or MAP3K) activates a MEK (also known as MKK or MAP2K), the dual specificity kinase that activates the MAP kinase. In yeast systems, five MAP kinase pathways have been described (5Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar); more than a dozen MAP kinases are encoded in the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans(6Plowman G.D.

The best characterized MAP kinase module contains the mitogen-sensitive ERK1 and ERK2, and a second module contains the related protein ERK5. Other well characterized modules contain the stress-sensitive c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases and p38 MAP kinases, which respond to inflammatory cytokines and osmotic shock, among other stresses (1Lewis T.S.

Interestingly, ERK3 homologs are not present in budding yeast or the nematode C. elegans, indicating that ERK3 is a relatively late addition to the metazoan signaling repertoire. A cDNA encoding ERK3 was cloned 10 years ago using an ERK1-derived cDNA probe (14Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J., Ip, N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H.

Several key properties of ERK3 set it apart from the classical MAP kinases, despite the fact that ERK3 is ∼50% identical to ERK1 and ERK2 in its catalytic core, making ERK3 one of their closest relatives. First, ERK3 contains a long C-terminal extension. Proteins of 63 and 95–100 kDa have been reported and are represented by cDNAs from several species that probably are derived from two distinct genes (9Zhu A.X. Zhao Y.I. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Mol.

In ERK5, which also contains a C-terminal domain following the kinase catalytic core, the extension may harbor an autoinhibitory motif; however, to date no function for the ERK3 C-terminal extension has been described, and its removal does not affect the few properties of the enzyme that are known (8Cheng M.

Second, ERK3 is unique among the MAP kinases in that it contains only a single phosphorylation site (serine 189) in its activation loop. The other MAP kinases have the sequence TXY in the loop, but ERK3 contains SEG, with glycine in place of the tyrosine. In ERK2 phosphorylation of tyrosine in this loop causes a refolding of the protein substrate-binding site and is required for the observed kinetic and threshold behavior of its cascade (18Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 19Ferrell J.E. Machleder E.M.

This distinction implies that activation by upstream regulators and interactions with substrates are likely to occur differently with ERK3 than with other family members. Consistent with these suggestions, none of the currently known MEK family members is able to phosphorylate and activate ERK3, and no physiological substrates of ERK3, other than itself, have yet been found. An ERK3 kinase activity has been partially purified that recognizes ERK3 alone of the known MAP kinases, phosphorylating it on serine 189 in the activation loop (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because ERK3 does not phosphorylate other substrates tested, it has not been possible to determine whether phosphorylation increases its activity. Finally, ERK3 is localized constitutively to the nucleus despite the lack of a traditional nuclear localization sequence. This is in contrast to ERK1 and ERK2, which translocate to the nucleus upon phosphorylation by MEKs via a mechanism that may, at least in the case of ERK2, be enhanced by the formation of kinase dimers (21Khokhlatchev A. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J.L. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 22Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To examine the basis for differences in these two MAP kinase family members, we made two chimeric proteins between ERK2 and ERK3. One chimera contained the N-terminal folding domain of ERK3 and the C-terminal folding domain of ERK2, and the other contained the N-terminal folding domain of ERK2 and the rest of the catalytic domain of ERK3. In addition, we exchanged the ERK2 and ERK3 residues in the common docking motif, a region of MAP kinases believed to interact with the docking (D) motif of MEKs and other proteins. We find that the C-terminal portion of the catalytic core is significantly responsible for localization of the kinases. However, the chimera containing the C terminus of ERK2, although found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of resting cells, can no longer accumulate in the nucleus upon activation nor is it exported from the nucleus by overexpression of MEK1. Finally, although either of the two folding domains of the kinase core is sufficient for MEK recognition in vitro, in transfected cells the N-terminal region of ERK2 is important for its activation in a manner not revealed by in vitro assays, perhaps due to the formation of multiprotein complexes. These results will be discussed in the context of known sites of MEK1-ERK1/2 interaction (23Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell.

The construct encoding the ERK3/2 chimera was produced using the unique SphI site in ERK3 at the codon for His-128 in subdomain V (Fig. 1 B). A rat ERK2 fragment encoding Ile-123 (located in the same region of subdomain V) through the end of ERK2 was obtained using PCR and ligated to an ERK3 fragment encoding residues 1–128. This chimera DNA and the one described below were subcloned into pGEX-KG and pCMV5/Myc for bacterial and mammalian expression, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate the construct encoding ERK2/3ΔC, approximately the same junction in subdomain V of the MAP kinases was used. Both fragments encoding the MAP kinases were obtained via PCR. AnNcoI-XhoI fragment encoding the N terminus of ERK2 and an XhoI-HindIII fragment encoding the C-terminal half of the catalytic domain of ERK3 were ligated to create the second chimera. Amino acid changes resulting from the addition of the new restriction sites are shown in Fig. 1 B. The aspartate to alanine and CD motif mutations were introduced with the QuikChange double-stranded DNA mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. BL21-DE3pLys bacteria containing GST fusion protein plasmids were grown in Terrific Broth at 30 °C to an A 600 of ∼0.6–0.8 and then induced with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. Proteins were purified from lysates over glutathione-agarose as described (28Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar, 29Robinson M.J. Cheng M.

Phosphorylated and active MEK1, MEK2, and MEK3 were purified as described previously (30Khokhlatchev A., Xu, S. English J., Wu, P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). MEK4 was activated by a catalytic fragment of MEKK1 as described previously (29Robinson M.J. Cheng M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29734-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); MEK6, which has high basal activity, was used without activation. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (29Robinson M.J. Cheng M. Khokhlatchev A. Ebert D. Ahn N. Guan K. Stein B. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

To measure ERK3 kinase activity, either partially purified ERK3 kinase or pig brain cytosol (gift of P. Sternweis, University of Texas Southwestern) was added to glutathione-agarose beads previously bound to GST fused to ERK3ΔC (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), ERK2, ERK3/2, or ERK2/3ΔC. Samples were rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were then washed with 1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, and once with kinase buffer (see below). Under these conditions, the ERK3 kinase remains tightly bound to the ERK3 on the beads (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the GST fusion proteins was initiated by addition of MgATP trace-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to the beads, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected using calcium-phosphate (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 10 μg of ERK chimera plasmids were used per 60-mm plate unless otherwise indicated. Lysates from the cells that were serum-starved for 24 h were prepared 48 h after transfection. For the ERK2/3ΔC chimera, lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (29Robinson M.J. Cheng M. Khokhlatchev A.

For all other proteins, lysates were prepared in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40. The anti-Myc antibody was from the Cell Culture Center and was used at 1:100 for blotting. The anti-hemagglutinin antibody 12CA5 (Babco, Richmond, CA) was used for Rsk immunoprecipitations and blotting. The anti-phospho-ERK2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs and was used as suggested by the manufacturer. All immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were done as described previously (32Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HA-Rsk activity was assessed using the substrate GST-S6 as previously described (32Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both constructs were the generous gift of J. Blenis (Harvard University). HEK293 cells were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips and transfected as above. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min and were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, slips were incubated in anti-Myc antibody (1:100) for 1 h at 37 °C and in anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (1:2000) for 30 min at 37 °C. To visualize the nucleus, slips were incubated with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 2 min at room temperature. The two chimeras of ERK2 and ERK3 and the mutants in which residues from the CD motifs have been exchanged are diagrammed in Fig.1 A. One chimera, ERK3/2, contains the N-terminal half of the ERK3 catalytic core, subdomains I–V, and the C-terminal half of the ERK2 catalytic core, subdomain V through the end of the ERK2 coding sequence. The second chimera, ERK2/3ΔC, contains subdomains I–V of ERK2 and the rest of the catalytic domain of ERK3, but lacks the C-terminal 180 residues of the 63-kDa form of ERK3. Deletion of these residues has a negligible effect on the subcellular localization of ERK3 or its binding to or phosphorylation by a partially purified ERK3 kinase (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J.

The sequences at the junctions of the two domains are shown in Fig.1 B, and the sequences encompassing the CD motifs are indicated in Fig. 1 C with the conserved residues inbold and the residues that were exchangedunderlined (Tyr-315 and Asp-316 of ERK2 exchanged for Ser-320 and Phe-321, respectively, the comparable positions of ERK3).

Open table in a new tab The two chimeras were expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria and were the predicted size (Fig. 1 D). A doublet was often observed with ERK2/3ΔC; both bands cross-reacted with anti-GST and anti-ERK3 antibodies (data not shown). ERK2 and ERK3 are not phosphorylated by the same upstream kinases (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of the two chimeras to be phosphorylated by MEK1, MEK2, and the ERK3 kinase in vitroto ascertain if specificity-determining regions could be mapped to either half of the catalytic domain. Brunet and Pouysségur (33Brunet A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1653-1655Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) suggested that MAP kinase subdomains I–V, the N-terminal half of its catalytic core, determine the upstream MEKs that will phosphorylate a MAP kinase in cells. If this is the case in vitro, the ERK3/2 chimera should not be recognized by the ERK2-selective enzymes MEK1 and MEK2. Because it contains the protein substrate-binding site, ERK3/2 should phosphorylate ERK2 substrates. As shown in Fig.2 A, ERK3/2 was phosphorylated by MEK1 and MEK2 with a stoichiometry similar to that for ERK2 (29Robinson M.J. Cheng M. Khokhlatchev A. Ebert D. Ahn N. Guan K. Stein B. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29734-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both tyrosine and threonine were phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B), and the rate of phosphorylation was only slightly slower than that for ERK2 (Fig. 2 C). Like ERK2, ERK3/2 was not phosphorylated by MEK3, -4, or -6 (data not shown). After phosphorylation, the ERK3/2 chimera displayed a specific activity of ∼200 nmol/min/mg with myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate (Fig. 2 D); this is more than a 100-fold increase in activity compared with unphosphorylated protein and about 10–20% of the value for wild type-phosphorylated ERK2. Because the stoichiometries of ERK3/2 phosphorylation by MEK1 and MEK2 were not significantly different from those of ERK2, the lower MBP kinase activity is most likely due to minor changes in folding of the chimera in the active site. No substrates of ERK3 other than itself have been identified; thus, there has been a question about its capacity to catalyze phosphoryl transfer. The relatively high activity of the chimera containing the N-terminal domain of ERK3 indicates that ERK3 can interact with ATP in a manner appropriate for catalysis. The ERK2/3ΔC chimera was phosphorylated poorly by all the MEKs but was reproducibly phosphorylated to a small extent by MEK2 (Fig.2 A), consistent with the weak phosphorylation of ERK3 by MEK2 and its lack of phosphorylation by other known MEK family members (29Robinson M.J. Cheng M. Khokhlatchev A. Ebert D. Ahn N. Guan K. Stein B. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29734-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Also consistent with earlier experiments, no detectable increase in kinase activity could be measured using MBP (data not shown). Previously, we partially purified an activity that bound to ERK3 (and ERK 3ΔC) and phosphorylated it on serine 189. This activity did not bind or phosphorylate other MAP kinases (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether this ERK3 kinase could bind and phosphorylate either of the chimeric proteins. The two chimeras were attached to glutathione beads and incubated with pig brain cytosol containing ERK3 kinase activity. The ERK3 kinase bound to both chimeras, as assessed by the ability of the activity on the beads to phosphorylate exogenously added full-length ERK3 (see below and data not shown). The ERK3 kinase also phosphorylated ERK2/3ΔC (Fig.3 A). However, the extent of chimera phosphorylation was much less than that of ERK3 itself (Fig.3 B). When serine 189 was mutated to alanine, the ERK3 kinase no longer phosphorylated ERK3ΔC, consistent with its previously characterized specificity (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ERK2 neither binds nor is phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the ERK3 kinase bound to the ERK3/2 chimera, this chimera was not phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase (Fig. 3 B), supporting the previously suggested distinction in the ability to bind and the inherent enzymatic specificity of this kinase. These results indicate that the ERK3 kinase interacts strongly with both domains of ERK3. Thein vitro results suggested that the C-terminal domain of ERK2 is sufficient for recognition by MEK1 and -2, consistent with the presence of the common docking (CD) motif in this domain (23Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 24Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol.

Psychiatry. 2000; 48: 665-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The CD motif is involved in binding MEK1, substrates, and certain MAP kinase phosphatases (23Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship of our findings to the work of Brunet and Pouysségur (33Brunet A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1653-1655Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar), who characterized regulation of ERK1-p38 chimeras in transfected cells, we expressed epitope-tagged forms of ERK2, ERK3ΔC, and the chimeras in mammalian cells, and we examined their regulation by components of the ERK/MAP kinase cascade (Fig. 4). As expected, neither ERK3ΔC nor ERK2/3ΔC were detectably activated in cells by any of the agents, as measured by phosphorylation of MBP (data not shown). This is consistent with the lack of MBP kinase activity of ERK3 after phosphorylation by the ERK3 kinase (8Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Activity in ERK2/3ΔC immunoprecipitates from MEK1-cotransfected cells was due to a coprecipitating kinase, based on the observation that mutation of an essential catalytic residue in ERK2/3ΔC (D of subdomain VII to A) produced an immunoprecipitate with equivalent activity. ERK3/2 was activated only weakly in cells by coexpression with wild type MEK1 or MEK2, typical of their effects on wild type ERK2 (Fig.4 A). On the other hand, the highly active mutant form of MEK1, MEK1R4F, activated ERK3/2 nearly as well as it activated ERK2 (Fig. 4 A). Although MEK2 activated the 3/2 chimera betterin vitro than did MEK1, in cells the activated MEK2 mutant, MEK2R4F, activated the 3/2 chimera much less well than MEK1R4F. We next tested the ability of more upstream components of the cascade to activate ERK3/2. Contrary to expectations, neither RafBXB, a constitutively active form of Raf, nor RasV12activated ERK3/2 to a significant extent. Their effects were much less than those of either MEK1R4F or MEK2R4F. Thus, activators of the ERK2 pathway were not equally effective in stimulating the ERK3/2 chimera, although they had the expected effects on ERK2. ERK3/2 also possessed the ability to activate the ERK2 substrate p90Rsk in cells. As seen in Fig. 4 B, neither ERK2 nor ERK3/2 alone stimulated Rsk activity. MEK1R4F stimulated Rsk activity due to phosphorylation by endogenous ERK1/2. However, when overexpressed in the presence of MEK1R4F, both ERK2 and ERK3/2 show an equal ability to activate Rsk further. Under these conditions expression of ERK2 is generally greater than ERK3/2 (Fig.4 C). This suggests that when expressed in cells, the chimera recognizes ERK2 substrates, consistent with the presence in this chimera of the CD site localized to the C-terminal half of ERK2 (23Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar,24Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol.

ERK2 is predominantly cytosolic until cell stimulation at which time it accumulates in the nucleus (17Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Cadmium (Cd), 1The abbreviations used are:CdcadmiumMTmetallothioneinsCRPcysteine-rich proteinCIP2cadmium-induced proteinYCF1yeast cadmium factor 1 for example, has been utilized eight times more during the last 40 years by mankind than in its entire history; the Cd2+ input into biosphere is estimated to be about 30,000 tons/year (1Nriagu J.O.

The situation is deteriorating due to the acid rain that mobilizes the soil-bound Cd thus increasing the bioavailability of Cd (4Stöppler M. Merian E. Metals and Their Compounds in the Environment. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1991: 803-851Google Scholar). Cd is highly toxic because of its strong affinity to purines, pyrimidines, phosphates, porphyrins, and the cysteine and histidine residues of proteins (5Vallee B.L. Ulmer D.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 91-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 6Jacobson K.B. Turner J.E. Toxicology. 1980; 16: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, organisms are able, at least in part, to cope with the toxic Cd. This is primarily ascribed to metallothioneins (MTs), cysteine-rich 6–7-kDa proteins ubiquitously expressed among eukaryotes as well as in some prokaryotes (7Kägi J.H.R. Suzuki K.Y. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1993: 29-55Google Scholar, 8Klaassen C.D. Liu J. Choudhuri S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

MTs contain an α-domain and a β-domain, each with characteristic sequence arrangements of cysteines. The constitutively expressed MTs are obviously able to detoxify Cd (10Ghoshal K. Jacob S.T. Prog.

Rather, MTs appear to control cellular zinc distribution, translocation, and availability (11Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), although, besides other functions, they may also act as general anti-stress factors (12Miles A.T. Hawksworth G.M. Beattie J.H. Rodilla V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 35-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). cadmium metallothioneins cysteine-rich protein cadmium-induced protein yeast cadmium factor 1 Scarce information is available suggesting that, besides MTs, also larger non-MT proteins are involved in Cd detoxification (13Stone H. Overnell J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Comp. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1985; 80: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the investigation of these non-MTs has been oddly neglected to date. Especially some invertebrates have been reported to contain Cd-binding non-MTs but without any evidence for their role in Cd detoxification or molecular characterization (14Bauer-Hilty A. Dallinger R. Berger B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Comp. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1989; 94: 373-379Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Morgan J.E. Norey C.G. Morgan A.J. Kay J. Comp. Biochem.

Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have identified a putative Cd-binding non-MT protein as a cDNA in the earthwormEnchytraeus using differential screening of cDNA library (18Willuhn J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Greven H. Wunderlich F. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 1994; 29: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19Willuhn J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Greven H. Wunderlich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24688-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These small oligochaete worms of high ecological relevance due to their function in soil formation and preservation are capable of surviving in acidic soils highly contaminated with Cd (20Didden W.A.M. Pedobiologia. 1993; 37: 2-29Google Scholar). The identified cDNA of Enchytraeus encodes a putativecysteine-rich non-MT 25-kDaprotein, termed CRP, with eight tandemly arranged repeats exhibiting a characteristic conserved arrangement of cysteines (19Willuhn J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Greven H. Wunderlich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24688-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crp gene is induced by Cd, and its transcript level positively correlates with Cd accumulation of worms (21Willuhn J. Otto A. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Wunderlich F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, Cd inducibility of crp-mRNA does not necessarily mean that the CRP protein is directly involved in Cd detoxification. Indeed, a Cd-inducible mRNA encoding the non-MT CIP2 (cadmium-induced protein) has been recently detected in the fungus Candida sp. (22Park K.S. Kwon J. Choi S.Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 162: 325-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the only 4 cysteines containing CIP2 is presumably not a Cd-binding protein, and it is not directly involved in Cd detoxification. Rather it is assumed to be involved in coping with the oxidative stress induced by Cd. Here, we provide experimental evidence for the actual role of the non-MT CRP protein in Cd detoxification. Transformation of crp-cDNA into Cd-hypersensitive yeast dramatically increases their Cd resistance, the extent of which is dependent on the number of CRP repeats and on the position of the different cysteines in a given CRP repeat. Yeast expression vector pRS425 (23Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. G. Jansen (Institute of Microbiology, Heinrich-Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany), was modified by inserting a 6× c-Myc tag as N-terminal fusion. Different arrangements of crp repeats were constructed by amplifying corresponding regions of the 1474-bp crp-cDNA (GenBankTM accession number X79344) and inserting the PCR products in the SalI restriction site of pRS425. Constructs of crp repeat 4 were cloned in pRS425 vector without a 6× c-Myc tag. This was performed with the “Altered Sites II in Vitro Mutagenesis” system (Promega, Madison, WI). In brief, PCR-generated fragments of the complete coding region of the crp-cDNA (753 bp) and the crp repeat 4 (93 bp) were cloned in the SalI site of vector pALTER-1. Oligonucleotides used for mutation of the nine cysteines of repeat 4 and the conserved residues at the repeat junctions 4/5 and 6/7, respectively, were as follows: Cys1(5′-GAGTCGACAATGAGCTCCTGTGGTT); Cys3(5′-ACAATGTGCTCCAGTGGTTCAGGA); Cys7(5′-TGTGGTTCAGGAAGTAAGTGTGAGA); Cys9(5′-TCAGGATGTAAGAGTGAGAAGGGA); Cys14(5′-GAGAAGGGAGAGAGTAAGCCAGGTT); Cys18(5′-GTAAGCCAGGTAGTACCAAGCGA); Cys22(5′-GTACCAAGCGAAGCTGTGGTACTA); Cys23(5′-ACCAAGCGATGCAGTGGTACTAAA); Cys27(5′-GTGGTACTAAAAGTGGAGTTGAA G); r4/5 (5′-TTGAAGATTGCCTATGTGGTCGTCCAAG); r6/7 (5′-TGTGGAATGCAGAACTGCCCGTGTG). The reactions of mutagenesis were performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Mutated crp inserts were finally cloned into the SalI site of yeast vector pRS425. Clones were sequenced using the LICOR 4000 laser fluorescent sequencing system as described recently (24Krücken J. Stamm O. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Wunderlich F. J. Biol.

The isogenic yeast strains DTY165 (strain SEY6210; MATα ura3-52, leu2-3,-112, his3-D200, trp1-D901, lys2-801, suc2-D9) and DTY167 (strain JW53F;MATα ura3-52, leu2-3,-112, his3-D200, trp1-D901, lys2-801, suc2-D9, ycf1::hisG) were used for the experiments (30Li Z.-S., Lu, Y.-P. Zhen R.-G. Sczcypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Yeast cells transformed with expression vector pRS425 were selected on minimal SD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose) without leucine and methionine. For the different assays of Cd resistance, 5 ml of yeast pre-cultures were grown for 24 h in minimal SD before inoculating SD medium containing CdCl2(initial A 600 = 0.005). Those assays with yeast cells expressing the different CRP fragments (Fig. 3) were performed in a total volume of 7 ml in 10-ml test tubes, those assays with the mutagenic CRP-r4 fragments in 20 ml in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Optical density of the cultures was determined after 72 h of growth at different Cd concentrations. Generation times were determined at the subtoxic Cd concentrations of 30 and 40 μm, respectively. Each experiment was reproduced at least three times. Data are shown with means ± S.D. Proteins extracted from yeast cells were separated by SDS-PAGE (31Lämmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and processed as detailed previously (24Krücken J.

The filters were blocked with Rotiblock (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and then incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:25,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, CT) as a secondary antibody before detection with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protein loading on filters was examined with a goat anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Exponentially growing DTY167 cells transformed with c-Myc-tagged crp constructs (2A 600 units) were fixed with 5% paraformaldehyde at 30 °C for 4 h. Spheroplasts were prepared using 100 units of lyticase (Sigma), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 3000 units of β-glucuronidase (type HP-2S) (Sigma), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min and treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (32Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Aliquots were allowed to adhere onto polylysine-coated glass coverslips. The c-Myc-tagged CRP proteins were detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody (1 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 working dilution) as secondary antibody (Sigma). Coverslips were finally mounted on slides in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of glycerol and vectashield (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) containing 2% (w/v) 1,4-diazobicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (Merck) and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Fluorescence was analyzed with the confocal laser scanning microsopy Leica TCS version 1.5.451 (Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) as detailed recently (33Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Giese G. Wrehlke C. Stamm O. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Wunderlich F. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 34Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Guo Z. Wunderlich F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 123-133Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The crp gene of Enchytraeus encodes the putative non-MT 25-kDa CRP protein consisting of eight tandemly arranged repeats (Fig. 1 A). The repeats 1–7 contain 31 amino acids, whereas the repeat 8 is truncated at the C terminus (19Willuhn J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Greven H. Wunderlich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24688-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The repeats exhibit a characteristic arrangement of nine cysteines in Cys-X-Cys and Cys-Cys segments as it is shown for the consensus sequence of the CRP repeats (Fig. 1 A). Data bank analysis does not reveal the existence of any other protein similar to CRP. Only the much smaller 6–7-kDa MTs exhibit sequence similarities. The MTs from oligochaetes such asLumbricus terrestris, Lumbricus rubellus, andEisenia foetida display the highest identities of more than 50% to the same CRP region comprising repeats 2–4 in highly scored alignments. The MT of the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans surprisingly aligns with only 37% identity to CRP repeats 6–8. Incidentally, the MT of C. elegans also exhibits lower identities in comparison with other invertebrate MTs (35Dallinger R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Comp. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1996; 113: 125-133PubMed Google Scholar). The MT ofDrosophila melanogaster exhibits 46% identities to CRP repeat 3. The mouse MT-I and MT-II align best to CRP repeat 3 as those MTs of the other oligochaetes, although with lower identities. Like MT-I of C. elegans, mouse MT-IV is highly identical to CRP repeats 6–8, whereas mouse MT-III fits best to CRP repeat 2. Human MT-I, -II, and -IV align predominantly to repeat CRP regions 4–6, whereas the human and the mouse MT-III show highest identities of about 37% to CRP repeats 2 and 3. The multiple sequence alignment in Fig.1 B shows that there is a conspicuous conserved distribution of the cysteines in the CRP repeats and in the different MTs, besides some other amino acids such as glycine, lysine, and serine. For expression in yeast, diverse crp constructs were generated by PCR (Fig. 2 A). All crp constructs, with the exception of crp-r4, were N-terminally tagged with a 8-kDa 6× c-Myc by cloning in yeast expression vector pRS425 under the control of a MET25 promoter (23Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The crp-r4 construct was cloned in pRS425 without a c-Myc tag to avoid possible steric hindrance by the c-Myc polypeptide. All constructs were transformed in Cd-hypersensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain DTY167 (30Li Z.-S., Lu, Y.-P. Zhen R.-G. Sczcypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), which harbors an inactivated gene for theyeast Cd factor (ycf1), normally required for Cd resistance (36Szczypka M. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crp constructs are expressed in approximately equal amounts in yeast (Fig. 2 B). The expression rate is low, because the CRP polypeptides are not detectable in Coomassie-stained SDS gels but only by Western blot analysis using anti-c-Myc antibody. Confocal laser scanning microscopy reveals that the 25-kDa CRP is exclusively localized in the cytoplasm but not in the vacuole or nuclei of yeast cells (Fig.2 C). In order to investigate the possible role of CRP in mediating Cd resistance, the DTY167 cells expressing the 25-kDa CRP (strain designated as DTY167-CRP), the isogenic wild-type DTY165 cells, and the Cd-hypersensitive DTY167-pRS425 cells transformed with empty vector were exposed for 72 h to Cd2+ concentrations up to 500 μm (Fig. 3 A). The DTY167-CRP cells do not only restore the Cd resistance but even exhibit a dramatically increased Cd resistance in comparison with wild-type DTY165 cells. At 100 μm Cd2+, DTY167-CRP reaches about 90% of growth that can be observed for control cultures without Cd. By contrast, wild-type DTY165 cells only reach a level of about 60% at 100 μm Cd2+. There is no growth observed for DTY165 at 300 μmCd2+ and higher concentrations. However, strain DTY167-CRP even tolerates 500 μm Cd2+, because it still reaches 20% of growth level of the untreated control (Fig.3 A). The hypersensitive DTY167-pRS425 cells are unable to grow at the used Cd2+ concentrations. The levels of Cd resistance restored in DTY167 positively correlate with the increasing number of CRP repeats (Fig. 3 B). All transformants expressing CRP repeats, except for DTY167-CRP-r4, show comparable growth at 100 μm Cd2+ after 72 h. Deletion of the N-terminal region and repeat 1 (DTY167-CRPΔr1) has no significant influence on the Cd resistance compared with DTY167-CRP (Fig. 3 B). The five repeats expressing transformants DTY167-CRP-r12345 and DTY167-CRP-r12678 have identical growth rates, but both display much lower resistance at 300 μm Cd2+ and higher Cd2+concentrations compared with DTY167-CRP. Growth of these strains stops at 400 μm Cd2+. A further reduced Cd resistance is observed for those yeasts expressing only three repeats such as DTY167-CRP-r345 and DTY167-CRP-r678. They have equivalent levels of Cd resistance, although the three repeats expressed in the cells are different. Growth of both strains is completely inhibited at 300 μm Cd2+. DTY167-CRP-r4 cells still exhibit a slight Cd resistance at 100 μmCd2+, because they reach 15% of the growth of the untreated control cells. Depending on the number of expressed repeats, generation times span between 3.17 ± 0.23 h for DTY167-CRP and 4.60 ± 0.64 h for DTY167-CRP-r4 at 40 μmCd2+, whereas hypersensitive DTY167-pRS425 cells double only after 13.65 ± 1.73 h at this Cd concentration. In order to investigate the importance of the individual Cys residues within a given CRP repeat for Cd resistance, Cys → Ser replacements were introduced in crp-r4 by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. The nine mutated crp-r4 constructs cloned in vector pRS425 were transformed in hypersensitive strain DTY167 and exposed to 100 μm Cd2+ for 72 h. All Cys mutants reveal a dramatic decrease in Cd resistance compared with wild-type CRP-r4 expressing DTY167. Incidentally, the latter cells exhibit different growth depending on the used experimental conditions (cf.Figs. 3 and 4). The extent of the decreased Cd resistance depends solely on the mutated Cys position in crp-r4 (Fig.4). Cys3, Cys14, Cys22, and Cys23 are obviously of particular importance, because Cd resistance of the corresponding mutants decreases almost to the level of hypersensitive DTY167-pRS425 cells. Cys9 and Cys18 mutants confer a slightly better resistance since reaching about 10% of the growth of DTY167-CRP-r4. Mutations of Cys1, Cys7, or Cys27are less influential on Cd resistance than the other Cys positions, as the growth of these mutants is reduced by only 60% compared with DTY167-CRP-r4. Moreover, determination of generation times at a sub-lethal concentration of 30 μm Cd2+confirms the relevance of Cys3. Mutation of that position at least doubles the generation time to 7.9 ± 0.4 h, whereas the generation times of the other mutants span between 3.26 ± 0.08 h (Cys27) and 3.78 ± 0.28 h (Cys22). However, wild-type DTY167-CRP-r4 has a doubling time of 3.08 ± 0.1 h at the same Cd concentration. Besides the conserved Cys residues in the CRP repeats, there are also other conserved amino acids such as Gly, Pro, Val, and Asp at the repeat junctions (Fig. 5 A). In order to investigate their role in functioning of CRP in Cd resistance, oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was used to generate amino acid replacements at two repeat junctions in the 25-kDa CRP (Fig. 5 A). A Pro136 → Leu replacement was introduced in repeat 5 at the junction between repeat 4 → 5, and the mutated cDNA, cloned in pRS425, was expressed in strain DTY167 (designated as DTY167-CRPm4/5). Furthermore, a mutant CRP with an Asp196 → Asn replacement in repeat 6 at repeat junction 6 → 7 was constructed (DTY167-CRPm5/6). Comparative determination of the generation times at sub-lethal 40 μm Cd2+and the growth in increasing Cd2+ concentrations up to 750 μm reveal no significant difference in Cd resistance among native DTY167-CRP, DTY167-CRPm4/5, and DTY167-CRPm6/7 (Fig.5 B). Our data provide evidence that, besides MTs, also larger non-MT cysteine-rich proteins are able to detoxify Cd. Indeed, the non-MT 25-kDa CRP protein of the terrestric earthworm Enchytraeusmediates Cd resistance to the Cd-hypersensitive yeast strain DTY167 when transformed by crp. Remarkably, Cd resistance is not only restored but rather dramatically increased in comparison to isogenic wild-type yeast. The CRP protein is unique to date, i.e. data bank analysis does not reveal any other similar non-MT protein in any other organism. The best fitting alignments can be obtained with MT of different sources. MT of other earthworms such as Lumbricus (37Stürzenbaum S.R. Kille P. Morgan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) orEisenia (38Gruber C. Stürzenbaum S. Gehrig P. Sack R. Hunziker P. Berger B. Dallinger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) display the best identities of about 50–53% to distinct regions of CRP, and even the more distant and diverse MT types of mouse and human exhibit identities of 37–44%. Besides the conserved cysteines, both MT and CRP contain still other conserved amino acids such as lysines, glycines, and serines. This structural similarity suggests a role of CRP in Cd detoxification similar to that of MT. Accordingly, mammalian MTs has been shown to mediate Cd resistance in yeast (39Cody C.W. Huang P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In yeast, Cd resistance is normally regulated by complex mechanisms. These involve GSH, the GSH-derived phytochelatins, and diverse membrane transporters (40Perego P. Howell S.B. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 147: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The hypersensitive strain we used in our study harbors an inactive ycf1 (yeast cadmium factor) gene (30Li Z.-S., Lu, Y.-P. Zhen R.-G. Sczcypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding cassette YCF1 protein is localized in the vacuolar membrane and serves as a pump, which transports Cd as a glutathioneS-conjugate into the yeast vacuole (36Szczypka M. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Li Z.-S. Sczcypka M., Lu, Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A similar pump mechanism is mediated in yeast by the transporter MRP1, the human multidrug-associated protein (42Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C. Zaman G.J.R. Schinke A.H. Borst P. Martinoia E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6743-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). CRP does not simply replace the lost function of YCF1 in Cd resistance of yeast, but rather CRP works by a different mechanism. This view is substantiated by our finding that CRP is uniformly distributed among the cytoplasm and is not detectable in the vacuolar membrane, although the CRP contains a putative transmembrane domain at the N terminus (19Willuhn J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Greven H. Wunderlich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24688-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, two mechanisms of MT in Cd detoxification are considered as follows: (i) chelation of Cd through coordinate covalent bonds to –SH groups of cysteines and/or (ii) scavenging of free radicals originating during Cd-induced stress (8Klaassen C.D. Liu J. Choudhuri S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 267-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). CRP presumably functions by the same mechanisms. This view is supported by our finding that (i) Cd resistance of yeasts increases with increasing numbers of expressed CRP repeats and that (ii) mutations of distinct cysteines in a given CRP repeat result in a dramatic decrease or even loss of Cd resistance. However, our data also indicate differences in the mode of action of CRP and MT in Cd detoxification in yeast. First, each cysteine of a given CRP repeat is important for Cd resistance. Mutations of the cysteines in the CRP repeat at positions 1, 7, 9, and 27 result in a dramatic reduction of Cd resistance by at least 60%, whereas mutations in Cys3, Cys14, Cys18, Cys22, and Cys23 even result in a complete loss of the capability of mediating Cd resistance. By contrast, mammalian MTs expressed in yeast contain at least some cysteines without any effect on Cd resistance at all (43Chernaik M.L. Huang P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, S. cerevisiaeis known to contain only one MT, i.e. the Cu-MT encoded by the CUP1 gene (44Winge D.R. Nielson K.B. Gray W.R. Hamer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14464-14470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ecker D.J. Butt T.R. Sternberg E.J. Neeper M.P. Debouck C. Gorman J.A. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16895-16900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This gene is specifically induced by copper but not by Cd, and its physiological role is the detoxification of copper and not that of Cd (44Winge D.R. Nielson K.B. Gray W.R. Hamer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14464-14470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when expressed under a constitutive promoter, Cu-MT is then also able to confer resistance to Cd (45Ecker D.J. Butt T.R. Sternberg E.J. Neeper M.P. Debouck C. Gorman J.A. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16895-16900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the crp gene is not inducible by copper. However, if the gene is specifically induced by Cd, the copper toxicity is significantly decreased inEnchytraeus (21Willuhn J. Otto A. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Wunderlich F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 46Willuhn J. Otto A. Koewius H. Wunderlich F. Chemosphere. 1996; 32: 2205-2210Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Third, replacement of conserved amino acids other than the cysteines in MT results in a reduced Cd resistance of yeast hosts, whereas in CRP, substitution of conserved amino acids including the α-helix incompatible proline has no effect on CRP-mediated Cd resistance. The differences revealed between CRP and MT in yeast hosts support previous findings also revealing differences of CRP and MT at the RNA level. MT genes are constitutively expressed and respond to various stressors (47Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. Sheridan J.F. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). However, the crp gene is not constitutively expressed; it is specifically induced by Cd but not by other stressors such as lead, mercury, copper, or H2O2 (21Willuhn J. Otto A. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P.

Collectively, our data indicate (i) that the non-MT CRP protein is able to detoxify Cd and (ii) that this capability is dependent on the availability of –SH groups similar to MTs. Although our results in yeast cannot yet be considered as applying to the situation in the earthworm Enchytraeus without further studies, the differences in the regulation of expression of the crp and MT genes reported to date suggest different actual physiological roles of both proteins. We thank Dr. D. J. Thiele for providing the yeast strains DTY165 and DTY167."
