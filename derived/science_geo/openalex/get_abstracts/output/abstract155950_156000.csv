https://openalex.org/W2085909854,"Several nuclear hormone receptors involved in lipid metabolism form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and are activated by RXR agonists such as rexinoids. Animals treated with rexinoids exhibited marked changes in cholesterol balance, including inhibition of cholesterol absorption and repressed bile acid synthesis. Studies with receptor-selective agonists revealed that oxysterol receptors (LXRs) and the bile acid receptor (FXR) are the RXR heterodimeric partners that mediate these effects by regulating expression of the reverse cholesterol transporter, ABC1, and the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1, respectively. Thus, these RXR heterodimers serve as key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis by governing reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues, bile acid synthesis in liver, and cholesterol absorption in intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2018554367,Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB by proinflammatory stimuli leads to increased expression of genes involved in inflammation. Activation of NF-kappaB requires the activity of an inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB)-kinase (IKK) complex containing two kinases (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and the regulatory protein NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modifier). An amino-terminal alpha-helical region of NEMO associated with a carboxyl-terminal segment of IKKalpha and IKKbeta that we term the NEMO-binding domain (NBD). A cell-permeable NBD peptide blocked association of NEMO with the IKK complex and inhibited cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. The peptide also ameliorated inflammatory responses in two experimental mouse models of acute inflammation. The NBD provides a target for the development of drugs that would block proinflammatory activation of the IKK complex without inhibiting basal NF-kappaB activity.

Arsenite is believed to exert its biological effects through reaction with exposed sulfhydryl groups, especially pairs of adjacent thiols. Here, we describe the mechanism by which arsenite affects the NF-κB signaling pathway. Activation of transcription factor NF-κB depends on the integrity of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. We found that arsenite potently inhibits NF-κB and IKK activation by binding to Cys-179 in the activation loop of the IKK catalytic subunits, IKKα/β. The affinity of IKKβ for trivalent arsenic was verifiedin vitro by the ability of IKKβ to enhance the fluorescence of an arsenic-substituted fluorescein dye. The addition of 1,2-dithiol antidotes or replacement of Cys-179 with an alanine residue abolished dye binding to and arsenite inhibition of IKKβ. Overexpression of IKKβ (C179A) protects NF-κB from inhibition by arsenite, indicating that despite the involvement of a large number of distinct gene products in this activation pathway, the critical target for inhibition by arsenite is on the IKK catalytic subunits.

Liu Y.P. Longfellow D. Aposhian H.V. Beck B. Fowler B. Goyer R. Menzer R. Rossman T. Thompson C. Waalkes M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Despite its toxicity, potassium arsenite (Fowler's solution) has been used in the treatment of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin (2Farber E.M. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1992; 27: 640-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, treatment with Fowler's solution frequently results in malignant skin lesions and hyperkeratosis, as well as liver fibrosis and other pathologies (3Cuzick J. Evans S. Gillman M. Price-Evans D.A. Br. J. Cancer. 1982; 45: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Piontek M. Hengels K.J. Borchard F. Strohmeyer G. Dtsch. Med.

Hepatol. 1990; 11: 80-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar problems were found to be associated with chronic exposure to high levels of arsenite through ground water contamination, as most recently documented in West Bengal, where chronic arsenite intoxication has become a common occurrence (6Das D. Chatterjee A. Mandal B.K. Samanta G. Chakraborti D. Chanda B. Analyst. 1995; 120: 917-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemically, arsenite reacts with sulfhydryl groups and exhibits very high affinity to vicinal thiols. Many of the adverse effects of arsenite on biological systems may therefore be caused by its reaction with closely spaced cysteine residues on critical cellular proteins (7Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The exact biological targets that account for most of the toxic effects of chronic arsenite exposure are not known. Assuming that some of the effects of arsenite exposure are due to aberrant functions of the cell cycle and signal transduction machineries, we examined how arsenite affects mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).1 Incubation of cultured cells with sub-lethal doses of arsenite resulted in activation of all three major MAPK pathways, ERK, JNK, and p38 (8Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). 2W. Li and M. Karin, unpublished results. The activation of MAPKs by arsenite may explain its ability to act as a tumor promoter (1Abernathy C.O. Liu Y.P. Longfellow D. Aposhian H.V. Beck B. Fowler B. Goyer R. Menzer R. Rossman T.

Indeed, other tumor promoters, such as phorbol esters, also lead to MAPK activation. Some of the effects that chronic arsenite exposure exerts on skin biology, such as disregulated keratinocyte proliferation and hyperkeratosis, closely resemble those associated with selective inhibition of NF-κB activity in keratinocytes (9Seitz C.S.

We therefore investigated the effect of arsenite exposure on the NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB is a transcription factor that plays an important role in development of chronic inflammatory disease (11Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar). NF-κB is kept in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells through interaction with specific inhibitors, the IκBs (12Rothwarf, D. M. & Karin, M. (1999) Science, www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;1999/5/rel.Google Scholar). In response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, the IκBs are rapidly phosphorylated and degraded through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, resulting in the release of free NF-κB dimers, which translocate to the nucleus to induce transcription of target genes (13Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 15Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). The protein kinase responsible for IκB phosphorylation and degradation in response to proinflammatory stimuli, is the IκB kinase (IKK). IKK is a complex of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory and structural subunit, IKKγ/NEMO (12Rothwarf, D. M. & Karin, M. (1999) Science, www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;1999/5/rel.Google Scholar). The IKK complex serves as a convergence point both for positive inputs that lead to NF-κB activation (12Rothwarf, D. M. & Karin, M. (1999) Science, www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;1999/5/rel.Google Scholar) as well as negative regulators that inhibit NF-κB activation (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Ample evidence suggests that interference with IKK activity may lead to resolution of inflammatory disorders (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 15Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of IKK also sensitizes cells to induction of apoptosis (16Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.-F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 17Li Z.-W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Here, we show that arsenite is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation and that its interaction site includes a specific cysteine residue in the activation loop of the IKK catalytic subunits. Furthermore, we demonstrated that specific binding of an organoarsenical dye to IKKβ requires this cysteine residue (Cys-179) and that a substitution of Cys-179 with alanine generates an arsenite-insensitive form of IKKβ, the overexpression of which protects NF-κB activation from inhibition by arsenite. Cells were cultured in either Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (HeLa or HEK293) or RPMI 1640 (Jurkat) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were stimulated with either 20 ng/ml recombinant human tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), 10 ng/ml interleukin-1β (Sigma), or 25 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Sodium arsenite (Sigma), 2,3,-dimercaptopropanol, or British anti-Lewisite (BAL), and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) (all from Sigma) were dissolved in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium and used at the indicated concentrations. 1,2-Ethanoedithiol (EDT) was from Aldrich, and stock solutions were made in Me2SO daily. Transfections were performed as described (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) for HeLa and HEK293 cells. All of the expression vectors have been previously described (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G.

Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors), and extracts were used for electrophoretic mobility shift and IKK assays as described previously (20DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 21Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission spectrum of 250 nm (FlAsH-EDT2) (23Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) was measured before and after incubation with 100 ng/ml (about 1 nm) IKKβ or other proteins. IKKβ, expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus expression vectors, was affinity-purified (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). The proteins were incubated with FlAsH-EDT2 for 20 min in the absence of additional EDT before measuring the fluorescence emission spectrum as described (23Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of arsenite on NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation in TNFα-stimulated HeLa cells. Both NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation were efficiently inhibited upon incubation with at least 12.5 μm arsenite or more (Fig.1, a and b). No effect on the DNA binding activities of transcription factors Oct1 and Sp1 were observed in cells incubated with up to 100 μmarsenite (Fig. 1 a, lower panel). Arsenite also inhibited the IκB kinase activity of the IKK complex (Fig. 1 c). In HeLa cells, the half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) concentration for arsenite toward NF-κB DNA binding activity was 8.7 μm, and the IC50 toward IKK was 9.1 μm (Fig.1 d). Arsenite also inhibited IKK and NF-κB activation in response to either TNFα or interleukin-1 in HEK293 cells (results not shown). Similarly, arsenite inhibited IKK activity in phorbol ester-stimulated Jurkat cells (results not shown). Thus, inhibition of IKK catalytic activity, induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity, and IκBα degradation seem to occur independently of cell type and stimulus. As described previously (8Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), arsenite stimulated the kinase activities of JNK and p38 (data not shown) and did not prevent their activation by TNFα (Fig. 1 e). Cell death was assessed in HeLa cells after arsenite treatment. No significant increase in cell death was found after exposure to 200 μmarsenite for 2 h (data not shown). IKK can be activated by overexpression of two members of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) family: MEKK1 and the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (24Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine whether arsenite inhibits NIK-induced IKK activation, HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with Xpress-tagged NIK and HA-tagged IKKα or HA-tagged IKKβ (Fig.2 a). The cells were incubated with different concentrations of arsenite for 1 h, and endogenous IKK activity was measured 24 h after transfection. Under the conditions used, transiently expressed HA-IKKα or HA-IKKβ molecules are incorporated into functional cytokine-responsive 900-kDa IKK complexes, which can be isolated with antibodies to the HA epitope (22Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). NIK-induced IKK activity was inhibited by arsenite regardless of whether HA-IKKα or HA-IKKβ was used (Fig. 2 a). Arsenite was also effective in inhibiting MEKK1- and NIK-induced IKK activity in HEK293 cells (data not shown). Of the two catalytic subunits, IKKβ plays the major role in responding to proinflammatory stimuli and mediating their effect on NF-κB (12Rothwarf, D. M. & Karin, M. (1999) Science, www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;1999/5/rel.Google Scholar). Previously, the IKKβ subunit was also shown to be inhibited by a high concentration of the anti-inflammatory drug aspirin (25Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) and by the cyclopentenone prostaglandin, 15-deoxy Δ12–14 PGJ2 (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of arsenite on IKKβ activity, we used a constitutively active IKKβ variant, IKKβ(EE), in which the two phospho-acceptor serine residues in the activation loop were substituted by glutamic acid (19Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with HA-tagged IKKβ(EE); 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with arsenite for 1 h, and IKK activity was measured (Fig. 2 b). Arsenite did not affect IKKβ expression as determined by Western blot analysis, whereas it strongly inhibited IKKβ catalytic activity. We next investigated whether arsenite could inhibit IKK activityin vitro. HeLa cells were stimulated with TNFα for 15 min, endogenous IKK was immunoprecipitated, and its kinase activity was determined in the presence of increasing arsenite concentrations (Fig.2 c). Dose-dependent inhibition of IKK activity was observed with an IC50 = 14.2 μm. No significant inhibition of immunoprecipitated JNK1 activity was observed upon incubation with up to 200 μm arsenite (Fig.2 c). Because many protein kinase inhibitors compete with ATP binding (26Gray N.S. Wodicka L. Thunnissen A.M. Norman T.C. Kwon S. Espinoza F.H. Morgan D.O. Barnes G. LeClerc S. Meijer L. Kim S.H. Lockhart D.J. Schultz P.G. Science. 1998; 281: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of ATP on inhibition of IKK activity. However, preincubation in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP had no effect on the inhibition of recombinant IKKβ activity by arsenite (data not shown). To verify whether trivalent arsenite binds IKKβ, we exploited a recently developed organoarsenical derivative of fluorescein, FlAsH-EDT2, in which fluorescence is quenched until its arsenic substituents bind vicinal thiols in a polypeptide target (23Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Normally FlAsH-EDT2 is used in live cells in the presence of a modest excess of EDT or an analogous small 1,2-dithiol to prevent the FlAsH molecule from binding to sites with less than four preorganized cysteines. However, to make an in vitro binding assay comparable with treatment with arsenite in the absence of antidotes such as BAL, we measured the effect of purified recombinant IKKβ on the fluorescence of FlAsH-EDT2 in the absence of excess 1,2-dithiols such as EDT or BAL. The addition of IKKβ caused a large increase in fluorescence emission, whereas adding just buffer or IKKβ presaturated with 50 μm arsenite had a negligible effect (Fig. 3 a). IKKβ alone was not fluorescent, and its ability to increase FlAsH fluorescence was essentially reversed by the addition of 10 μm EDT, the conditions under which FlAsH is normally used specifically to label tetracysteine motifs in living cells (Fig.3 a). This reversal by EDT confirms that the binding of IKKβ is mainly via the arsenic groups of FlAsH, and that under the normal antidote concentrations used in labeling of live cells, FlAsH should not be significantly affecting IKKβ activity. The convenience of assaying FlAsH fluorescence in the absence of excess EDT facilitated quick screening of a variety of other purified proteins, none of which increased FlAsH fluorescence to anything like the extent of IKKβ (Fig. 3 b). Thus, FlAsH as a model organoarsenical interacts much more strongly with IKKβ than with many other proteins in this or other signaling pathways. A fluorescein derivative comparable with FlAsH but containing only one arsenic 3S. R. Adams and R. Y. Tsien, unpublished results. also increased fluorescence upon incubation with IKKβ (data not shown), indicating that only two cysteines are required for binding. However, the fluorogenic enhancement was by a smaller factor than with FlAsH-EDT2, probably because the monoarsenic derivative was not as fully quenched before protein addition, and a large excess of the fluorophore over protein was present under the conditions used. To confirm the parallelism between FlAsH binding and arsenite inhibition, we tested whether 1,2-dithiols like BAL and DMPS, which can reverse the binding of FlAsH to IKKβ (Fig. 3, a and b), can also protect IKK activity from arsenite. Pre-incubation of cells with BAL or DMPS indeed prevented subsequent inhibition of IKK activity by arsenite (Fig. 3 c). This result confirmed the effectiveness of these antidotes and suggested that they may be well enough retained in cells during a wash to combat a later arsenite challenge. Because trivalent arsenic strongly prefers binding to vicinal thiols, we examined the IKKβ kinase domain for critically positioned cysteines. Although no consecutive cysteines were present, we noticed that both IKKα and IKKβ, but not JNK1 or p38α, contain a cysteine (Cys-179) within their activation loops (Fig.4 a). As IKKα and IKKβ form homo- and heterodimers (21Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), it is possible that two Cys-179 residues may be adjacent within the dimer. Alternatively, they may be located within close proximity to another cysteine within the folded protein. To examine whether Cys-179 is critical for sensitivity to arsenite, we replaced it with alanine using site-directed mutagenesis. Both WT IKKβ or IKKβ (C179A) were co-expressed with NIK in HeLa cells, and their sensitivity to arsenite was examined. Although both constructs were equally responsive to NIK, resulting in similar levels of kinase activity, the IKKβ (C179A) mutant was fully resistant to inhibition by 50 μm arsenite, a dose sufficient for complete inhibition of the WT enzyme (Fig. 4 b). We also co-transfected an NF-κB-dependent transcriptional reporter (2XNFkB-LUC) with an expression vector encoding either WT IKKβ or IKKβ (C179A). A NIK expression vector was included to ensure maximal IKK activation. Although activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity in response to WT IKKβ was highly sensitive to arsenite, NF-κB activation in response to IKKβ (C179A) was insensitive to the inhibitor (Fig. 4 c). Recombinant IKKβ (C179A) expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus vector was also completely resistant to concentrations of arsenite that were inhibitory to WT IKKβ (Fig. 4 d). Furthermore, IKKβ (C179A) exhibited decreased binding to FlAsH as judged by its much reduced ability to enhance fluorescence emission of FlAsH-EDT2 (Fig. 4 e). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that arsenite inhibits IKK by direct modification of its catalytic subunits at a site that includes Cys-179. When the IKKβ subunit is rendered resistant to modification, very little inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity occurs in arsenite-treated cells. The pathological effects of arsenite are likely to be caused by modification of critical cysteine groups in cellular proteins or by its reaction with enzymes containing lipoic acid as a co-factor (7Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Despite such a potentially indiscriminate mechanism of toxicity, we found that arsenite exerts rather specific effects on cellular signal transduction pathways. Previously, we demonstrated that exposure to sublethal doses of arsenite results in potent activation of various MAPK signaling pathways, most notably JNK and p38 (8Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These effects were attributed to inhibition of MAPK phosphatases, enzymes that contain a critical cysteine in their catalytic pocket (8Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar).2 The present work demonstrates that in contrast to its positive effect on MAPK cascades, arsenite is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation because of its ability to directly inhibit IKK activity. Interestingly, the inhibition of IKK activity involves modification of Cys-179, which is critically positioned within the activation loop of the IKK catalytic subunits. Substitution of this cysteine with alanine prevents the inhibition of IKK activity and overexpression of the arsenite-resistant IKKβ (C179A) mutant protects NF-κB from arsenite-mediated inhibition. These results indicate that despite the involvement of at least 50 different proteins in NF-κB activation (12Rothwarf, D. M. & Karin, M. (1999) Science, www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;1999/5/rel.Google Scholar), each containing multiple cysteines, arsenite inhibits this system through modification of one critical site that includes Cys-179 in the IKKβ activation loop. Thus, even a highly reactive toxin such as arsenite can exert its predominant toxic effects through a small number of relevant targets. Although arsenite exhibits much higher affinity to vicinal thiols than for single or widely spaced thiols (7Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), Cys-179 is not located nearby another cysteine within the IKKβ primary structure. However, it is likely that upon folding of the IKKβ polypeptide chain, Cys-179 is situated within a critical distance of another, yet to be identified cysteine. As the catalytic subunits of IKK form stable dimers (18Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), it is possible that the second cysteine is present within the dimeric partner of IKKβ. Interestingly, Cys-179 of IKKα/β is highly reactive and was recently found to be a target for cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which, like arsenite, are potent IKK inhibitors (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). In that case, the inhibition is likely to be mediated by formation of a Michael adduct between the cytopentenone moiety and Cys-179 of IKKβ. The ability to demonstrate direct binding of trivalent arsenite to IKKβ relied on the use of the fluorogenic organoarsenic FlAsH-EDT2. This molecule was previously developed as a ligand that allows the specific fluorescent tagging of recombinant proteins that contain four appropriately spaced cysteines (23Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Specificity for four cysteines relies on the presence of a small excess, typically 10 μm, of a 1,2-dithiol such as EDT to competitively suppress binding to isolated pairs of cysteines. In the absence of excess 1,2-dithiol, FlAsH forms relatively weak (K d ∼ 0.1. μm) nonfluorescent complexes with small peptides containing a single pair of consecutive cysteines.3 On a full-size protein such as IKKβ, hydrophobic immobilization of FlAsH's second arsenic-EDT group on the protein surface may prevent that arsenic from quenching fluorescence, as described recently for the interaction of FlAsH and albumin (27Griffin, B., Adams, S., Jones, J. & Tsien, R. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar). FlAsH or its mono-arsenic analog may be useful for detecting other vicinal thiols on full-size proteins in vitro. Regulation of the NF-κB pathway is critical for the expression of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, and carcinogenesis. The IKK complex is believed to be an important site for integrating signals that regulate the NF-κB pathway. Recently, a number of drugs and naturally occurring compounds, including aspirin, sulindac, cyclopentenone prostaglandins, and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase-derived eicosanoids, have been shown to inhibit the NF-κB pathway through IKK (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 28Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C.

Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of this inhibition remain elusive. Our results on the mechanisms of inhibition of IKK by arsenite reveal the critical role of a cysteine residue in the activation loop of IKKβ. The same cysteine is targeted by cyclopentenone prostaglandins and is essential for the sensitivity of IKK and the entire NF-κB pathway to these naturally occurring anti-inflammatory molecules (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Our results link some of the biological effects of arsenite on tissue pathology to inhibition of IKK and NF-κB. As a matter of fact, some of the consequences of chronic arsenite exposure on human skin, such as hyperkeratosis and hyperproliferative skin disease, are similar to the effect of NF-κB inhibition on skin (9Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 10Makris C. Godfrey V.L. Krahn-Senftleben G. Takahashi T. Roberts J.L. Schwarz T. Feng L. Johnson R.S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2000; I5: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have observed dermatopathies involving blistering and hyperkeratotic lesions in mice that are mosaics for a null allele of the X-linkedIkkγ gene, coding for the essential regulatory subunit of the IKK complex (10Makris C.

Thus, IKK is likely to be a highly relevant target for the chronic cutaneous toxicity of arsenite. In addition, through inhibition of IKK, and consequently NF-κB, arsenite can promote apoptosis. Previous work has shown that IKKβ-deficient mice die at mid-gestation because of sever liver apoptosis (10Makris C. Godfrey V.L. Krahn-Senftleben G. Takahashi T. Roberts J.L. Schwarz T. Feng L.

Higher elevation shrubs and summer-flowering grasses expanded downslope across what is now the edge of Absolute Desert, a broad expanse now largely devoid of rainfall and vegetation. Paradoxically, this pluvial period coincided with the summer insolation minimum and reduced adiabatic heating over the central Andes. Summer precipitation over the central Andes and central Atacama may depend on remote teleconnections between seasonal insolation forcing in both hemispheres, the Asian monsoon, and Pacific sea surface temperature gradients. A less pronounced episode of higher groundwater levels in the central Atacama from 8 to 3 ky B.P. conflicts with an extreme lowstand of Lake Titicaca, indicating either different climatic forcing or different response times and sensitivities to climatic change."

https://openalex.org/W2195878577,The atomic structures of two proteins in the histidine biosynthesis pathway consist of β/α barrels with a twofold repeat pattern. It is likely that these proteins evolved by twofold gene duplication and gene fusion from a common half-barrel ancestor. These ancestral domains are not visible as independent domains in the extant proteins but can be inferred from a combination of sequence and structural analysis. The detection of subdomain structures may be useful in efforts to search genome sequences for functionally and structurally related proteins.
https://openalex.org/W2095990525,"We use Global Positioning System (GPS) observations and elastic half-space models to estimate the distribution of coseismic and postseismic slip along the Izmit earthquake rupture. Our results indicate that large coseismic slip (reaching 5.7 meters) is confined to the upper 10 kilometers of the crust, correlates with structurally distinct fault segments, and is relatively low near the hypocenter. Continued surface deformation during the first 75 days after the earthquake indicates an aseismic fault slip of as much as 0.43 meters on and below the coseismic rupture. These observations are consistent with a transition from unstable (episodic large earthquakes) to stable (fault creep) sliding at the base of the seismogenic zone."

Infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients are particularly susceptible to pneumococcal infection. The polysaccharide capsule of the pneumococcus has long been recognized as the major virulence determinant (1AlonsoDeVelasco E. Verheul A.F.M. Verhoef J. Snippe H. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 591-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virulence varies with capsular serotype, but experiments with conversion of serotypes clearly demonstrate that factors other than the capsule play a significant role (2Kelly T. Dillard J.P. Yother J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1813-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of non-capsular virulence factors have also been extensively examined. Although their relative contribution to pneumococcal virulence remains unclear, it is apparent that proteins such as PspA,1 pneumolysin, and pneumococcal surface antigen A play a role in pneumococcal virulence (3Berry A.M. Yother J. Briles D.E. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4McDaniel L.S. Yother J. Vijayakumar M. McGarry L. Guild W.R. Briles D.E. J. Exp.

The classical and alternative pathways of complement are part of the innate immune system and constitute an important line of defense against pneumococcal infection (6Brown E.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 121: 159-187PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gordon D.L. Rice J. Finlay-Jones J.J. McDonald P.J. Hostetter M.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There are many strategies by which bacteria can interfere with the function of the complement system (reviewed in Ref. 8Wurzner R. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For example, binding of the complement regulatory protein fH to bacterial surface proteins has been described by several groups (reviewed in Ref. 9Zipfel P.F. Hellwage J. Friese M.A. Hegasy G. Jokiranta S.T. Meri S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although the precise consequences of such a binding remain somewhat elusive. fH is a 150-kDa plasma protein composed of 20 short consensus repeats and is the best characterized member of the factor H protein family (10Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Complement Regulatory Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 59-69Google Scholar). fH is a crucial protein in the regulation of complement. The critical step in the amplification loop of the alternative pathway is the formation of C3 convertase (C3bBb) from surface-deposited C3b and factor B. fH inhibits complement activation by preventing association of factor B with C3b, acting as a cofactor in C3b degradation by factor I and promoting the dissociation of Bb from both C3 and C5 convertase. Examples of bacterial surface structures interacting with fH include M and M-like proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes (11Horstmann R.D. Sievertsen H.J. Knobloch J. Fishetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 12Johnsson E. Berggård K. Kotarsky H. Hellwage J. Zipfel P.F. Sjöbring U. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4894-4901PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, YadA in Yersinia enterocolitica has been shown to inhibit complement activation by coating the bacterial surface with fH (13China B. Sory M.-P. N′guyen B.T. De Bruyere M. Cornelis G.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3129-3136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two groups independently described inhibition of complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis in type 3 pneumococci. One study (14Tu A.-H.T. Fulgham R.L. McCrory M.A. Briles D.E. Szalai A.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4720-4724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that PspA interferes with deposition of C3b and/or inhibits the alternative pathway C3 convertase. Another study (15Neeleman C. Geelen S.P.M. Aerts P.C. Daha M.R. Mollnes T.E. Roord J.J. Posthuma G. Van Dijk H. Fleer A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4517-4524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) claimed that pneumococcal resistance to phagocytosis is mediated by previously unknown surface proteins binding fH. PspA does not contribute to this interaction, as a PspA-deficient mutant bound similar or even larger amounts of fH than the parent strain. In this study we expand upon previous works on pneumococci and complement by describing a novel surface protein containing an fH-binding region. The protein was identified in silico by using previously described fH-binding proteins as probes, and the candidate gene was found in the chromosomal locus of PspC (also called SpsA, PbcA, and CbpA). A recent paper (16Brooks-Walter A. Briles D.E. Hollingshead S.K. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6533-6542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) compares different allelic variants of PspC in several pneumococcal serotypes, and previous works have suggested functions for PspC such as binding of secretory IgA (17Hammerschmidt S. Talay S.R. Brandtzaeg P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) or influence on adhesion and virulence (18Rosenow C. Ryan P. Weiser J.N. Johnson S. Fontan P. Ortqvist A. Masure R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the protein we describe differs substantially from all previously described PspC alleles, except for the amino-terminal region. Our data show that this region is responsible for fH binding in type 3 pneumococci and suggest that fH binding to other serotypes is mediated by PspC regions homologous to this domain. Strains of S. pneumoniae used in this study are described in Table I. In unencapsulated strains PR201, PR212, PR215, and PR218 the whole capsule locus is deleted and substituted with a kanamycin (Km) resistance cassette. 2F. Iannelli, B. J. Pearce, and G.

Bacteria used for binding assays were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco), supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (Difco).

PR218 was transformed with this construct. By double cross-over mutagenesis the hicgene was consequently replaced with the cat cassette, generating thehic-deficient mutant FP13. Oligonucleotides HICf1 (5′-TGGGATCCCAGAGAAGGAGGTAAC TAC-3′) and HICr1 (5′-GGAGCCTGAATTCGACGAAG-3′), containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites respectively (underlined), were used in a PCR to amplify DNA corresponding to amino acids 39–261 in Hic. The PCR was performed withTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and consisted of 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Template was prepared by resuspending bacterial colonies in water, boiling for 5 min, and removing bacterial debris by centrifuging at 13,000 ×g. The PCR-amplified fragment was gel-purified with Sephaglas Bandprep (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), digested withBamHI and EcoRI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and ligated with likewise digested vector pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 DNA ligase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid pGEX-5X-3:hic-(39–261) was then electroporated into DH5α E. coli according to the GST gene fusion system protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transformants were screened for presence of insert by plasmid mini-preps and restriction enzyme digestion. The clone used for overexpression of the fusion protein GST:Hic39–261 was verified by purifying the plasmid and sequencing the complete insert. Fusion protein was affinity-purified according to the instructions in the GST gene fusion system manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasma absorption experiments were performed with log phase pneumococci (A 600 ∼0.4). Bacteria were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and the bacterial concentration was adjusted to 2 × 1010 cells/ml. 100 μl of bacteria were incubated for 1 h with 100 μl of human plasma. Bacteria were washed five times with PBST, and bound proteins were eluted from the cells with 100 μl of 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 2.0. The pH of the eluted material was adjusted to ∼7 with 1 m Tris. C3-deficient serum was obtained from a patient with selective and complete C3 deficiency (C3 < 1 mg/liter), kindly provided by Dr. G. Eggertsen, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 8–12% acrylamide. Proteins were blotted onto an Immobilon-PTMpolyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) as described (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against fH diluted 1:1000 was the source of primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit goat antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies, and detection of immunoreactive bands was performed by chemiluminescence as described (22Nesbitt S.A. Horton M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Slot blot, Western blot, and bacterial binding assays were performed with fH (Sigma), radiolabeled with 125I using the IODO-BEADS kit (Pierce). Unincorporated 125I was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Slot blots were performed by applying 5, 1, 0.02, and 0.004 μg of purified protein onto nitrocellulose membranes in a slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked for 4 × 20 min in PBST containing 0.25% (w/v) gelatin (Difco). Radiolabeled fH (200,000 cpm/ml) was then added, and the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed 4 times for 20 min in PBST, 0.5 m NaCl, and membrane-associated radioactivity was visualized by exposure onto a phosphoimaging plate (Fuji Film). Western blot membranes were treated in the same way. Binding assays with pneumococci were performed as described (23Åkesson P. Cooney J. Kishimoto F. Björck L. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), using log phase bacteria (A 600 ∼0.4). Surface plasmon resonance was performed by coupling affinity-purified anti-GST antibodies (Biacore) onto sensor chip CM5 (Biacore) by standard amine coupling, according to the manufacturer's instructions. ∼10,000 resonance units of antibodies were coupled. Each cycle of analysis was then commenced by immobilization of 500–1500 resonance units of GST or GST:Hic39–261 (10 μg/ml), followed by injection of fH (2–0.127 μm). The kinetic studies were performed in PBST. Each cycle was terminated by the regeneration of the chip with 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2. Global analysis of data was performed with multiple models in BiaEvaluation 3.0. A previously described assay for the measurement of fH-mediated inhibition of the alternative pathway was employed (24Nydegger U.E. Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 1404-1408PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit erythrocytes (National Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Uppsala, Sweden) were washed and suspended at 5 × 108 cells/ml. The serum of a patient with homozygous C2 deficiency (25Truedsson L. Alper C.A. Awdeh Z.L. Johansen P. Sjöholm A.G. Sturfelt G. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5856-5863PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a source of complement. Highly purified fH was also kindly provided by Dr. L. Truedsson. The hemolytic reaction was performed in veronal-buffered saline with 16 mm EGTA, 4 mm Mg2+, and 0.1% gelatin. The concentration of C2-deficient serum producing about 80% hemolysis in the assay system was determined in preliminary experiments. Final incubation mixtures (200 μl) contained C2-deficient serum diluted 1/12 with or without additional proteins (fH, GST, or GST:Hic39–261 at 30, 90 or 60 μm, respectively) and 2.5 × 107 rabbit erythrocytes (50 μl). The erythrocytes were added 5 min after the other reagents. After 5–40 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 750 μl of cold veronal-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were removed for measurement of light absorbance at 412 nm. Sequence comparisons were performed with MacVector 6.5.3 (Oxford Molecular, Oxford, UK). Data base searches utilized the Entrez server at The National Institute for Biotechnology Information. The sequence of PspC from the type 4 pneumococcus was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website. Previous observations in our laboratory indicated that S. pneumoniaeis capable of absorbing proteins from human plasma. 3R. Janulczyk, F. Iannelli, A. G. Sjöholm, G. Pozzi, and L. Björck, unpublished results. To better investigate the nature of these interactions, a series of strains (Table I), both encapsulated and unencapsulated, was incubated with plasma. After washing, plasma proteins bound to the pneumococci were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE, showing that strains D39 (type 2, encapsulated) and all four unencapsulated strains (serotypes 2, 3, 3, and 19) absorbed a protein with an estimated molecular mass of 140 kDa (Fig.1, STAIN). In repeated experiments PR218, an unencapsulated derivative 4B. J. Pearce, F. Iannelli, and G. Pozzi, manuscript in preparation. of Avery strain A66 consistently showed the most prominent absorption of the 140-kDa protein. The protein absorbed by PR218 was subjected to trypsin-in-gel digestion, and six internal fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation. These sequences showed 100% identity to various regions in human complement factor H. A replica of the gel in Fig. 1 was transferred to a membrane by electroblotting and probed with a rabbit anti-fH antiserum. The antiserum reacted with the previously mentioned 140-kDa band, a band of similar size in plasma, and purified fH (Fig.1, BLOT). There was also a weak reactivity with a band corresponding to ∼50 kDa. When subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing, the band was identified as human immunoglobulin heavy chains, suggesting specific or unspecific binding of immunoglobulins to pneumococci and subsequent cross-reactivity with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies. To exclude that binding of fH was secondary to complement activation and deposition of C3 at the bacterial surface, the plasma absorption with strain D39 was repeated using a C3-deficient serum. The protein reacting with anti-fH antibodies was present in equal amounts when comparing results from absorptions of normal human plasma and the C3-deficient serum (data not shown), showing that fH binding is independent of C3. A group of S. pneumoniae strains was examined for binding of radiolabeled fH. Most strains showed significant binding of fH, although the degree of binding varied considerably between strains (Table II). Encapsulated strains generally bound somewhat less than the corresponding unencapsulated strains. To investigate whether the binding was mediated by proteinaceous structures, binding of fH to strain PR218 was examined following treatment of bacteria with different proteases (data not shown). Binding was almost completely abolished by pretreatment with papain. Trypsin also caused a major decrease, whereas pepsin had a moderate effect (<50% decrease). These results confirm a previous observation (15Neeleman C. Geelen S.P.M. Aerts P.C. Daha M.R. Mollnes T.E. Roord J.J. Posthuma G. Van Dijk H. Fleer A. Infect.

Previously described bacterial surface proteins known to interact with fH include streptococcal M proteins (11Horstmann R.D. Sievertsen H.J. Knobloch J. Fishetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 4046-4052PubMed Google Scholar) were used to search a pneumococcal (type 4 strain JNR. 7/87) genome data base obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research. The highest scoring homology for all the probes was found in a 2106-base pair open reading frame, encoding a putative protein of 702 amino acids (aa). The degree of homology between the pneumococcal protein and the fH-binding proteins used for searching was low, but significant, when comparing the full sequences. However, there were several limited regions of markedly higher homology. A GenBankTM search with this putative protein identified it as an allele of PspC, also denoted SpsA, CbpA, or PbcA (16Brooks-Walter A. Briles D.E. Hollingshead S.K. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6533-6542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PspC was then conversely used to search the S. pyogenes genome sequencing project, and the highest scoring match was found to encode the M1 protein. We chose to sequence the chromosomal locus of the pspC gene in Avery strain A66 (type 3) and its derivative PR218. Serotype 3 strains strongly resist phagocytosis (29Hostetter M.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1986; 153: 682-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and PR218 shows a prominent absorption of fH from human plasma. The locus contained a 1836-base pair open reading frame, encoding a putative protein of 612 aa. The gene was tentatively named hic, for factorH-binding inhibitor of complement (GenBankTM accession number AF252857). The Hic protein (schematically depicted in Fig. 2,top) contains a proline-rich region consisting of 24 repeats of 11 amino acids. Near the COOH terminus there is a consensus sequence LPSTGS, typical of Gram-positive cell wall-anchored proteins (30Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is followed by a hydrophobic COOH-terminal tail. The Hic sequence was used to search the streptococcal Genome Project data base and identified M protein as the best match. Several pneumococcal surface proteins were found to be homologous to Hic. SpsA from type 2 and type 47 pneumococci contains a region highly homologous to Hic. SpsA binds secretory IgA and its secretory component (17Hammerschmidt S. Talay S.R. Brandtzaeg P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). CbpA (18Rosenow C. Ryan P. Weiser J.N. Johnson S. Fontan P. Ortqvist A. Masure R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), an adhesin and virulence determinant in type 2 pneumococci, also contains this region, as does PbcA (unpublished sequence from GenBankTM). SpsA2, CbpA, and PbcA together form the D39 lineage of PspC alleles (16Brooks-Walter A. Briles D.E. Hollingshead S.K. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6533-6542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 149-aa-long NH2-terminal region of Hic, including the predicted 37-aa leader peptide, was aligned with the corresponding region in PspC proteins from serotypes 1, 2, 4, 6A, and 19 (Fig. 3). No particular function has previously been suggested for this region in the PspC proteins. Interestingly, the remainder of Hic showed no significant homology to the PspC proteins except for shorter stretches in the proline-rich region of PspC. In contrast to Hic (Fig. 2,bottom), the PspC proteins contain a series of repeats with choline-binding motifs, a different mechanism for surface attachment. Computer predictions (31Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1974; 47: 45-148Google Scholar, 32Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar) of the secondary structure resulted in strong predictions of α-helical structure in the NH2-terminal region of both Hic (aa 40–270) and PspC (aa 50–250).Figure 3Sequence comparison of Hic and allelic variants of PspC.

Splicing by overlap extension (19Horton R.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) was used to flank an antibiotic resistance cassette with sequences found upstream and downstream of the hic gene. PR218 was transformed with this construct, and the hic gene was deleted by double crossover mutagenesis. The resulting strain, FP13, grew as well as the parent strain in ordinary growth media. The deletion of hic was confirmed by PCR experiments. The mutant strain was subjected to plasma absorption experiments identical to those described above. In contrast to the parent strain (Fig. 1), no band at the position of fH was detected with the anti-fH antiserum. Furthermore, the binding of radiolabeled fH to wild type and mutant bacteria was examined using serial dilutions of bacteria (Fig.4). Unlike the parent strain PR218, the mutant strain FP13 showed background levels of fH binding even at the highest bacterial concentration. The possible contribution of PspC to pneumococcal fH binding was also examined by constructing a mutant derivative of D39, where the pspC gene has been truncated so that the 405 NH2-terminal amino acids are missing in PspC. This mutant, called FP7, was used in plasma absorption experiments, and no band reacting with the anti-fH antibodies was eluted (data not shown). We decided to investigate the binding properties of the non-repeat region of Hic, including the part shared by Hic, PspC, CbpA, SpsA, and PbcA. Therefore, the hic region encoding the NH2-terminal part of Hic (aa 39–261) was cloned into the vector pGEX, resulting in a fusion with the gene encoding GST. Control sequencing of the insert verified the presence of the partialhic gene, showing 100% identity with the DNA sequence from strain A66. GST:Hic39–261 and GST were overexpressed, affinity-purified, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A, STAIN). Although partially degraded, the main protein band had the expected mass (54 kDa). An identical gel was blotted to a membrane, which was then incubated with radiolabeled fH, washed, and subjected to autoradiography. fH bound to GST:Hic39–261 but not to GST (Fig. 5 A, BLOT). The fusion protein and the GST control were also applied in serial dilutions onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with radiolabeled fH, which"

We predict that weed populations might be reduced to low levels or practically eradicated, depending on the exact form of management. Consequent effects on the local use of fields by birds might be severe, because such reductions represent a major loss of food resources. The regional impacts of GMHT crops are shown to depend on whether the adoption of GMHT crops by farmers covaries with current weed levels."

IL-1β is thought to act early in the initiation of the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in type I diabetes. IL-1β promotes β cell impairment, in part, by activating NF-κB transcription factor-dependent signaling pathways. We have examined whether β cells could be protected from the effects of IL-1β by overexpressing an inhibitor of NF-κB activity, IκB, by adenoviral gene transfer to intact human islets in culture. Infection of islets with an adenoviral vector encoding a non-phosphorylatable, non-degradable variant of IκBα resulted in normal insulin responses to glucose in the presence of IL-1β. Furthermore, nitric oxide production was prevented and, more importantly, Fas-triggered apoptosis was inhibited following IκBα gene transfer.

It is thought that antigen acquisition is consequent to β cell apoptosis. Once activated, the antigen-presenting cells are able to migrate to the peripheral lymphoid organs where they can activate autoreactive naı̈ve T-lymphocytes that have escaped thymic or peripheral negative selection (1Bach J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 516-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β)1play important roles in this process (2McDaniel M.L. Kwon G. Hill J.R. Marshall C.A. Corbett J.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 24-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β is released by macrophages in response to a variety of changes in a given tissue (3Lacy P.E. Mt. Sinai J. Med. 1994; 61: 170-174PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of IL-1β production by islet-resident macrophages in the onset of autoimmune diabetes has been suggested in several related studies. Depletion of macrophages in BB rats and in cyclophosphamide-treated non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice by silica particles has been shown to prevent diabetes (4Kasuga A. Maruyama T. Takei I. Shimada A.

Islet-resident macrophages as well as β cells in the NOD mouse begin displaying an increase in iNOS protein at about 5 weeks of age coincident with the onset of insulitis (15Reddy S. Liu W. Elliott R.B. Pancreas. 1993; 8: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, insulitis progression, defined cytologically as an increase in macrophage and T-lymphocyte infiltration in and around the islets of Langerhans, is associated with increasing levels of iNOS expression and protein in β cells of the NOD mouse (15Reddy S.

The regulation of NF-κB activity has been implicated in β cell impairment. NF-κB activity is increased in rat insulinoma cells (RIN) in culture in response to IL-1β (23Flodstrom M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2747-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas cytokines were also shown to promote NF-κB activity in human and rodent islets in vitro (24Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, iNOS expression in RINm5F insulinoma cells is dependent on NF-κB transactivation of the promoter in response to IL-1β (24Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, this requirement for NF-κB activation for iNOS expression was observed in human β cells as well as in rat islets in culture in response to IL-1β (24Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Another gene that is activated in response to IL-1β and very likely involved in β cell dysfunction is cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2. In human and hamster islets, COX-2 expression is induced in response to IL-1β, and this is paralleled by an increase in NF-κB-dependent activation of the COX-2 promoter (25Sorli C.H. Zhang H.J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TNFα-induced apoptosis in NIT-1 mouse insulinoma cells as well as primary islets is paralleled by an activation of NF-κB (26Stephens L.A. Thomas H.E. Ming L. Grell M. Darwiche R. Volodin L. Kay T.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NF-κB activity is regulated by a group of naturally occurring repressors termed IκB (27Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). IκB is normally bound to NF-κB, resulting in retention of the complex in the cytoplasm. Following inflammatory stimulation, such as exposure to certain cytokines like TNFα and IL-1β, IκB is rapidly phosphorylated and targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The release of IκB allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it binds its cognate enhancer elements upstream of pro-inflammatory genes (27Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 28Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). IκB has been shown to inhibit iNOS gene expression by associating with NF-κB and preventing its translocation to the nucleus (29De Vera M.E. Taylor B.S. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273(6 Pt 1): G1290-G1296Google Scholar). Recently, a mutant version of IκBα has been engineered that is non-phosphorylatable and unable to be degraded (30Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant IκBα in cells from human arthritic joints, including macrophages, in vitro, suppressed TNFα production (31Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. de Martin R. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8211-8215Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Adenoviral gene transfer of the mutant into human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, blocked IL-1β and TNFα-induced iNOS expression as well as IL-1β and IL-8 production (30Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the ability of a non-phosphorylatable, non-degradable variant of IκBa, delivered by adenoviral gene transfer, to inhibit IL-1β-mediated β cell destruction and apoptosis. We demonstrate that adenoviral gene transfer of the IκBα repressor to human islets in vitro can prevent IL-1β-dependent suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin release and can inhibit nitric oxide production following exposure of the islets to IL-β. Furthermore, we show that IL-β-mediated, Fas-triggered apoptosis induction can be prevented in islets by IκB gene transfer. These results suggest that inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway in islets may be one means of facilitating islet transplantation as a potential therapy for autoimmune diabetes. The IκBα repressor cDNA was used to generate an E1-deleted recombinant adenoviral vector, kindly provided by Dr. David Geller (University of Pittsburgh). The virus was propagated and purified as described (32Mittereder N. March K.L. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E1/E3-deleted eGFP and LacZ adenoviral vectors were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs into the pAdLox shuttle plasmid followed by Cre-Lox recombination (33Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all instances, transgene expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. Pancreata from multiorgan cadaveric donors were provided by the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA) and local Organ Procurement Organizations with the appropriate consent for research use. Islets were obtained from the Diabetes Research Institute of the University of Miami (Dr. C. Ricordi) and from the University of Minnesota (Dr. Bernhard Hering). These sources participate in the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International Islet Distribution Program. Pancreata were obtained from at least five cadaveric donors of different ages and sex and subjected to the digestion, isolation, and purification as described (34Linetsky E. Bottino R. Lehmann R. Alejandro R. Inverardi L. Ricordi C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1120-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of islets was usually greater than 80% (mantled islets). Viability of the cultured islets was usually greater than 85% as assessed by vital dye exclusion, insulin staining, and morphology. The experiments described below used islets from the pancreata of five different donors. Islets were washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) prior to infection. 200–300 islets were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding IκBα (Ad-IκB), β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ), or enhanced green fluorescence protein (Ad-eGFP) at 1 × 106 plaque forming units (pfu) per 200–300 islets for 2 h at 37 °C. Following infection, islets were washed twice in serum-free medium and then cultured for 48 h in medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing a solution of 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). To determine the effects of IL-1β on β cell function of islets infected with Ad-IκB or Ad-LacZ/Ad-eGFP as controls, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was used as a functional assay. Islets were first treated with 50 units of recombinant human IL-1β (Sigma) for a period between 18 and 24 h immediately following a preincubation in fresh media between 16 and 24 h. The IL-1β-containing medium was removed, and the islets were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (KRH buffer; 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). Incubation was carried out at 37 °C in KRH buffer for 30 min followed by an additional incubation for 30 min in the presence of 5 and 18 mm glucose (final concentration). The buffer was subsequently removed, and its insulin content was determined by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Dako Chemicals), which specifically recognizes processed human insulin. To evaluate NO production, the islet culture supernatants were collected between 18 and 24 h following the addition of IL-1β, and an aliquot was subjected to the Griess reaction. Uninfected islets, as well as those infected with Ad-eGFP as control or Ad-IκB, were treated with 50 units of IL-1β for 24 h. Furthermore, a subset of islets untreated or pretreated with IL-1β were challenged with the agonistic human Fas antibody (clone CH-11, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation with antibody, islets were lysed and processed for the detection of caspase-3 (CPP32) activity using a commercially available kit (ApoAlert, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). As an indirect means of correcting for cell number, the CPP32 activity was corrected by the number of nanograms of DNA in the lysate assayed, using the PicoGreen reagent, an intercalating DNA fluorogenic compound (Molecular Probes Inc.). To examine the effects of IκB gene transfer on NF-κB activity in vitro, subconfluent NIT-1 insulinoma cells (derived from the non-obese diabetic mouse; ATCC CRL-2055) were infected with Ad-IκB at a multiplicity of infection of between 40 and 80 in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced with medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene fused to five tandemly arrayed NF-κB consensus binding sites (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the LipofectAMINE reagent as suggested by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). 18–24 h later, the cells were treated with 50 units of IL-1β. Uninfected, transfected cells treated with or without IL-1β were used as controls. All cells were lysed 24 h later for luciferase assay using a commercially available kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Statistics were performed using the SPSS for Windows v. 8.0 package, and a p value of less than 0.05 by ANOVA was taken to indicate statistically significant differences. Previous studies have demonstrated efficient adenoviral gene transfer to human and murine islets in culture with maintenance of normal β cell function as assessed by glucose-stimulated insulin release assays and glucose perifusions (35Csete M.E.

In particular, we have demonstrated the ability to infect up to 70% of islet cells and 50% of the β cells with an adenoviral vector encoding the green fluorescence protein (38Giannoukakis N. Mi Z. Gambotto A. Eramo A. Ricordi C. Trucco M. Robbins P. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1545-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Ghivizzani S.C. Gambotto A. Ricordi C.

To determine if adenoviral gene transfer of the IκBα repressor was able to prevent the IL-1β-induced impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin release by cultured human islets, we exposed uninfected islets as well as those infected with Ad-eGFP and Ad-IκB to 50 units of recombinant IL-1β. This amount, over a 24-h period, was sufficient to impair the ability of islets to respond to a high glucose challenge (18 mm) in all islet cultures examined (Fig. 1). However, the islets infected with Ad-IκB responded similarly to uninfected control islets to increasing glucose (Fig. 1 and Table I). Why the level of insulin release at 5 mm of glucose is higher in Ad-IκB-infected islets compared with the Ad-LacZ control is unclear. However, it is possible that there is low level activation of NF-κB during the islet isolation procedure, which is inhibited by Ad-IκB gene transfer.Table IGlucose-stimulated insulin release assayIslet statusInsulin release (5 mmglucose)Insulin release (18 mm glucose)% ± S.E.M.Control100866 ± 200Ad-LacZ113 ± 80900 ± 133 1-ap < 0.05.IL-1β66 ± 5380 ± 13Ad-LacZ + IL-1β93 ± 680 ± 26Ad-IκB316 ± 4700 ± 88 1-ap < 0.05.Ad-IκB + IL-1β225 ± 211021 ± 300 1-ap < 0.05.1-a p < 0.05.

We determined the level of nitrite in the media of uninfected, Ad-LacZ-infected, and Ad-IκB-infected islets in the presence or absence of 50 units of IL-1β by the Griess reaction. Nitrite accumulation was detectable in uninfected islets as well as Ad-LacZ-infected islets in the absence of IL-1β. No significant accumulation above control values occurred when islets were infected with Ad-LacZ alone (Fig. 2). However, exposure of uninfected islets to IL-1β resulted in a significant accumulation (Fig. 2). The largest accumulation was seen in cultures infected by Ad-LacZ followed by IL-1β exposure (375 ± 40%versus control, p < 0.05, Fig. 2). This result is similar to previous observations demonstrating that adenoviral infection is able to partially increase the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes like iNOS (44Clesham G.J. Adam P.J. Proudfoot D. Flynn P.D. Efstathiou S. Weissberg P.L. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, gene transfer of IκB was able to block both IL-1β and adenoviral-mediated induction of NO. More importantly, nitrite accumulation in the medium of Ad-IκB-infected islets was no greater than control levels (100 ± 5% versus control,p = NS, Fig. 2). Cross-linking of the Fas antigen on a number of cell types using an IgM antibody has been shown to activate caspase-3 activity and apoptosis (45Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M.

Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we used Ad-eGFP as a control vector, because we have previously demonstrated that Ad-eGFP infection, like Ad-LacZ, of human islets in vitro does not affect their function or apoptosis activation (38Giannoukakis N. Mi Z. Gambotto A. Eramo A. Ricordi C. Trucco M. Robbins P. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1545-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Ghivizzani S.C. Gambotto A. Ricordi C. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Uninfected, Ad-eGFP-infected, and Ad-IκB-infected islets were first exposed to 50 units of IL-1β for 18–24 h and then treated with the agonistic Fas antibody for 1 h. Caspase-3 activity was significantly suppressed in islets infected with Ad-IκB compared with uninfected and Ad-eGFP-infected controls (Fig.3). Ad-IκB also was able to reduce apoptosis following IL-1β treatment but had no effect following the addition of Fas antibody. However, gene transfer of IκB significantly suppressed the increase in apoptosis following treatment with IL-1β and subsequent treatment with the Fas antibody (Fig. 3). To rule out the possibility that the protection conferred to islets against Fas-triggered apoptosis activation was due to adenovirus-mediated down-regulation of Fas, islets were infected with a replication-defective herpes simplex-1 vector encoding IκBα (HSV-IκB) or LacZ as control (HSV-LacZ). Following exposure of the islets to IL-1β and the agonistic Fas antibody, a decrease in caspase-3 activity was observed in islets infected with HSV-IκB compared with the uninfected control (data not shown). To demonstrate that IκB gene transfer inhibited NF-κB activity, we performed transient transfection assays in Ad-IκB-infected NIT-1 insulinoma cells with an NF-κB-luciferase construct. In Fig. 4we show that NF-κB-luciferase reporter activity is significantly increased in uninfected cells treated with IL-1β (159 ± 10%versus control, p < 0.05). Ad-IκB infection followed by transient transfection with the reporter resulted in reporter gene activity at levels lower than transfected control cells (57 ± 6% versus control, p < 0.05). More importantly, exposure of Ad-IκB-infected, reporter gene-transfected cells to IL-1β did not lead to reporter gene activity at levels higher than those seen in uninfected, transfected control cells (65 ± 13% versus control,p < 0.05). Previous studies have demonstrated that adenoviral infection of intact human islets in culture does not change their viability or functional characteristics (36Csete M.E. Benhamou P.Y. Drazan K.E. Wu L. McIntee D.F. Afra R. Mullen Y. Busuttil R.W. Shaked A. Transplantation. 1995; 59: 263-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Weber M. Deng S. Kucher T. Shaked A. Ketchum R.J. Brayman K.L. J.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used adenoviral gene transfer to intact human islets in vitro to demonstrate that a human IκBα repressor can suppress IL-1β-induced impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. There was no increase in nitrite accumulation in the media of Ad-IκB-infected islets exposed to IL-1β compared with the increase seen in uninfected islet cultures treated with IL-1β. This result is consistent with IκB inhibiting NF-κB activation, resulting in prevention of iNOS induction, an IL-1β- and NF-κB-sensitive gene (17Taylor B.S. de Vera M.E. Ganster R.W. Wang Q.

Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our transient transfection data in a β cell line suggest that Ad-IκB gene transfer inhibits the effects of IL-1β by interfering with NF-κB transcriptional activity. This inhibition is most likely due to direct interaction of IκB with NF-κB in the cytoplasm preventing NF-κB translocation into the nucleus. Ad-IκB infection alone did not change the NO levels compared with uninfected, untreated islets. However, Ad-LacZ infection followed by IL-1β treatment, resulted in a dramatic increase in NO production that was paralleled by an increase in IL-1β-induced, Fas-triggered apoptosis activation in Ad-eGFP-infected islets. The increased nitrite accumulation by Ad-LacZ-infected islets in the presence of IL-1β suggests that the adenoviral infection triggers intrinsic islet antiviral defense mechanisms that are perhaps mediated by resident macrophages and potentiated by exogenously added IL-1β. Indeed, adenoviral infection has been shown to stimulate NO production (49Haddad I.Y. Sorscher E.J. Garver Jr., R.I. Hong J. Tzeng E. Matalon S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,50Beckman J.S. Crapo J.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition to endocrine cells, islets contain a small number of macrophages and dendritic cells that are likely targets of adenoviral infection. It is possible that the nitrite, detected in the Ad-LacZ-infected islets, was derived from islet-resident antigen-presenting cells that were activated in response to the viral proteins. Although there is strong support for IL-1β alone inducing NO production and β cell dysfunction in rat islets, this does not always appear to be the case for human β cells (2McDaniel M.L. Kwon G.

Invest. 1992; 90: 2384-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear why there is such variability among the data among different investigators and experiments, some factors that could have influenced our findings can be ruled out, including: 1) the degree of islet contamination by non-endocrine, exocrine, or other pancreatic cells is minimal. We routinely used islet preparations of 80% or greater as assessed by microscopic morphology and insulin staining of intact islets and single cell cultures in addition to dithizone staining following a new and improved isolation protocol (34Linetsky E. Bottino R. Lehmann R. Alejandro R. Inverardi L. Ricordi C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1120-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) Variability of islet viability and function. We have used islets isolated from pancreata obtained from multiple donors of different ages and sex; and 3) Isolation-associated cell damage. The islets we have used have been isolated by a procedure that offers minimal cell trauma/damage (34Linetsky E. Bottino R. Lehmann R. Alejandro R. Inverardi L. Ricordi C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1120-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One important difference between our procedures and those in some other studies, where IL-1β alone could not promote NO production or β cell impairment, involves the culture conditions of the islets following isolation. It is possible that different culture conditions may promote β cell resistance to the effects of IL-1β by inducing the down-regulation (internalization) of the type I IL-1 receptor. Consequently, the relocation of the type I IL-1 receptor to the cell surface would require stimulation by cytokines like TNFα or interferon γ. Ad-IκB infection was able to prevent the IL-1β-induced, Fas-triggered activation of caspase-3 activity. It thus appears that NF-κB activity is important for Fas-mediated apoptosis in β cells. Alternatively, NF-κB activity could be required for expression of Fas. Basal caspase-3 activity in islets was also significantly reduced following Ad-IκB infection, suggesting that NF-κB is activated in islets during the isolation procedure. Thus, IκB gene transfer could be useful to preserve islet function prior to, and following islet transplantation. Apoptosis is a process involving the activity of caspases. To date, caspase-3 activation commits all cells examined, including β cells to apoptosis, and is an early step in mediating Fas signaling (52de Craen M.V. Declercq W. den Brande I.V. Fiers W.

Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In response to Fas ligation by the CH-11 monoclonal antibody, caspase-3 activation is seen as early as 5 min in a fibrosarcoma cell line (45Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Although we have not formally ruled out the possibility that caspase-3 activity in our cultures partly derives from non-β cells, that caspase-3 activity is at control levels in islets expressing IκB demonstrates its utility to protect islet cells from the apoptotic Fas trigger. NF-κB is a transcriptional complex composed of homo- or heterodimers of proteins belonging to the Rel family of transcription factors. Activation of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional processes usually occurs in response to inflammatory signals such as cytokines, however, it may also be associated with stress responses in a manner analogous to heat-shock proteins (57Renard P. Zachary M.D. Bougelet C. Mirault M.E. Haegeman G. Remacle J. Raes M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 58Renard P. Raes M. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1999; 15: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although very little is known about non-inflammatory effects of NF-κB-dependent gene expression as well as its targets in β cells under non-pathologic situations, this is an important area that requires further understanding to appropriately modulate repression of NF-κB in gene transfer strategies. For example, levels of IκB expression may have to be regulated to promote protection against pro-inflammatory cytokines, yet preserving normal NF-κB responses to stress (57Renard P. Zachary M.D. Bougelet C. Mirault M.E. Haegeman G. Remacle J. Raes M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 58Renard P. Raes M. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1999; 15: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This could be achieved using gene transfer strategies using vectors with regulatable promoters like tetracycline or mifepristone (RU-486) (59Burcin M.M. Schiedner G. Kochanek S. Tsai S.Y.

To prevent potential interference with normal cell function, other complementary strategies like cytokine blockade can be used. We have demonstrated such an approach by interfering with the effects of IL-1β, an upstream activator of NF-κB, using an adenoviral vector the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein in human islets in vitro (39Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Ghivizzani S.C. Gambotto A. Ricordi C. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this report, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using an adenoviral vector encoding an IκBα repressor to infect human islets as a means of preventing IL-1β-induced impairment of β cell function. Moreover, we have demonstrated that IκBα transduction of islets can suppress NO production in the presence of IL-1β as well as Fas-triggered caspase-3 activation, an early marker of apoptosis induction. We suggest that IκBα gene transfer to islets may be a means of preserving their integrity and promoting their survival and function prior to and following transplantation into diabetic hosts as a potential therapy for type I diabetes.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 430-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These MODY1 mutations located in various domains of the HNF4α protein result in defective function of the transcription factor (6Lausen J. Thomas H. Lemm I. Bulman M. Borgschulze M. Lingott A. Hattersley A.T. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 430-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clinical phenotype of MODY1 patients is indistinguishable from that of MODY3 patients who carry mutations in the HNF1α gene (5Hattersley A.T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 430-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNF4α acts upstream of HNF1α in a transcriptional cascade that drives liver-specific gene expression and hepatocyte differentiation (7Tian J.-M. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R.

A naturally occurring mutation in the HNF4α-binding site of the HNF1α promoter identified in a MODY3 family (10Gragnoli C. Lindner T. Cockburn B.N. Kaisaki P.J. Gragnoli F. Marozzi G. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1648-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggests that the transcriptional hierarchy could also be involved in pancreatic β-cell gene expression and function. HNF4α defines the expression of liver-specific genes encoding apolipoproteins, serum factors, cytochrome P-450 isoforms, and proteins involved in the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids (reviewed in Ref. 11Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver-specific Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar). However, clinical characterization of MODY1 subjects reveals that the primary defect is impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells rather than liver dysfunction (5Hattersley A.T.

Unfortunately, little is known as to how HNF4α regulates β-cell-restricted gene expression and glucose metabolism and associated insulin secretion. Targeted disruption of thehnf4α gene results in defective gastrulation of mouse embryos due to dysfunction of the visceral endoderm (15Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This early embryonic lethality prevents further analysis of the HNF4α function in pancreatic β-cells. The precise role of HNF4α in pancreatic β-cells would best be examined by conditional β-cell-specific deletion of the mouse hnf4α gene. Another alternative is to up- and down-regulate HNF4α function in pancreatic β-cell lines through gene manipulation. In the present study, the wild type HNF4α (WT-HNF4α) and its dominant-negative mutant (DN-HNF4α) could be induced in INS-1 cells under tight control of the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator (16Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). DN-HNF4α represents the epitope Myc-tagged truncated HNF4α mutant protein lacking the first 111 amino acids (mycΔ111HNF4α) (17Fraser J.D. Keller D. Martinez V. Santiso-Mere D. Straney R. Briggs M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The HNF4α protein consists of an N-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain (amino acids 1–24), a DNA binding domain containing two zinc fingers (amino acids 51–117), and a large hydrophobic portion (amino acids 163–368) composed of the dimerization, ligand binding, cofactor binding, and ligand-dependent transactivation domain (18Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M.

DN-HNF4α therefore suppresses the endogenous WT-HNF4α transcriptional activity by the formation of heterodimers lacking DNA binding capacity (17Fraser J.D. Keller D. Martinez V. Santiso-Mere D. Straney R. Briggs M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have investigated in a quantitative manner the consequences of altered HNF4α function on β-cell-specific expression of genes implicated in glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. This allowed us to elucidate the molecular basis and HNF4α target genes responsible for impaired metabolism secretion coupling in β-cells deficient in HNF4α function. The rat insulinoma INS-1 cell line-derived stable clones were cultured in RPMI 1640 in 11 mm glucose, unless indicated otherwise (20Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The establishment of the first step stable clone INS-r3, which expresses the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator, was reported previously (21Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 99: 4372-4377Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Plasmids used in the secondary stable transfection were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs encoding the rat WT-HNF4α (a generous gift from Dr. Darnell Jr., New York) and DN-HNF4α into the expression vector PUHD10-3 (a kind gift from Dr. H. Bujard, University Heidelberg, Germany). DN-HNF4α was PCR-amplified from WT-HNF4α using the following primers, ctaggatccttccgggctggcatgaagaaagaagcc and ccagaattcctgcagatggttgtcctttag. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3.1myc (Invitrogen, Netherlands) and sequenced. Transfection, clone selection, and screening procedures were described previously (21Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 99: 4372-4377Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) for detection (22Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dilutions for antibody against HNF4α (kindly supplied by Dr. F. M. Sladek, University of California, Riverside, CA) and anti-Myc tag (9E10) in myeloma SP2/0 culture medium were 1:6,000 and 1:10. Cells in 24-well dishes were cultured in 2.5 mm glucose medium with or without indicated doses of doxycycline for 14 or 48 h. Insulin secretion was measured over a period of 30 min, in Krebs-Ringer/bicarbonate-HEPES buffer (KRBH, 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing indicated stimulators. Insulin content was determined after extraction with acid ethanol following the procedures of Asfari et al. (20Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Insulin was detected by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard (22Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in 6-well dishes were cultured in 2.5 mm glucose medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h. The production of ATP was measured during 8 min of stimulation in KRBH. ATP assay was performed as reported previously (22Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The production of14CO2 from [1-14C]pyruvate or [2-14C]pyruvate was measured over 1 h in KRBH containing either 0.05 or 1.0 mm pyruvate as described previously (23Noel R.J. Antinozzi P.A. McGarry J.D.

After a 48-h culture period in 2.5 mm glucose medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline, cells were trypsinized (0.025% trypsin, 0.27 mm EDTA), and the cell suspension was maintained for 2 h in a spinner culture with 2.5 mm glucose RPMI 1640 plus 1% newborn calf serum at 37 °C. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured as described (25Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the spinner culture period, cells were loaded with 10 μg/ml rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) for 10 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended and transferred to the fluorimeter cuvette at 37 °C with gentle stirring in an LS-50B fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and fluorescence, excited at 490 nm, was measured at 530 nm. Cells in 10-cm dishes were cultured in 2.5 mm glucose medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 14 or 48 h, followed by an additional 8 h in culture medium with 2.5, 6, 12, and 24 mm glucose. Total RNA was extracted and blotted to nylon membranes as described previously (22Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was prehybridized and then hybridized to 32P-labeled random primer cDNA probes by the technique of Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.3-7.84Google Scholar). To ensure equal RNA loading and even transfer, all membranes were stripped and re-hybridized with the “housekeeping gene” probes such as β-actin or cyclophilin. cDNA fragments used as probes for L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK), glucose transporter-2 (GLUT-2), glucokinase, insulin, PDX1, HNF4α, upstream stimulatory factors (USF), c-Jun, and C/EBPβ mRNA detection were digested from corresponding expression vectors kindly provided by Drs. A. Kahn, B. Thorens, P. B. Iynedjian, J. Philippe, T. Edlund, J. E. Darnell, Jr., M. Sawadogo, W. Schlegel, and U. Schibler, respectively. cDNA probes for rat aldolase B, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, dimerization cofactor for HNF1α (DcoH), mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator 1 and 2 (ANT1 and ANT2), mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) E1 subunit, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), Pax4, Pax6, Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, Isl1, insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2), cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (Cdk4), and cyclophilin were prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Cells in 10-cm dishes were grown in culture medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes, 5′-GGCTGAAGTCCAAAGTTCAGTCCCTTCGC-3′ (8Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). EMSA procedures including conditions for nuclear extract preparation, probe labeling, binding reactions, unlabeled-probe competition, and antibody supershift were performed as reported previously (22Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheHNF1α gene promoter luciferase reporter plasmids,WT-HNF1αLuc (wild type) andΔAHNF1αLuc (HNF4α-binding site deleted), were kindly provided by Dr. N. Miura (Akita University, Japan) (27Muira N. Tanaka K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3731-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments and luciferase reporter enzyme assays were carried out as previously reported (22Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have obtained 10 and 8 clones positively expressing WT-HNF4α and DN-HNF4α, respectively. The clones designated as WT-HNF4α-28 and DN-HNF4α-26 that displayed highest induction levels of transgene proteins were chosen for the present study. The time course and dose response of doxycycline effect on WT-HNF4α and DN-HNF4α expression are illustrated in Fig. 1, A andB, respectively. WT-HNF4α protein could be induced within a range from 2- to 50-fold above the endogenous protein level (Fig.1 A). Thus, graded overexpression of WT-HNF4α could be achieved by culturing the WT-HNF4α-28 cells with varying doses of doxycycline in a defined period. Similar induction of DN-HNF4α protein was detected in the nuclear extracts from DN-HNF4α-26 cells (Fig. 1 B). No leakage of this doxycycline-dependent promoter was observed, since the expression of DN-HNF4α protein was not detectable in non-induced DN-HNF4α-26 cells (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the dominant-negative suppression of HNF4α function in INS-1 cells could be rapidly achieved by culturing the DN-HNF4α-26 cells with a maximum dose of doxycycline (500 ng/ml). Impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is the primary defect causing hyperglycemia in MODY1 patients carrying HNF4α mutations. We therefore examined the consequences of induction of WT-HNF4α and DN-HNF4α on insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. The graded overexpression of WT-HNF4α led to a left shift of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig.2 A). However, the maximal (above 12 mm) glucose-elicited insulin secretion remained unchanged (Fig. 2 A). Glucose generates ATP and other metabolic coupling factors important for insulin secretion through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation (28Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The physiological insulin secretagogue, leucine, is transported directly into mitochondria to provide substrates for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (28Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). K+ causes insulin secretion by depolarization of the β-cell membrane, resulting in an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (28Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the insulin secretory responses to these three secretagogues that act at different levels of the signal transduction cascade following induction of DN-HNF4α. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, DN-HNF4α selectively inhibited glucose- and leucine-stimulated insulin secretion. This could be explained by defective glucose and leucine metabolism. To investigate whether impaired nutrient-evoked insulin secretion is correlated to defective cellular ATP production, we analyzed the impact of DN-HNF4α expression on the level of ATP generated by glucose and leucine. As shown in Fig.3 A, induction of DN-HNF4α indeed abolished the ATP generation by glucose and leucine. Since the mitochondrial substrate leucine failed to generate ATP after induction of DN-HNF4α, it would seem that HNF4α is required for maintaining normal mitochondrial function. To test this hypothesis, we examined the consequences of DN-HNF4α induction on mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate. Pyruvate-derived carbons enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle as either acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase, or oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase. By using pyruvate radiolabeled at either the first or second carbon, the putative defects at various steps in pyruvate metabolism can be assessed. The radiolabeled carbon of [1-14C]pyruvate is lost to CO2 at the pyruvate dehydrogenase step as pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, if pyruvate enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle via oxaloacetate, the label is lost to CO2 at isocitrate dehydrogenase within one turn of the cycle. Radiolabeled CO2 is generated from 2-14C at either OGDH or isocitrate dehydrogenase when pyruvate enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle as acetyl-CoA. Overexpression of DN-HNF4α reduced CO2 formation from [2-14C]pyruvate by 41% (Fig. 3 B), whereas CO2 formation from [1-14C]pyruvate was not different between non- and induced conditions (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that the defect in mitochondrial metabolism is not at the point of entry of pyruvate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, rather that the defect appears in reactions within the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This is in full agreement with the impairment of leucine stimulation of insulin secretion since leucine metabolism bypasses pyruvate and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle solely as acetyl-CoA. Decreased isocitrate dehydrogenase activity would also be unlikely since impairment at this step would be observed by both [1-14C]pyruvate and [2-14C]pyruvate oxidation. These oxidation experiments suggest that steps following this reaction beginning with OGDH may be responsible for impaired [2-14C]pyruvate oxidation. The Δψm was measured in a suspension of INS-1 cells by monitoring rhodamine-123 fluorescence. In control cells (−Dox) addition of 10 mmglucose (12.5 mm final) potently hyperpolarized Δψm, whereas 1 μm of the protonophore FCCP depolarized Δψm (Fig.4 A). In cells expressing DN-HNF4α (+Dox), the glucose response was inhibited by 65% (p < 0.02). Impaired hyperpolarization of Δψm was also observed when the glycolysis was bypassed by stimulating cells with the end product of glycolysis pyruvate (Fig.4 B), indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. Direct activation with methyl succinate of the electron transport chain at complex II resulted in a diminished response in DN-HNF4α-induced cells (Fig.4 C). The amplitude of complete Δψmdepolarization by FCCP was also reduced in cells treated with doxycycline (−43%; p < 0.01), suggesting that the mitochondria were partially uncoupled by suppression of HNF4α function (Fig. 4 D). The expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism (Fig. 5, A and B) or in pancreatic β-cell development and differentiation (Fig. 5,C and D) was quantitatively evaluated in WT-HNF4α-28 (Fig. 5, A and C) and DN-HNF4α-26 cells (Fig. 5, B and D). As shown in Fig.5 A, WT-HNF4α mRNA could be induced by 2-, 8-, and 50-fold above the endogenous level. This graded overexpression of WT-HNF4α resulted in a stepwise increase in the expression of three glucose-responsive genes encoding, respectively, GLUT-2, L-PK, and aldolase B (Fig. 5 A). However, the mRNA level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is also responsive to glucose, remained unaltered (Fig. 5 A). Induction of WT-HNF4α also caused incremental expression of OGDH E1 subunit transcript (Fig. 5 A). Consistently, The mRNA levels of GLUT-2, aldolase B, L-PK, and OGDH E1 subunit were significantly reduced after induction of DN-HNF4α (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, induction of DN-HNF4α led to increased UCP-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, HNF4α regulates the expression of genes involved in both glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. The profile of HNF4α-targeted genes is strikingly similar to that of HNF1α (29Wang H. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). HNF4α may regulate the expression of genes implicated in glucose metabolism through HNF1α function as in hepatocytes (7Tian J.-M. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 9Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar). Since HNF4α is required for liver development and hepatocyte differentiation (9Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether HNF4α regulates the expression of genes important for the pancreatic β-cell phenotype. Induction of WT-HNF4α (Fig. 5 C) or DN-HNF4α (Fig.5 D) did not alter the expression patterns of PDX1, Pax4, Pax6, NKx2.2, NKx6.1, and Isl-1, which are necessary for normal pancreatic cell development or differentiation (30Edlund H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Moreover, HNF4α did not regulate the mRNA levels of USF, c-Jun, and C/EBPβ (Fig.5, C and D). The expression of these transcription factors appeared to be responsive to glucose (Fig. 5,C and D). The expression of another glucose-responsive transcription factor, DcoH, was slightly affected by induction of WT-HNF4α but not by expression of DN-HNF4α (Fig. 5,C and D), suggesting the involvement of an indirect mechanism. Both Cdk4 and IRS2 are involved in pancreatic β-cell development (31Rane G.R. Dubus P. Mettus R.V. Galbreath E.J. Boden G. Reddy E.P. Barbacid M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 32Withers D.J. Burks D.J. Towery H.H. Altamuro S.L. Flint C.L. White M.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), but their expression was not regulated by HNF4α (Fig. 5, C and D). Induction of DN-HNF4α for 48 h caused 50% reduction in insulin mRNA levels (Fig. 5 D). This may be secondary to decreased HNF1α function, since HNF1α is required for insulin gene transcription (29Wang H. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We performed EMSA for studying HNF4α binding activity to HNF1α promoter, luciferase reporter enzyme assay for HNF1α promoter activity, and Northern blotting for the HNF1α mRNA expression. Nuclear extracts were prepared from WT-HNF4α-28 and DN-HNF4α-26 cells cultured for 48 h in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml doxycycline. The murine HNF1α promoter segment, which contains the HNF4α-binding site, was used as probe (8Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Induction of WT-HNF4α resulted in a dramatic increase in the signal density of HNF4α binding (Fig.6 A). On the other hand, induction of DN-HNF4α almost completely abolished the binding activity of endogenous HNF4α to the HNF1α promoter (Fig.6 A). DN-HNF4α exerts its dominant-negative function by forming DN-HNF4α/WT-HNF4α heterodimers that lack DNA binding capacity (11Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver-specific Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar). The retarded DNA binding complexes corresponding to endogenous WT-HNF4α and/or induced transgene WT-HNF4αhomodimers were supershifted by a specific antibody against HNF4α (Fig. 6 A). Consistently, induction of WT-HNF4α resulted in a 2-fold increase in endogenous HNF1α mRNA level, whereas DN-HNF4α completely eliminated the HNF1α expression (Fig. 6 B). To confirm that HNF4α directly regulates HNF1α transcription, we transiently transfected WT-HNF4α-28 and DN-HNF4α-26 cells with a luciferase reporter construct containing either the wild type HNF1αgene promoter (HNF1αLuc) or a promoter that lacks a functional HNF4α-binding site (ΔAHNF1αLuc). As demonstrated in Fig. 6 C, overexpression of WT-HNF4α caused a 2.5-fold increase in the luciferase reporter enzyme activity in WT-HNF4α-28 cells transfected with HNF1αLuc. Deletion of the HNF4α-binding site in the HNF1α promoter (ΔAHNF1α) abolished the activation induced by WT-HNF4α (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, induction of DN-HNF4α caused a 71% reduction in wild type HNF1α promoter activity (Fig.6 C). The inhibitory effect of DN-HNF4α was no longer present in DN-HNF4α-26 cells transfected withΔAHNF1αLuc (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, HNF4α directly controls HNF1α gene expression in pancreatic β-cells as it does in hepatocytes. It has been demonstrated that HNF4α controls the expression of a large array of liver-specific genes encoding several apolipoproteins, metabolic proteins, and serum factors that are essential for hepatocyte differentiation and liver development (9Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar). HNF4α is also required for HNF1α expression in hepatocytes (7Tian J.-M. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 9Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar). Another study in embryonic stem cell-differentiated embryoid bodies (33Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-31214Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) shows that the absence of HNF4α affects the expression of genes encoding GLUT-2, aldolase B, and L-PK, which are involved in glucose transport and glycolysis. However, little is known as to how HNF4α regulates pancreatic β-cell gene expression. The primary cause of the MODY1 phenotype is impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (5Hattersley A.T. Diabetic Med. 1998; 15: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The present study was therefore designed to investigate the role of HNF4α in the regulation of the expression of β-cell genes implicated in glucose metabolism and associated insulin secretion. We found that overexpression of WT-HNF4α caused a left shift of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas dominant-negative suppression of HNF4α selectively blunted the insulin release induced by glucose and leucine but not by K+ depolarization. The diminished nutrient-evoked insulin secretion is associated with reduced ATP production in DN-HNF4α-expressing cells. The physiological insulin secretagogue leucine raises the cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations through mitochondrial metabolism downstream of glycolysis (28Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 34Kennedy E.D. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes Metab. 1998; 24: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that loss of HNF4α function leads to defective mitochondrial metabolism and, as a consequence, impaired insulin secretion. The reduced mitochondrial oxidation of [2-14C]pyruvate and the abrogation of mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization elicited by glucose, pyruvate, and methyl succinate indicate impaired mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activity and partial uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Quantitative Northern blot analysis allows us to identify HNF4α target genes responsible for defective metabolism-secretion coupling. HNF4α indeed regulates the expression of genes encoding GLUT-2, aldolase B, and L-PK in pancreatic β-cells (Fig. 5), as inferred from previous studies in hepatocytes and embryonic stem cell-differentiated embryoid bodies (8Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 9Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, we demonstrate that HNF4α alters the mRNA expression of mitochondrial OGDH E1 subunit and UCP-2 (Fig. 5), which may indeed contribute more significantly to the impaired metabolism-secretion coupling. The phenotype and gene expression patterns in DN-HNF4α-expressing cells are strikingly similar to those of DN-HNF1α-expressing cells (22Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang H. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether HNF4α regulates β-cell expression through HNF1α function, as in hepatocytes (9Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar). We provide unprecedented evidence that HNF4α is required for HNF1α expression in pancreatic β-cells. This conclusion is based on the use of an artificial dominant-negativehnf4α mutation. The naturally occurring human mutations of HNF4α do not function in a dominant-negative manner (6Lausen J. Thomas H. Lemm I. Bulman M. Borgschulze M. Lingott A. Hattersley A.T. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 430-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hani E.-H. Suaud L. Boutin P. Chèvre J.-C. Durand E. Philippi A. Demenais F. Vionnet N. Furuta H. Velho G. Bell G.I. Laine B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is to be expected that a mutation with such repressive action on the endogenous HNF4α function would cause embryonic lethality, as is the case in the hnf4α knock-out mouse (15Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Haploinsufficiency or reduced gene dosage of HNF4α may thus explain the mechanism leading to the MODY1 phenotype (33Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-31214Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The INS-1 cell line expressing DN-HNF4α provides a convenient model to explore the impact of impaired HNF4α function on β-cell gene expression and metabolism-secretion coupling. This goal cannot be achieved by the introduction of one of the human HNF4α mutations into β-cell lines. In fact, the induction of a nonsense mutation HNF4αQ268X to a level similar to DN-HNF4α had no detectable consequences on β-cell gene expression and metabolism-secretion coupling. 2H. Wang and C. B. Wollheim, unpublished results. MODY1 patients display secretory defects not only in β-cells but also in the glucagon-secreting α-cells and the pancreatic polypeptide-secreting cells (36Herman W.H.

Bell G.I. Fajans S.S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, this general effect on islet hormone release does not seem due to an effect on the development and differentiation of the endocrine pancreas, since altered HNF4α function did not affect the expression of PDX1 and other transcription factors determining pancreatic phenotype. On the other hand, loss of HNF4α function may cause reduced β-cell insulin content secondary to defective HNF1α function (22Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang H. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).

This study addresses the mechanism for this regulation, using primary cultures of fetal rat hypothalamic neurons as a model system. Leptin dose-dependently stimulated a 10-fold increase in pro-TRH biosynthesis, with a maximum response at 10 nm. TRH release was quantified using immunoprecipitation, followed by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis and specific TRH radioimmunoassay. Leptin stimulated TRH release by 7-fold. Immunocytochemistry revealed that a substantial population of cells expressed TRH or leptin receptors and that 8–13% of those expressing leptin receptors coexpressed TRH. Leptin produced a 5-fold induction of luciferase activity in CV-1 cells transfected with a TRH promoter and the long form of the leptin receptor cDNA. Although the above data are consistent with a direct ability of leptin to promote TRH biosynthesis through actions on TRH neurons, addition of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone produced a 3.5-fold increase in TRH biosynthesis and release, whereas neuropeptide Y treatment suppressed pro-TRH biosynthesis ∼3-fold. Furthermore, the melanocortin-4 receptor antagonist SHU9119 partially inhibited leptin-stimulated TRH release from the neuronal culture. Consequently, our data suggest that leptin regulates the TRH neurons through both direct and indirect pathways.

Previous work in starved rats has shown that this is associated with a decrease in hypothalamic, but not thalamic, reticular prepro-TRH1mRNA, supporting the concept that the hypothyroidism of starvation is of hypothalamic origin (1Blake N. Eckland D. Foster O. Lightman S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2714-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Leptin is a recently discovered peptide hormone that is synthesized and released by adipose tissue (3Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M.

Serum leptin levels decrease during starvation, and leptin has been proposed to be a major regulator of the central nervous system-mediated adaptation to starvation (2Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Mantzoros C. Qu D. Lowell B. Maratos-Flier E. Flier J.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar). Absence of leptin is responsible for the obese phenotype of ob/ob mice, and administration of this hormone to these animals reverses many of the endocrine defects (3Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11807) Google Scholar, 4Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker M.B. Hecht R. Winters D. Boone T. Collins F.

Science. 1995; 269: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). It was recently suggested that leptin has an important role in the neuroendocrine regulation of the HPT axis (2Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Mantzoros C. Qu D. Lowell B. Maratos-Flier E. Flier J.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar, 7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Endocr.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2569-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). During prolonged fasting in rats, low levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine are observed, and TSH is in the low to normal range. This is due in part to fasting-induced suppression of prepro-TRH gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus neurons. Since the decrease in thyroid hormone levels is blunted in fasted mice and rats by systemic administration of leptin (2Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Mantzoros C. Qu D. Lowell B. Maratos-Flier E. Flier J.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar, 9Ahima R.S. Kelly J. Elmquist J.K. Flier J.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4923-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the decrease in leptin during fasting alters the set point for feedback inhibition by thyroid hormones on prepro-TRH mRNA biosynthesis (8Legradi G. Emerson C.H. Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Lechan R.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2569-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which leptin regulates energy expenditure through the HPT axis is unknown. Leptin has direct actions on cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus, positively regulating pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and thus α-MSH and negatively regulating the appetite-stimulating peptide neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the agouti-related peptide (AgRP) (10Flier J.S. Maratos-Flier E. Cell. 1998; 92: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). NPY afferents neurons on TRH neurons are proposed to be inhibitory. Thus, the effect of leptin on TRH could be indirect, mediated by those arcuate neurons. In this study, using primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons that express high levels of endogenous pro-TRH (7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 599-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 11Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the hypothesis that leptin can regulate pro-TRH biosynthesis and TRH release by a direct action on TRH neurons. To this end, we determined the colocalization of pro-TRH with the leptin receptor (ObR), investigated the ability of leptin to activate the prepro-TRH promoter, and demonstrated that leptin induces pro-TRH biosynthesis and release. To support an additional indirect regulatory role of leptin in pro-TRH, we determined the effects of α-MSH and NPY on the biosynthesis of pro-TRH. The normal and timed-pregnant female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats used in these studies were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA and Kingston, NY). Fetal rat hypothalamic cells (day 17) were prepared as described earlier by us (11Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, timed-pregnant female rats on day 17 of gestation were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). The diencephala from fetuses were removed and dispersed enzymatically with neutral proteases (100 units/dl) for 2 h. The dispersed cells were then plated (5 × 106 cells/ml) in tissue culture flasks for radiolabeling and release studies. All cells were plated in wells precoated with 20 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma). The cells were maintained in bicarbonate-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. To induce differentiation of neuronal cells and prepro-TRH biosynthesis, the cells were cultured with 50 μmbromodeoxyuridine during the first 4 days as described previously (11Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry experiments, the cells were plated on four-chamber glass slides (LabTek, Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) at low density (5 × 105cells/ml). The human TRH promoter and RSV180 were both cloned into the vector pA3luc as described previously (12Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M.E. Chen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ObRb and STAT3 constructs have been described previously (13Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were grown as described previously (14Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1567-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected in triplicate using the calcium phosphate method. Each well received 1.7 μg of reporter, 0.8 μg of STAT3, and 0.8 μg of ObRb expression vectors. In addition, each well received 20 ng of a cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase expression vector to control for transfection efficiency. Total amounts of DNA were held constant. Eighteen hours after transfection, the cells were washed and placed in normal medium. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were incubated with serum-free medium. Forty hours after transfection, 100 nm leptin was added or not. The cells were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme activities. CHO cells stably expressing the short form of the leptin receptor (ObRa) were grown and generated as described earlier (13Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). AtT-20 were grown in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, and 90% humidity (15Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 6: 51-69Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Each flask was plated with 5 × 106 cells, and cultures were maintained for 6 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (15Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 6: 51-69Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The culture medium was removed every 2 days and replaced with fresh medium. Experiments were performed at a confluency corresponding to 20–30 × 106 cells. ObRb mRNA was quantified as described (16Bjørbæk C. Elmquist J.K. Michl P. Ahima R.S. van Bueren A. McCall A. Flier J.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3485-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), except for a few changes. Briefly, total RNA was isolated, and 0.20 μg were subjected to cDNA synthesis (100 μl total) with or without reverse transcriptase. For amplification of rat β-actin cDNA, the following primers were used: upstream primer, 5′-TTGTAACCAACTGGGACGATATGG-3′; and downstream primer, 5′-GATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGCTAGG-3′. The following primers were used for specific PCR amplification of rat ObRb cDNA: upstream primer, 5′-TATGTCATTGTACCGATAATTATT-3′; and downstream primer, 5′-CCCCTTGTGGAATCTGGAGTGG-3′. Each 50-μl PCR was carried out with 5.0 μl of cDNA as template and 0.50 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (29.6 TBq/mmol, 370 MBq/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The samples were subjected to 18 cycles of amplification for β-actin and 30 cycles for ObRb. Five microliters of the reaction were run on a denaturing urea-acrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and finally subjected to 32P PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). After 12 days in culture, hypothalamic neurons (5 × 106/flask) were stimulated with increasing concentrations of leptin for a period of 6 h in low leucine, serum-deprived Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium. The cells were pulsed for the entire 6 h with 0.3 mCi of ]3,4,5-3H]leucine (156 Ci/mmol) for pro-TRH and processing product radiolabeling and 0.3 mCi of [l-2,3,4,5-3H]proline (100 Ci/mmol) for TRH radiolabeling. For long-term labeling, we utilized 90% (9 volumes) leucine-free medium mixed with 1 volume of regular medium. After the incubations, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times. After the last wash, the cells were rapidly cooled on ice, and 2 ml of 2 n acetic acid containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and enzyme inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, bacitracin, bestatin, and pepstatin, each at 0.1%) were added. The cells were scraped and heated to 95 °C for 10 min prior to sonication. One-hundred microliters of sample were removed for protein assay. The remainder of the cell extract was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was then lyophilized and held at −20 °C until analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For TRH analysis, the medium from these cultures was immunoprecipitated with anti-TRH antibodies, followed by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis (IEFGE) (see below). An immunoprecipitation protocol was carried out as described previously (17Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized cell extracts were resuspended in 10 μl of 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 200 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Following resuspension, cell extracts were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of protein G-purified anti-pro-TRH-(115–151) antibody (15Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 6: 51-69Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Then, a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG was added along with 75 μl of buffer B (500 mm KCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 5 mm NaEDTA, and 0.25% Triton X-100). Samples were further incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates of cell extracts were washed once with buffer B and once with buffer C (10 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.2) and 15 mm NaCl), which removes EDTA and Triton X-100. The immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in sample buffer (0.0625 m Tris (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 15% glycerol, and 15 mm dithiothreitol) and boiled for 4 min prior to SDS-PAGE. The release medium obtained from proline-labeled cultures was immunoprecipitated with anti-TRH antibodies as described above and resuspended in sample buffer prior to IEFGE. Radioactive or unlabeled samples were fractionated by mobility by loading onto a discontinuous Tricine/SDS-PAGE system for separation of low molecular mass peptides (18Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A stacking gel was made to 3% cross-linking (acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution), and the separating gel was made to 6% cross-linking (acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution). Gels were run in the Protean 16-cm cell system (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, gels were cut into 1-mm slices in a gel slicer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) and prepared for either counting or radioimmunoassay. For tritium analysis, immunoprecipitated peptides were extracted from gel slices by incubation in 1 ml of 1n acetic acid for 24 h at 4 °C. Scintillation fluid (Bio Safe II, Research Product International Corp., IL) was added, and samples were counted in a scintillation counter. Preparation for radioimmunoassay (RIA) included the same acetic acid extraction as described above, but following incubation, gel slices were removed. Samples were then lyophilized and resuspended in the appropriate RIA buffer. Recovery of peptides from gel slices has been shown to be ∼90% as determined by RIA prior to and following the electrophoresis (19Nillni E.A. Friedman T.C. Todd R.B. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Jackson I.M.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2462-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To identify the apparent molecular masses of fractionated peptides on SDS-PAGE, a series of molecular mass markers was used: prestained bovine serum albumin, 80.0 kDa; ovalbumin, 49.5 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 32.5 kDa; soybean trypsin inhibitor, 27.5 kDa; lysozyme, 18.5 kDa (Bio-Rad); trypsin inhibitor, 20.4 kDa; myoglobin, 16.95 kDa; myoglobin fragment IV, 14.4 kDa; myoglobin fragment III, 8.16 kDa; myoglobin fragment II, 6.2 kDa; and myoglobin fragment I, 2.5 kDa (Diversified Biotech, Newton, MA). Immunoprecipitated [3H]proline-labeled TRH samples with anti-TRH antibodies were fractionated on an IEFGE according to estimated isoelectric points for TRH. This was based on theoretical calculations using MacVector software for protein analysis (pI ∼7.00) and using the Swiss Protein Annotated Protein Sequence Database, the TrEMBL Computer-annotated supplement to the Swiss Protein Database (pI ∼6.8–7.00). Samples dissolved in sample buffer (6m urea, 1% CHAPS, 80 mm dithiothreitol, 1.6% Pharmalyte 5–8, and 0.4% Pharmalyte 2.5–5) were run in 30% acrylamide and 1% bisacrylamide gel tubes in buffer containing 6m urea and 1% CHAPS. To generate a pH 4.6–8.00 gradient, 1% Pharmalyte 2.5–5 and 4% Pharmalyte 5–8 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the solution. The pH gradient was pre-established by subjecting the gel tubes to 100 V for 15 min and 200 V for another 15 min utilizing 100 mm NaOH in the upper chamber and 10 mm H3PO4 in the lower chamber. After the prerun, samples were loaded and run for 2.5 h at 400 V. After the run, each gel tube was sliced (0.5 cm), put in scintillation vials containing 2 n acetic acid, keep at 4 °C for 3 days, and counted. The pH gradient was determined by measuring the pH in each slice. After the run, a gel tube without sample was incubated in 2 ml of 50 mm KCl under vacuum overnight, and the pH was measured with a pH meter and using Bio-Rad IEFGE standards, a mixture of nine natural proteins with isoelectric points ranging from 4.45 to 9.0. RIA for TRH was performed in triplicate samples removed from nonradioactive neuronal cells previously exposed to increasing concentrations of leptin. The protocol for TRH RIA is standard in our laboratory and has been published elsewhere (19Nillni E.A. Friedman T.C. Todd R.B. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Jackson I.M.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2462-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hypothalamic neurons (3 × 105) from 12-day-old cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to an immunocytochemistry protocol as described previously (11Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CHO cells transfected with an empty vector or expressing the short form of the leptin receptor were subjected to immunostaining using an antibody against the common extracellular domain of the leptin receptor. Generation of this polyclonal antibody was done as described earlier (20Bjørbæk C. Elmquist J.K. Frantz J.D. Shoelson S. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Immunoreaction of the primary anti-ObR antibody with the hypothalamic neurons was performed at 4 °C for 24 h. Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate was used as the fluorescence marker. A wide range of dilutions for the primary and secondary antibodies was tested. The optimal dilutions were found to be 1:1000 for the primary antibody and 1:2000 for the secondary antibody, with incubation times of 24 h at 4 °C for the primary antibody and 2 h at room temperature for the secondary antibody. Control experiments, including the incubation of cells without primary antibody or preimmune serum and the blocking of the primary antibody with synthetic peptides against which the antibody was generated, were performed and did not show any positive staining. For colocalization experiments, cells previously stained with anti-ObR antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate probe (green color) were then incubated with anti-pAV37-Texas Red or anti-pST10-Texas Red antibody for 24 h at 4 °C. Anti-pAV37 antibody recognizes the TRH prohormone, and anti-pST10 antibody recognizes the end product of processing prepro-TRH-(160–169) (11Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conjugation of Texas Red (red color) to these antibodies, as well as their ability to obtain successful colocalization with other proteins, was described previously by us in experiments demonstrating the colocalization of pro-TRH with the prohormone convertase-1 (18Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TRH RIA values were calculated from release media denied from controls and treated cells. Samples for each condition were taken in triplicate. Protein assay results were used to correct for minor variations in total cell number. Data are displayed as ng/ml. Analysis of variance, followed by a multiple comparison (Tukey-Kramer test), was employed when appropriate. We have previously used primary cultures of fetal rat hypothalamic neurons to study pro-TRH biosynthesis and processing (11Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nillni E.A. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 185-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this primary cell system, we examined the effect of leptin on the biosynthesis of pro-TRH. After 12 days in culture, primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons were stimulated with leptin for 6 h in the presence of radioactive leucine (leucine is present 21 times in the pro-TRH sequence). After treatment, radioactive peptides were acid-extracted and subjected to double immunoprecipitation with an antibody, previously characterized by us (18Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), directed against prepro-TRH-(116–151) (anti-pAV37antibody) that recognizes the TRH precursor (26 kDa) and an intermediate form of its processing of ∼16 kDa. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to separation on a Tricine/SDS-PAGE system, followed by slicing and radioactive counting. A typical SDS-PAGE profile of immunoprecipitated pro-TRH and the intermediate form of ∼16 kDa during leptin treatment as compared with untreated controls is depicted in Fig.1 A. Fig. 1 B depicts the profile of pro-TRH (26 kDa) biosynthesis in three independent experiments similar to that shown in Fig.1 A. Since the radioactive incorporation into proteins and the SDS-PAGE separation profile vary from one experiment to the next, the values were normalized by calculating the ratio between the pro-TRH radioactive peak in cells treated with leptin versus the pro-TRH peak in untreated controls. Those values were also corrected against the total [3H]leucine incorporated by the cells for each experiment as measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Molecular masses of the identified peaks are indicated based on the migration of standards. The results show an ∼10-fold increase in pro-TRH biosynthesis in cells treated with 10 nmleptin as compared with untreated controls. These data indicate that leptin can stimulate the biosynthesis of pro-TRH. Having determined that leptin stimulates the synthesis of pro-TRH, we wanted to determine whether leptin increases TRH release. We first evaluated the release of TRH synthesized de novo by subjecting the cells treated with leptin to a pulse with [3H]proline (which is present in the TRH molecule). Even though proline is a nonessential amino acid and may not have the advantages of an essential amino acid for radiolabeling, a dramatic increase in radiolabeling in proline-rich proteins has been reported in the rat parathyroid gland (22Sasaki S. Shimokawa H. Tanaka K. J. Dent. Res. 1982; 61: 1479-1482Google Scholar, 23Muenzer J. Bildstein C. Gleason M. Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5623-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More than 90% of the [3H]proline found in the parathyroid gland was incorporated into proline-rich proteins. Radiolabeled TRH in the release medium was then immunoprecipitated with anti-TRH antibodies and subjected to IEFGE (pH gradient ∼4.5–8). We have recently developed the conditions for the identification of TRH utilizing the isoelectric focusing system. The approximate isoelectric point for TRH was ∼7.00 based on theoretical calculations (see “Materials and Methods”), and our experimental results are presented in Fig. 2 A. The results depicted in Fig. 2 A represent a typical IEFGE profile from media samples collected after treatment of hypothalamic cells with leptin for 6 h in the presence of [3H]proline. The data show that treatment of hypothalamic neurons with leptin increased the release of TRH in a dose-dependent fashion from 1 to 10 nm. Ten nanomolar leptin showed an effect on TRH release of ∼5-fold as compared with untreated controls. AtT-20 cells, which do not carry endogenous pro-TRH, were used as a control for the IEFGE system. As expected, immunoprecipitation of [3H]proline-radiolabeled release peptides in these cells showed background levels of radioactivity (Fig. 2 A). We next wanted to determine whether the increase in TRH release by leptin, in addition to inducing a new biosynthesis of pro-TRH and release of TRH (Fig. 2 A), is also due to an action of leptin as a secretagogue. To this end, the release medium was collected from cultured cells exposed to increasing concentrations of leptin for 6 h and compared with that from untreated control cells. The samples were analyzed by specific RIA against TRH as described previously (18Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the release of TRH increased in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximum response being observed at 10 nm leptin (15-fold). The big difference in release measured by the two approaches indicates that leptin not only induces the activation of prepro-TRH gene expression to ultimately translate more pro-TRH into protein, but also acts as a secretagogue. The 10-fold difference observed between TRH measurements by radiolabeling versus RIA indicates that leptin also induces the release of TRH stored in mature secretory granules near the plasma membrane of the cell, mechanisms that are independent of gene activation. Since the samples were collected after 6 h, the total amount of TRH measured by RIA may account for the newly synthesized plus TRH molecules accumulated in mature secretory granules. In our previous study (24Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we showed that the newly formed pro-TRH needs at least 120 min to be processed and deliver its end products of post-translational processing to mature secretory granules. Studies looking at short-time leptin stimulation (<120 min) are under way to further quantify the amount of TRH release by leptin as secretagogue alone. To further investigate whether leptin might have direct effects on"

The increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in myocytes by digitalis treatment and after ischemia/reperfusion is also thought to result from the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism. However, the precise roles of the NCX1 are still unclear because of the lack of its specific inhibitors. We generated Ncx1-deficient mice by gene targeting to determine the in vivo function of the exchanger. Homozygous Ncx1-deficient mice died between embryonic days 9 and 10. Their hearts did not beat, and cardiac myocytes showed apoptosis. No forward mode or reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was detected in null mutant hearts. The Na+-dependent Ca2+ exchange activity as well as protein content of NCX1 were decreased by ∼50% in the heart, kidney, aorta, and smooth muscle cells of the heterozygous mice, and tension development of the aortic ring in Na+-free solution was markedly impaired in heterozygous mice. These findings suggest that NCX1 is required for heartbeats and survival of cardiac myocytes in embryos and plays critical roles in Na+-dependent Ca2+ handling in the heart and aorta.

The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger plays important roles in maintaining calcium homeostasis in many mammalian tissues (1Schulze D. Kofuji P. Hadley R. Kirby M.S. Kieval R.S. Doering A. Niggli E. Lederer W.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1726-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This exchanger catalyzes the electrogenic exchange of one intracellular Ca2+ ion for three extracellular Na+ ions in each reaction cycle (2Reeves J.P. Hale C.C. J. Biol.

Previous studies have defined three isoforms of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3) that are coded by distinct genes in mammals (4Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D.

NCX1-specific transcripts are most abundant in the heart, although they are found in many other tissues (6Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

Hydropathy analysis shows that the NCX1 protein has 11 transmembrane regions with a large intracellular loop located between membrane-spanning segments 5 and 6 (4Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D.

Smolley J.R. Spitzer K.W. Science. 1990; 248: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). NCX1 excludes Ca2+ that enters the cardiac myocytes through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels during contraction and returns the cell to its resting state. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in myocytes by digitalis treatment and after ischemia/reperfusion is also thought to result from the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism (9Kleber A.G. Circ. Res. 1983; 52: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It was reported that an NCX1 inhibitor, KBR-7943, showed significant protection of cardiomyocytes against Ca2+ and Na+ overload during anoxia and hypercontracture (10Ladilov Y. Haffner S.

Previous studies, using electrophysiological and other techniques, have shown that NCX1 is activated by [Ca2+]i (3Kimura J. Noma A. Irisawa H.

Recent studies, using molecular biological techniques, have revealed that a high affinity Ca2+ binding site in the central cytoplasmic loop of NCX1 is required for the regulation by Ca2+ (17Levitsky D.O.

Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17230-17238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although many previous studies strongly indicated the critical role of NCX1 in cardiac function, there are still many ambiguities because of lack of specific inhibitors. In addition, the role of NCX1 during development is not known. Therefore, we generated mutant mice that lack the Ncx1 gene. We cloned the Ncx1gene from a 129/SV mouse genomic library. The targeting vector was constructed by insertion of the neo cassette into the 3-kilobase pair XbaI–XhoI fragment containing exon 2 of the Ncx1 gene. The diphtheria toxin-A fragment gene was ligated to the 3′ position of the targeting vector for negative selection (see Fig. 1 A). The A3-1 embryonic stem (ES)1 cell line was transfected with the linearized targeting vector by electroporation. After G418 selection, homologous recombinants were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. PCR and Southern and Northern blot hybridizations were performed by standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Targeted ES cells were aggregated with eight cells from C57Bl/6J (B6) mice, and chimeric blastocysts were implanted into the uterus of pseudopregnant ICR mice. Chimeric male mice were then mated to female B6 mice to confirm the germline transmission. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (21Tsuda M. Imaizumu K. Katayama T. Kitagawa K. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Takagi T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6678-6684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, day 9.5 embryos were frozen and sectioned at 15 μm. Antisense and sense cRNA probes were prepared from a mouse NCX1 cDNA (XbaI–XhoI, 445 base pairs) with digoxigenin-UTP according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Thaw-mounted sections on polylysine-coated slides were post fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde and then washed twice for 5 min in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The post fixed sections were treated with 0.001% proteinase K and subsequently were placed for 10 min in a solution of 0.1 m triethanolamine and 0.225% anhydrous acetic acid. After washing in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, sections were dehydrated through a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol. The air-dried sections were prehybridized for 1 h at 50 °C in the hybridization buffer (10% sodium dextran sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3m NaCl, 0.2% SarKosyl, 0.2% heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 50% formamide) and then hybridized overnight at 50 °C in the hybridization solution with 100 ng/ml cRNA probe. After rinsing in 5× SSC at 60 °C for 20 min, the sections were washed in 50% formamide, 2× SSC at 60 °C for 30 min. Next, they were subjected to RNase digestion for 20 min at 37 °C (1 μg/ml RNase A in a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5) and then washed in 50% formaldehyde, 2× SSC at 60 °C for 30 min. The hybridization signal was detected using alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Color was developed by incubation with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and phosphate solution. Whole embryos were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde overnight, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 2 μm. Sections were then incubated with anti-PECAM antibody to identify endothelial cells (22Bader B.L. Rayburn H. Crowley D. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1998; 95: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i concentration was measured at room temperature as described previously (23Yao A. Su Z. Nonaka A. Zubair I. Lu L. Philipson K.D. Bridge J.H. Barry W.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, whole hearts were excised from embryos at day 9.5 under the microscope and incubated in dye-loading solution containing 5 mm Fluo-3 for 30 min. Fluo-3-loaded hearts were then attached to a CELL TAK (Collaborative Biochemical Products)-coated glass plate in the flow-through chamber on the microscope. After washing with dye-free normal HEPES solution consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.08 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm KOH, 5.5 mm glucose, 4 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, hearts were excited by a mercury arc lamp system at a 485-nm wavelength, and fluorescence at 530 nm was detected. Measurement of [Na+]i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake was performed as described previously (24Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8996-9001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, for Na+ loading, confluent smooth muscle cells in 24-well dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in balanced salt solution (BSS) (10 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.4, 146 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 1 mm ouabain and 10 mm monensin.45Ca2+ uptake was initiated by switching the medium to Na+-free BSS or to normal BSS, both of which contained 0.1–2 mm45CaCl2 (1.5 mCi/ml). After 30 s of incubation, 45Ca2+uptake was terminated, and radioactivity was counted. [Na+]i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake activity was estimated by subtracting the 45Ca2+ uptake in normal BSS from that in Na+-free BSS. Thoracic aortic rings (∼4 mm in length) were prepared from 12–15-week-old mice. Isometric tension was measured as described previously (25Motley E.D. Paul R.J. Matlib M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1028-H1040PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, using two thin steel wires, the ring was tied to a force transducer and suspended in a water bath containing Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (118.5 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 24.9 mmNaHCO3, 10.0 mm glucose, and 0.03 mm EDTA) bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Aortic rings were stabilized at a resting tension of 1 g for 1 h before recording contractile responses. Aortic rings were soaked in Na+-free buffer (118.5 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4.74 mm KCl, 1.18 mm MgSO4, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 2.54 mmCaCl2, 25 mm choline bicarbonate, 10 mm glucose, and 0.01 mm EDTA) at 37 °C and were pretreated with 10 μm ionomycin. Then the relaxation response induced by the addition of 10 mm EGTA was measured. Contractile responses were also measured by changing to Na+-free buffer after the treatment of 0.1 mmouabain for 30 min. Exon 2 ofNcx1 is a first coding exon and encodes approximately two-thirds of the NCX1 protein (26Kraev A. Chumakov I. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In targeting vector, this exon was replaced by the neomycin-resistant gene (neo) (Fig. 1 A). A3-1 ES cells were transfected with the targeting vector, and ES clones containing the homologously recombined gene were isolated. Chimeric mice were generated using these recombinant ES cells by the aggregation method. The heterozygous (Ncx1 +/−) mice were mated to generate null mutant mice. No homozygous (Ncx1 −/−) mutant offspring was identified among ∼100 pups from heterozygous intercrosses (Fig. 1 B). Although Ncx1 −/− embryos could be recognized at day 9.5, Ncx1 −/− embryos were absorbed after day 10.5. The disruption of the Ncx1 gene in mutant embryos were confirmed by Northern blot analysis using RNA prepared from whole embryos (Fig. 1 C) and reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). There were no obvious blood vessels in the yolk sacs of Ncx1 −/− embryos (Fig.2 A). The body size ofNcx1 −/− embryos was smaller than that of their wild type (Ncx1 +/+) orNcx1 +/− littermates (Fig. 2 B).Ncx1 −/− embryos also exhibited an enlarged pericardial sac (Fig. 2 B). Otherwise, developments of limb buds, the cranial neural tube, and somites ofNcx1 −/− embryos was comparable with those ofNcx1 +/+ embryos (28Rugh R. The Mouse—Its Reproduction and Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1994Google Scholar). AlthoughNcx1 +/+ and Ncx1 +/−hearts showed spontaneous rhythmic contractions at day 9.5, ∼70% ofNcx1 −/− embryos did not show any heartbeats, and the remaining Ncx1 −/− embryos showed very slow and arrhythmic contraction. To determine the localization of NCX1 transcripts in the embryos at day 9.5, we performed in situhybridization analysis. This analysis using whole embryos revealed thatNcx1 is expressed abundantly and restrictedly in the heart at day 9.5 (Fig. 2 C). These findings strongly suggest that NCX1 is essential for heartbeats in embryos. To determine the cause of embryonic lethality of Ncx1 −/−mutants, day 9.5 embryos were examined. Histological analysis revealed that the ventricular wall of Ncx1 −/− was very thin and that there were fewer cardiac myocytes in the ventricle ofNcx1 −/− mice than that ofNcx1 +/+ littermates (Fig.3, A–D). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that heart-specific genes such asCsx/Nkx2.5, GATA4, atrial natriuretic peptide,and myosin light chain 2v genes were expressed inNcx1 −/− mice as abundantly as inNcx1 +/+ and Ncx1 +/−littermates (data not shown), suggesting that there is no defect in cardiomyocyte differentiation. Some myocardial cells inNcx1 −/− embryos showed morphology characteristic of apoptosis such as nuclear condensation and cell shrinkage (Fig. 3 D) (29Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). In the neural tube and optic vesicle, many epithelial cells showed prominent nuclear condensation and cell shrinkage (Fig. 4,A–D). In addition, many epithelial cells were detached from the neural tube and neural crest. To evaluate the degree of apoptosis, we performed TUNEL analysis. Many TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the heart and neural tube of Ncx1 −/− embryos, whereas no positive cells were detected in the corresponding area ofNcx1 +/+ embryos (Fig. 3, E andF and Fig. 4, E–H). Because Ncx1expression was restricted to the heart and not detected in epithelial cells at day 9.5, apoptosis of neuroepithelial cells inNcx1-lacking mice may be secondary to ischemia caused by the lack of blood circulation although slight expression of Ncx1in epithelial cells, which was not detected by in situhybridization analysis, cannot be ruled out.Figure 4Histological analysis and TUNEL assay of day 9.5 embryos. Transverse sections through the telencephalic vesicle of Ncx1 +/+ (A, B,E, and F) and Ncx1 −/−(C, D, G, and H) embryos are shown. Scale bars indicate 200 μm (A,C, and E), 100 μm (B, F, and G), 50 μm (D, H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 2 A, obvious vessels were not observed in yolk sacs of the null mutant. We examined the development of vessels by staining with anti-PECAM antibody, which reacts with endothelial cells. Although honeycomb-like vasculature was present in bothNcx1 +/+ and Ncx1 −/−yolk sac, branching vitelline vessels were not observed, and a plexus of capillaries was enlarged in the Ncx1 −/−yolk sac (Fig. 5 A). BecauseNcx1 is not expressed in yolk sac vessels at that embryonic stage, the impaired development of yolk sac vessels is also thought to be secondary to loss of heartbeats. We next examined hematopoiesis. In yolk sac circulation, blood islands were present inNcx1 −/− as well asNcx1 +/+ yolk sac, suggesting that hematopoiesis is normal in Ncx1 −/− embryos. Capillaries were also formed but dilated in Ncx1 −/− embryos (Fig. 5 B). This finding was consistent with the observations of anti-PECAM staining. In placental circulation, the primitive erythrocytes were detected in the placental labyrinth and chorionic plate of the Ncx1 +/+ embryos but not ofNcx1 −/− embryos (Fig. 5 C). These findings suggest that erythrocytes, which were normally formed in blood islands, did not circulate due to the deficiency of heartbeats. It has been reported that mechanical forces including shear stress and stretch as well as growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-β are essential for vascular development in the yolk sac (30Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). In general vasculogenesis of the yolk sac, the primary capillary plexus generated by sprouting develops into a mature vascular system through the remodeling (30Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the remodeling of the primary capillary plexus is impaired inNcx1 −/− embryos possibly because of the defects of blood circulation. To determine the mechanism of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and loss of heartbeats, we examined the Ca2+ signaling in the organ-cultured heart of day 9.5 embryos using Ca2+indicator Fluo-3. Spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ transient was observed in Ncx1 +/+ hearts in normal HEPES solution and was completely inhibited in 20 μmnifedipine-contained solution, as shown in Fig.6, suggesting that the Ca2+cycling system in hearts of day 9.5 embryos requires Ca2+influx though L-type Ca2+ channels, as observed in adult hearts. Although sporadic Ca2+ transients at a very low frequency were observed (data not shown),Ncx1 −/− hearts did not show fast Ca2+ transients, suggesting that NCX1 is required for Ca2+ transients. To examine the role of NCX1 in Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity, hearts were perfused with Na+-free solution (0 mm Na+ solution). Removal of Na+ markedly increased [Ca2+]i inNcx1 +/+ hearts, and subsequent application of 140 mm Na+ decreased [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6 A). However,Ncx1 −/− hearts did not show any response to either removal or reapplication of Na+ (Fig.6 B). These findings clearly indicate that the reverse mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was absent in theNcx1 −/− heart at day 9.5. To evaluate the forward mode of Na+/Ca2+exchange activity in Ncx1 −/− hearts, we examined the decline of caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients. After equilibrating the sarcoplasmic reticulum with Ca2+, 20 mm caffeine was applied to the hearts. Caffeine of millimolar concentration has been reported to release Ca2+from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors and to inhibit Ca2+ uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (31Chapman R.A. Leoty C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1976; 258: 1-2PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, 20 mm caffeine induced a marked increase in [Ca2+]i in bothNcx1 +/+ and Ncx1 −/−hearts (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that sarcoplasmic reticulum contains Ca2+ and that ryanodine receptors are functional in both Ncx1 +/+ andNcx1 −/− hearts at day 9.5. The decay phase of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient appears to be slower in the Ncx1 −/− heart (Fig. 6 B). To clarify if this was due to disruption of the forward mode of the Na+-dependent Ca2+ exchange activity, we applied caffeine to the hearts in 0 mmNa+ solution (Fig. 6, C and D, red line). The decay phase was dramatically prolonged in 0 mm Na+ solution (Fig. 6 C, red line) in a Ncx1 +/+ heart compared with that in 140 mm Na+ solution (Fig.6 C, black line), which was consistent with previous findings (23Yao A. Su Z. Nonaka A. Zubair I. Lu L. Philipson K.D. Bridge J.H. Barry W.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 32Bers D.M. Bassani J.W.M. Bassani R.A. Cardiovasc.

This finding suggests that NCX1 plays an important role in the decay of caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients. In contrast, the decay phase of caffeine-induced Ca2+transient was not affected by the presence of Na+ inNcx1 −/− hearts (Fig. 6 D, red lineand black line), indicating that the forward mode Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity is completely lacking in Ncx1 −/− hearts. The decay of caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients has been reported to be mediated by sarcolemmal Ca2+-ATPase and mitochondria as well as NCX1 (23Yao A. Su Z. Nonaka A. Zubair I. Lu L. Philipson K.D. Bridge J.H. Barry W.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 32Bers D.M. Bassani J.W.M. Bassani R.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1772-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We investigated the functional contribution of sarcolemmal Ca2+-ATPase to the decay phase of caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i transients usingNcx1 −/− hearts. Sarcolemmal Ca2+-ATPase was inhibited by raising the extracellular Ca2+ levels. As shown in Fig. 6 D, the decay phase of caffeine-induced [Ca2+]itransient elicited by a solution of 10 mm Ca2+, 0 mm Na+, 20 μmcaffeine, and 20 μm nifedipine concentration (blue line) was markedly prolonged in comparison with that by either a solution of 0 mmCa2+, 140 mm Na+, 20 mm caffeine, and 20 μm nifedipine concentration (black line) or a solution of 0 mm Ca2+, 0 mmNa+, 20 mm caffeine, and 20 μm nifedipine concentration (red line). These findings clearly indicate that sarcolemmal Ca2+-ATPase is critically involved in the decay phase of caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i transients. We next examined expression levels of NCX1 protein and the Na+-dependent Ca2+ exchange activity in Ncx1 +/− adult mice. Protein levels of NCX1 in the heart, kidney, aorta, and smooth muscle cells ofNcx1 +/− mice were half that found inNcx1 +/+ mice (Fig.7 A, inset, and data not shown). Intracellular Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in cultured smooth muscle cells ofNcx1 +/− mice was also down-regulated to half that of Ncx1 +/+ mice (Fig.7 A). The maximum velocities of Ca2+ uptake in smooth muscle cells in both Ncx1 +/+ andNcx1 +/− mice were 1.35 and 0.71 nmol/30 s/mg of protein, respectively (Fig. 7 B). Thus, the Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was well correlated to NCX1 protein levels in both Ncx1 +/+ andNcx1 +/− mice. To determine whether this correlation was also observed at the tissue level, we examined Ca2+ uptake-dependent relaxation of aortic rings (Fig. 8, A andB). Aortic rings were precontracted by treatment with ionomycin and subsequently with EGTA. In the presence of extracellular Na+, there were no significant differences in the rate and degree of relaxation between Ncx1 +/+ andNcx1 +/− mice. This suggests that non-NCX1 Ca2+ efflux systems may be up-regulated to compensate for the reduced amount of NCX1 protein in Ncx1 +/−mice. In the absence of extracellular Na+, the rate and degree of relaxation were markedly decreased inNcx1 +/+ mice but not inNcx1 +/− mice. These findings suggest that the smooth muscle relaxation of Ncx1 +/− aorta is extracellular Na+-independent unlikeNcx1 +/+ mice.Figure 8Relaxation and contraction of aortic rings. A and B, time-dependent relaxation induced by 10 mm EGTA in aortic rings fromNcx1 +/+ (A) andNcx1 +/− (B) mice pretreated with 10 μm ionomycin in normal or Na+-free Krebs-Ringer solution. D, each point andbar represent CX1 +/− mice. The aorta was treated with 0.1 mm ouabain for 30 min and then exposed to Na+-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the effect of Na+ removal on tension development in aortic rings of Ncx1 +/+ andNcx1 +/− mice (Fig. 8, C andD). When aortic rings were treated with 0.1 mmouabain for 30 min and then placed in Na+-free solution, the developed tension was significantly reduced in adultNcx1 +/− mice (36% of high K+-induced tension) as compared withNcx1 +/+ mice (94% of high K+-induced tension). These findings suggest that altered expression levels of NCX1 have a profound effect on vascular tension development. Therefore, the NCX1 modulator can be a useful tool to control vascular contractility, and Ncx1 +/−mice would be very useful to elucidate physiological and pathological functions of NCX1. We thank H. Fujimura and S. Nito for helpful discussions and Y. Hamazaki for maintaining mice."

(1999) Nature 402, 685–689). Glucose, leucine, succinic acid methyl ester, and α-ketoisocaproic acid all markedly stimulate insulin release but do not increase glutamate levels in pancreatic islets. Increasing the intracellular glutamate levels to 10-fold higher than basal levels by adding glutamine to islets does not stimulate insulin release. When leucine, in addition to glutamine, is applied to islets, insulin release is almost as high as with glucose alone. This is consistent with the known ability of leucine to allosterically activate glutamate deamination by glutamate dehydrogenase, which can supply α-ketoglutarate to the citric acid cycle. Experiments with mitochondria from pancreatic islets suggest that flux through the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction is quiescent during glucose-induced insulin secretion. These experiments support the traditional idea that when insulin release is associated with flux through glutamate dehydrogenase, the flux is in the direction of α-ketoglutarate.

N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid. Recently Maechler and Wollheim (1Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), on the basis of intricate and broad-based experiments, proposed that glutamate generated from citric acid cycle-derived α-ketoglutarate is a messenger in glucose-induced insulin secretion. The glutamate effect was not robust, and its demonstration seemed to require rather narrowly defined conditions. For example, dimethylglutamate, a glutamate precursor that is permeable to the plasma membrane, caused a leftward shift in the concentration dependence of glucose-stimulated insulin release in INS-1 insulinoma cells. Dimethylglutamate did not stimulate insulin release at a basal concentration of glucose (2.5 mm) or augment insulin release at concentrations of glucose (16.7 to 25 mm) optimal for insulin release. Insulin release by dimethylglutamate was potentiated only at intermediate glucose concentrations. It was reported that when rat insulinoma INS-1 cells were incubated in the presence of a concentration of glucose (12.8 mm) that stimulates insulin release, cellular glutamate levels increased 4.8-fold to a stimulated level of 0.22 mm within 30 min. It was also observed that glucose (16.7 mm) augmented glutamate levels in human pancreatic islets from a basal level of 0.78 to a stimulated level of 3.93 nmol of glutamate per mg of islet protein. However, even these stimulated levels of glutamate are quite low. Our calculations indicate that the basal (0.04 to 0.08 mm) and stimulated glutamate levels (0.2 to 0.4 mm) reported by Maechler and Wollheim (1Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) are far lower than the basal concentration of glutamate of 1 to 7 mmfound in many tissues (2Williamson D.H. Brosnan J.T.

Idahl L.A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1970; 2: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, even though sophisticated approaches were employed to investigate the glutamate as messenger hypothesis, there was the suggestion from previous reports (3Danielsson B. Hellman B. Idahl L.A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1970; 2: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Malaisse-Lagae F. Welsh M. Matthews D.E. Bier D.M. Hellerstrom C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the current study we chose to address an issue essential for the support of the major premise of the glutamate as messenger hypothesis. That is, whether increases in intracellular glutamate are associated with insulin release.Results of simple experiments that permit a straightforward interpretation, unfortunately, cast significant doubt on the idea that glutamate is a messenger for any insulin secretagogue. Glucose and other secretagogues did not increase intracellular glutamate levels in pancreatic islets, and when islet glutamate levels were increased 10-fold by glutamine, insulin release did not occur. Studies with pancreatic islet mitochondria did not suggest that insulin secretagogues increase the amination of α-ketoglutarate. The results of the current study support the traditional theory of insulin secretion involving glutamate, which is that leucine, by allosterically activating glutamate dehydrogenase, can stimulate glutamate deamination to α-ketoglutarate, which is further metabolized in the citric acid cycle to stimulate insulin secretion (3Danielsson B.

We found higher basal levels of glutamate (1 to 2.5 mm)1 in pancreatic islets than Maechler and Wollheim (1Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) observed in stimulated insulinoma cells and pancreatic islet cells, and we did not see glutamate levels rise above background levels in the presence of glucose, the most potent physiologic metabolizable insulin secretagogue (TableI). In addition, the metabolizable insulinotropic agents succinic acid methyl ester and α-ketoisocaproic acid did not increase cellular glutamate levels. However, we observed that glutamine, which is permeable to the plasma membrane and is known not to be an insulin secretagogue when applied to islets by itself (9Fahien L.A. MacDonald M.J. Kmiotek E.H. Mertz R.J. Fahien C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13610-13614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increased cellular glutamate levels up to 10-fold without increasing insulin release. These experiments do not support the idea that intracellular glutamate is an intracellular messenger for any insulin secretagogue.Table IEffects of various insulin secretagogues and nonsecretagogues on the concentration of glutamate and on insulin release in isolated pancreatic isletsIncubation mixture conditionGlutamate concentrationInsulin releasenmol glutamate/mg proteinmicroUnits insulin/5 isletsNo addition22 ± 2 (23)33 ± 6 (59)Glucose, 16.7 mm21 ± 2 (14)377 ± 20 (53) 1-ap < 0.001vs. no addition.Glutamine, 1 mm52 ± 3 (6) 1-ap < 0.001vs. no addition.34 ± 6 (10)Glutamine, 5 mm93 ± 7 (6) 1-ap < 0.001vs. no addition.

The amount of insulin released by leucine alone (Table I) or BCH is usually about one-third of that stimulated by glucose alone (9Fahien L.A. MacDonald M.J. Kmiotek E.H. Mertz R.J. Fahien C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13610-13614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the addition of glutamine alone to the incubation mixture has no effect on insulin release, when glutamine is added along with leucine, insulin release is increased to levels almost as high as with glucose (see Ref. 9Fahien L.A.

Leucine did not increase but lowered the level of glutamate derived from glutamine from 10-fold higher than the basal level to 6-fold higher than the unstimulated level (Table I).

Glucose stimulates insulin release by aerobic glycolysis. It is known that the beta cell possesses pyruvate carboxylase and that one-half of glucose-derived pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle via carboxylation, which can augment cycle intermediates by anaplerosis (10MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data from experiments with isolated mitochondria from islets or INS-1 cells (TableII) agreed with the studies with intact islets. When pyruvate, the final product of glycolysis, was added to pancreatic islet mitochondria or INS-1 cell mitochondria (a situation analogous to adding glucose to intact beta cells), glutamate export was not augmented, but export of α-ketoglutarate was increased slightly (3-fold). Succinate increases the export of several metabolites, such as malate, 20- to 50-fold (data not shown), but adding succinate (a situation similar to adding the secretagogue methyl succinate to intact islets) did not increase the export of glutamate or α-ketoglutarate. When α-ketoglutarate was added alone, glutamate export was not increased. However, when glutamate was added, α-ketoglutarate export increased only slightly (2-fold) unless pyruvate was also added to transaminate with glutamate. Similarly, it was only when aspartate, which via transamination can contribute an amino group to α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate, was added along with α-ketoglutarate or with pyruvate that glutamate export increased significantly (Table II). When pyruvate and aspartate were added together, both glutamate and α-ketoglutarate export were increased. The increase in glutamate export could result from transamination of aspartate catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase, whereas the increase in α-ketoglutarate could be because pyruvate increased the level of α-ketoglutarate through anaplerosis (10MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Khan A. Ling Z.C. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2539-2542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, because there was only significant export of glutamate from islet mitochondria when aspartate was added with either α-ketoglutarate or pyruvate, and because pyruvate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate failed to promote significant export of glutamate, it seems unlikely that glutamate generated in beta cell mitochondria could be an intracellular messenger in glucose-induced insulin secretion. Glutamate can, however, become a metabolizable insulin secretagogue when its deamination is activated by leucine (4Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Malaisse-Lagae F. Welsh M. Matthews D.E. Bier D.M.

Open table in a new tab The idea that glutamate deamination catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase is a mechanism of insulin secretion in humans is suggested by the hypoglycemic disease hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia syndrome. This disease is caused by various gain of function mutations in the glutamate dehydrogenase gene in exons encoding the binding site for GTP (18Stanley C.A. Fang J. Kutyna K. Hsu B.Y.L. Ming J.E. Glaser B. Poncz M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme (19Frieden C. Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrbäck K. 2nd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1963: 3-24Google Scholar, 20Fahien L.A. Teller J.K. MacDonald M.J. Fahien C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). Because this results in the enzyme having a lower affinity for GTP, glutamate deamination catalyzed by the enzyme should be always activated. In the beta cell where the level of glutamate dehydrogenase is low, this would result in persistently enhanced insulin secretion and increased generation of ammonia by glutamate dehydrogenase. Excessive liver glutamate dehydrogenase activity may also explain the hyperammonemia (18Stanley C.A. Fang J. Kutyna K. Hsu B.Y.L. Ming J.E. Glaser B. Poncz M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). 3It is difficult to explain the hyperammonemia solely on the basis of an increase in liver glutamate dehydrogenase activity. This is because in liver mitochondria the level of glutamate dehydrogenase active sites is very high (25Fahien L.A. Teller J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10411-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such that the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction is at equilibrium (26Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Consequently, decreased binding of GTP should not alter the net rate of flux through glutamate dehydrogenase. This may indicate that there are other metabolic alterations secondary to the mutation in this enzyme that play a role in the hyperammonemia.It is interesting that not only is it unlikely that glutamate is involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion but also that the activation processes of glucose-induced insulin release and glutamate metabolism-induced insulin release appear to be reciprocal to one another. Pancreatic islets maintained in a normal or a high concentration of glucose exhibit an intact response to glucose but markedly decreased insulin release in response to leucine, whereas islets maintained in a low concentration of glucose show a normal or enhanced leucine response (13Gao Z. Li G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. McKenzie D.I. Moran S.M. Am. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low glucose effect may explain beta cell hypersensitivity to leucine frequently seen in hypoglycemic states (13Gao Z. Li G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the suppression by glucose of leucine-induced insulin release has been suggested to be due to inhibition of glutamate deamination from increased levels of GTP and altered levels of other effectors of glutamate dehydrogenase resulting from glucose metabolism (13Gao Z. Li G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently Maechler and Wollheim (1Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), on the basis of intricate and broad-based experiments, proposed that glutamate generated from citric acid cycle-derived α-ketoglutarate is a messenger in glucose-induced insulin secretion. The glutamate effect was not robust, and its demonstration seemed to require rather narrowly defined conditions. For example, dimethylglutamate, a glutamate precursor that is permeable to the plasma membrane, caused a leftward shift in the concentration dependence of glucose-stimulated insulin release in INS-1 insulinoma cells. Dimethylglutamate did not stimulate insulin release at a basal concentration of glucose (2.5 mm) or augment insulin release at concentrations of glucose (16.7 to 25 mm) optimal for insulin release. Insulin release by dimethylglutamate was potentiated only at intermediate glucose concentrations. It was reported that when rat insulinoma INS-1 cells were incubated in the presence of a concentration of glucose (12.8 mm) that stimulates insulin release, cellular glutamate levels increased 4.8-fold to a stimulated level of 0.22 mm within 3"
https://openalex.org/W2015543883,"Abstract To better understand the action of glucose on fatty acid metabolism in the β-cell and the link between chronically elevated glucose or fatty acids and β-cell decompensation in adipogenic diabetes, we investigated whether glucose regulates peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gene expression in the β-cell. Islets or INS(832/13) β-cells exposed to high glucose show a 60–80% reduction in PPARα mRNA expression. Oleate, either in the absence or presence of glucose, has no effect. The action of glucose is dose-dependent in the 6–20 mm range and maximal after 6 h. Glucose also causes quantitatively similar reductions in PPARα protein and DNA binding activity of this transcription factor. The effect of glucose is blocked by the glucokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose, is partially mimicked by 2-deoxyglucose, and is not blocked by the 3-O-methyl or the 6-deoxy analogues of the sugar that are not phosphorylated. Chronic elevated glucose reduces the expression levels of the PPAR target genes, uncoupling protein 2 and acyl-CoA oxidase, which are involved in fat oxidation and lipid detoxification. A 3-day exposure of INS-1 cells to elevated glucose results in a permanent rise in malonyl-CoA, the inhibition of fat oxidation, and the promotion of fatty acid esterification processes and causes elevated insulin secretion at low glucose. The results suggest that a reduction in PPARα gene expression together with a rise in malonyl-CoA plays a role in the coordinated adaptation of β-cell glucose and lipid metabolism to hyperglycemia and may be implicated in the mechanism of β-cell “glucolipotoxicity.”"

In this study, the relative ability of αA- and αB-crystallin, in protecting lens epithelial cells from apoptotic cell death was determined. The introduction of αA-crystallin in the transformed human lens epithelial (HLE) B-3 lens epithelial cell line (which expresses low endogenous levels of αB-crystallin) led to a nearly complete protection of cell death induced by staurosporine, Fas monoclonal antibody, or the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α. To further study the relative protective activities of αA- and αB-crystallins, we created a cell line derived from αA−/−αB−/− double knockout mouse lens epithelia by infecting primary cells with Ad12-SV40 hybrid virus. The transformed cell line αAαBKO1 derived from αA/αB double knockout cells was transfected with αA- or αB-crystallin cDNA contained in pCIneo mammalian expression vector. Cells expressing different amounts of either αA-crystallin or αB-crystallin were isolated. The ability of αA- or αB-crystallin to confer protection from apoptotic cell death was determined by annexin labeling and flow cytometry of staurosporine- or UVA- treated cells. The results indicate that the anti-apoptotic activity of αA-crystallin was two to three-fold higher than that of αB-crystallin. Our work suggests that comparing the in vitro annexin labeling of lens epithelial cells is an effective way to measure the protective activity of αA- and αB-crystallin.

The two ∼20-kDa subunits form soluble aggregates with an average molecular mass of 600–800 kDa and can be isolated from lens fiber cells as a heteroaggregate containing αA- and αB-polypeptides in a 3:1 ratio.

However, the in vivofunctions and mechanism of chaperone action of the α-crystallin aggregates are largely enigmatic.Lens growth begins with the division of lens epithelial cells in the germinative zone near the equator. As new cells elongate to form lens fibers, they wrap around the lens periphery and meet at the sutures. Transcripts for αA- and αB-crystallins can be detected in lens epithelial cells at early stages of mouse lens development (10Robinson M.L. Overbeek P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2276-2284PubMed Google Scholar), and a marked increase in αA-crystallin accompanies differentiation (11Vermorken A.J.M. Hildernik J.M. van de Ven W.J. Bloemendal H. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the specific cellular functions of the α-crystallins in the lens epithelium are largely unknown.Recent work on lens epithelial cells derived from αA- or αB-crystallin knockout mice suggest that they play an important role in regulating cellular growth (9Andley U.P.

P., Bassnett, S., and Fleming, T. P. (2000) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar), consistent with the roles of other small heat shock proteins in normal growth and development (13Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). Because lens epithelial cells grow throughout life, and the lens is exposed to light-induced stress due to its location along the optical axis of the eye, it is likely that mechanisms may be present to protect these cells from a lifetime of exposure to metabolic and environmental stress. αA- and αB-crystallin expression in lens epithelial cells could presumably be helpful in providing protection for these cells.Recent studies in our laboratory demonstrated that UVA radiation, which increases oxidative stress by production of reactive oxygen species and produces cataract in animals, induces lens epithelial cell death, and that the expression of αA-crystallin prevents cell death (9Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31252-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because αA-crystallin is largely restricted to the lens, it is important to investigate its role in protecting lens epithelial cells from diverse stress conditions. TNFα is a cytokine that kills cells via apoptosis or necrosis depending on cell type (14Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Its mechanism of action involves an increase in reactive oxygen species in cells upon stimulation of TNFα receptors (14Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expression of αB-crystallin and HSP27 prevents TNFα-induced cell death in murine L929 cells, as well as cell death induced by cross-linking of Fas (a member of the TNF and nerve growth family of receptors) and staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor (14Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Proteins of the HSP70 and HSP90 chaperone families also regulate apoptosis (17Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 18Galea-Lauri J. Richardson A.J. Latchman D.S. Katz D.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4109-4118PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which molecular chaperones prevent cell death presumably involves an inhibition of factors that can induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and by inhibition of the activation of caspases (19Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).The study of physiological roles of the molecular chaperones αA- and αB-crystallin can be assisted with the development of mammalian tissue culture systems in which the cloned crystallin genes can be expressed and the protective activities of the proteins under various stress conditions can be probed. In the present work, we describe cell lines derived from αA- and αB-crystallin knockout mouse lens epithelial cultures in which the two proteins can be re-introduced. These cell lines, as well as transformed human lens epithelial cell lines, allowed us to investigate the relative protective activity of αA- and αB-crystallin in preventing apoptosis of lens epithelial cells induced by staurosporine, TNFα, anti-Fas, and UVA radiation.DISCUSSIONαA- and αB-crystallins are synthesized as major components of all vertebrate lenses (5Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Area Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar). Although both subunits are highly expressed in lens fiber cells, they are also readily detected in lens epithelial cells (10Robinson M.L. Overbeek P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2276-2284PubMed Google Scholar). Because the epithelial cells represent the most metabolically active region of the lens, we focused on cultured lens epithelial cells derived from αA-, αB-, or αA-/αB-crystallin knockout mice. A recent study of lens epithelial cells derived from αB-crystallin knockout mice indicated that the loss of αB-crystallin predisposes lens epithelial cells to genomic instability (12Andley, U. P., Song, Z., Wawrousek, E. F., Brady, J. P., Bassnett, S., and Fleming, T. P. (2000) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar), which may explain its broad tissue distribution as well as its overexpression in growing tissues, in diseased states, and under stress conditions (3Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 158: 319-325Google Scholar, 4Dubin R.A. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 5Sax C.M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 803-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, lens epithelial cells from αA-crystallin knockout mice were reportedly delayed in growth and were more sensitive to UVA radiation (9Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31252-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The present results provide new insight into the distinctive cellular functions of αA- and αB-crystallins under physiologically relevant conditions.One of the main findings of this study is that αA-crystallin expression in lens epithelial cells imparts a greater resistance to various apoptotic inducers than the expression of αB-crystallin. At a given expression level, the anti-apoptotic activity of αA- was significantly higher than that of αB-crystallin. Moreover, αA-crystallin, which has been shown previously to confer resistance to thermal stress and UVA radiation (8Van den Ijssel P.L.R.A. Overkamp P. Knauf U. Gaestel M. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 335: 54-56Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31252-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), was also found to prevent apoptosis induced by TNFα, staurosporine, and anti-Fas. Lens epithelial cells are proximal to sources of stress and our results suggest that an important in vivo function of αA-crystallin may be to protect these cells from stress-induced apoptosis. Although the mechanism by which αA-crystallin exerts this protective effect is unknown, it may indirectly affect either the activation of anti-apoptotic factors, such as Bcl-2, or prevent the activation of pro-apoptotic factors, such as caspases (19Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Previous work on prevention of stress-induced apoptosis by sHSPs has been restricted to αB-crystallin and HSP25/27 (14Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 16Mehlen P. Schulze-Ostoff K. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Because αA-crystallin expression is largely restricted to the lens tissue, and because lens epithelial cells are continually exposed to sources of environmental stress, we sought to determine the relative protective activity of αA-crystallin and other sHSPs. When primary cultures of wild-type or αB-crystallin knockout mouse lens epithelial cells were irradiated with physiological levels of UVA radiation, no significant increase in apoptosis occurred during the 24-h post-irradiation period. After UVA exposure, the number of apoptotic cells was indistinguishable between wild-type and αB-crystallin knockout cells, suggesting that loss of αB-crystallin did not increase the incidence of apoptosis. In striking contrast, our previous study with UVA-treated αA-crystallin knockout lens epithelial cells had demonstrated that the loss of αA-crystallin resulted in a 40-fold increase in apoptosis (9Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31252-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We also exposed αA/αB double knockout lens epithelial cultures to UVA radiation. In these double knockout cells, a 40-fold increase in apoptotic cells was observed following UVA radiation. Taken together, the results obtained with primary cultures of αA knockout, αB knockout, and αA/αB double knockout lens epithelial cells indicate that, in the presence or absence of αA-crystallin, the loss of αB-crystallin does not increase apoptosis. This is consistent with the notion that the anti-apoptotic activity of αA-crystallin is higher than that of αB-crystallin. This observation also suggests that HSP25/27 present in lens epithelial cells contributes to maintaining their protection at a certain level.αA- and αB-crystallin have pleomorphic cellular functions, including the ability to bind cytoskeletal elements (29Muchowski P.J. Valdez M.M. Clark J.I. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 951-956PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), bind membranes (24Cobb B.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6664-6672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and translocate to the nucleus (31Bhat S.P. Hale I.L. Matsumoto B. Elghanayan D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although the proteins that interact with αA- and αB-crystallin in the lens epithelium in vivo are unknown. One of the unresolved question in lens research is why are both αA- and αB-crystallin needed in the lens (2Horwitz J. Bova M.P. Ding L.-L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Eye. 1999; 13: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)? Recently, it has been shown that a targeted disruption of a mouse αA-crystallin gene induces cataract (20Brady J.P. Garland D. Douglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dense inclusion bodies consisting mainly of αB-crystallin were found in the lens fiber cells of these mice suggesting that αB-crystallin is unstable at high concentrations in the lens in the absence of its aggregation partner, αA-crystallin. Other experiments suggest that mixing of αA- and αB-crystallin increases the stability of the system (2Horwitz J. Bova M.P. Ding L.-L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Eye. 1999; 13: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although αB-crystallin is widely distributed in tissues such as muscle, heart, brain, lung, and kidney, αA-crystallin is largely restricted to the lens, with low levels detected in the thymus and spleen (3Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 158: 319-325Google Scholar, 4Dubin R.A. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 5Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Area Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar). This distinct tissue distribution and the stress inducibility of only αB- and not αA-crystallin supports the notion that the two proteins may have unique cellular functions in the lens.Recent in vitro studies demonstrate that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallins is sensitive to substrate, buffer conditions, and temperature (32Datta S.A. Rao Ch. M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34773-34778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1434: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the activity of αB-crystallin is relatively insensitive to temperature, a marked temperature dependence of chaperone activity of αA-crystallin has been reported (32Datta S.A. Rao Ch. M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34773-34778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1434: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using several protein substrates, αA- and αB-crystallin were found to have similar chaperone activities at physiological temperatures (∼37 °C) when inhibition of lactalbumin aggregation was measured, whereas the chaperone-like activity of αB-crystallin was greater than that of αA-crystallin when the substrate was alcohol dehydrogenase or insulin (33Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Another factor that may contribute to their different activities is the surface hydrophobicity of the αA- and αB-crystallins (32Datta S.A. Rao Ch. M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34773-34778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1434: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, neither the differences in vitro chaperone activity toward selected substrate proteins, nor the different surface hydrophobicity of αA- and αB-crystallin are sufficient to explain the greater anti-apoptotic activity of αA- over that of αB-crystallin found in the present study (32Datta S.A. Rao Ch. M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34773-34778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1434: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings provide a basis for future studies on identification of in vivo substrates of αA- and αB-crystallin and other factors that determine their in vivo protective activity.The assessment of relative anti-apoptotic activities of αA- and αB-crystallins in mouse lens epithelial cells using annexin labeling was further supported by our findings in human lens epithelial cells. The extended-life span HLE B-3 cells used for transfection studies did not express endogenous αA-crystallin after 11 passages but continued to express low endogenous levels of αB-crystallin (25Fleming T.P. Song Z. Andley U.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1387-1398PubMed Google Scholar) and were able to accumulate αB-crystallin and HSP27 in response to thermal stress (Fig. 3). The αA-crystallin-expressing stably transfected human lens epithelial cell lines used in this study were significantly more resistant to staurosporine, TNFα, and an antibody to Fas, than were the mock transfected cells, consistent with a previous report of the enhanced resistance of αA-crystallin expressing lens epithelial cells to UVA radiation (9Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31252-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protective effect of αA-crystallin increased with its level of expression. A factor that may influence the protective activity of αA-crystallin in the presence of αB-crystallin in HLE B-3 cells is the stoichiometry of the αA/αB aggregate (2Horwitz J. Bova M.P. Ding L.-L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Eye. 1999; 13: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the in vitro stability and the chaperone-like activity of the 3:1 αA/αB heteroaggregate is substantially greater than that of aggregates containing higher or lower ratios of the two subunits or of homopolymers containing either αA- or αB-crystallin (2Horwitz J. Bova M.P. Ding L.-L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Eye. 1999; 13: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 37Sun T.-X. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Quantitative immunoblot analysis of HLE B-3 cells (data not shown) indicated that the stoichiometric composition of the αA/αB-crystallin expression in the stably transfected HLE B-3 cells containing >1 ng of αA-crystallin/μg of cellular protein is approximately 3:1. Such heteroaggregates were presumably present in αA-crystallin-expressing stably transfected HLE B-3 cells, which express endogenous αB-crystallin. The present results indicate that the expression of αA-crystallin, on a background of low αB-crystallin, is helpful in enhancing resistance of lens epithelial cells to apoptosis induced by a variety of agents and supports the idea that αA-crystallin is an important anti-apoptotic protein in lens epithelial cells.In summary, the present studies indicate that αA-crystallin has a higher capacity than αB-crystallin to prevent lens epithelial cell death. This may indicate that the threshold concentration of αA-crystallin necessary for protection against stress-induced apoptosis in the lens epithelium is less than that of αB-crystallin. Because their expression in the lens epithelium is at much lower levels than in the fiber cells, it remains to be determined whether the 2- to 3-fold difference in protective activity is of significance for their function in the in vivo lens epithelium. The current work suggests that comparing the annexin labeling of lens epithelial cells is an effective way to measure the protective activity of αA- and αB-crystallin under physiologically relevant conditions. Taken together with our previous study (12Andley, U. P., Song, Z., Wawrousek, E. F., Brady, J. P., Bassnett, S., and Fleming, T. P. (2000) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar), which demonstrated that the lack of αB-crystallin predisposes cultured lens epithelial cells to genomic instability, these studies provide a basis for further investigating the distinct physiological functions of αA- and αB-crystallins in lens epithelial function. α-Crystallin, a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP)1 family of molecular chaperones, is an aggregate of two polypeptides, αA- and αB-crystallins, that share 55% amino acid sequence identity. The two ∼20-kDa subunits form soluble aggregates with an average molecular mass of 600–800 kDa and can be isolated from lens fiber cells as a heteroaggregate containing αA- and αB-polypeptides in a 3:1 ratio. The α-crystallins have dynamic polymeric structures with a hollow interior and undergo inter-aggregate subunit exchange (1Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 2Horwitz J. Bova M.P. Ding L.-L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Eye. 1999; 13: 403-407Crossref Pub"

Growth of NEO cells (control MCF-7 cells) was stimulated by both IGF-1 and estradiol (E2), and the addition of both mitogens resulted in a synergistic response. Estrogen enhanced IGF-1R signaling in NEO cells, but this effect was markedly diminished in SX13 cells. Estrogen was also able to potentiate the IGF-1 effect on the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E and on the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein in control but not in SX13 cells. IGF-1 increased the protein level of p21 and the luciferase activity of the p21 promoter, whereas it only reduced the protein level of p27 without affecting p27 promoter activity. Estrogen did not affect the p21 inhibitor, but it decreased the protein level of p27 and the p27 promoter luciferase activity. These effects of both mitogens were also observed at the level of association of both cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors with CDK2 suggesting that IGF-1 and E2 affect the activity of both p21 and p27. Taken together, these data suggest that in MCF-7 cells, estrogen potentiates the IGF-1 effect on IGF-1R signaling as well as on the cell cycle components. Moreover, IGF-1 and E2 regulate the expression of p21 and p27 and their association with CDK2 differently.

It has been shown that an inhibition of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling with anti-IGF-1R antibodies or antisense RNA to the IGF-1R restricts breast cancer cell growth both in vitro andin vivo (1Lee A.V. Yee D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1995; 49: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The IGF-1R is expressed in a high percentage of primary human breast tumors, and this expression is positively correlated with the level of estrogen receptor (ER) (2Peyrat J.P. Bonneterre J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1992; 22: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In several tissues and cell lines, including normal breast (3Ruan W. Catanese V. Wieczorek R. Feldman M. Kleinderg D.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), endometrial cancer cells (4Kleinman D. Karas M. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Phillip M. Segev Y. Levy J. Sharoni Y. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2531-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells (MCF-7, ZR-75, and T47D) (5Stewart A.J. Johnson M.D. May F.E. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), estrogen sensitizes the cells to the mitogenic effect of IGF-1. Consequently, the combined effects of estradiol (E2) and IGF-1 might stimulate the proliferation in mammary epithelium, thereby increasing the risk of breast cancer. The mechanisms involved in this sensitization at the level of IGF-1R signaling and cell cycle components have not yet been established. The components of IGF-1R signaling pathways that transduce the mitogenic stimulus to the cell cycle machinery have been partially identified. IGF-1 initiates its growth-promoting effects through its cognate transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. Upon activation by ligand binding, the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase phosphorylates several intracellular substrates such as the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (IRS-1 through -4) and Shc (7White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In breast cancer cell lines that express the ER (MCF-7, ZR-75 or T47-D), the mitogenic effects of IGF-1 are primarily mediated by IRS-1 (8Jackson J.G. White M.F. Yee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Surmacz E. Burgaud J.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1429-1436PubMed Google Scholar). Activated IRS-1 serves as a multisite docking protein for numerous Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins. These proteins include the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) and the adapter protein, Grb2. Some of the downstream effectors of PI3K are the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB and p70/S6 kinase (10Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). The binding of IRS and Shc proteins to Grb2 and the associated guanine nucleotide exchange protein, mSos, results in activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway. The specific pathway involved in cell proliferation (i.e. PI3K versus MAP kinase) depends on the particular cell type (11Petley T. Graff K. Jiang W. Yang H. Florini J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In myoblasts, adipocytes, and 3T3 fibroblasts, IGF-1-induced cellular proliferation is clearly mediated by the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway (12Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 13Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem.

In contrast, in MCF-7 cells, the proliferative response to IGF-1 is mediated by PI3K (15Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). More specifically, it has been shown that in MCF-7 cells the PI3K pathway is involved in cyclin D1 synthesis and the hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (15Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that Akt affects cyclin D translation in response to serum in MCF-7 cells (16Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29864-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which E2 induces cellular proliferation have not been well established. E2 acts through nuclear hormone receptors (ERα and -β), which, upon activation, may induce the transcription of various genes, including growth factors, their receptors, and substrates (17Molloy C.A. May F.E. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12565-12571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that these growth factors may, in turn, decrease ERα gene expression while increasing the activity of the receptor in MCF-7 cells (18Stoica A. Saceda M. Fakhro A. Joyner M. Martin M.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The effect of E2 on cellular proliferation may be mediated by the up-regulation of IGF-1R expression (5Stewart A.J. Johnson M.D. May F.E. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IRS-1, and IRS-2 (19Lee A.V. Jackson J.G. Gooch J.L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Coronado-Heinsohn F Osborne C.K. Yee D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) or by down-regulating the expression of the inhibitory IGF-binding proteins (20Huynh H. Yang X. Pollak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1016-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). E2 also has direct effects on specific components of the cell cycle. For instance, some studies have shown that E2 stimulates cellular proliferation through early activation of CDK2 and CDK4, phosphorylation of Rb, and increased expression of certain cyclins (21Foster J.S. Wimalasena J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 22Planas-Silva M.D. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the potentiation of IGF-1s by E2 on cell proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We exposed MCF-7 cells to IGF-1 and E2 either separately or in combination, and then we analyzed various components of IGF-1R signaling (IGF-1R, IRS-1, PI3K, Akt, and Erk1/2) and certain cell cycle molecules (cyclin D1, Rb, cyclin E, and two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), p21 and p27). In order to determine the role of the IGF-1R in estrogen signaling, we used MCF-7-derived cells that express a reduced level (50%) of IGF-1R (24Neuenschwander S. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4298-4303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results show a potentiation of action of IGF-1 by E2 not only on the immediate downstream targets of IGF-1R signaling but also on certain cell cycle components. Moreover, this potentiation is dependent on the level of IGF-1R expression. Our results also indicate that IGF-1 and E2 have differential actions on the CDKIs, p21 and p27. The radionuclide [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant human IGF-1 was obtained from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). 17β-Estradiol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), leupeptin, aprotinin, protein A-agarose, and phosphatidylinositol were obtained from Sigma. ICI 182,780 was kindly supplied by Dr. Alan Wakeling at Zeneca Pharmaceuticals (Macclefields, UK). Silica TLC plates were obtained from Whatman. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to cyclin D1 (HD11), cyclin E (C19), CDK2 (M2), p27KIP-1 (C19), Erk1 (C16), and the IGF-1 receptor β subunit (C20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody to IRS-1 and mouse monoclonal antibodies to p21WAF1/CIP1 and p85 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The mouse polyclonal anti- phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal anti-actin (clone AC) was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phospho-Akt (Ser473), Akt, phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), and phospho-Rb (Ser780) were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All these antibodies were used with a 1/1000 dilution in Western blotting. Full-length promoter constructs for p21 and p27 were kindly donated by Dr. F. Kashanchi (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) and Dr. T. Sakai (Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan), respectively. MCF-7 cells from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were cultured in IMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). MCF-7 cells stably transfected with an antisense IGF-1R cDNA (SX13) (29Johnson M.R. Valentine C. Basilico C. Mansukhani A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2647-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and corresponding control cell lines transfected with the empty vector (NEO) were maintained in the same medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). For growth studies, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (8–10,000 cells per well) in IMEM phenol red-free medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. One day later, the medium was switched to that containing the serum-free medium plus the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780, (10 nm) for 48 h to synchronize cells in the G0 phase. The medium was then changed to that containing phenol red-free medium without serum and the various stimuli as described in the figure legends. As an indirect measure of growth, the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol 2-yl] 2,5-diphenyltetraolium bromide (MTT) assay was used as described previously (26Kleinman D. Karas M. Danilenko M. Arbell A. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Levy J. Sharoni Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Determination of the surface IGF-1Rs on NEO and SX13 cells was obtained by flow cytometry. Cells were trypsinized and washed once in PBS and once in FACS buffer (0.1% sodium azide, 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Next, cells (106 cells/sample) were incubated 30 min on ice with 5 μg/ml IGF-1R-PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) diluted in FACS buffer. Background staining was evaluated using a mouse IgG1 isotype control (5 μg/ml) (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Cells were washed three times and resuspended in 0.5 ml with FACS buffer. Finally, cells were examined for fluorescence intensity on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (both from Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing various protease inhibitors (2 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C, and then the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using the BCA protein assay. After normalization for protein concentration (250 μg) various proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatants using 5 μg of appropriate antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with 40 μl of protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After two sequential washes using buffer A with a 1/2 dilution, the resulting pellets were boiled for 4 min in reducing Laemmli buffer containing 80 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked and probed with the various antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. After extensive washings, immunoreactivity was detected with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometry was performed by scanning the radiographs and then analyzing the bands with the software MacBas version 2.52 (Fuji PhotoFilm). In some experiments, Western blotting was performed on whole cell lysates, using 50 μg of protein. PI3′-kinase activity was determined as described previously (27Dupont J. Derouet M. Simon J. Taouis M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared on ice in extraction buffer B composed of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 35 min at 40,000 × g at 4 °C. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the resulting supernatants (each containing 250 μg of total protein) by incubating them overnight at 4 °C with the αIRS-1 antibody (1/1000). Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A-agarose beads and washed successively as follows: once in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μmNa3VO4, twice in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm LiCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, and finally, once in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmNa3VO4. The pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. To each tube was added 10 μl of MnCl2 (100 mm) and 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of ATP (440 μm) containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of HCl (8n) and 160 μl of CHCl3:CH3OH (1/1). After centrifugation (3,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C), the organic phase was extracted and applied to a silica gel thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (120/94/22.6/4) and dried, and the radioactivity was quantitated with a PhosphorImager apparatus (FujiFilm, Stamford, CT). Three days prior to experiments, MCF-7-derived cells were stripped of endogenous steroids by passage in IMEM without phenol red containing 3% fetal bovine serum (charcoal-stripped). Cells were transiently transfected using the Effectene reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were plated in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection; each well received 1 μg of p21 or p27 promoter-luciferase construct and 0.5 μg of the pTKRenilla vector to normalize for transfection efficiency. All transfections included a reference sample with p0luc (for p21) or pGL2 basic (for p27). 16 h after transfection, cells were switched to serum-free medium for 24 h, followed by the addition of various stimuli for 24 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-luciferase System (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All reported values are the means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made by a two-sided Student'st test. Statistical significant was assumed if a null hypothesis could be rejected at the p < 0.05. To characterize potential cross-talk and synergism between the IGF-1R and ER signaling on cellular proliferation, we used MCF-7 cells expressing an IGF-1R antisense cDNA (SX13) and control cells (NEO). SX13 cells have a significantly reduced level of IGF-1R (50% reduction on Western blot analysis, Fig. 1 A and Ref.24Neuenschwander S. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4298-4303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the surface receptors were undetectable by flow cytometry suggesting that most of IGF-1Rs in SX13 cells are internalized (Fig.1 B, left panel, curve 1 versus curve 2). NEO and SX13 cells were partially synchronized in G0 phase by serum deprivation and using the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (10 nm) for 48 h. Under these conditions, more than 75% of cells were synchronized in G0 phase (data not shown). Next, cells were incubated with E2 (10 nm), IGF-I (1 nm), or a combination of both stimuli for 3 days. MTT assays were performed on each day as an indirect measure of cell proliferation. In NEO cells, IGF-1 treatment resulted in a 1.7- (p < 0.05) and 1.8 (p < 0.05)-fold increase in cell number after 48 and 72 h, respectively, as compared with cells incubated with Serum-free Medium (SFM, Fig.2). Treatment with E2 (10 nm) resulted in a 1.3- (p < 0.05) and 1.9 (p < 0.05)-fold increase in cell number after 48 and 72 h, respectively. No significant effect was observed after 24 h of stimulation with E2 (data not shown). Coexposure to both mitogens resulted in a 3.8- (p < 0.05) and 4.7 (p < 0.05)-fold increase in cell number after 48 and 72 h stimulation, respectively. These results indicate that IGF-1 and E2 exert a greater effect when cells are simultaneously exposed to these growth factors than when exposed to E2 or IGF-1 individually. Thus, E2 sensitizes the MCF-7 cell line to the mitogenic effect of IGF-1, at least after 48 h. At 72 h, the effect of both IGF-I and E2 may have been maximal, and thus no further synergism was observed. In SX13 cells, the effect of IGF-1 on cellular proliferation was abrogated; only E2 treatment resulted in a significant increase in cell number after 72 h (2.1 (p < 0.05)-fold compared with cells incubated in SFM). These results were confirmed in a second clone expressing a decreased IGF-1R level.Figure 2Abrogation of the synergistic effect of E2 and IGF-1 on cell growth in SX13 cells. MCF-7 cells were maintained in SFM in the absence or presence of IGF-1 (1 nm), E2 (10 nm), or a combination of these both mitogens for 3 days, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell number was determined indirectly each day using the colorimetric MTT method. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of percentage of cell number increase as compared with cells maintained in SFM. The results are obtained from three independent experiments with 5 measurements per experiment for each condition. *, p < 0.05 indicates a significant synergistic effect between IGF-1 and E2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next identified the specific signaling components of the IGF-1R cascade that are sensitized by E2 treatment. SX13 and NEO cells were again treated with either IGF-1 (5 min) or E2 (48 h) separately or sequentially (E2 for 48 h followed by IGF-1 for 5 min). The tyrosine phosphorylation state of the IGF-1R β subunit and IRS-1, PI3K activity, and the association of p85 with IRS-1, Akt, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation were then determined. Treatment with IGF-1 for 5 min resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor β subunit and IRS-1 in NEO cells, whereas the effect of IGF-1 on phosphorylation of these proteins in SX13 cells was markedly reduced (Fig. 3, panels 1 and3). In NEO cells, treatment with IGF-1 induced the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, and this induction was reduced by 50% in SX13 cells (Fig. 3, panel 5). The phosphorylation state of IGF-1R, IRS-1, and Erk1/2 was not regulated by E2 treatment alone in either SX13 or NEO cells. However, in both cell lines, after exposure to E2, IGF-1 stimulation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and IRS-1 compared with cells stimulated with IGF-1 alone (Fig. 3, panels 1 and 3). In NEO cells, treatment with E2 also increased the IGF-1-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation, whereas in SX13 cells no potentiation of E2 was observed. In NEO cells, the increased phosphorylation of IRS-1 was paralleled with an increase in the total amount of IRS-1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3, panel 4). This effect was markedly attenuated in SX13 cells. In contrast, treatment with E2 did not increase the total level of IGF-1R or the protein expression of Erk1/2 in either cell line (Fig. 3,panels 2 and 6). In NEO cells, we also show by flow cytometry analysis that the level of surface IGF-1Rs is unchanged by the treatment with E2 (Fig. 1, right panel, curve 2 versus curve 3). However, by using the same technique, in SX13 cells, 38% of cells are IGF-1R positives after E2 treatment. Thus, E2 induced a redistribution of IGF-1Rs to the cellular surface (Fig. 1, left panel, curve 2 versus curve 3). These results indicate that in SX13 cells, most of the IGF-1Rs are internalized, and treatment with E2 facilitates the translocation of IGF-1Rs to the plasma membrane at the cellular surface. Thus, we show that the potentiation of the effects of IGF-I by E2 can be explained, at least in part, by the increased phosphorylation of the IGF-IR, the increased IRS-1 expression, and the increased phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Erk1/2 in NEO cells. In SX13 cells, this potentiation of E2 on IGF-1 action, while seen with IGF-1R and IRS-1 phosphorylation, is not apparent with Erk1/2 phosphorylation or with cellular proliferation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85) is a signaling molecule that binds directly to IRS-1 and is important for the proliferative effects of IGF-1 on MCF-7 cells (8Jackson J.G. White M.F. Yee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effects of E2 and IGF-I on the activation of PI3K and Akt, one of its downstream targets. Treating MCF-7 cells with IGF-1 for 5 min resulted in an increase in the association of p85 with IRS-1 in NEO cells (data not shown). This also increased PI3K enzyme activity associated with IRS-1 (Fig. 4 B). This effect was not observed in SX13 cells. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473was also induced by IGF-1 in NEO cells but not in SX13 cells (Fig.4 C, upper panel). The PI3K activity and Akt phosphorylation were unaffected by the presence of E2 in either cell line (Fig. 4,B and C). This is similar to the results observed on tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and IRS-1. In NEO cells, estrogen enhancement of the IGF-1R and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (shown in Fig. 3, panels 1 and 3) was also associated with a significant increase in IGF-1-induced PI3K activity and an increase in the phosphorylation state of Akt (Fig. 4,B and C). Densitometric analysis revealed that IGF-1 induction of PI3K activity and phospho-Akt in the presence of E2 were 1.5-fold higher than that induced by IGF-1 alone. Interestingly, in SX13 cells, PI3K activity or phosphorylation of Akt induced by IGF-1 or E2 separately was undetectable, whereas these were both increased when E2 and IGF-I were given simultaneously (Fig. 4, B andC). This effect was associated with an increase in cell surface expression of IGF-1Rs following E2 treatment of SX13 (Fig.1 B, left panel). In NEO and SX13 cells, E2 treatment increased by 35% (p < 0.05) the total level of p85 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 A) but did not alter the total level of Akt immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 C, lower panel). Thus, the synergistic effects of E2 and IGF-I are reflected at the level of downstream targets of the IGF-IR. We also investigated the mechanisms involved in the synergism of the mitogenic effects of IGF-1 and E2 at the level of various cell cycle components. The elements of the cell cycle we examined included cyclin D1, cyclin E, and phospho-Rb immunoreactivity levels in NEO and SX13 cells. In a time course experiment, when MCF-7 cells were treated separately with IGF-1 and E2, maximal cyclin D1 and cyclin E protein levels were induced after 3 and 24 h of stimulation, respectively (data not shown). Next, we tested the effect of simultaneous treatment with E2 and IGF-1 on these important cell cycle components. In NEO cells, treatment with IGF-1 and E2 separately for 3 h resulted in a 2.8- (p < 0.05) and 2.5 (p < 0.05)-fold increase in cyclin D1 immunoreactivity, respectively, as compared with cells maintained in SFM (Fig.5 A). Coexposure to both mitogens resulted in a 5.5-fold increase (p < 0.05) in cyclin D1 protein expression (Fig. 5 A). In SX13 cells, treatment with IGF-1 and E2 increased cyclin D1 protein expression by 1.3- and 2-fold (p < 0.05), respectively. Moreover, E2 did not enhance the effects of IGF-1 in these cells (Fig.5 A). In NEO cells, after 24 h of exposure to IGF-1 and E2 separately, cyclin E protein expression was increased by 1.5- (p < 0.05) and 1.8 (p < 0.05)-fold, respectively, as compared with cells maintained in SFM (Fig.5 B). Simultaneously exposing cells to both stimuli resulted in a 2.7-fold increase (p < 0.05) in cyclin E protein expression. In SX13 cells, the effect of IGF-1 alone on cyclin E levels was undetectable, whereas E2 alone or combined with IGF-1 increased cyclin E protein expression by 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5 B). Finally, we determined the effects of IGF-1 and E2, alone or in combination, on the phosphorylation state of Rb using a phospho-specific Rb antibody. In NEO cells, IGF-1 or E2 treatment increased the phospho-Rb immunoreactivity by 3-fold (p< 0.05) as compared with cells grown in SFM (Fig. 5 C). Coincubating NEO cells with IGF-1 and E2 induced a 4.5-fold increase (p < 0.05) in phospho-Rb immunoreactivity.

Recently, we found that Notch1 and its ligand are each expressed in juxtaposed cell compartments in the follicles of the bursa of Fabricius, the central organ for chicken B cell development. To examine the function of Notch1 in B cells, a constitutively active form of chicken Notch1 was expressed in a chicken B cell line, DT40, by a Cre/loxP-mediated inducible expression system. Remarkably, the active Notch1 caused growth suppression of the cells, accompanied by a cell cycle inhibition at the G1 phase and apoptosis. The expression of Hairy1, a gene product up-regulated by the Notch1 signaling, also induced the apoptosis, but no cell cycle inhibition. Thus, Notch1 signaling induces apoptosis of the B cells through Hairy1, and the G1 cell cycle arrest through other pathways. This novel function of Notch1 may account for the recent observations indicating the selective inhibition of early B cell development in mice by Notch1.

Matsuno K Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Upon binding to its ligand, Notch protein is proteolytically processed within the transmembrane domain, and its intracellular domain (Notch-IC)1 is released (2Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W.

In the lymphoid system, Notch1 is strongly expressed in CD4− CD8− immature thymocytes and its ligands (Jagged1/2) are expressed in thymic stromal cells (28Hasserjian R.P. Aster J.C. Davi F.

By transgenic approach, it has been found that Notch signaling influences the commitment of CD4/CD8 and αβ/γδ T cell lineages in the thymus (27Li L. Milner L.A. Deng Y. Iwata M. Banta A. Graf L.

Recently, it has been reported that the induced deletion of Notch1 gene in adult mice resulted in the impairment of early T cell development and ectopic development of B cells in the thymus (32Radtke F. Wilson A. Stark G. Bauer M. van Meerwijk J. MacDonald H.R. Aguet M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Conversely, retroviral expression of constitutively active Notch1 in bone marrow progenitors resulted in a block of early B cell development and the ectopic development of immature T cells in the bone marrow (33Pui J.C. Allman D. Xu L. DeRocco S. Karnell F.G. Bakkour S. Lee J.Y. Kadesch T. Hardy R.R. Aster J.C. Pear W.S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Thus, Notch1 signaling appears to promote T cell development as well as to inhibit B cell development of common lymphoid progenitors primarily destined to develop into B cells. In mice and humans, B cells are continuously generated in the bone marrow throughout life. In chickens, however, the B cell generation is restricted to a relatively short period of life in a lymphoid organ called the bursa of Fabricius (reviewed in Ref. 34Masteller E.L. Pharr G.T. Funk P.E. Thompson C.B. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 185-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The bursa is composed of about 104 follicles, each of which is colonized by a few B cell precursors expressing surface immunoglobulin (Ig) M at 8–14 embryonic day (35Houssaint E. Torano A. Ivanyi J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1983; 7: 590-595Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Pink J.R. Ratcliffe M.J. Vainio O. Eur. J.

A. 1986; 83: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The precursors proliferate enormously, and their numbers finally reach to 2–5 × 105/follicle. During this process, extensive diversification of Ig is accomplished by Ig gene conversion (39Reynaud C.A. Anquez V. Grimal H. Weill J.C. Cell. 1987; 48: 379-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 40Reynaud C.A. Dahan A. Anquez V. Weill J.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and most of the developing B cells die by apoptosis prior to emigration into the periphery (34Masteller E.L. Pharr G.T. Funk P.E. Thompson C.B. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 185-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Lassila O. Eur. J.

The bursa disappears within several months after hatching, and the peripheral B cell pool is maintained by self-replenishing after the involution of the bursa. To understand how B cell development and homeostasis are regulated in the chicken B cell system, we identify molecules specifically expressed in the bursa and study their functions. Recently, we have found that Notch1 is expressed in the most outer layer of each follicle in the bursa. The Notch1-expressing cells were surrounded by the cells expressing the Notch1 ligand, Serrate2, suggesting a possible role for the Notch signaling in B cell development in the bursa. 2R. Goitsuka, T. Morimura, S. Miyatani, and D. Kitamura, manuscript in preparation. To understand the meaning of their specific expression pattern and a possible interaction of Notch1 and Serrate2 in the bursa, we analyzed a function of Notch1 in a bursa-derived B cell line, DT40, by expressing a constitutively active form of Notch1 through a new inducible expression system. With this approach, we have revealed a direct effect of Notch1 signaling in cells, namely the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1phase accompanied by apoptosis of the B cell line. In addition, we demonstrated that Hairy1, a downstream target of Notch signaling, also induces apoptosis, but not the G1 cell cycle arrest, of the same cells. ChickenNotch1ICS gene (corresponding to amino acids 1748–2142 of rat Notch1) was amplified by PCR with primers, 5′-CTCAAGCTTGGCGCAAGCGGCGCAGGGAGCATGGCCAGC-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTAGACGGCCGGCTTCAGGTTGCCGATGTAACTG-3′, using a partial chicken Notch1 cDNA2 as a template (Fig.1 A). The PCR product (1.2 kb) was digested withHindIII and EcoRI, cloned into pBlueScript SK+, and verified for its nucleotide sequence. TheHindIII-EcoRI fragment of theNotch1ICS gene was inserted into a multiple cloning site of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence to make pEGFP-Notch1ICS or of pAT7neo, which contains the chicken β-actin promoter and double T7 tag in place of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer and GFP sequences of pEGFP-C1, to make pAT7-Notch1ICS. A cDNA encoding a C-terminal portion of Notch1 was amplified by PCR with primers based on the reported sequence (43Wakamatsu Y. Maynard T.M. Jones S.U. Weston J.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), 5′-GCCCTCTCGGGGCCCCCACGCTGTCCCCCCCGC-3′and 5′-CCCGAATTCACTTGAAGGCCTCGGGGATGTGTCCCAT-3′, using an oligo(dT)-primed single-strand cDNA library of the bursa. The PCR product (1.3 kbp) was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and verified for its sequence, from which anApaI-EcoRI fragment was excised and inserted into pEGFP-Notch1ICS to make pEGFP-full-length intracellular region of Notch1 (Notch1ICF). To make pCALNL5-GFP-Notch1ICS, a 2-kbEco47III-EcoRI fragment from the pEGFP-Notch1ICS was inserted into SwaI-EcoRI sites of pCALNL5, in which a multiple cloning site includingSwaI-EcoRI-SacI-KpnI-SmaI sites had been created at a SwaI site of pCALNLw (44Kanegae Y. Takamori K. Sato Y. Lee G. Nakai M. Saito I. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 181: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, an Eco47III-EcoRI fragment (3.3 kbp) from pEGFP-Notch1ICF was inserted into pCALNL5 to make pCALNL5-GFP-Notch1ICF. Chicken Hairy1 cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers based on the reported sequence (45Palmeirim I. Henrique D. Ish-Horowicz D. Pourquie O.

The PCR product (0.8 kbp) was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega) and verified for its sequence, from which anEcoRI-BamHI fragment was excised and inserted into pEGFP-C1 to make pEGFP- Hairy1. A SacI-BamHI fragment from the pEGFP-Hairy1 was inserted into pBluescript SK+ (pBS- Hairy1). Then, a SacI-KpnI fragment from the pBS-Hairy1 including Hairy1 cDNA was inserted in pCALNL5-GFP-Notch1ICS in place of Notch1ICS to make a pCALNL5-GFP- Hairy1. pCAG-Puro-MerCreMer, in which a 3.0-kbHindIII fragment from pAN-MerCreMer (46Zhang Y.

The chicken Hairy1 genomic DNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ nucleotide data base (accession no. AB045236). The same 0.7-kb fragment but with a deletion of the CSL-binding motif (110 base pairs) was also inserted into the pBasic2 to make pBasic2-Hairy1mt as a negative control. For the analysis of subcellular localization of Notch1-IC, 3 μg of either pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-Notch1ICS was transfected into NIH3T3 cells (1 × 105) usingtrans IT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI). On the next day, the localization of their gene products was visually inspected by fluorescence microscopy. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Irvine, United Kingdom) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, Life Technologies, Inc.). The bursa-derived B lymphoblastoid cell line, DT40, and its subline CL18 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.) as above, at 40 °C. For transfection, cells were washed with the culture medium, and adjusted to 2 × 107/ml. Cells (1 × 107) were transferred to a cuvette and pulsed at 975 microfarads and 250 V in the presence of 30 μg of pAT7neo, pAT7-Notch1ICS, or pCAG-Puro-MerCreMer. The transfected cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) or 1 μ g/ml puromycin (Sigma). Drug-resistant clones were subjected to Western blotting using anti-T7 mouse monoclonal antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) or anti-Cre rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novagen). MerCreMer-expressing DT40 cells were further transfected with pCALNL5-GFP, pCALNL5-GFP-Notch1ICS, pCALNL5-GFP-Hairy1, or pCALNL5-GFP-Notch1ICF and selected with 1 mg/ml G418 as above. Drug-resistant clones were treated for 12 h with 10 nm of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OH-TAM; Sigma), an estradiol analog, and the expression of GFP or GFP fusion proteins was addressed by flow cytometry using FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) as well as by Western blotting with anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH). The resultant clones with negligible background and the highest induction of the expression of GFP or GFP fusion proteins were used for the study. pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-Notch1ICS, pAT7neo, or pAT7-Notch1ICS (15 μg per each) were transfected into DT40 cells (5 × 106) with either pBasic2-Hairy1wt or pBasic2-Hairy1mt (5 μg per each) and pactβgal (a gift of T. Yagi, 0.5 μg), and, 48 h later, the cells were harvested and measured for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using Luciferase assay system (Promega) and Galacto-Light (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA), respectively, as described previously (49Katsuta H. Tsuji S. Niho Y. Kurosaki T. Kitamura D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1547-1551PubMed Google Scholar). The stable transfectants of DT40 cells (5 × 105/ml) were seeded into a six-well plate (4 ml/well) and treated for 12 h with 10 nm OH-TAM to induce the expression of GFP or GFP fusion proteins. Then, the number of live cells were counted using trypan blue and adjusted to 5 × 105/ml every 24 h. At the same time, the cells were also stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) and their DNA contents were analyzed by FACSort as described previously (50Fukuda T. Kitamura D. Taniuchi I. Maekawa Y. Benhamou L.E. Sarthou P. Watanabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7302-7306Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transcripts ofHairy1 and MerCreMer genes were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using the following cDNA probes: aHindIII-BamHI fragment (0.8 kbp) from pBS-Hairy1, and aBamHI-ClaI fragment (0.45 kbp) from pCAG-Puro-MerCreMer. These fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP by Prime IT II (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instruction. Total cellular RNAs (5 μg each) extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 1% formamide in MOPS buffer, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne; Pall, East Hills, NY). Hybridization was performed as described previously (51Morimura T. Hattori M. Ohashi K. Sugimoto C. Onuma M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2979-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein samples were prepared by boiling cells in SDS sample buffer. The samples (2.5 × 105cells/lane) were separated on 7% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) or anti-Cre rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novagen). An enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). To examine the effect of Notch1 signaling in chicken B cells, we constructed vectors expressing an intracellular portion of chicken Notch1 (Notch1ICS, Fig.1 A), which corresponds to a constitutively active form of mouse Notch1 reported previously (30Robey E. Chang D. Itano A. Cado D. Alexander H. Lans D. Weinmaster G. Salmon P. Cell. 1996; 87: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). We then tested whether this chicken Notch1ICS is indeed active. First, the Notch1ICS was transiently expressed in NIH3T3 cells as a fusion protein with GFP and its subcellular localization was determined. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the GFP-Notch1ICS protein was found exclusively in the nuclei, whereas the control GFP was distributed diffusely in the cell. The same result was obtained with the chicken B cell line, DT40 (data not shown). We next examined the ability of Notch1ICS in DT40 cells to activate the transcription from the promoter of chicken Hairy1 gene, which is one of Hes family genes and has a CSL protein binding motif in its promoter region (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no.AB045236). In comparison to the GFP control, the GFP-Notch1ICS strongly activated the chicken Hairy1 gene promoter, but not the mutant promoter with a deletion of the CSL protein binding site (Fig. 1 C). Notch1ICS with a T7-tag at the N terminus similarly activated the Hairy1 promoter. These results indicate that the Notch1ICS is constitutively active in chicken B cells. To reveal a function of Notch1 in developing B cells in the bursa, we utilized a bursa-derived B-lymphoblastoid cell line, DT40, as a model system. DT40 cells maintain the characteristics of the bursal B cells, namely expression of specific surface markers such as ChB1 (52Goitsuka R. Chen C.H. Cooper M.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3126-3132PubMed Google Scholar) and, more significantly, continuous somatic gene conversion at Ig loci (53Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). DT40 cells express both Notch1 and Serrate2 weakly, but not Hairy1, suggesting that self ligand-receptor interaction, if any, is not enough to evoke intracellular signaling (see Fig. 6).2 To address the function of Notch1, we transfected DT40, or its surface IgM-negative variant, CL18, with T7-tagged Notch1ICS expression vector. Despite repeated transfection experiments, however, we could not establish any stable transfectants from DT40, and only one from CL18 expressing Notch1ICS, which showed very slow proliferation rate (data not shown). Cell cycle analysis of the Notch1ICS-transfectant showed that it contained high proportion of apoptotic cells, compared with the parental or mock-transfected CL18 cells (Fig.2). Similar effect of the Notch1ICS was observed in a few transfectants obtained from 249L4 cells, another bursa-derived B cell line expressing Notch1 (data not shown). Thus, Notch1ICS expression appears to be lethal for the B cell lines tested above, and occasionally arising transfectants suffer a severe growth disadvantage with continuous apoptosis in a fraction of cells. To avoid the cell lethality by the constitutive expression of Notch1ICS and to analyze the direct effects of Notch1ICS on the proliferation and/or survival of the cells, we applied a Cre/loxP-mediated inducible system (54Zhang Y. Wienands J. Zurn C. Reth M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7304-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for the expression of Notch1ICS. An expression vector encoding the chimeric Cre recombinase, MerCreMer, containing a ligand binding domain of the mouse estrogen receptor at both ends, was first introduced into DT40 cells. A stable transfectant strongly expressing the MerCreMer protein was selected by Western blotting, then transfected with the expression vectors in which GFP or GFP-Notch1ICSfusion genes were separated from the promoter byloxP-flanked neomycin-resistance gene (Fig.3 A). In the resultant transfectants (GFP or GFP-Notch1ICS clones), loxP-mediated recombination and the following expression of GFP orGFP-Notch1ICS genes can be induced by treatment with OH-TAM. Flow cytometric analysis showed that more than 97% of the transfectants expressed either GFP or GFP-Notch1ICS proteins upon treatment with 10 nm OH-TAM for 12 h (Fig.3 B). Two of the GFP-Notch1ICS clones (N#1–1, N#3–1) and a control GFP clone (G#1–13), each showing negligible fluorescence before OH-TAM treatment, were used for further analyses. Since OH-TAM itself inhibited the growth of DT40 cells slightly (data not shown), transfectants were treated with OH-TAM for the first 12 h to induce the expression of transgenes, then washed and further cultured in normal medium. The GFP-Notch1ICS clones proliferate constantly in the absence of Notch1ICS expression, but the proliferation was gradually inhibited by the induction of Notch1ICS, which first became evident 3 days after the induction (Fig.4, B and C). The control GFP clone proliferates at a constant rate irrespective of the induction of GFP (Fig. 4 A). To characterize the growth regulation by Notch1ICS, cell cycle profile was analyzed by flow cytometry every 24 h of the culture after the induction of Notch1ICS expression (Fig.5 A). The proportion of apoptotic cells increased gradually and reached over 25% by day 4 after the expression of Notch1ICS (a). The proportion of the cells in the S phase started to decrease at day 2 and became about half of"

Quantum state-resolved differential cross sections were measured for this prototype reaction. Different rotationally-vibrationally excited OH products have markedly different angular distributions, whereas the total reaction products are roughly forward and backward symmetric. Theoretical results obtained from QCT calculations indicate that this reaction is dominated by the insertion mechanism, with a small contribution from the collinear abstraction mechanism through quantum tunneling."

We report here the characterization of a new Rho member, which shares 85% and 78% amino acid similarity to TC10 and Cdc42, respectively. This GTPase, termed as TC10-like (TCL) is encoded by an unexpectedly large locus, made of five exons spanning over 85 kilobases on human chromosome 14. TCL mRNA is 2.5 kilobases long and is mainly expressed in heart. In vitro, TCL shows rapid GDP/GTP exchange and displays higher GTP dissociation and hydolysis rates than TC10. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assays, we show that GTP-bound but not GDP-bound TCL protein directly interacts with Cdc42/Rac interacting binding domains, such as those found in PAK and WASP. Despite its overall similarity to TC10 and Cdc42, the constitutively active TCL mutant displays distinct morphogenic activity in REF-52 fibroblasts, producing large and dynamic F-actin-rich ruffles on the dorsal cell membrane.

Rho proteins are key elements in the regulation of dynamic assembly of cytoskeletal components, that participate in physiological processes such as cell proliferation and motility, establishment of cell polarity (reviewed in 1), as well as in physiopathological processes such as cell transformation and metastasis (2Keely P. Parise L. Juliano R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Fort P. Jeanteur P. Progress in Molecular and Subcellular Biology. 22. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 159-181Google Scholar). The Rho family is made of two main groups. One comprises Rho(A–C), RhoD, Rnd(1–3), and RhoL; the other comprises Rac(1–3), RhoG, Cdc42, TC10, TTF/RhoH, and Chp (reviewed in Ref. 4Aspenström P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In fibroblastic cells, Rho(A–C) control the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fiber bundling (5Ridley A.J.

Cdc42 and TC10 regulate the formation of filopodia (8Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar, 9Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N.

BioEssays. 1994; 16: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In neurons, Rho proteins are required for axonal outgrowth (10Gallo G. Letourneau P.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 80-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while in phagocytic cells, they play a role in the activation of NADPH oxidase (11Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the polarization of helper T cells toward antigen-presenting cells (12Stowers L. Yelon D. Berg L.J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Like other Ras-related proteins, Rho GTPases adopt either an active GTP-bound or an inactive GDP-bound conformational state. Their activity is controlled positively by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which catalyze the replacement of GDP with GTP, and negatively by GTPase-activating proteins, which accelerate the endogenous GTPase activity (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Once loaded with GTP, the GTPase binds to and activates a set of downstream effector proteins directly or indirectly involved in the initiation of the cellular effects (reviewed in Ref. 15Aspenström P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Activation or inhibition of different Rho GTPases have been reported to control the formation of similar F-actin-containing structures, which might be a consequence of two distinct mechanisms. First, this might result from activation cascades involving several GTPases. This is the case for Cdc42, whose activation promotes the formation of filopodia as well as Rac-dependent lamellipodia (6Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar); for RhoG, which promotes the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia through Rac1 and Cdc42 activities (16Gauthier-Rouvière C. Vignal E. Mériane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); and for RhoA, whose inactivation leads to the downstream activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 (17Moorman J.P. Luu D. Wickham J. Bobak D.A. Hahn C.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Second, distinct GTPases might activate identical downstream effector proteins. This might be the case for Cdc42 and TC10, which share several effectors and both trigger the formation of filopodial extensions (9Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It thus emerges that identifying all GTPases of the Rho family is an essential step toward understanding how these proteins act in concert in the control of cell physiology. Here we report the identification of a new Rho member in mammals, based on its homology with Cdc42 and TC10. Sequence analysis indicates that this new protein, termed as TCL, is encoded by a 2.5-kb1 mRNA preferentially expressed in heart. Like TC10 and Cdc42, TCL binds Cdc42/Rac interacting binding (CRIB) domains of PAK and WASP. However, expression of the constitutively active TCL and TC10 proteins elicits the formation of distinct cytoskeletal structures in fibroblasts. Searches in human and murine data bases for sequences homologous to TC10 cDNA were done using BLAST (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) and ENTREZ NCBI web facilities. One human genomic sequence was identified (AL049871.2) as well as human ESTs (AA020825, AA020848,AA424648, AA434363, AA461242, AA920345, AI066690, AI091480, AI366101,AI369275, AI370786, AI378515, AI583530, N27528, N40345, and W59948), and murine ESTs (AA051640, AA537565, AI182685, AI322267, AI462525,AI510273, AI920345, AI931399, AW060455, AW121127, W10994, W12115, andW16055). Human- and mouse-derived TCL protein sequences were aligned with other Rho GTPases using MULTALIN (19Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4317) Google Scholar). Distance matrixes were computed and used to draw a similarity tree using ClustalW (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) and Treeview (21Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). IMAGE clones 269952 and 363723 (human) and 1383415 and 316263 (mouse) containing TCL full-length cDNAs were obtained from the United Kingdom (UK) Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center (Cambridge, UK). The human TCL open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by PCR and cloned in pBlueScript KS. Q79L and T35N mutations were introduced using the Gene Editor kit (Promega). The CAAX box was deleted by PvuII cleavage. The original clones as well as wild-type and mutated PCR fragments were fully sequenced. Wild-type and mutated ORFs were subcloned in prokaryotic pGEX-4T-2 vector (Life Science), yeast pBTM116, and mammalian pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). PAK-1 ORF was obtained by PCR amplification and subcloned in pGAD1318. WASP fragment (amino acids 201–321) containing the CRIB domain was swapped from pGEX-KG to pGAD1318. pGAD1318-Kinectin (clone 66, encoding amino acids 677–913) was isolated from an interaction screen with RhoG (16Gauthier-Rouvière C. Vignal E. Mériane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). pGEX-PAK expressing GST protein fused to human PAK1B CRIB domain (amino acids 5–131) was kindly provided by Anja Bathoorn (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands). For in vitrointeraction purposes, the insert containing PAK1B CRIB domain was swapped from pGex to pMal-C2 vector (New England Biolabs). pGEX-WASP and pActII-ROCK (encoding amino acids 888–1030) were kindly provided by A. Hall (University College, London, UK). GST-TCLwt and GST-TC10wt were expressed in E. coli using the pGEX vectors according to standard procedures. Briefly, bacteria were grown to mid log phase at 25 °C and then induced with 0.3 mm IPTG for 2.5 h at 25 °C. Bacteria were then pelleted; washed; re-suspended in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm GDP, and lysozyme (0.25 mg·ml−1); incubated on ice for 1 h; and sonicated. Unsoluble material was removed by centrifugation. 300 μl of glutathione-S-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the cleared lysate, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed three times in PBS. GST fusion proteins were eluted twice in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GDP, and 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). Recombinant GST-TCL was further used for biochemical studies and for raising antibodies. Rabbits were submitted to three rounds of injection of 0.1 mg of GST-TCL. Immunosera were depleted on GST-bound Sepharose, then affinity-purified on GST-TCL-bound Sepharose. For loading assays, 1 μm GTPase was incubated with 10 μmnucleotide ([35S]GTPγS or [3H]GDP) in Load Buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). For off-rate measurements, 1 μmGST-GTPases was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C with 10 μm nucleotide [35S]GTPγS in MgCl2-free Load Buffer. Nucleotide exchange was started by adding 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmunlabeled GTP. For loading and exchange kinetics, 25-μl aliquots (25 pmol) were taken at different times, added to 25 μl of cold “Stop Buffer” (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2), and filtered on 0.45-μm membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). k off values were calculated assuming single-exponential kinetics. For GTP hydrolysis assays, GST-GTPases were loaded for 2 min at 37 °C with 10 μm[γ32P]GTP in MgCl2-free Load Buffer supplemented with 5 mm Pi. GTP hydrolysis was started by adding 2 mm MgCl2. 25-μl aliquots were taken out at different times, mixed with 975 μl of charcoal in 50 mm NaH2PO4, and centrifuged.32Pi release was measured by counting the supernatant. Mouse MTN blot (CLONTECH) was pre-hybridized for 30 min. at 65 °C in 5 ml of ExpressHyb buffer (CLONTECH), then hybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in the same buffer containing denatured [α-32P]dCTP-labeled murine probe (1–2 × 106 cpm·ml−1). Filter was then washed twice for 15 min at 65 °C in 50 ml of 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and once for 15 min at 52 °C in 50 ml of 0.2× SSC, 0.1%SDS. Filter was sequentially hybridized with TCL and β-actin cDNA probes. For interaction studies in yeast, pBTM116 constructs expressing dominant active TCLQ79L or dominant negative TCLT35Nmutants as well as dominant active TC10Q75L and dominant active Cdc42G12V fused to LexA DNA binding domain were cotransformed in TAT-7 strain with plasmids expressing PAK, WASP, or kinectin fused to Gal4 activating domains, as described previously (22Blangy A. Vignal E. Schmidt S. Debant A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Fort P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 729-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double transformants were selected on drop-out medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. For in vitro interaction studies, 10 μg of GST-TCL (0.2 nmol) bound to Glutathione Sepharose was loaded for 2 min. at 37 °C in 100 μl of magnesium-free Load Buffer supplemented with 1 mm GTPγS or GDP, then blocked by adding 20 mmMgCl2. Under these conditions, 20% of TCL was loaded with GTP. The GTPase was then incubated on ice for 2 h with 15 μg of maltose-binding protein (MBP) (0.35 nmol) or MBP-CRIB (0.3 nmol), 1 mg.ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20. Sepharose beads were rinsed three times in ice-cold Load Buffer supplemented with 1 mg.ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20. Total and Sepharose-bound proteins were denatured in Laemmli buffer and then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MBP and anti-TCL antibodies. Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52) and human 293 (Bosc) cells were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated on 18-mm diameter glass coverslips 16–24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE method, as described by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). Four hours after the transfection, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Expressing cells were observed under fluorescence microscopy 8–24 h after transfection. Interactions were performed as described by Sander et al.(23). Bosc cells were transfected with constructs expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone (CLONTECH) or fused to the constitutive active mutants of Cdc42, RhoG, TC10, and TCL. 24 h after transfection, cells were rapidly washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mmNaCl, and protein inhibitor mixture. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 17,000 × g at 4 °C, and samples were taken from the supernatant to estimate total protein concentration. 20 μg of GST-CRIB fusion bound to Sepharose beads were added to cell lysate and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer. Total proteins and CRIB affinity-purified proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody directed against GFP (CLONTECH). Cells were fixed for 5 min in 3.7% formalin (in PBS) followed by a 2-min permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS) and incubation in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Expression of GFP-tagged proteins was directly visualized. F-actin was revealed using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (0.5 unit·ml−1; Sigma). Expression of Myc epitope-tagged proteins was visualized after a 60-min incubation with the 9E10 anti-Myc mAb or 12CA5 anti-HA mAb, followed by incubation with affinity purified 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:50 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells were washed in PBS, mounted in Mowviol (Aldrich), and observed under microscopy. Cell imaging was performed at the Integrated Imaging Facility of the laboratory. The microscopes were all Leicas (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with PL APO grade oil objectives. Images were captured as 16 TIFF files with MicroMax 1300 Y/HS (B/W) cooled (−10 °C) CCD cameras (RS-Princeton Instruments Inc.) driven by MetaMorph (version 4.11; Universal Imaging Corp.). MetaMorph also drived built-in microscope shutters and piezoelectric stepping motors (PZ 73E) attached to the lens turret through an E-662 LVPZT servo controller (Physik Instrument, Waldbronn, Germany).Rhodamine fluorescence was observed a N2.1 cube filter and GFP fluorescence with a GFP cube filter (Leica). For cell fluorescence quantitation, a 63× (numeric aperture, 1.32) and a constant time exposure (400 ms) were used. Cell fluorescence was measured after thresholding using the View Region Statistics module of MetaMorph. For all experiments, at least 100 transfected cells were examined, unless stated in the text. To examine inner cell three-dimensional F-actin organization, stacks of optical sections (z step = 0.088 μm) were captured with a DMR B microscope using a 63× (numeric aperture, 1.32) objective mounted on a piezoelectric stepping motor. Stacks were first restored with Huygens (Scientific Volume Imaging b.v, Hilversum, The Netherlands). Briefly, Huygens is an iterative program that encodes light as 32-bit gray levels and reassigns it at high probability to specific voxels in the stack using a point spread function. This results in removing fuzziness contained in the stack. In the present study, the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm was used throughout (24van der Voort H.T.M. Straters K.C. J. Microsc. 1995; 178: 165-181Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25van der Voort H.T.M. Messerli J.M. Noordmans H.J. Smeulders A.W.M. Bioimaging. 1993; 1: 20-29Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Restored stacks were then further processed with Imarys (BitPlane, Zurich, Switzerland) for visualization and volume rendering. Huygens and Imarys programs were run on a four-processor Origin 2000 and a two-processor Octane (SGI), respectively. For living cell studies, a laboratory made device maintained cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, >80 relative humidity atmosphere. Epifluorescence illumination was ensured by a halogen light bulb (100 watts). GFP positive cells grown on 0.17-mm-thick glass coverslip were studied 18 h after transfection with an inverted DMIRBE using a 63× (numeric aperture, 1.32). Cell images were captured (exposure time, 400 ms) every 10 s for 10 min as time series of 16-bit files. For video presentation, selected images were cropped, assembled, and compressed using Quicktime (version 4.0). Transfected REF-52 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH7.2) containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 msucrose for at least 1 h, and processed for SE as described (26Brunk U. Collins V.P. Arro E. J. Microsc. 1981; 123: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Samples were observed using a Hitachi S4000 scanning microscope at 15 kV. For all experiments, at least 50 cells were examined. Images were processed as above. To estimate the fraction of transfected cells, one coverslip was processed for F-actin, TCLQ79L, and TC10Q75L detection by immunofluorescence. In all experiments, the same proportion of cells with altered morphology was observed either by SE or immunohistochemistry. A general survey of nucleotide sequences encoding new GTPases of the Rho family was performed in human and murine expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases. We isolated a set of 16 human and 14 murine EST sequences with 70% identity to human or murine TC10 ORF (27Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These sequences showed lower levels of identity with Cdc42, RhoG, or Rac1. Merging overlapping ESTs produced a 2,195-bp human and a 2,252-bp murine consensus cDNA sequences, whose ORFs were 87% identical. ORFs from both species were PCR-amplified from IMAGE clones 269952 and 316263, respectively, and fully sequenced (accession numbers AJ276567 and AJ276568). Human and murine ORFs potentially encode 214 and 204 amino acids proteins, respectively, that share 95% sequence similarity (93% identity), all changes being clustered within the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal ends. These proteins contain the canonical G1–3 boxes involved in the nucleotide binding and conserved among Ras-like GTPases, as well as a two-cysteine “CCAAX” box, a substrate for geranylgeranyl- and farnesyltransferases. Protein sequence alignment with other GTPases of the Rac/Cdc42 subfamily showed that, like TC10, these proteins contain an amino-terminal extension compared with Cdc42, Rac, or RhoG, which differs in length between man and mouse (Fig.1 A). Sequence alignment of human Rho proteins was next used to compute pairwise similarity matrixes and to draw a similarity dendrogram, which clearly showed that the new protein shares a significant stem with TC10 (Fig.1 B). For these reasons, this protein will be referred to as TCL (TC10-like). Data base search also revealed significant matches within a 169,645-bp genomic fragment from human chromosome 14 (AL049871.2, Genoscope, France). Further analysis showed that this fragment contains all genomic counterparts of whole of TCL cDNA sequence (Fig. 2). The human TCL gene is made of 5 exons, the first one (39,379–40,011) encoding the 5′-untranslated region and the first 59 amino acids. The second exon (102,071–102,132) encodes amino acids 60–79 and is separated by an unusually long intron (62,061 bp) from the first exon. Exon 3 (113,934–114,099) encodes amino acids 80–134, exon 4 (116,082–116,178) encodes amino acids 135–165, and exon 5 (123,839–125,067) amino acids 166–214. Thus, the human TCL gene represents the largest gene encoding a Rho GTPase characterized so far, spanning over 86 kb. We next examined the pattern of expression of TCL mRNA. To this aim, we used a 1.7-kb probe derived from the original IMAGE 316263 murine clone, covering the 5′-untranslated region, the ORF, and two thirds of the 3′-untranslated region. Hybridization of the TCL probe to a Northern blot membrane from multiple mouse tissues revealed the presence of a single mRNA product of about 2.5 kb (Fig.3). This is in consistency with 2,252-bp length of the consensus sequence (excluding the poly(A) tract), merged from the various murine TCL ESTs. TCL mRNA is expressed at high levels in heart, and at moderate levels in lung and liver. Very low levels could be detected in the other tissues. TCL pattern of expression differs from TC10 and Cdc42. TC10 has been reported to be expressed at high levels in heart and skeletal muscle but at very low levels in other tissues such as lung and liver, while Cdc42 is expressed at moderate levels in most tissues (9Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next purified wild-type TCL and TC10 deleted from their CAAX boxes as GST fusions in bacteria and compared their biochemical properties. We first examined the kinetics of [35S]GTPγS and [3H]GDP loading of TCL. Since the recombinant protein was purified in the presence of GDP, GDP dissociation represents the first and the rate-limiting step. The increase in TCL bound to labeled nucleotides therefore reflects the dissociation of the original bound GDP. At 37 °C and in a physiological buffer containing 2 mmMgCl2, TCL bound [35S]GTPγS and [3H]GDP at the same rate (t 12 = 2 min) (Fig. 4 A). Assuming single-exponential kinetics, TCL dissociates from GDP at an apparent rate of 0.34 ± 0.05 min−1. Fig.4 B shows GTPγS dissociation kinetics of TCL and TC10. GTPases were first loaded with [35S]GTPγS in low magnesium buffer and then allowed to dissociate from the labeled nucleotide by incubation at 37 °C with 2 mmMg2+ and 1 mm cold GTP. Under these conditions, TCL dissociated from GTPγS with a k offapproximating 0.085 ± 0.01 min−1, while TC10 showed a slower dissociation rate (k off = 0.055 ± 0.008 min−1). Thesek off are higher than values previously determined at 30 °C for TC10 (0.006–0.018 min−1) (9Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Murphy G.A. Solski P.A. Jillian S.A. Perez de la Ossa P. D'Eustachio P. Der C.J. Rush M.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3831-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 C shows the basal GTPase activity of TCL and TC10. GTPases were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP in low magnesium, and the release of32Pi was measured at 37 °C after 2 mm Mg2+ addition. Under these conditions, TCL hydrolyzed 7% of its bound GTP per minute, while TC10 hydrolyzed 5% of it. These values are in the range of those reported for TC10 hydrolysis at 37 °C (0.06 min−1) (28Murphy G.A. Solski P.A. Jillian S.A. Perez de la Ossa P. D'Eustachio P. Der C.J. Rush M.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3831-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, TCL and TC10 protein sequences are highly similar in their amino-terminal region, and are strictly conserved in their effector loop (HsTCL amino acids 48–59, Fig. 1 A). To evaluate whether TCL can bind targets containing a CRIB domain as TC10 does, we first generated TCL mutants expected to be preferentially loaded with GTP or GDP. To produce a constitutively active TCL protein, glutamine 79 was replaced by leucine (Q79L). This substitution is equivalent to the classical Q61L mutation previously shown to reduce the overall GTP hydrolysis rate in other Rho GTPases (reviewed in Ref. 27Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We also replaced threonine 35 by an asparagine (T35N), whose equivalent substitution in Ras (T17N) has been reported to lock the GTPase in the GDP-bound form (30Feig L. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Both mutants were expressed as LexA fusions and assayed for interaction with PAK-1 and with the CRIB domain of WASP fused to Gal4. As shown in Fig.5 A, a high β-galactosidase activity was detected when LexA-TCLQ79L was co-expressed with GalAD-PAK-1 or GalAD-WASP. Similar levels of β-galactosidase activity were observed when LexA-TC10Q75L or LexA-Cdc42G12V were expressed, while RhoGG12Vdid not show any interaction. Yeasts co-expressing LexA-TCLT35N failed to produce any β-galactosidase activity, indicating that only the GTP-bound form of TCL binds PAK-1 and WASP. Similar levels of expression were detected for Cdc42, TC10, and TCL constructs in yeast extracts (Fig. 5 A,lower panel). As a negative control, we co-expressed GalAD fused to a kinectin fragment, which specifically binds to RhoGG12V and Rac1G12V (16Gauthier-Rouvière C. Vignal E. Mériane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This fragment failed to produce any interaction with TCLQ79L, TC10Q75L, and Cdc42G12V fusions. The interaction of GTP-bound TCL was confirmed in mammalian cells using a CRIB affinity assay (23Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). Lysates from Bosc cells expressing GFP or GFP fused to Cdc42G12V, RhoGG12V, TC10Q75L, or TCLQ79L were incubated with GST-CRIBPAK bound to Sepharose beads. Western blotting analysis of bound proteins using an anti-GFP antibody shows that GFP-Cdc42G12V, GFP-TC10Q75L, and GFP-TCLQ79L were efficiently bound, whereas GFP or GFP-RhoGG12V proteins were not (Fig. 5 B,upper panel). As a control, lysates from GFP-TCLQ79L-expressing cells were incubated in the presence of GST (Fig. 5 B, last lane), which produced no interaction. The presence of wild-type and fusion GFP in total lysates was checked by Western blotting, which showed that all constructs had been expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 5 B,lower panel). To establish that TCL directly interacts with CRIB domains, affinity-purified MBP fused to CRIBPAK was incubated with glutathione beads bound to GST-TCLwt loaded with GDP or GTP. Fig. 5 C shows that TCL.GTP efficiently interacted with MBP-CRIBPAK, while barely detectable levels were observed with TCL.GDP (upper andlower right panels). MBP alone produced no interaction with either form of TCL. The amount of input and pulled-down purified proteins was controlled by Western blotting using anti-MBP and anti-GST antibodies (upper andmiddle panels) and by Ponceau staining (lower panel). These experiments therefore establish that TCL efficiently and directly binds CRIB domains. Previous studies have established that expression of TC10Q75L produces numerous peripheral filopodial"

This cDNA was identified by subtractive hybridization based upon its high expression in bone marrow-derived osteoblasts. By Northern blot analysis, we detected a single 2-kilobase mRNA transcript in bone, whereas no expression was detected in other tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the protein was expressed highly in osteocytes within trabecular and cortical bone. RNA and protein expression analysis using in vivo marrow ablation as a model of bone remodeling demonstrated that this gene was expressed only in cells that were embedded within bone matrix in contrast to the earlier expression of known osteoblast markers. The cDNA was predicted to encode a serine/glycine-rich secreted peptide containing numerous potential phosphorylation sites and one RGD sequence motif. The interaction of RGD domain-containing peptides with integrins has been shown previously to regulate bone remodeling by promoting recruitment, attachment, and differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Secretion of this RGD-containing protein from osteocytes has the potential to regulate cellular activities within the bone environment and thereby may impact bone homeostasis.

J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In the growing skeleton, the amount of mineralized bone formed exceeds the amount lost through resorption, whereas in the mature adult lost bone mineral is precisely balanced by an equivalent amount of formation, thereby preserving the integrity of the skeleton. Under certain conditions such as aging, postmenopausal estrogen deficiency, or prolonged steroid treatment, the amount of bone formed is not sufficient to compensate for the quantity lost by resorption. Over time, this imbalance results in reduced bone mass, compromises the structural integrity of the skeleton, and, ultimately, can lead to osteoporotic bone fractures. Osteoporosis and the resulting fractures are causes of significant morbidity and mortality within the aging population. Bone remodeling is a very complex process of tightly coordinated action by the bone resorbing osteoclasts and the bone forming osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are derived from a mesenchymal cell lineage and are responsible for the formation of new bone matrix in their differentiated state (2Wlodarski K.H. Clin. Orthoped. Relat. Res. 1990; 252: 276-293PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, osteoblasts produce factors that regulate the formation of osteoclasts and osteoclastic bone resorbing activity in response to endocrine signals such as parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. It has been postulated that bone loss associated with aging is caused by a defect in the osteoblast cell lineage (3Rodriguez J.P. Garat S. Gajardo H. Pino A.M. Seitz G. J. Cell.

Either the mesenchymal precursor population is insufficient or has lost the capacity to proliferate and/or differentiate into sufficient numbers of functioning osteoblasts. Osteoblasts progress through a three-stage process of differentiation: proliferation, matrix maturation, and mineralization (7Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 9Malaval L. Liu F. Roche P. Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). During this differentiation process, a well characterized temporal and spatial expression pattern of extracellular bone matrix proteins and other genes occurs (9Malaval L. Liu F. Roche P. Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 10Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S.

Res. 1993; 8: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The bone matrix is composed primarily of type I collagen, which forms the extracellular structural component for the deposition of hydroxyapatite. Osteoblasts also secrete non-collagenous proteins into the extracellular matrix (12Robey P.G. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Boskey A.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The non-collagenous proteins include proteoglycans, sulfated glycoproteins, highly phosphorylated RGD-motif proteins, and proteins modified to contain Gla amino acid residues. Examples include biglycan, osteonectin, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. The exact functions of many of these proteins have not yet been delineated, although, for most, evidence supports a role in promoting mineralization events (12Robey P.G. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An exception is the Gla peptide, osteocalcin, which has been shown to be a negative regulator of bone formation by gene knockout technology (14Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The progression of osteoblast differentiation has been modeled in cell culture using primary calvarial or bone marrow cells. Bone marrow contains pluripotent stem cells of the adipocytic, osteoblastic, fibroblastic, and hematopoetic cell lineages (10Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S.

Rat and human marrow cultures require a differentiation agent such as dexamethasone, whereas mouse-derived cells can differentiate in the absence of dexamethasone (17Rickard D.J. Kassem M. Hefferan T.E. Sarkar G. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 18Maniatopoulos C. Sodek J. Melcher A.H.

In vitro differentiated osteoblasts display the capacity to secrete noncollagenous proteins into the extracellular matrix in a temporally regulated manner, which may indicate a regulatory function for each of these proteins in the mineralization process (20Yao K.L. Todescan Jr., R. Sodek J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differentiated bone marrow cultures have the capacity to facilitate deposition of matrix and formation of hydroxyapatite mineral when grown in the presence of a phosphate source such as β-glycerophosphate. These properties have made the differentiation of rat bone marrow cells a useful model to investigate the mechanisms of bone remodeling and osteoblast function. In fact, it is ex vivo experiments comparing marrow cultures derived from young versus aged humans that have suggested that aging related osteoporosis may be the result of a diminished capacity of marrow to produced functioning, differentiated osteoblasts (3Rodriguez J.P. Garat S. Gajardo H. Pino A.M. Seitz G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 4Erdmann J. Kogler C. Diel I. Ziegler R. Pfeilschifter J. Mech.

Res. 1994; 9: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In our efforts to better describe the molecular mechanisms by which osteoblastic cells control bone homeostasis, we have constructed a subtractive cDNA library and identified novel genes that are differentially expressed in rat bone marrow-derived osteoblastic cell cultures versus control cell cultures that were not induced to form osteoblasts. This report is focused on the identification and characterization of a single novel gene that has properties consistent with a bone-specific extracellular matrix protein. The temporal regulation of the mRNA expression specifically in osteoblasts and osteocytes during the differentiation program and the analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence are consistent with a gene having functional significance in bone. We propose the name OF45 (osteoblast/osteocyte factor of 45 kDa) for the protein encoded by this cDNA. Primary RBMC were isolated and differentiated into osteoblastic cells as described previously (21Rickard D.J. Sullivan T.A. Shenker B.J. Leboy P.S. Kazhdan I. Dev.

Marrow was isolated from the tibia and femur of 3-month-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley female rats and placed into culture medium (α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Life Technologies, Inc.). Isolated marrow cells were filtered through 100-μm mesh, washed three times with culture medium, and plated into 10-cm tissue culture dishes at a density of 1 × 106cells/cm2. Cells were allowed to attach for 4 days undisturbed at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were grown until 90% confluent, at which time they were treated with 50 μg/ml ascorbate and 10 nm dexamethasone in culture medium as indicated. Medium was changed three times per week after the initial attachment period. To assess the ability of these cell cultures to mineralize, cultures were maintained in 50 μg/ml ascorbate, 10 nm dexamethasone, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and stained by Von Kossa staining to assess mineral deposition. UMR-106 cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and grown until 80% confluent. Cells were then switched into control media, 10 nm dexamethasone, or 10 nm dexamethasone and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Cells were refed with fresh medium three times per week and were extracted for RNA at either 24 h or 14 days using Trizol reagent as indicated below. ROS 17/2.8 cells were the kind gift of Barbara Kream (Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT) and were plated and treated in a manner identical to that for the UMR-106 cell cultures. A subtractive cDNA library was constructed essentially as described previously (23Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24Rivera-Gonzalez R. Petersen D.N. Tkalcevic G. Thompson D.D. Brown T.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from untreated cultures and 5 μg from dexamethasone-treated cultures were used to generate cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase following conditions specified by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR product after five rounds of subtractive hybridization was ligated to BamHI-digested/alkaline phosphatase-treated pBSSK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Colonies were screened by hybridization to round 5 probe as described (24Rivera-Gonzalez R. Petersen D.N. Tkalcevic G. Thompson D.D. Brown T.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from hybridizing colonies and sequenced. A cDNA library was constructed from mRNA isolated from dexamethasone-treated RBMC using the pSPORT1 vector system as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA library was plated, transferred to Hybond N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), denatured, cross-linked with a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and hybridized according to standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One million colonies were screened by hybridization with three different 32P-labeled fragments from the subtractive cDNA library. 28 positive clones were identified and sequenced. The longest clone, named 51-35, hybridized to all three probes and was sequenced on both strands to confirm the sequence. The first nucleotide of the longest clone corresponds to base 17 in the sequence shown in Fig. 1. The 5′ end of the mRNA was determined by RNA ligase-mediated RACE as described (26Frohman M.A. PCR Methods and Applications. 4. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: S40-S58Google Scholar). The OF45 gene-specific primers were 44A (5′-GTTAGGTAGTGCGTGCTTCG-3′) and 44B (5′-GGACATCTGTTGGAATTACGC-3′). The pGbx-1 RNA linker primers were NRC-1 (5′-CCAAGACTCACTGGGTACTGC-3′) and NRC-2 (5′-CTAGAGGGGCCTGTTGAACC-3′).Figure 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of OF45.

Different cDNA probes were used on the identical filters after stripping of the filters overnight in prehybridization buffer at 57 °C prior to adding the next radiolabeled cDNA probe. Each cDNA probe was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from either rat tibia or ROS 17/2.8 cell RNA. Specific probe regions are: alkaline phosphatase GenBank™ accession no.

A mammalian expression vector for OF45 was created by PCR amplification of the coding region and subcloning into the cytomegalovirus mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cell cultures were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 or OF45pcDNA3 using LipofectAMINE Plus according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was harvested 48 h after transfection. Samples were denatured with reducing sample buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA), separated by electrophoresis on Novex 10% NuPAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride using a semidry transfer system. Blots were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, and primary antibody diluted in 0.25% nonfat dry milk was added for 1 h. After washing, goat anti-rabbit peroxidase secondary antibody (Pierce) was diluted into 0.25% nonfat dry milk and applied to the blot for 1 h. After washing, signal was detected using an ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) following the manufacturer's instructions. OF45 protein spanning the entire coding region was expressed in bacteria using pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI). This construct created a fusion protein with a His6 tag and T7 tag at the amino terminus. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was created by subcloning theBamHI/EcoRI fragment in the Escherichia coli expression construct pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). High titer polyclonal antisera was generated by immunization of rabbits by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). A polyacrylamide gel slice containing ∼20 mg of highly purified glutathione S-transferase-OF45 fusion protein was used as the immunogen. This material was obtained by SDS-PAGE purification of glutathione S-transferase-OF45 fusion protein that was solubilized from the inclusion bodies. The His tag OF45 fusion protein expressed in pET28a was purified and coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B, as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 5 mg of protein/ml of resin was coupled. Anti-OF45 antibody was affinity-purified by standard methods described previously (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Adult rat tibia were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and decalcified in 10% EDTA. Bones were embedded into paraffin, and 5-μm sections were placed onto Digene silanated slides (Beltsville, MD) and heated overnight at 50 °C. Slides were rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating sections in 3% H2O2 in methanol. Antigenic sites were exposed by pepsin digestion at 20,000 units in 0.01 m HCl. Sections were blocked in 1% BSA/PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with primary antibody diluted at 1:500 in 0.1% BSA/PBS or rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratory Inc., Burlingame CA) as a control. Secondary antibody consisting of anti-rabbit IgG Fab fragments linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was diluted at 1:100 in 0.1% BSA/PBS and placed onto sections for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed using a diaminobenzidene substrate chromagen system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratory). Animal experimental protocols were carried out according to Pfizer's animal care approved protocols, and animals were maintained in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Tibial marrow ablation was performed as described by Suva et al. (30Suva L.J. Seedor J.G. Endo N. Quartuccio H.A. Thompson D.D. Bab I. Rodan G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). At the indicated times after ablation, the tibia were isolated and split longitudinally. The cellular contents of the marrow cavity were removed by scraping with a spatula, and RNA was isolated as described for tissues. Primary rat bone marrow cells were cultured for 4 weeks in the presence of vehicle or 10 nm dexamethasone. Consistent with earlier literature reports (18Maniatopoulos C. Sodek J. Melcher A.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 21Rickard D.J. Sullivan T.A. Shenker B.J. Leboy P.S. Kazhdan I. Dev.

Biochem. 1991; 146: 370-378Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar), this culture system required dexamethasone treatment to potentiate differentiation into osteoblastic cells as evidenced by induction of osteoblast marker genes (Fig. 4) or the ability to detect mineralization by Von Kossa staining when a phosphate source such as β-glycerophosphate was included in the culture medium (data not shown). A cDNA library enriched for genes induced during osteoblastic differentiation was constructed by subtractive hybridization of cDNA from dexamethasone treated cultures versus cDNA from vehicle-treated cultures. After 5 rounds of subtractive hybridization, clones were analyzed by colony screening using round 5 subtracted cDNA as probe. A summary of the sequence analysis for 153 randomly selected, hybridizing clones is shown in TableI. The sequence data were assembled and compared with known genes in GenBank™ with the BLAST algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69631) Google Scholar). An indicator of the efficiency of the subtraction was that there was very little contamination with ribosomal RNA (1/153) or with mitochondrial genes (0/153). The identification of genes previously reported to be induced during osteoblast differentiation (10Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell.

Regulation was determined by Northern blot analysis of 20 μg of total RNA from vehicleversus dexamethasone-treated RBMC. Results are indicated as follows: +, up-regulated by dexamethasone; NR, not regulated, NS, no signal detected; ND, not determined. In addition to known osteoblast marker genes, sequence analysis revealed a number of unknown genes. The mRNA corresponding to most of the novel sequences could not be detected by Northern blot analysis of 20 μg of total RNA. More sensitive methods will be required to confirm their regulation during osteoblast differentiation. In this report, we focus on the characterization of a single novel gene that was strongly represented (17% of analyzed clones) in the subtractive library and the induction of which could be detected by Northern blot analysis of total RNA. The full-length cDNA was cloned as described under “Experimental Procedures” and sequenced (Fig. 1). A Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plot demonstrated that the sequence contained a hydrophobic leader sequence followed by a hydrophilic protein (Fig.2 A). Although the predicted amino acid sequence lacked the NH2-terminal positively charged region (N-region) characteristic of a signal sequence for a secreted protein, it does contain an amino-terminal hydrophobic region (H-region) characteristic of a signal sequence as described by von Hiejne (32von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence with PSORTII, a program to predict the subcellular localization sites of proteins from their amino acid sequences indicates that this is likely to be an extracellular protein (33Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 34McGeoch D.J. Virus Res. 1985; 3: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The predicted site of cleavage would be between Ala-16 and Ala-17. Assuming the actual cleavage occurs after Ala-16, the secreted protein would be 419 amino acids in length with a calculated molecular weight of 44,744 Da. The predicted amino acid composition of the processed protein is shown in Fig. 2 B. The sequence is rich in serine, glycine, and charged residues. It would be a basic protein having a calculated pI of 8.67 with a net charge of +5.13 at neutral pH in the absence of post-translational modification. There are numerous potential phosphorylation sites including nine consensus casein kinase II sites shown in Fig. 1. Phosphorylation sites offer the potential for post-translational modification to increase the acidic character of the protein. Finally, sequence analysis revealed one consensus RGD integrin recognition motif characteristic of some extracellular matrix proteins (Fig. 1). Transient transfection in Chinese hamster ovary cells confirmed that OF45 can be secreted by mammalian cells (Fig. 2 C). The apparent molecular mass by SDS-PAGE was ∼45 kDa, consistent with that predicted from the cDNA sequence for the cleaved peptide. Recombinant expression in Chinese hamster ovary and UMR cells (data not shown) gave no evidence for additional processing or post-translational modifications that could be detected by SDS-PAGE. However, it is possible that proteolytic or other post-translational processing occurs with endogenously expressed protein in bone. Comparison of the OF45 cDNA sequence to GenBank™ using the BLAST 1.4 algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69631) Google Scholar) showed little primary sequence homology to any known genes in the data base. Weak homology was found to the protein DMP1 (also known as AG1) (35George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-31260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary sequence homology is shown in the alignment in Fig.3. Although the homology at the primary sequence level is very weak (22% identity, 37% similarity, expected probability 3 × 106) there are general similarities that support the relatedness of these two proteins. OF45 shares properties with DMP1 including the fact that both genes are highly charged, serine-rich, and contain a hydrophobic leader sequence. OF45 is also analogous to DMP1 in that both genes exhibit a highly tissue restricted expression. DMP1 is most highly expressed in mature odontoblasts, the tooth-forming cells analogous to the bone forming osteoblasts that express OF45 (35George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol.

In this study, we identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a gene product induced by heregulin-β1. The stimulation by heregulin-β1 of breast cancer epithelial cells induced the expression of the VEGF mRNA and protein and its promoter activity. Heregulin-β1 also stimulated angiogenesis in a VEGF-dependent manner. Herceptin, an anti-HER2 antibody inhibited heregulin-β1-mediated stimulation of both VEGF expression in epithelial cells and angiogenesis in endothelial cells. Because the activation of Pak1 and VEGF expression are positively regulated by heregulin-β1, we hypothesized that Pak1 regulates VEGF expression, and hence explored the role of Pak1 in angiogenesis. We provide new evidence to implicate Pak1 signaling in VEGF expression. Overexpression of a kinase-dead K299R Pak1 leads to suppression of VEGF promoter activity, as well as VEGF mRNA expression and secretion of VEGF protein. Conversely, kinase-active T423E Pak1 promotes the expression and secretion of VEGF. Furthermore, expression of the heregulin-β1 transgene, HRG, in harderian tumors in mice enhances the activation of Pak1 as well as expression of VEGF and angiogenic marker CD34 antigen. These results suggest that heregulin-β1 regulates angiogenesis via up-regulation of VEGF expression and that Pak1 plays an important role in controlling VEGF expression and, consequently, VEGF secretion and function.

Abnormalities in the expression and actions of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)1 family members contribute to the progression and maintenance of the malignant phenotype and to increased metastasis in human breast cancer (1Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar). HER family receptors are transactivated by receptor-receptor interaction in a ligand-dependent manner (2Hynes N.C. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) and thus can utilize more than one pathway to transduce their biological activities. For example, HER-3 and HER-4 receptors bind to more than a dozen isoforms of the heregulins, and each can activate the HER-2 receptor via interactions among heterodimeric interactions (3Peles E.

Accordingly, an anti-HER2 mAb, Herceptin, has been shown to block heregulin-triggered interactions between HER3 and HER2 interactions, and some of the biological effects of heregulin-β1 (HRG) (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 8Kumar, R., Mandal, M., and Vadlamudi, R. (2000) Semin. Oncol., in press.Google Scholar). The physiologic significance of HRG was established through targeted deletion studies in which mice lacking HRG had developmental abnormalities in the nervous and cardiovascular systems (9Kramer R. Bucay N. Kane D. Martin L. Tarpley J. Theill L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93 (1996): 4833-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10Lee K. Simon H. Chen H. Bates B. Hung M. Hauser C. Nature. 1995; 378: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The most prominent cardiovascular abnormalities included a lack of the endocardial cushion, which requires mesenchymal cell growth for its development. Heregulin supports angiogenesis (11Russell K.S. Stern D.F. Polverini P.J. Bender J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2205-H2211PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that HRG, a paracrine growth factor secreted from mesenchymal cells, regulate the progression of breast cancer cells to the invasive phenotype (12Pietras R.J. Arboleda J. Reese D.M. Wongvipat N. Pegram M.D. Ramos L. Gorman C.M. Parker M.G. Sliwkowski M.X. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2435-2446PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kumar R. Mandal M. Ratzkin B.J.

Recently, we confirmed that in the absence of HER-2 overexpression, HRG-stimulated activation of breast cancer cells promotes the development of more aggressive phenotypes; this development includes the formation of lamellipodia and an increase in cell motility through activation of p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1) (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Additional evidence that Pak1 may play a role in HRG-mediated invasion of breast cancer cells was demonstrated by the use of kinase-dead Pak1 mutants that promoted cell spreading and the stabilization of focal points, reducing cell invasion (15Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Wang R-A. Mandal M.

Despite the widely acknowledged role of HRG in angiogenesis and breast cancer progression, the molecular mechanism by which HRG affects angiogenesis and the potential role that Pak1 signaling plays in angiogenesis remain poorly understood. Several recent studies suggest that tumor growth and progression are closely linked to angiogenesis. The neovascularization or angiogenesis, which provides nutrient flow to solid tumors, is critical to the initial rapid tumor growth and the growth of metastases (17Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1588-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The onset of tumor angiogenesis depends on the production of angiogenic factors by the tumor cells or tumor microenvironment that stimulate host organ vascular endothelial cell growth and chemotaxis (18Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar). The signals that influence the expression of angiogenic molecules in tumor cells may come from other tumor cells or from surrounding stromal cells. One of the best characterized angiogenic protein is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor (17Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1588-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 18Hanahan D. Folkman J.

VEGF is a potent, selective endothelial cell mitogen and chemotactic protein that is regulated by a number of cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes (20Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Bayko L. Filmus J. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4575-4580PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar), as well as by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling (22Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of HER1 and HER2 receptors in human tumor cell lines is associated with increased expression of VEGF and angiogenesis (23Petit A.M. Rak J. Hung M.-C. Rockwell P. Goldstein N. Fendly B. Kerbel R.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1523-1530PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of HER2 occurs in 20–25% of breast cancer patients. The remainder of breast cancer patients, who have no overexpression of HER-2 receptor levels, often exhibit metastasis. Thus, it is important to explore the potential regulation of VEGF by mesenchymal growth factor HRG in the absence of HER2 overexpression. The results of this study show that HRG regulates the expression of the VEGF promoter, VEGF mRNA, and VEGF protein and its secretion and that HRG stimulates angiogenesis in a VEGF-dependent manner. Our results implicate Pak1 signaling in HRG regulation of VEGF expression. Using dominant-negative or dominant-active Pak1 mutants, we discovered that Pak1 activity was required for the transcriptional expression of VEGF and thereby influenced the level of VEGF secretion.

Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) were purchased from the Clontics Corp. and cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against HER3 (25Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Adam L. Bandyopadhyay D. Steinbach G. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and VEGF and recombinant heregulin-beta1 were obtained from Neomarkers Inc. (Fremont, CA). Antibodies against HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptors have been described previously (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recombinant VEGF was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Breast cancer cells were grown to 50% confluency and then incubated in serum-free conditions for 48 h. Cells were metabolically labeled with 20 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine for 24 h in a methionine-free medium containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence of HRG (50 ng/ml) (13Kumar R. Mandal M. Ratzkin B.J. Liu N. Lipton A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 62: 102-112Crossref Google Scholar). Conditioned media with equal trichloroacetic acid perceptible counts were immunoprecipitated with the desired or control antibody, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed using autoradiography. Breast cancer cells were cultured under serum-free conditions for 24 h and treated in the presence or absence of HRG (50 ng/ml); conditioned medium was harvested after 24 h. The amount of secreted VEGF was measured in the conditioned medium with a VEGF-specific sandwich-ELISA assay (R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. VEGF protein levels were normalized to the number of cells. Total cytoplasmic (RNA 20 μg) was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. Northern blots were probed with32P labeled 473 bp VEGF cDNA fragment (provided by Dr. Abraham Judith). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels were used to assess the integrity of the RNA and to control for RNA loading (25Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Adam L. Bandyopadhyay D. Steinbach G. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells cultured in six-well plates were transiently cotransfected with 2 μg of full-length VEGF promotor-luciferase reporter construct (26Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with or without HRG for 24 h. Cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer, and a luciferase assay was performed using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity was used to normalize the transfection. The Pak1 kinase assay was performed as described (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells expressing HA-tagged T423E Pak1 were treated with doxycycline (1 μg/ml) for 24 h to induce the express kinase-active Pak1, and T423E Pak1 was immunoprecipitated with HA monoclonal antibody. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm MgCl2. The kinase reaction was carried out in kinase buffer supplemented with myelin basic protein as a substrate and 10 μci of [γ32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The kinase reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by autoradiography. To study Pak kinase activity in tissues from transgenic mice, endogenous Pak1 was immunoprecipitated from tissues lysates using Pak1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In vitro angiogenesis in collagen gels was quantitated using spheroids of microvascular endothelial cells (27Meyer M. Clauss M. Lepple-Wienhues A. Waltenberger J. Augustin H. Ziche M. Lanz C. Buner M. Rziha H.J. Dehio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). To generate these spheroids, 1 × 104 cells were suspended in culture medium and seeded in 96-well plates coated with 0.5% (w/v) agarose. HMVEC-L spheroids were generated overnight and then embedded into collagen gels. A collagen stock solution was prepared prior to use by mixing acidic collagen extract of rat tails (equilibrated at 4 °C to 3 mg/ml) with 10× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (8:1) and ∼1 volume of 0.1n NaOH to adjust the pH to 7.4. A 0.5-ml sample of this stock solution was mixed at room temperature with 0.5 ml of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 ng/ml HRG in the presence or absence of 100 nm Herceptin or 1 μg/ml anti-VEGF antibody. The spheroid-containing gel was rapidly transferred into a 24-well plate and allowed to polymerize, after which 0.15 ml of medium was pipetted on top of the gel. The gel was incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and 100% humidity. For the tube formation assay (27Meyer M. Clauss M. Lepple-Wienhues A. Waltenberger J. Augustin H. Ziche M. Lanz C. Buner M. Rziha H.J. Dehio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), 10 mg/ml of Matrigel was coated in 24-well plates at 4 °C. Endothelial cells were gelled at 37 °C and then seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well onto the Matrigel layers contained 50 ng/ml HRG in the presence or absence of 100 nm Herceptin or 1 μg/ml anti-VEGF antibody. The rates of migration of HUVEC and HMVEC-L were determined using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Aliquots of HUVEC and HMVEC-L (105 cells/aliquot) were placed into the upper chamber of a filter with an 8-μm pore size (Costar Transwell) well. The filter inserts with cells were placed in wells of a 24-well culture plate containing 600 μl of medium alone, as control, or medium plus 50 ng/ml human recombinant VEGF or 50 ng/ml HRG in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml anti-VEGF antibody, 100 nm Herceptin, or control IgG. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, nonmigrating cells were scraped off, and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter inserts were fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Six randomly selected fields on each filter were then counted. To test the invasion behavior of HRG-treated MDA-MB435 cells, 8-μm filters were coated with Matrigel (20 μg/filter). The coated filters were placed in the Boyden chambers. Cells (105) suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to the upper chamber. Conditioned medium from mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells was used as a source of chemoattractant and was placed in the lower compartment of the Boyden chambers. After 24 h of incubation, the invaded cells are counted as described above. Angiogenesis was assayed in terms of the growth of blood vessels from subcutaneous tissue into a solid gel of reconstituted basement membrane (i.e. Matrigel) containing the test sample as described (28Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kourbali Y. Rath A.M. Vassy R. Martin A. Jozefonvicz J. Soria C. Lu H. Crepin M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 507-510PubMed Google Scholar). Matrigel rapidly solidified at body temperature, thereby trapping the factor, assuring its slow release, and prolonging exposure of surrounding tissues to it. After 2 weeks, mice were killed, and Matrigel plugs were photographed. A breeding pair of HRG transgenic mice was kindly provided by Dr. Philip Leder (29Krane I.M. Leder P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1781-1788PubMed Google Scholar). Genotype of the animals was confirmed by Southern blotting of tail DNA. Animal breeding and maintenance was performed according to IACUC guidelines. Approximately 50% of the transgenic offspring showed hyperplasia of the harderian gland as reported earlier (29Krane I.M. Leder P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1781-1788PubMed Google Scholar). The hyperplastic harderian gland from transgenic lines and normal harderian gland from wild type animals was dissected and processed for RNA extraction using the TRIZOL method. Expression of HRG was analyzed by RT-PCR. HRG primers were as follows: forward, 5′-ATGTCTGAGCGCAAA GAAGGCAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGCTGATCACTTTGCACATATAC-3′. Expression of VEGF was analyzed by RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting. VEGF primers were: forward, 3′-CGCGGATCCAGGAGTACCCTGATGAG-5′; reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCACATTTGTTGTGCTGT-3′. Sections of the harderian glands were stained with CD34 monoclonal antibody (NeoMarkers, CA). CD34 is a differentiation antigen expressed by most endothelial cells in vivo; expression of CD34 has been shown to be up-regulated by endothelial cells during angiogenesis (30Fina J. Molgard M.V. Robertson D. Bradley N.J. Managhan P.D. Sutherland D.R. Baker M.A. Grueves M.F. Blood. 1990; 75: 2417-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ito A. Nomura S. Hirota S. Suda T. Kitamura Y. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 3% H202, washed in phosphate-buffered saline followed by preincubation with goat serum for 30 min, and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against CD34 (dilution 1:50) for 60 min. After three washes, the sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibodies for 10 min, washed, and incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase for 10 min before the addition of 3-amino-9-ethyl-cabazole. Meyer's hematoxylin was used for counter-staining. During an earlier study to characterize the nature of secreted proteins from HRG-stimulated [35S]methionine-labeled MCF-7 cells, we discovered that HRG enhanced the accumulation of several newly synthesized proteins in the conditioned medium, including a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa (Fig. 1 A, arrowhead). In the present study, we investigated whether this secreted 20-kDa protein is a VEGF. Immunoprecipitation of the conditioned medium from control (−) and HRG-stimulated (+) labeled MCF-7 with an anti-VEGF mAb revealed that HRG enhanced the secretion of a 20-kDa VEGF protein (Fig. 1 B, arrow). To understand the correlation between VEGF production and the invasiveness of cells, we examined the effect of HRG on the secretion of VEGF and the invasiveness of highly metastatic MDA-MB435 cell (15Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Consistent with the invasive nature, MDA-MB435 cells secreted higher levels of VEGF than did MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1 C) and were more invasive than MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 C, however, MDA-MB435 cells responded to HRG with further induction of a 20-kDa VEGF protein band similar to that of VEGF 165 and a weaker induction of a protein similar to VEGF 121 (32Wang D. Huang H-J.S. Kazlauskas A. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1464-1472PubMed Google Scholar). HRG treatment also promoted the ability of MDA-MB435 cells to invade through a porous membrane as measured by a Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 1 D). Quantitation of the VEGF in the conditioned medium using a very sensitive ELISA assay confirmed that HRG stimulation of MCF-7 cells tripled the level of VEGF protein over 24 h. The amount of VEGF protein secreted into the conditioned medium from MDA-MB435 cells was about four times higher than from MCF-7 cells, but HRG treatment further increased the level of secreted VEGF to a level 1.7 times the level of VEGF present in the conditioned medium of untreated control cells (Fig. 1 E). We performed a Northern blot analysis to determine whether the HRG-mediated increase in the level of expression of VEGF protein was accompanied by an increase in the level of expression of VEGF mRNA. VEGF mRNA level increased in response to HRG stimulation. HRG treatment continuously increased the steady-state levels of VEGF mRNA by 2–6-fold at 1–9 h after treatment (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of cultures with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, completely inhibited the HRG-mediated induction of VEGF mRNA (Fig. 2 B). To study translational regulation, we utilized cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide stabilized the levels of VEGF mRNA expression; treatment with HRG, however, superinduced the expression of VEGF mRNA (Fig. 2 B). Together, these results suggest that HRG regulate VEGF at a pretranslational level. To further confirm the role of HRG in the transcriptional regulation of the VEGF gene, cells were transiently transfected with a chimeric luciferase gene fused with the 5′ region of the VEGF promoter (26Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the activity of the promoter was assayed in the presence or absence of HRG. HRG treatment stimulated VEGF promoter activity in three breast cancer cell lines, all of which had normal levels of HER receptors (Fig. 3). The observed HRG-mediated up-regulation of VEGF promoter activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB435 cells was effectively suppressed by pretreating the cells with the anti-HER-2 mAb Herceptin, which inhibits the formation of HER-3/HER-2 interaction (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and with anti-HER-3 mAb, which competes with the HRG binding site on the HER-3 receptor (25Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Adam L. Bandyopadhyay D. Steinbach G. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 33Chen X. Levkowitz G. Tzabart E. Karunagaran D. Lavi S.

Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor mAb C255 was more effective than MCF-7 cells in blocking the stimulatory effect of HRG on the VEGF promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that C225 may also prevent HRG-induced interactions between HER-3 and HER-1 receptors. This idea is supported by results showing that anti-HER3 antibody (Ab3) was more inhibitory than Herceptin in MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 3 B) and because MDA-MB231 cells expressed significantly more HER-1 than is present on MCF-7 and MDA-MB435 cells (34Aguilar Z. Akita R.W. Finn R.S. Ramos B.L. Pegram M.D. Kabbinavar F.F. Pietras R.J. Pisacane P. Sliwkowski M.X. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6050-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent studies from this laboratory showed that Pak1 plays a role in HRG-mediated stimulation of leading edge formation and invasiveness of noninvasive breast cancer cells (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and in the maintenance of motile/invasive phenotypes of MDA-MB435 cells (15Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because the activation of Pak1 (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and VEGF (this study) expression are positively regulated by heregulin-β1 and because VEGF expression can be regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (22Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), a HRG-inducible kinase that is the upstream regulator of Pak1 (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Pak1 regulates VEGF expression and therefore explored the role of Pak1 in angiogenesis. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of the dominant-negative K299R Pak1 mutant (7Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chemoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) on HRG-induced activation of the VEGF promoter. Transient co-transfection of MCF-7 cells with pGL3-VEGF and kinase-dead K299R Pak1, but not with control vector, completely suppressed the ability of HRG to stimulate transcription from the VEGF reporter system (Fig. 4 A). To further validate the involvement of Pak1 signaling on the level of VEGF expression, we next used well characterized MDA-MB435 cells expressing either K299R Pak1 mutant (435-K16 and 435-K17 cells) or control vector (435-CMV cells) (15Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The 435-K17 cells represent a different clone with properties similar to 435-K16 cells. The inhibition of Pak1 signaling was accompanied by a significant reduction (50–60%) in the level VEGF promoter activity (Fig. 4 B) and VEGF mRNA expression (Fig. 4 C) and by a 35% reduction in secretion of VEGF protein in the conditioned medium (Fig. 4 D) compared with the levels in the control cells. The observed discrepancy between a significant reduction of VEGF mRNA level (60% compared with control cells) and a modest suppression of VEGF accumulation in the conditioned medium (35% compared with control cells) could be due to the possible detection of more than one isoform of VEGF using a radioimmunoassay kit. However, HRG treatment was not able to rescue or induce the observed reduction in the basal VEGF secretion, suggesting the possible requirement of a functional Pak1 pathway during HRG-mediated up-regulation of VEGF. To study the effect of dominant-active Pak1 on the expression of VEGF, we used MCF-7 clones expressing kinase-active T423 Pak1 under the control of an inducible tetracycline promoter (16Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Wang R-A. Mandal M. Nguyen D. Sahin A. Chernoff J. Hung M.-C. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36238-36244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As expected, expression of HA-tagged T423E-Pak1 increased Pak kinase activity compared with the level in vector control cells (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, the increased expression of kinase-active T423E Pak1 in MCF-7 cells was accompanied by increased VEGF promoter activity (Fig. 5 B) and enhanced secretion of VEGF protein in the conditioned medium, as determined by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled VEGF (Fig. 5 C) and the results of the ELISA assay (Fig. 5 D). Taken together, these results suggest that Pak1 signaling regulates the expression of VEGF and that Pak1 may be an important mediator of HRG regulation of VEGF expression. We tested the ability of HRG to stimulate angiogenesis in cells embedded in collagen gels. In the presence of HRG or VEGF, capillary sprouts originated from HMVEC-L spheroids embedded in collagen gels in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (Fig. 6 A). Inclusion of anti-HER-2 receptor mAb Herceptin or anti-VEGF mAb (but not control antibody; data not shown) suppressed sprouting of vascular endothelial cells in HRG-treated cultures (Fig. 6 A). Because basement membrane can stimulate differentiation, HUVEC were also plated onto a gel composed of reconstituted basement membrane proteins, to which HUVEC attach rapidly. After 24 h, elongated processes appeared in the control cells that had been cultured in the absence of serum. In contrast, the addition of HRG and VEGF to HUVEC promoted the formation of networks of branching and anastomosing cords of cells (commonly known as tube formations) (Fig. 6 B). This effect of HRG was significantly blocked by Herceptin or anti-VEGF mAb (Fig. 6 B) but not by the control antibody (data not shown). The effect of HRG on the migration of HUVEC and HMVEC-L was analyzed using the Boyden chamber assay. Endothelial cells migrated in response to a chemotatic gradient of VEGF and HRG. In this assay, HUVEC were more responsive to HRG than were HMVEC-L. As expected from Fig. 6,A and B, HRG tripled the migration rate of HUVEC and doubled that of HMVEC-L cells (Fig. 6 C). However, anti-VEGF mAb and Herceptin each suppressed HRG stimulation of cell migration (Fig. 6 C). The angiogenic activity of HRG was also tested in a murine angiogenesis model involving subcutaneous injection of Matrigel and HRG. Matrigel rapidly solidified at body temperature, thereby trapping the factor, assuring its slow release, and prolonging exposure of surrounding tissues to it. Two weeks after injection, the Matrigel plugs and the surrounding tissues were histologically examined. In these studies, we used basic fibroblast growth factor as a positive control. On gross examination, the control plugs appeared white; plugs containing HRG appeared bright red, and many contained superficial blood vessels; the effect of HRG on angiogenesis was confirmed by hematoxylin-eosin staining of frozen sections from matrigel plugs (Fig. 7 A). These HRG effects were undetectable in plugs containing HRG and anti-VEGF antibody (data not shown). Together, these results suggested that HRG is a very potent angiogenic factor and that VEGF may mediate the angiogenic effects of HRG. In this context, Russell et al. (11Russell K.S. Stern D.F. Polverini P.J. Bender J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2205-H2211PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown that a distinct isoform of heregulin-β3 can also induce angiogenesis. However, anti-VEGF Ab did not inhibit the effects of heregulin-β3 on HUVEC (from a donor), suggesting the existence of biological differences between the heregulin-β1 and -β3 gene products of the two distinct gene (35Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S-Y. Lu H.S. Hu S.H. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To evaluate the HRG modulation of Pak1 activity and angiogenesis in vivo, we used an murine mammary tumor virus-driven HRG transgenic model that develops mammary adenocarcinomas and harderian tumors (29Krane I.M. Leder P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1781-1788PubMed Google Scholar). Because harderian tumors can usually be detected by 3 weeks of age as opposed to the 12–16 months required for detection of mammary gland tumors, we used the harderian tumors to establish the proof-of-principle of our hypothesis of HRG regulation of angiogenesis in vivo. Harderian glands from wild type (WT) and HRG-transgenic (HRG-TG) mice were analyzed by RT-PCR for the expression of HRG and by RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting for VEGF. HRG-transgenic mice have significantly elevated levels of HRG transcript compared with wild type mice (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, overexpression of HRG in harderian tumors was accompanied by increased Pak1 kinase activity (Fig. 7 D) as well as VEGF expression (Fig. 7 C). Furthermore, we also discovered a significant increase in angiogenesis as determined by immunostaining with CD34 antigen (a specific angiogenic marker, Refs. 30Fina J. Molgard M.V. Robertson D.

Invest. 1995; 72: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar; shown by brown stain) in the harderian gland tumors as compared with wild type tissues (Fig. 7 E). Together, these results imply a close relationship among the expression of HRG, Pak1 activity, VEGF expression and angiogenesis in vivo. In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that: 1) HRG regulates the expression and secretion of VEGF from breast epithelial cancer cells; 2) Pak1 signaling is an important regulator of VEGF expression and functions; 3) HRG stimulates angiogenesis; and 4) VEGF may play a role in the angiogenic effects of HRG on endothelial cells. These data provide evidence that up-regulation of the VEGF pathway in breast cancer epithelial cells by HRG, which is secreted from mesenchymal cells, may have functional implications for the enhancement of invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Any potential up-regulation of VEGF by HRG in breast cancer epithelial cells is likely to sustain and perhaps further promote the ability of tumor cells to survive and metastasize by supporting neovascularization. In addition, because HRG is a potent angiogenic factor (this study) and receptors for HRG are also present on endothelial cells (11Russell K.S. Stern D.F. Polverini P.J. Bender J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2205-H2211PubMed Google Scholar), we propose a model in which HRG interacts with both mammary epithelial tumor cells and endothelial cells and in which induced secretion of VEGF from tumor cells may further amplify the angiogenic responses of endothelial cells to HRG.

These include the following: 1) examining the sufficiency of GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 to mediate irreversible cell adhesion on immobilized von Willebrand factor (vWf) under flow; 2) the ability of the vWf-GPIb interaction to induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation independent of endogenous platelet stimuli; and 3) the identification of key second messengers linking the vWf-GPIb/IX interaction to integrin αIIbβ3 activation. By using Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3, we demonstrate that these receptors are both necessary and sufficient to mediate irreversible cell adhesion under flow, wherein GPIb/IX mediates cell tethering and rolling on immobilized vWf, and integrin αIIbβ3mediates cell arrest. Moreover, we demonstrate direct signaling between GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3. Studies on human platelets demonstrated that vWf binding to GPIb/IX is able to induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation independent of endogenous platelet stimuli under both static and physiological flow conditions (150–1800 s−1). Analysis of the key second messengers linking the vWf-GPIb interaction to integrin αIIbβ3 activation demonstrated that the first step in the activation process involves calcium release from internal stores, whereas transmembrane calcium influx is a secondary event potentiating integrin αIIbβ3 activation.

For circulating cells such as platelets and leukocytes, integrins play an indispensable role in anchoring these cells to the luminal surface of blood vessels at sites of vascular injury and inflammation. However, a limitation of integrin function is their relative inefficiency at forming adhesion contacts under conditions of blood flow. This has been most clearly demonstrated from studies of leukocyte adhesion to post-capillary venules, in which the formation of integrin adhesion contacts requires an initial cell-tethering step dependent on one or more selectin family members (3Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar, 4Ley K. Gaehtgens P. Fennie C. Singer M.S. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D.

Sci. 1991; 88: 7538-7542Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). There is now strong evidence that platelets also utilize a multistep adhesion mechanism, involving glycoprotein (GP)1 Ib/IX and one or more surface integrins, to mediate stable adhesion at sites of vascular injury (6Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 7Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Platelet tethering involves the binding of the GPIb/IX complex to subendothelial von Willebrand factor (vWf). This multivalent adhesive interaction is unique in that it can tether platelets at high shear stresses (6Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), a key requirement for the ability of platelets to secure hemostasis throughout the arterial circulation. vWf binding to GPIb/IX also induces platelet activation, converting the major platelet integrin, αIIbβ3, from a low affinity to a high affinity receptor capable of engaging the C1 domain of vWf (8De Marco L. Girolami A. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Gralnick H.R. Williams S.B. Collerm B.S. J. Clin.

This latter adhesive interaction is essential for stable platelet adhesion on vWf and also for subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization leading to platelet spreading (11Savage B. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11227-11233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major unresolved issue is the mechanism by which the vWf-GPIb interaction induces activation of integrin αIIbβ3 under physiological flow conditions. In particular, it is unclear whether GPIb/IX induces integrin αIIbβ3 activation directly, through the generation of intracellular second messengers, or involves an indirect pathway dependent on the release of ADP and/or the generation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Evidence favoring the latter mechanism has been suggested from studies of shear-induced platelet aggregation using a cone-and-plate viscometer (13Moritz M.W. Reimers R.C. Baker R.K. Sutera S.P. Joist J.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 101: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar, 14Moake J.L. Turner N.A. Stathopoulos N.A. Nolasco L. Hellums J.D. Blood. 1988; 71: 1366-1374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which the exposure of platelets in suspension to pathological levels of shear induces platelet activation in an ADP-dependent manner. According to this model (Fig. 1), shear-induced binding of soluble vWf to GPIb induces transmembrane calcium influx through an unidentified surface channel functionally linked to the GPIb/IX complex. The subsequent rise in intracellular calcium promotes secretion of dense granule ADP, which in turn engages one or more purinergic receptors (15MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Snith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus under pathological levels of shear, the vWf-GPIb interaction has been postulated to induce integrin αIIbβ3activation by an indirect mechanism critically dependent on transmembrane calcium influx and the release of ADP.Figure 1Proposed model for vWf-induced integrin αIIbβ3activation under pathological shear conditions. Exposure of platelets in suspension to pathological levels of shear using a cone-and-plate viscometer induces platelet aggregation via a process dependent on GPIb/IX, integrin αIIbβ3, vWf, extracellular calcium, and ADP (33Ikeda Y.

The schematic model demonstrates shear-induced binding of soluble vWf to GPIb leading to transmembrane calcium influx through an unidentified surface channel functionally linked to the GPIb/IX complex (33Ikeda Y.

This model suggests that under pathological shear conditions, the vWf-GPIb interaction induces integrin αIIbβ3 activation via an indirect signaling mechanism. The bottom left panel schematically depicts platelet aggregates forming in a cone-and-plate viscometer. Thebottom right panel highlights the critical role of vWf multimers in mediating platelet aggregation through interaction with GPIb/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3. Thetop panel demonstrates the signaling processes linking the vWf-GPIb interaction to integrin αIIbβ3activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mechanism by which platelets become activated on an immobilized vWf matrix under physiological flow conditions has been less clearly defined. This is a potentially important issue given the critical role played by vWf in promoting platelet-vessel wall and platelet-platelet adhesion contacts under flow. A recent study by Kuwahara et al. (20Kuwahara M. Sugimoto M. Tsuji S. Miyata S. Yoshioka A. Blood. 1999; 94: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has raised the interesting possibility that integrin αIIbβ3 activation on the surface of platelets adhering to immobilized vWf occurs in a calcium-independent manner. In their studies, adhesion of platelets to vWf under physiological flow conditions was not associated with detectable changes in the cytosolic concentration of calcium, and furthermore, chelating intracellular calcium did not inhibit integrin αIIbβ3-dependent stationary platelet adhesion. Several other reports have begun to challenge the hypothesis that calcium influx is indispensable for GPIb/IX-dependent signaling. For example, Francesconiet al. (21Francesconi M.A. Deana R. Girolami A. Pontara E. Casonato A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Francesconi M. Casonato A. Pontara E. Via L.D. Girolami A. Deana R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) failed to detect transmembrane calcium influx following vWf binding to GPIb/IX. Moreover, Kermode et al. (23Kermode J.C. Zheng Q. Cook E.P. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1996; 22: 238-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have suggested that previously observed changes in cytosolic calcium initiated by vWf binding to GPIb/IX may be artifactual, resulting from extrusion of the indicator dyes from loaded platelets. Our recent studies also do not support an indispensable role for calcium influx in GPIb/IX-dependent signaling, as pretreating platelets or GPIb/IX-transfected CHO cells with extracellular calcium chelators did not prevent GPIb/IX-induced cytoskeletal remodeling (24Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reason for the apparent discrepancies between different studies in terms of GPIb/IX signaling is not immediately evident but may reflect methodological differences that influence the platelet activation process. For example, studies in a cone-and-plate viscometer primarily examine the effects of pathological levels of shear on the formation of platelet-platelet adhesion contacts (aggregation) in suspension, whereas studies in flow chambers principally examine platelet adhesion onto reactive protein surfaces. In this study we have examined several aspects of the adhesive and signaling relationship operating between GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 using an in vitroflow-based adhesion assay. First, we have examined whether vWf engagement of GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3is sufficient to mediate irreversible cell adhesion under flow. Second, we have examined whether the vWf-GPIb interaction can transduce signals directly to regulate the ligand binding status of integrin αIIbβ3. Third, we have examined whether there is a second messenger role for calcium in linking the vWf-GPIb interaction to integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Our studies indicate that the sequential binding of vWf to GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 is sufficient to mediate irreversible cell adhesion under flow and that GPIb/IX can transduce signals directly to regulate the ligand binding function of integrin αIIbβ3. In addition, we have demonstrated that intracellular calcium mobilization and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) are two key signaling events linking the vWf-GPIb interaction to integrin αIIbβ3 activation over the full range of shear forces experienced by platelets in vivo.

The pZeoSV vector and ZeocinTM were from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Whole blood (anticoagulated with 15 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.4) was collected from healthy volunteers who had not received any anti-platelet medication in the preceding 2 weeks. Washed platelets were prepared as described previously (29Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and/or 1 mmMgCl2 where indicated. Autologous red blood cells were obtained by an initial centrifugation of anticoagulated whole blood at 200 × g for 30 min. The platelet-rich plasma was removed, and the red blood cells were pelleted by further centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. The red blood cells were washed three times with washing buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose) prior to reconstitution with washed platelets (50% (v/v) autologous packed red blood cells), in the presence of 0.4 units/ml apyrase (ADPase activity). The concentrations of apyrase, ATPαS, AR-C69931MX, and A3P5PS required to inhibit completely the platelet-activating effects of exogenous ADP (10 μm) were determined by monitoring the presence of platelet aggregates and/or platelet shape change in washed platelets. Platelet aggregation in whole blood, or washed platelets reconstituted with red blood cells, was determined by reduction in single platelet count (Cell-Dyn, Abbott). Similarly, the concentration of aspirin required to inhibit the effects of arachidonic acid (1.5 mm) was determined by monitoring platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma or by the reduction in single platelet count in whole blood. Transfection of CHO.K1 cells with GPIb/IX (CHO-Ib/IX) and/or integrin αIIbβ3was performed as described previously using calcium phosphate precipitation (30Cranmer S.L. Ulsemer P. Cooke B.M.

Cells were placed under selection pressure after 48 h using 500 μg/ml Zeocin, and clones were screened for GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 expression by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) using the the anti-GPIbα mAb, AK2, or the complex-specific anti-αIIbβ3 antibody, P2. Cells expressing both GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 were designated CHO-Ib/IX-αIIbβ3. Control cells transfected with pDX alone were designated CHO-pDX. Static adhesion assays were performed using a modified method of Yuan et al. (29Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass coverslips were coated with HvWf (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Platelets were allowed to adhere and spread on the matrix for 30–60 min unless otherwise indicated and visualized using phase contrast microscopy or differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Images were captured, and the surface area of adherent platelets was determined using MCIDTM software (Imaging Research Inc., Canada). The increase in surface area of spreading platelets was expressed in pixels following subtraction of the surface area of resting platelets. Flow assays were performed using glass microcapillary tubes (Microslides, Vitro Dynamics Inc., NJ) coated with BvWF (10 μg/ml) or HvWf (100 μg/ml), according to a modified method of Cooke et al. (31Cooke B.M. Usami S. Perry I. Nash G.B. Microvasc. Res. 1993; 45: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For studies using platelets reconstituted with red blood cells, microcapillary tubes were blocked with 10–25% heat-inactivated human serum. Citrate or heparin-anticoagulated whole blood or washed platelets reconstituted with red blood cells were perfused through HvWf-coated microcapillary tubes at shear rates of 150, 600, or 1800 s−1 for up to 5 min. Platelet adhesion was visualized in real time using DIC microscopy (DMIRB Leica microscope), and the first 2 min of flow was video-recorded for off-line analysis. In the indicated experiments, citrated whole blood was incubated with apyrase (8.25 units/ml) alone or in combination with aspirin (1 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. In other studies, platelets were pretreated with ATPαS (100 μm) or AR-C69931MX with A3P5PS (100 nm and 200 μm, respectively) for 10 min. Alternatively, washed platelets were incubated with EGTA/Mg2+ (1 mm each), EGTA-AM (50 μm), BIM (0.2–0.5 μm), or with calphostin C (1 μm) for 30 min at 22 °C, prior to reconstitution with red blood cells. For CHO cell flow adhesion studies, CHO-Ib/IX and CHO-Ib/IX-αIIbβ3 cells (resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (1 × 106/ml)) were perfused through BvWf-coated (10 μg/ml) microcapillary tubes at a shear rate of 150 s−1 for 5 min. Tethered cells were subsequently exposed to incremental increases in shear (every 60 s) from 150 to 750, 3000, and 6000 s−1. Adherent cells were visualized using phase-contrast microscopy (IX70, Olympus, Japan), and images were video-recorded at each shear rate for off-line analysis. In the indicated experiments, CHO-Ib/IX and/or CHO-Ib/IX-αIIbβ3 cells were pretreated with either the anti-GPIbα mAb, AK2 (5 μg/ml), the anti-β3mAb, c7E3 Fab (20 μg/ml), the anti-αvβ3mAb, LM609 (2 μg/ml), or the non-peptide antagonist of integrin αIIbβ3, Aggrastat (200 nm), for 15 min prior to performing flow assays. In all studies, any cell forming an adhesion contact with immobilized vWf for greater than 40 ms was scored as a tethered cell. Stationary adhesion was defined as cells not moving more than a single cell diameter over a 10-s period for platelets and within a 30-s period for transfected CHO cells. In static adhesion assays, washed platelets were allowed to adhere to HvWf-coated coverslips in the presence of PAC-1 (1 μg/ml). In flow adhesion assays, washed platelets reconstituted with red blood cells were perfused through microcapillary tubes for 5 min prior to the perfusion of PAC-1 (1 μg/ml) over adherent platelets for 15 min. Adherent platelets were fixed, incubated with a FITC-conjugated α-IgM antibody, and visualized using confocal microscopy (Leica TCS NT, Netherlands). Fluorescence was quantified by integrated pixel intensity determination (Leica TCS NT software). Washed platelets (1.5 × 109/ml) resuspended in platelet wash buffer (PWB) were incubated with the calcium indicator dyes, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM (1 μm), and Fura Red, AM (1.25 μm), for 30 min at 37 °C. The platelets were washed twice with platelet wash buffer, resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing either extracellular calcium (1 mm) or EGTA/Mg2+ (1 mmeach), and if indicated, incubated with DM-BAPTA, AM (70 μm). Changes in cytosolic calcium concentration were associated with increased or decreased fluorescence emission of Oregon Green and Fura Red, respectively (emission wavelengths of 500–570 nm for Oregon Green and 600–710 nm for Fura Red). These changes were analyzed by confocal microscopy and based on a ratio signal intensity in the Oregon Green and Fura Red channels. Fluorescence ratios were then converted to calcium concentration units according to Equation1, [Ca2+]=170×(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)×(Fmax/Fmin)Equation 1 where 170 = Kd of Oregon Green Ca2+ binding; R = fluorescence ratio;Rmax and Rmin represent the fluorescence ratio of platelets that have been incubated with 50 μmA23187 + 10 mm Ca2+ or 70 μm DM-BAPTA, AM, + 2 mm EGTA, respectively;Fmin and Fmax represent the Oregon Green fluorescence of Rmax andRmin. The calcium concentrations for minimal and maximal calcium fluorescence ratios are calculated based on established methods, and the values obtained are in close agreement with that previously published (20Kuwahara M.

Basal cytosolic calcium concentrations were determined in platelets in suspension and compared with calcium levels obtained in platelets adherent to HvWf under static or flow conditions. For population analysis of the calcium response in platelets adherent to a vWf matrix under static conditions, the cytosolic calcium concentration was determined over a 37.5-s time interval, 10 min after adhesion. The calcium concentration in pulsing platelets was determined using MCIDTM software (Imaging Research Inc., Canada) at 7-s intervals over the 37.5-s period. For single cell analysis, the calcium dynamics in individual platelets was monitored every 0.586 s over a 37.5-s time interval (Leica TCS NT software). Under flow conditions, the frequency of a calcium “event” (where event is defined as the recording of a particular calcium concentration) was determined at 7-s intervals over a 37.5-s period. Significant differences were detected using Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance, using the Prism software package (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). The necessity of GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3 for irreversible platelet adhesion on vWf has been clearly established through the use of specific inhibitors against either receptor (6Savage B.

However, it has yet to be established definitively that these two receptors are sufficient to mediate irreversible cell adhesion under flow, independent of other platelet adhesion receptors or endogenous stimuli. To investigate this possibility, we performed studies on CHO cells co-transfected with GPIb/IX and integrin αIIbβ3. We chose this cell line as it does not express GPIb/IX or integrin αIIbβ3, does not contain storage granules for ADP or other activating stimuli, or generate TXA2 following cell stimulation. We have recently demonstrated that CHO cells transfected with the GPIb/IX complex are able to tether and translocate on a vWf matrix but are unable to form irreversible adhesio"

The results suggest that both the α-1 repeat and a region encompassing the α-2 repeat and its immediately C-terminal segment contain reentrant loop domains, each oriented in an opposite direction with respect to the membrane. We found that single or multiple mutations of six residues including Asn-125 and conserved aspartates Asp-130, Asp-825, and Asp-829 in the α repeat reentrant domains reduce the apparent affinity of the exchanger for extracellular Ca2+ by up to 6-fold. In contrast, the triple cysteine mutation D130C/D825C/D829C did not influence the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of the exchange current. Cysteine accessibility scanning with different thiol modifiers suggested that N125C, D130C, and D825C may be located in a restricted aqueous space in the membrane accessible only to ions when examined with external probes, although N125C and D825C were previously shown to be internally accessible during exchange reaction.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3973-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), internal repeat sequences designated as the α-1 and α-2 repeats, which are presumably the product of intragenic duplication, are located in the N- and C-terminal halves of the membrane domain, respectively (12Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have revealed that three amino acid residues in the putative loop regions of α-1 and α-2 repeats (Asn-125, Thr-127, and Val-820 in the case of NCX1) are responsible for the differential sensitivity of the exchanger isoforms NCX1 and NCX3 to inhibition by Ni2+, a competitive inhibitor for the transport substrate Ca2+o (13Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Nakamura T.Y. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23094-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of one of these residues (Asn-125 to Cys) caused a reduction in the apparent Ca2+o affinity of NCX1 (14Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Nakamura T.Y. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23094-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutation of some acidic or hydroxyl-containing amino acid residues within the putative transmembrane segments of the α repeats resulted in loss or a large reduction in the exchange activity or a change in the I-V relationship (15Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These results suggest that both the α-1 and α-2 repeats may be involved in ion translocation in the exchanger. We recently examined the topology of the α repeat regions of NCX1 by substituted cysteine susceptibility analysis using the thiol-specific, membrane-impermeable reagent MTSET (16Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) as a probe (6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed unique topology of the α-1 and α-2 repeats: the loop connecting the putative TM2 and TM3 in the α-1 repeat forms a reentrant membrane loop, with both ends facing the extracellular side; whereas the α-2 repeat, except for its N-terminal segment (a portion of TM7), forms a domain accessible primarily from the cytoplasmic side. In this study, using the same approach with several other thiol modifiers as probes, we have further investigated the topological disposition of amino acid residues in the α repeats and the C-terminal neighboring region of the α-2 repeat in NCX1. In addition, we have evaluated the functional importance of residues in the putative loops of α repeats by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. We have obtained evidence that the α-2 repeat and its immediate C-terminal region, like the α-1 repeat, contain a reentrant loop structure and that highly conserved aspartic acids localized in these reentrant structures of α repeats influence the apparent Ca2+o affinity of NCX1. 3-(N-Maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (biotin maleimide) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. MTSET and MTSEA were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals. Streptavidin-conjugated agarose was from Vector Laboratories. NEM, SLO, ouabain, monensin, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma Chemical Co. Lipofectin was from Life Technologies, Inc. The ECL detection system was purchased from Amersham Corp. The NCX1-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody used in this study has been described previously (9Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Nakamura T.Y. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17230-17238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. CCL39 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and their NCX transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. cDNA of dog NCX1.1 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pKCRH using SacII-HindIII sites (designated pKCRH-NCX1) (17Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Substitution of each amino acid residue by cysteine was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Nakamura T.Y. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23094-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, two DNA fragments were produced by PCR using Pfu polymerase and two pairs of outer and inner primers, with inner primers containing an overlapping sequence with the same desired mutation. The final PCR products were generated with these DNA fragments as templates, using two outer primers. After digestion with restriction enzymes, the final PCR products were inserted into pKCRH-NCX1. Successful construction was verified by sequencing (ABI PRISM; Perkin-Elmer). pKCRH plasmids were transfected into CCL39 cells using Lipofectin, and stable cell clones exhibiting high Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity were selected by ionomycin treatment (Ca2+ killing) (18Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the construction of cDNA for CL-N1, we synthesized the oligonucleotide sense and antisense primers in which nucleotides corresponding to endogenous cysteines were changed to those for serine or alanine at the following positions: C14S/C20S/C122A/C151S/C210S/C383S/C387S/C485S/C557S/C730S/C738S/C768S/C792S/C914S/C933S. Using these mutant primers and the appropriate external primers, the DNA fragments were generated by PCR, digested, and inserted into appropriate sites of the NCX1 construct. Furthermore, we introduced single cysteine residues into this cysteine-less NCX1 using a similar PCR-based method. For cell Na+ loading, confluent cells in 24-well dishes were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of BSS (10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 146 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 1 mm ouabain and 10 μm monensin. During the last 5 (for MTSEA) or 10 min (for other thiol modifiers) of Na+ loading, cells were treated with 5 mm MTSEA or NEM, 0.5 mm ZnCl2, or 0.1 mmHgCl2 and then washed three times with BSS containing 1 mm ouabain. The rate of 45Ca2+uptake by these cells was then measured for 30 s at 37 °C in Na+-free BSS (replacing NaCl with equimolar choline chloride) or in normal BSS, both of which contained45CaCl2 (1.5 μCi/ml) and 1 mmouabain (13Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylation of exchangers was performed as described previously (19Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells on a 60-mm dish were washed with ice-cold PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2)) and incubated with 0 or 5 mm MTSET in PBSCM for 15 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated with 0.5 mm biotin maleimide in PBSCM for 30 min at room temperature. All subsequent steps were performed on ice. After washing with PBSCM containing 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and then washing with PBSCM, cell monolayers were scraped, suspended, and collected in the tube by centrifugation. Cells were solubilized in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated for 1 h with streptavidin-agarose beads. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and then proteins were eluted from resins by boiling in Laemmli's buffer. The eluted samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% gel and then to immunoblot analysis with an anti-NCX1 polyclonal antibody. The blots were visualized using anti-rabbit secondary antibody and the ECL detection system. In some experiments, cells were permeabilized with SLO immediately before the biotinylation. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min in 1 ml of SLO buffer (25 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 115 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 units/ml SLO). After washing with ice-cold SLO buffer, cells were incubated with prewarmed SLO buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing, cells were subjected to biotinylation as described above. Ni2+-sensitive exchange currents were measured using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique as described previously (20Uehara A. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Imanaga I. Pflügers Arch.-Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 335-338PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the apparent affinity for Na+o (Km(Na)), the inward exchange current was evoked by changing Na+-free, choline chloride-containing medium to Na+-containing medium containing 8–140 mm NaCl (NaCl plus choline chloride maintained at 140 mm) exactly as described previously (14Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Nakamura T.Y. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23094-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The I-V relation of the exchange current was measured using the following solutions: (i) bath solution, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0 or 5 mm NiCl2, 2 mmBaCl2, 20 μm ouabain, 2 μmnicardipine, 10 μm ryanodine, and 5 mmHepes/Tris (pH 7.2), and (ii) pipettes solution, 10 mmNaCl, 120 mm CsOH, 100 mm aspartic acid, 3 mm MgCl2, 8.6 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 5 mm potassium creatine phosphate, 20 mm1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, and 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.2) (calculated ionized Ca2+ concentration, 0.15 μm). All experiments were performed at the holding potential of −40 mV and at about 35 °C. All data were acquired and analyzed by the pCLAMP (Axon Instrument) software. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (17Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three to seven independent determinations. Differences for multiple comparisons were analyzed by unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test. Values ofp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We examined the topologies of the α-1 and α-2 repeats and the immediately C-terminal region of the latter in wild-type NCX1 as well as in CL-N1 by substituted cysteine susceptibility analysis with several thiol-reactive reagents as probes. The wild-type NCX1 and CL-N1 transfectants had very similar values for apparent affinity for the external transport substrate Ca2+o(Km(Ca)) (0.19 ± 0.02 and 0.18 ± 0.03 mm (n = 3), respectively) and the rate of Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake measured in the saturating Ca2+o concentrations (Vmax) (20 ± 1.7 and 17 ± 1.5 nmol/mg/30 s (n = 3)). Thus, it appeared that CL-N1 has basic transport properties similar to those of the wild type. We used 44 and 17 functional cysteine-substituted mutants of the wild-type NCX1 and CL-N1, respectively (see Figs. 1 and 2). However, many cysteine substitutions in the wild-type NCX1 (positions 110, 113, 114, 131, 132, 138, 139, 143, 814, 816, 820, 844, 846, and 848) and CL-N1 (positions 120, 128, 136, 812, 822, 828, and 855) did not yield functional exchangers. We also mutated residues at these positions to other amino acids such as alanine, but again, many of these mutants were not functional. 2T. Iwamoto and M. Shigekawa, unpublished observations. Thus, data are not available on the accessibility of these nonfunctional residues.Figure 2Biotinylation of cysteine-less NCX1 or its single cysteine mutants. CCL39 cells expressing wild-type NCX1 (WT-N1), CL-N1, or the indicated single cysteine mutants of CL-N1 were labeled with biotin maleimide with or without pretreatment with external 5 mm MTSET (A) or with or without SLO pretreatment to permeabilize the plasma membrane (B andC). The labeled cells were solubilized, and biotinylated exchanger protein was recovered and then visualized by immunoblot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”D, the crude membrane fractions (10 μg) from cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the exchanger protein was visualized by immunoblot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We treated cells expressing each cysteine mutant for 5–10 min with either MTS reagents, NEM, Zn2+, or Hg2+ applied externally, washed them three times with buffer, and then measured the percentage of change in the rate of Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake under standard conditions. We thus evaluated the accessibility of residues by detecting a change in exchange activity that was assumed to be caused by reaction of the substituted cysteine with each thiol-reactive reagent. Therefore, the lack of a change in exchange activity does not necessarily indicate the lack of a reaction (see “Discussion”). We found that, like MTSET (10 mm), neither MTSEA (5 mm), NEM (5 mm), nor Zn2+ (0.5 mm) influenced the activity of wild-type NCX1 (Fig. 1 A; see Ref. 6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar for MTSET data), despite the fact that the mature NCX1 protein contains 15 endogenous cysteine residues. An absence of the effect of externally applied NEM or MTSET on the activity of wild-type NCX1 was also reported by others (5Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 21Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, 0.1 mm Hg2+ caused a 50% reduction in the activity of wild-type NCX1, suggesting that the ion, which binds to a cysteinyl side chain of protein in a covalent manner (22Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), modified functionally important endogenous cysteine(s) inaccessible to NEM or MTS reagents. We used CL-N1 when Hg2+ was used as a probe, because its activity was not affected by this ion (Fig. 1 D). Externally applied MTSEA (5 mm) inhibited the activities of seven cysteine mutants in the α-1 repeat, and its accessibility pattern was the same as that seen with 10 mm externally applied MTSET, except that one mutant (H124C) exhibited an enhanced activity with MTSEA (Fig. 1 A; see Ref. 6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The effect of NEM on α-1 repeat mutants was somewhat different from those obtained with external MTS reagents in that of the above-mentioned seven cysteine mutants, NEM inhibited V121C but did not affect G129C and S134C. On the other hand, the accessibility patterns of external MTSEA or NEM at 5 mm for the α-2 repeat and its immediately C-terminal region were significantly different from those obtained with external MTSET; MTSEA inhibited the activities of N842C and I847C, whereas NEM inhibited the activities of S818C, K819C, A821C, A822C, A828C, S831C, G833C, V835C, G837C, A850C, and G870C (Fig. 1 A), although none of cysteine mutants of these regions was affected by MTSET (data not shown; see Ref. 6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar for mutants other than A822C, T823C, Q826C, A828C, D829C, S831C, I847C, and A850C). The observed inhibition by the membrane-permeable NEM of mutants of the α-2 repeat and its immediately C-terminal region is consistent with our previous finding that many residues in these regions were accessible from the cytoplasmic side (6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We examined the sidedness of the effect of MTSEA on N842C. For this, we compared the accessibility of this mutant to external MTSEA with those of G123C and A128C, which were shown to be accessible to external but not internal MTSET (6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We found that the MTSEA concentration dependence of inhibition of exchange activity and the rate of modification of cysteine by this reagent were very similar in all these mutants (Fig. 1, B and C). The rate of modification was slow in these mutants (≤ 20m−1 s−1), suggesting restricted accessibility of these cysteines to external MTSEA. On the other hand, V155C, W763C, S818C, A821C, and G833C, all of which were accessible to internal but not external MTSET (6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), retained 90–99% and 85–102% of their activities even after treatment with 5 mm external MTSEA for 5 and 30 min, respectively, under the conditions described for Fig. 1 C. However, when one of these mutants (W763C) was treated with a higher concentration (10 mm) of external MTSEA for 30 min, its activity decreased to 55 ± 1.8% (n = 3) of the control (p < 0.05 versus control), although other mutants were not significantly affected. All these results strongly suggest that external MTSEA did not modify internal cysteines under the conditions used. N842C and I847C are thus likely to be accessible to MTSEA from the external side. External transition metal ions produced accessibility patterns distinct from those obtained with external MTS reagents or NEM (Fig. 1 A; see Ref. 6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar for MTSET data). Zn2+ at 0.5 mm inhibited the activities of α-1 repeat mutants N125C, F126C, A128C, G129C, and D130C and of α-2 repeat mutant D825C. Of these mutants, N125C, F126C, D130C, and D825C were not inhibited by MTS reagents or NEM. We obtained essentially the same results from similar experiments using 0.5 mm Cd2+ (data not shown) or 0.1 mm Hg2+ (Fig. 1 D). For the latter experiment, we used five α-1 and five α-2 repeat mutants prepared from CL-N1. We observed that Hg2+reduced the activities of N125C, G129C, D130C, and D825C, but it did not influence the activity of parental CL-N1 (Fig. 1 D). The results suggest that accessibility of these α-1 and α-2 repeat mutants depends significantly on the size of the probe used and that D825C of the α-2 repeat is accessible to small ions from the external side. To obtain more direct information on the topological disposition of the α-1 and α-2 repeats and the C-terminal neighboring region of the latter, we introduced single cysteines at some positions in these regions of CL-N1 and examined their reactivity toward external or internal biotin maleimide (Fig. 2). The biotinylated exchanger protein was isolated with streptavidin-agarose beads and visualized with anti-NCX1 antibody after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We observed that 0.5 mm external biotin maleimide minimally labeled the CL-N1 protein in the presence or absence of external MTSET (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, wild-type NCX1 was strongly biotinylated in the absence of external MTSET, whereas its labeling was minimal in the presence of external MTSET (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that in wild-type NCX1, certain endogenous cysteine(s) is accessible to biotin maleimide from the external side. These results are consistent with our previous observation (19Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that biotin maleimide is practically membrane-impermeable and highly cysteine-directed when used at low concentrations (0.5 mm). The α-1 repeat mutants S117C, G123C, G129C, and S134C were biotinylated in the absence but not in the presence of external MTSET (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, like the parental CL-N1, other α-1 repeat mutants (H124C, N125C, and T127C) were not significantly labeled before and after cell permeabilization with SLO (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, mutants of the α-2 repeat and its neighboring region (S818C, A821C, D825C, D829C, G833C, G837C, N842C, A850C, and Q864C) were not significantly biotinylated as compared with CL-N1 when transfectants had not been treated with SLO (Fig. 2 C,− SLO). However, S818C, A821C, G833C, G837C, and Q864C were biotinylated after treatment with SLO (Fig. 2 C,+ SLO), suggesting that these residues are accessible from the cytoplasmic side. The observed absence or low level of labeling of some mutants before and after SLO treatment (Fig. 2, B andC) did not appear to be due to reduced protein expression, because their expression levels as estimated by immunoblot analysis were comparable with that of the parental CL-N1 (Fig. 2 D). Thus these cysteine residues were not accessible to biotin maleimide from both sides of the membrane. Fig. 3 summarizes the data for the accessibility of residues in the α-1 and α-2 repeats and the immediate C-terminal region of the latter described in the preceding paragraphs and in our previous report (6Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The overall accessibility patterns for these two regions of the NCX1 molecule are consistent with the view that they contain reentrant membrane loop structures (see “Discussion”). We examined the effect of individual cysteine substitution on the transport function of NCX1. First, the apparent affinity (Km(Ca)) of cysteine mutants for the transport substrate Ca2+o was determined from the Eadie-Hofstee plot of the initial rate of Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake versusCa2+o concentration (see Fig. 4 A for typical plots). We found that these plots were linear for all mutants examined, which suggests the preservation of a single Ca2+ binding site in each mutant. Fig. 4 B summarizes the data obtained from such an analysis. The Km(Ca) was increased in six mutants (H124C, N125C, G129C, D130C, D825C, and D829C) by up to 4.4-fold as compared with wild-type NCX1 (TableI). Interestingly, of these six residues, Asp-130, Asp-825, and Asp-829 are highly conserved in mammalian NCX proteins and NCX homologues from other species, although Asp-130 is Glu in rat NCX2.Table IKinetic parameters determined from measurements of initial rates of Na+ i-dependent Ca2+ uptake and inward exchange currents in cells expressing wild-type NCX1 or α repeat NCX1 mutantsMutants45Ca2+uptakeInward currentKm(Ca)(mm)Vmax (nmol/mg/30 s)Ki(Ni)(μm)Km(Na)(mm)HillNCX10.19 ± 0.0220 ± 1.715 ± 0.9943 ± 2.11.9 ± 0.06N125C0.58 ± 0.05 1-ap < 0.05versus NCX1.23 ± 1.85.3 ± 0.78 1-ap < 0.05versus NCX1.57 ± 2.1 1-ap < 0.05versus NCX1.1.6 ± 0.08D130C0.84 ± 0.04 1-ap < 0.05versus NCX1.15 ± 1.11.8 ± 0.11 1-ap < 0.05versus NCX1.44 ± 2.51.8 ± 0.1"

It involves translocation of DNA into a preformed capsid shell and its organization into a condensate with a packing density equivalent to that estimated in a DNA crystal (1Earnshaw W. Casjens S. Cell. 1980; 21: 319-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the pathway for DNA-packaging, (i) a concatameric viral chromosome is first recognized, (ii) the DNA is cut and attached to the prohead shell through the unique portal vertex, (iii) one unit-length genome is translocated into the capsid shell followed by a second cut to terminate DNA translocation, and (iv) the DNA is organized into an ordered condensate (1Earnshaw W. Casjens S. Cell. 1980; 21: 319-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Feiss M. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Black L.W.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although the basic molecular mechanisms of DNA translocation and organization inside the capsid are still a mystery, genetic and biochemical studies implicate an ATP-driven DNA-packaging machine constituted by the capsid shell, the portal vertex, and two nonstructural packaging/terminase proteins attached to the portal, as the principal driving force (1Earnshaw W. Casjens S. Cell. 1980; 21: 319-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Feiss M. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Black L.W.

Recent biochemical studies with a number of double-stranded DNA phage packaging systems (λ, T3, T4, P1, and SPP1) revealed that the nonstructural terminase complex, constituted by one small subunit and one large subunit, is a key component of the DNA-packaging machine (3Black L.W. Calender R. The Bacteriophages. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 321-374Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, among the multiple biochemical functions and interactions that are required to catalyze the DNA-packaging process, the two key functions, (i) DNA cutting, which generates the termini of the packed DNA (hence, the name terminase), and (ii) ATP hydrolysis, which is evidently the driving force for translocation of DNA into the capsid shell, have been shown to be associated with the large terminase subunit (λ, gpA (4Catalano C.E. Cue D. Feiss M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Rubinchik S. Parris W. Gold M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); T3, gp19 (7Morita M. Tasaka M. Fujisawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). Genetic evidence also supports this implication. In phage T3, a mutation in one of the consensus ATP binding sites of the large terminase subunit gp19 resulted in partial uncoupling of the ATPase from DNA translocation (7Morita M. Tasaka M. Fujisawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In phage T4,ts mutations in g17 accumulated partially filled heads, suggesting a defective DNA translocation pathway (8Black L.W. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 1030-1052Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, certain mutants in phage λ large terminase subunit gpA were reported, which showed apparent defects in DNA translocation. 1M. Feiss, personal communication. However, despite much circumstantial evidence, a direct linkage between a biochemically defined ATPase and DNA translocation is yet to be established for any phage system. The phage T4 terminase, analogous to the other phage terminases, is constituted by a 70-kDa large subunit, gp17, and an 18-kDa small subunit, gp16 (9Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Powell D. Franklin J. Arisaka F. Mosig G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although these proteins have been purified and an in vitro DNA-packaging system has been constructed (9Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), not much is known about the biochemical functions associated with these proteins and their role in the DNA-packaging pathway. Of particular interest to us is the putative translocating ATPase, which has not yet been identified in any phage system. In this study we asked, do either (or both) of the terminase subunits exhibit an ATPase activity? If so, what are the biochemical characteristics of the ATPase? And, do these characteristics implicate a mechanistic relationship to DNA translocation? We report here the first biochemical characterization of the T4-packaging/terminase subunits with respect to the ATPase function. The data show that the large packaging subunit gp17 is the catalytic subunit exhibiting an ATPase activity, whereas the small subunit gp16 acts as an essential accessory subunit. We also discovered a novel feature associated with the small subunit gp16, namely its substantial stimulation of gp17 ATPase activity. Implications of these findings to the mechanism of DNA packaging in bacteriophage T4 and other double-stranded DNA viruses are discussed. Escherichia coli B40 (su +1) was used as the amber suppressor for preparation of phage stocks. E. coli P301 (sup −) was used as the non-suppressor strain for preparation of packaging extracts. E. coli VR34 (NS3529 λimm λLP1 λimm434-P1:Cre+) was used for plating the packaging reaction mixtures (11Rao V.B. Thaker V. Black L.W. Gene. 1992; 113: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). E. coli CR63 (su +1) and E. coli CR63 (λ) (su +1) were used for determining the yield of phage with appropriate genetic markers. E. coli strains BL21, BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)pLys-S, and BL21(DE3)pLys-E (Novagen, Inc. (12Studier W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 61-89Google Scholar)) were used as the host strains for pET plasmids carryingg17 and g16 constructs. Wild type phage T4, 16amN87amN66, 17amNG178,17amNG178rIIAdel.H88, and16amN6617amNG178rIIAdel.H88 phage stocks were prepared in this laboratory (13Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Three phage T7 pET vectors (Novagen Inc.) were used for construction of terminase recombinants (Table I). The vector pET9d (kan r), which has an NcoI cloning site downstream to the strong T7 promoter, was used for construction of the recombinants pR16, pR17, pR16–17, pR16,17, and pR17,16; these would express the terminase protein(s) with the native primary amino acid sequence. The vector pET12a (amp r), which has a BamHI cloning site after a 22-amino acid ompT leader sequence, was used for the construction of pR-omp16 and pR-omp17; this vector allowed expression of Omp-gp16 or Omp-gp17 fusion proteins but failed to secrete the fusion proteins into the extracellular medium. The vector pET15B (amp r), which has a BamHI cloning site after a 25-amino acid sequence containing the hexahistidine tag, was used for construction of pRL-H17 and pRL-H16, which allowed the expression of terminase proteins with the N-terminal hexahistidine fusion.Table IRecombinant constructs for overexpression of the packaging proteins gp16 and gp17■, T7 promoter; ░, phage T7 ribosome binding site; ▥, hexahistidine tag; ▧, ompT tag; ▨, g16 coding sequence; □, g17 coding sequence; ▤, overlapping sequence at the 3′-end of g16; ,g17 ribosome binding site.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (9902) Google Scholar). Large scale plasmid DNA preparations were performed by equilibrium CsCl-EtBr density gradient purification (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Transformation-competent cells were prepared either by the CaCl2 method (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) or by the electroporation method (16Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA or the plasmid DNA was performed by the cycle-sequencing strategy using the FentamoleTM DNA-sequencing system (Promega) (17Rao V.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)2 was performed according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed according to Towbin et al. (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar), and immunostaining using gp17 antibodies was performed according to the procedure described earlier (20Yap N. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In vitro DNA-packaging assays were performed as described previously (9Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All the terminase recombinants were designed to clone only the coding sequence of the corresponding terminase gene under the control of the T7 promoter and the strong ribosome binding site (RBS). This was done to eliminate any potential regulatory cis elements in the flanking non-coding regions of the terminase genes. The following procedure, which describes the construction of pRL-H16 and pRL-H17, was used as the basic procedure for the construction of all the recombinants described in this study (Table I). The g16 coding sequence was amplified using the primers 5′-CGC GGATCCGATGGAAGGTCTTGATATAAACAAAC-3′ (forward nucleotides 1–25) and 5′-CGC GGATCCCTTAATCGGTTGTTCCATTTATCACC-3′ (reverse nucleotides 497–472). The corresponding primers for amplification of g17 coding sequence were 5′-CGCG GGATCCGATGGAACAACCGATTAATGTATTAAATG-3′ (forward nucleotides 1–28) and 5′-CGCG GGATCCGTTATACCATTGACATACCATGAG-3′ (reverse nucleotides 1832–1810). The nucleotide numbers in parentheses correspond to the coding sequence of the corresponding gene. Each primer had a tag sequence at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide (shown in italics), which allowed efficient cutting at the adjacentBamHI sequence (shown in bold). Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were performed as described earlier using about 100 ng of purified mature phage T4 DNA as a template (20Yap N. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA was digested with BamHI at 37 °C for 2 h, and the DNA was ligated with the linearized and dephosphorylated pET15b vector DNA. The ligated DNA was transformed into competent E. coliBL21 cells, and the amp r transformants were screened for gene-positive transformants by marker rescue using the16amN87amN66 and 17amNG178 mutants (21Kuebler D. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence of appropriate size insert and orientation was confirmed by restriction mapping. Miniprep DNAs were prepared from the transformants and were re-transformed into the expression strainE. coli BL21(DE3)pLys-S. We found that the BL21(DE3)pLys-E strain was worse than the BL21(DE3)pLys-S strain for overexpression of gp17, and hence, all the expression studies were performed under the BL21(DE3)pLys-S background. The gp17-expressing constructs could not be maintained in BL21(DE3), apparently due to the toxicity of a high basal level expression of gp17-associated nuclease (21Kuebler D. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Bhattacharyya S.P. Rao V.B. Virology. 1993; 196: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The clone pR16–17 was constructed by cloning the contiguousg16- and g17-coding sequence in its native configuration in which the RBS and the ATG initiation codon ofg17 are nested within a 30-base pair-overlapping sequence in the 3′-end of g16 (10Powell D. Franklin J. Arisaka F. Mosig G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The clone pR16,17 was constructed by duplicating the 3′-end-overlapping sequence in g16 and incorporating a second T7 RBS in the upstream of the g17 ATG initiation codon (the T7 RBS refers to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence AAGGAG plus the eight nucleotides that precede the ATG initiation codon (12Studier W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 61-89Google Scholar)). This was done to minimize potential translational regulation in the overlapping sequence, which might limit the overexpression of both gp16 and gp17 (23Lin H. Simon M.N. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3495-3501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The clone pR17,16 is similar to pR16,17 in that both the g16 and g17 have independent RBSs for expression but in a reverse order. This was constructed by cloning theg16-coding sequence plus the upstream T7 RBS downstream to the 3′-end of g17. The clone pR16 + pRL-H17 contained two independent terminase plasmids but with different antibiotic markers. For example, in one combination, a g16 clone in pET9d with the kanamycin marker (pR16) was transformed into pRL-H17/E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys-S with the ampicillin marker, and theamp r kan r-resistant colonies were selected. A number of such combinations were constructed and analyzed since a variety of constructs with either theg16 or g17 cloned into various pET vectors were available in the laboratory. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys-S cells carrying the recombinant terminase construct was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic(s) to about 4 × 108 cells/ml, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Aliquots (500 μl) were withdrawn at different time points and were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.2 volume of water, and an appropriate amount of 4× SDS sample buffer was added. gp16 was analyzed on a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel, and gp17 was analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. To determine whether the expressed protein is in the soluble form or in the inclusion bodies, total lysates were made by passing the cells through a French press cell at 20,000 lb/inch2, and the lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were washed once with the purification buffer (Buffer P: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The supernatants (soluble fraction) and pellets (insoluble fraction) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Equivalent to about 100 μl of the original culture volume was loaded into each well. A fresh culture of E. coliBL21(DE3)pLys-S containing the clone pRL-H17 was grown at 30 °C in Moore's tryptone-phosphate medium (24Moore J.T. Uppal A. Maley F. Maley G.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) to a density of around 2 × 108 cells/ml. The cells were induced to express gp17 by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm and were allowed to shake at 30 °C for 1–2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 12 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.1–0.2 volume of the Buffer P. The resuspended cells were lysed by two passages through a French press cell at 20,000 lb/inch2, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was directly loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel ion-exchange column (20-ml packed resin for 200–400 ml of original culture). The column was thoroughly washed by passing 3–5 column volumes of Buffer P. The column was then washed with 0.13m NaCl in Buffer P to remove nonspecific proteins. Bound gp17 was eluted with 0.2 m NaCl in Buffer P, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and in vitroDNA-packaging. Fractions containing the bulk of gp17 were pooled and dialyzed against two changes of Bind buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), 1 liter each. The sample was then loaded onto a Ni2+-agarose column that was pre-equilibrated with the Bind buffer (3-ml packed column per 200–400 ml of original culture). After washing the column with 10–15 column volumes of Bind buffer, loosely adhered nonspecific proteins were removed by further washing with 10–15 column volumes of Wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole). gp17 was then eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 60 mm-1m imidazole. The fractions (0.5–1 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and in vitro DNA-packaging. Fractions containing gp17, which eluted at about 350 mm imidazole, were pooled, dialyzed against two changes of 500 ml of Buffer P containing 200 mm NaCl, and stored at −70 °C. gp16 was purified from the E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys-S carrying the clone pRL-H16. The procedure was essentially the same as described for gp17 except for the following differences. In the DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, the nonspecific proteins were eluted with 0.17 m NaCl wash, and gp16 was eluted with 0.2 m NaCl. The final purified gp16 was dialyzed against Buffer P (no NaCl) and was stored at −70 °C. The purified gp17, gp16, or the control proteins were incubated in a reaction mixture (10–30 μl) containing 1–10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) in Buffer P at 37 °C for 10–30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. A 1-μl reaction mixture was spotted on a 10-cm-long polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography strip at about 1 cm from the bottom. The strips were developed in a solvent containing 0.5 m LiCl and 1m formic acid until the solvent reached to about 0.5 cm from the top of the strip (∼45 min (25Manne V. Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13223-13232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The chromatograms were air-dried and autoradiographed. The NTPase activity was determined under the same conditions using 10 μCi of α-32P-labeled ATP, dATP, CTP, GTP, TTP, or UTP as the substrate (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol). Whenever nonradioactive nucleotides were used as standards, the spots were visualized by exposing the chromatogram to UV light and marking the position of the nucleotide spot. In the quantitative experiments, the purified gp16 and/or gp17 were incubated in duplicates or triplicates with either [32P]ATP or a mixture of [32P]ATP and cold ATP, and the 32Pi or [32P]ADP formed was quantitated. Quantitation was performed by cutting the spots from the TLC strips and counting in a Beckman LS-133 scintillation counter at a pre-set efficiency of 0.5–1.5%. For some experiments, quantitation was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. From the 32Pi value, the total Piproduced, which includes both the cold and radioactive Pi, was calculated. In the single turnover experiments, the reaction mixture contained, on a molar basis, 3–10-fold more protein when compared with the ATP substrate. The data represent an average of duplicate or triplicate values for each variable. gp17 was partitioned out of solution by passing through an anti-gp17 IgG-protein A-Sepharose column. Antibodies against gp17 were raised in a rabbit using the most highly purified gp17 preparation (Josman Laboratories). The specificity of gp17 antibodies was confirmed by Western blotting using crude cell lysates of uninduced and induced pRL-H17extracts and control induced extracts expressing a nonspecific protein. The antibodies were first pre-adsorbed by passing through an Affigel-immobilized E. coli extract to remove any nonspecific E. coliantibodies. The anti-gp17 IgG and pre-immune IgG were purified by 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation of the serum followed by negative DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography (26Andrew S.M. Titus J.A. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997: 2.7.1-2.7.12Google Scholar). The purified anti-gp17 IgG and the pre-immune IgG appeared homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and, more importantly, lacked any nonspecific nuclease or ATPase activities. The IgGs were immobilized by passing about 180 μg of purified IgG through mini-protein A-Sepharose columns (∼200-μl beads) (25Manne V. Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13223-13232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each column was thoroughly washed with the buffer, and about 3 μg of purified gp17 was passed through the column. The adsorbed samples, which were recovered in the flow-through from the pre-immune and the anti-gp17 IgG columns, were analyzed for ATPase activity. The purified gp17, gp16, or the control proteins were incubated with either [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP in Buffer P (10–30 μl) at 37 °C for 10–45 min. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. After taking a small aliquot of the sample (1 μl) for TLC to determine the ATPase activity, the proteins in the reaction mixture were precipitated by adding 10 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. The precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at room temperature. The pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid followed by two additional washings with 1 ml of acetone to remove trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and autoradiographed. The 32P in the gp17 position was quantitated using the PhosphorImager. Using the phage T7 pET system, the terminase proteins gp16 and gp17 were expressed either independently or together in a number of configurations (Table I). When expressed independently, gp17 was overexpressed up to about 5–8% of the total cell protein, and gp16 was overexpressed up to about 20% of the total cell protein. However, when expressed together, regardless of the configuration, the level of expression was much lower, in most cases only up to about 1% of the total cell protein. Although most of the overexpressed gp16 (except Omp-16) was in the soluble fraction, most of the gp17 partitioned into the insoluble fraction (compare lanes 4 for the insoluble fraction with lanes 3 for the soluble fraction in Fig. 1, panels A and C). Although large quantities of near homogeneous gp17 could be purified from the insoluble fraction, it could not be renatured into an active form having in vitro DNA-packaging activity. Therefore, we experimented with the growth conditions to maximize the expression of gp17 as a soluble protein. We found that more of the expressed gp17 was recovered in the soluble form when tryptone-phosphate medium was used and by lowering the growth temperature to 30 °C (compare lane 4 for the insoluble fraction with lane 3 for the soluble fraction in panel B). This is in agreement with a previous report showing the expression of foreign proteins in soluble form when the E. coli was grown in the enriched tryptone-phosphate medium (24Moore J.T. Uppal A. Maley F. Maley G.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Qualitative in vitro DNA-packaging and in vivoterminase assays showed that the recombinant terminase proteins were active. After considering various factors, we chose to focus our efforts on the His-tagged constructs pRL-H17 and pRL-H16. A careful analysis showed that the hexahistidine tag did not appear to interfere with the functionality of gp17. For instance, the His-gp17 was highly active for in vitro packaging of externally added phage T4 DNA (∼106 plaque-forming units/10-μl lysate). Second, induction of His-gp17 expression resulted in the degradation of plasmid DNA, yielding a characteristic DNA smear extending throughout the lane, as has been observed with the native gp17 (21Kuebler D. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Bhattacharyya S.P. Rao V.B. Virology. 1993; 196: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, the extent of degradation with His-gp17 was lower than that with the native gp17. Finally, sequencing of the entire g17 from the pRL-H17 clone showed no mutations introduced by polymerase chain reaction. Attempts to purify gp16 and gp17 in a single step by directly passing the crude extract through the Ni2+-agarose column were not successful since some nonspecific E. coli proteins apparently competed with gp17 for binding to the column, decreasing the efficiency of gp17 binding and recovery. Therefore, gp17 was first partially purified by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, and the eluate within a narrow window of 130–200 mm NaCl (Fig. 1 B, lane 6), which contained most of the gp17, was further purified by Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography. Virtually all the proteins in the DEAE fraction except His-gp17 were removed either in the flow-through fraction (lane 9) or in the 60 mm imidazole fraction (lane 10).

Biochem. 236, 63-73) and recombinant prion protein (PrP) have been found to be in monomeric form (Mehlhorn, I., Groth, D., Stockel, J., Moffat, B., Reilly, D., Yansura, D., Willet, W. S., Baldwin, M., Fletterick, R., Cohen, F. E., Vandlen, R., Henner, D., and Prusiner, S. B. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 5528-5537; and this paper), and therefore PrP(C)-PrP(C) interactions were previously unknown. In this report we confirm recombinant PrP to be a monomer by analytical ultracentrifugation. However, by three lines of evidence (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cross-linking experiments, and size exclusion chromatography) we could also demonstrate that, under native conditions, at least part of the native bovine PrP(C) exists as a monomer-dimer equilibrium. A bovine PrP(C)-specific immuno-sandwich ELISA was developed and calibrated with recombinant PrP (Meyer, R. K., Oesch, B., Fatzer, R., Zurbriggen, A., and Vandevelde, M. (1999) J. Virol. 73, 9386-9392). By this ELISA we identified a distinct PrP(C) fraction and partially purified this protein. When serial dilutions of brain homogenate or partially purified PrP(C) were measured, using the peptide antibody C15S, a nonlinear dose-response curve was obtained. This nonlinearity was shown not to be due to an artifact of the procedure but to a monomer-dimer equilibrium of PrP(C) with preferential binding of the antibody to the dimer. From the curvature we could deduce the association constant (3.9 x 10(8) M(-1) at 37 degrees C). Accordingly, DeltaG degrees of the reaction was calculated (-48.6 kJ M(-1)), and DeltaH degrees (9.5 kJ M(-1)) as well as DeltaS degrees (0.2 kJ K(-1) M(-1)) were extrapolated from the van't Hoff plot. When serial dilutions of monomeric recombinant PrP were tested, only a straight line was obtained, supporting our hypothesis. Additional evidence of dimer formation was revealed by Western blotting of partially purified PrP(C) cross-linked by the homobifunctional cross-linker BS(3). Finally, size exclusion chromatography of partially purified PrP(C) fractions revealed an additional shoulder not observed with recombinant PrP. The difference in respect of dimer formation between native PrP(C) and recombinant PrP could be explained by the lack of glycosylation of the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2127109293,"Increases in glucose concentration control the transcription of the preproinsulin (PPI) gene and several other genes in the pancreatic islet beta-cell. Although recent data have demonstrated that secreted insulin may regulate the PPI gene (Leibiger, I. B., Leibiger, B., Moede, T., and Berggren, P. O. (1998) Mol. Cell 1, 933-938), the role of insulin in the control of other beta-cell genes is unexplored. To study the importance of insulin secretion in the regulation of the PPI and liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) genes by glucose, we have used intranuclear microinjection of promoter-luciferase constructs into MIN6 beta-cells and photon-counting imaging. The activity of each promoter was increased either by 30 (versus 3) mm glucose or by 1-20 nm insulin. These effects of insulin were not due to enhanced glucose metabolism since culture with the hormone had no impact on the stimulation of increases in intracellular ATP concentration caused by 30 mm glucose. Furthermore, the islet-specific glucokinase promoter and cellular glucokinase immunoreactivity were unaffected by 30 mm glucose or 20 nm insulin. Inhibition of insulin secretion with the Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil, the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel opener diazoxide, or the alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist clonidine blocked the effects of glucose on L-PK gene transcription. Similarly, 30 mm glucose failed to induce the promoter after inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity with LY294002 and the expression of dominant negative-acting phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (Deltap85) or the phosphoinositide 3'-phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue). LY294002 also diminished the activation of the L-PK gene caused by inhibition of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase with anti-5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha2 antibodies. Conversely, stimulation of insulin secretion with 13 mm KCl or 10 microm tolbutamide strongly activated the PPI and L-PK promoters. These data indicate that, in MIN6 beta-cells, stimulation of insulin secretion is important for the activation by glucose of L-PK as well as the PPI promoter, but does not cause increases in glucokinase gene expression or glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2049334004,"Penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP 5) of Escherichia coli functions as a d-alanine carboxypeptidase, cleaving the C-terminal d-alanine residue from cell wall peptides. Like all PBPs, PBP 5 forms a covalent acyl-enzyme complex with β-lactam antibiotics; however, PBP 5 is distinguished by its high rate of deacylation of the acyl-enzyme complex (t12 ∼ 9 min). A Gly-105 → Asp mutation in PBP 5 markedly impairs this β-lactamase activity (deacylation), with only minor effects on acylation, and promotes accumulation of a covalent complex with peptide substrates. To gain further insight into the catalytic mechanism of PBP 5, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the G105D mutant form of soluble PBP 5 (termed sPBP 5′) at 2.3 Å resolution. The structure is composed of two domains, a penicillin binding domain with a striking similarity to Class A β-lactamases (TEM-1-like) and a domain of unknown function. In addition, the penicillin-binding domain contains an active site loop spatially equivalent to the Ω loop of β-lactamases. In β-lactamases, the Ω loop contains two amino acids involved in catalyzing deacylation. This similarity may explain the high β-lactamase activity of wild-type PBP 5. Because of the low rate of deacylation of the G105D mutant, visualization of peptide substrates bound to the active site may be possible.

Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These proteins, known as penicillin-binding proteins or PBPs,1 utilize lipid-linked disaccharide peptide substrates to catalyze both the polymerization of glycan chains (transglycosylation) and cross-linking of peptide chains (transpeptidation) during cell wall synthesis. In the latter reaction, a serine residue on the PBP reacts with the acyl-d-Ala-d-Ala C terminus of the peptide chain to form a transient acyl-enzyme complex, releasing the C-terminald-alanine residue. This complex reacts with an amino group from another peptide chain to form a cross-link, which is crucial to the integrity and rigidity of the cell wall. An additional activity catalyzed by some PBPs, carboxypeptidation, occurs when the acyl-enzyme complex reacts with water. Penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics mimic the structure of the acyl-d-Ala-d-Ala C terminus of the peptide chain (2Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) and react with PBPs to form an acyl-enzyme complex. Unlike the transient nature of the PBP-peptide complex, the acyl-enzyme complex formed between PBPs and β-lactam antibiotics is much more stable and results in prolonged inhibition of the enzyme. In Escherichia coli, at least 10 PBPs have been identified. These PBPs can be split into two classes: the high molecular mass PBPs (PBPs 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, and 3) and the low molecular mass PBPs (PBPs 4, 5, 6, 6b, and 7) (3Ghuysen J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). High molecular mass PBPs are essential for cell viability and are involved in the physiological processes of cell elongation, cell division, and the maintenance of cell shape (4Spratt B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The role of low molecular mass PBPs in bacterial physiology is less clear. These PBPs catalyze d,d-endopeptidase ord,d-carboxypeptidase activity both in vitro and in vivo (5Matsuhashi M. Tamaki S. Curtis S.J. Strominger J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 644-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Amanuma H. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11173-11180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but although they account for >90% of the amount of penicillin G bound to membranes, they are not essential for cell viability (7Denome S.A. Elf P.K. Henderson T.A. Nelson D.E. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3981-3993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent study utilizing strains with multiple deletions of low molecular mass PBPs revealed a role for PBP 5 in the proper synthesis of peptidoglycan (8Nelson D.E. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Production of a β-lactamase is the most common mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to β-lactam antibiotics (9Bush K. Sykes R.B. Antimicrobial Drug Resistance. Academic Press, Inc., New York, NY1984: 1-31Crossref Google Scholar). The initial step of the reaction catalyzed by these enzymes is analogous to that mediated by PBPs, but instead of accumulating a stable acyl-enzyme complex, β-lactamases destroy the antibiotic by rapidly hydrolyzing the acyl-enzyme bond. Analysis of the sequences and crystal structures of PBPs and Class A and class C β-lactamases reveals strong structural similarities in the two classes of penicillin-interacting proteins (10Joris B. Ghuysen J.-M. Dive G. Renard A. Dideberg O. Charlier P. Frere J.-M. Kelly J.A. Boyington J.C. Moews P.C. Knox J.R. Biochem.

Ghuysen J.-M. Science. 1986; 231: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The hallmark of all active site serine-based penicillin-interacting proteins is the presence of three well conserved motifs in the active site (13Ghuysen J.-M. Dive G. Bacterial Cell Walls. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1994: 103-129Google Scholar). These motifs are the S XXK tetrad containing the active site serine residue, the (S/Y)XN triad, and the KT(S)G triad. The reaction mechanism of the interaction of β-lactam antibiotics with PBPs and β-lactamases is represented schematically by the following three-step model.E+S⇌k−1k+1E·S→k2E­S*→k3E+PEquation 1 where E is the PBP or β-lactamase, S is a β-lactam antibiotic, E · S is the Michaelis complex, E-S* is the covalent acyl-enzyme complex, and P is the inactive degradation product (14Pratt R.F. Govardhan C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Martin M.T. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 923-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In PBPs,k3 is usually quite small compared with k2, leading to accumulation of the inactive acylated enzyme. For β-lactamases, both the k2and k3 rate constants are very large, and the β-lactam antibiotic is hydrolyzed. In contrast to most other PBPs, E. coli PBP 5 is distinguished by its high β-lactamase activity, with k3≈ 0.07 s−1 (t12 < 10 min) for the penicilloyl-PBP 5 complex. A mutant PBP 5, PBP 5-G105D (termed PBP 5′), shows near normal acylation rates with penicillin G but displays a 30-fold decrease in the rate of deacylation (16Amanuma H. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1294-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the mutant protein forms a stable covalent complex with the depsipeptide substrate,N,N′-diacetyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-lactate, which is not observed with the wild-type protein (16Amanuma H. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1294-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotype of PBP 5′ is similar to that of wild-type PBP 5 in which Cys-115 has been modified with sulfhydryl reagents, causing a larger effect on deacylation than acylation (18Curtis S.J. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2584-2588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since the mutants PBP 5-C115A and PBP 5-C115S both display wild-type levels of d-alanine carboxypeptidase (CPase) and penicillin binding activities, this residue does not appear to be directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme (17Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent attempts to identify residues involved in deacylation of PBP 5 have been unsuccessful (19vanderLinden M.P. deHaan L. Dideberg O. Keck W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the molecular mechanism of deacylation of PBP 5 and to define further the interactions of β-lactam antibiotics and peptide substrates with PBPs, we have solved the structure of the G105D mutant of PBP 5 at 2.3-Å resolution, the first structure for PBP 5. It reveals the closest similarity yet identified between a PBP-type enzyme and a Class A β-lactamase, which may explain the relatively high β-lactamase activity of PBP 5. Construction of the expression plasmid encoding sPBP 5′ has been described (17Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pratt J.M. Jackson M.E. Holland I.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2399-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the G105D mutant form of PBP 5 missing its last 17 codons (plus six extra codons added during plasmid construction) was cloned into the PstI-HindIII restriction sites of pBR322. Overnight cultures of MC1061 harboring the expression plasmid were subjected to osmotic shock (21Kustu S.G. Ames G.F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6976-6983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sPBP 5′ was purified from the shock fluid by ampicillin affinity chromatography exactly as described (17Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein was dialyzed exhaustively against 20 mm Tris· HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% NaN3, pH 7.5 and concentrated to 6–8 mg ml−1. SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis indicated that the protein was >98% pure with very little of the characteristic 30- and 10-kDa breakdown products (22Nicholas R.A. Ishino F. Park W. Matsuhashi M. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6394-6397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallization conditions were similar to those described previously (23Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2% NaN3. Crystals of bullet-shaped morphology formed at 18 °C within 1–2 days. The crystals belong to space group P32 with cell dimensions a = 50.83 Å and b =c = 140.29 Å. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit. In all cases crystals were mounted in quartz capillaries, and data were collected at room temperature by the standard oscillation method. The initial native data set was collected using a Rigaku RAXIS-II image plate system (Molecular Structures Corp., The Woodlands, TX) mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 x-ray generator operating at 40 kV and 80 mA and fitted with a graphite monochromator. The crystal-to-plate distance was 130 mm, the oscillation angle was 3°, and the exposure time was 30 min frame−1. A total of 84° of data was collected. Derivative diffraction data were collected using a DIP 2030H image plate detector mounted on a Nonius FR391 rotating anode x-ray generator fitted with MacScience focusing mirrors (Nonius B. V., Delft, The Netherlands) and operating at 40 kV and 100 mA. Data were collected at a crystal-to-plate distance of 150 mm, with an oscillation angle of 1° and an exposure time of 18 min frame−1. Rotation ranges of 60–75° were sufficient to collect essentially complete data sets. For model refinement purposes a high resolution data set was collected, where the crystal-to-plate distance was 150 mm, the oscillation angle was 1°, and the exposure time was 12 min frame−1. To ensure a high redundancy of data, the crystal was rotated through a total of 90°. In all cases the oscillation data were processed using HKL (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38567) Google Scholar). In the case of derivative data, the Friedel pairs were not merged in order to retain the anomalous signal. A search for derivatives was made by soaking crystals in solutions of heavy atom compounds in stabilizing buffer (20% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0). Soaks in various mercury and platinum compounds yielded several promising derivatives, as judged by difference Patterson maps. In each case heavy atom positions were determined and refined, and the data were used in trial phasing. These calculations showed that two derivatives, mercury cyanide (HgCN2) and di-μ-iodobis-(ethylenediamine) di-platinum nitrate (PIP), were of the best quality and sufficient to solve the structure. All calculations to this point were performed using PHASES (25Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Perkins H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At this stage the derivative and native data were merged using SCALEIT (26Collaborative Computation Project Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19764) Google Scholar), and the final phasing calculation was performed using SHARP (27deLaFortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) and included anomalous data. The resulting multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) phases were improved by solvent flattening using SOLOMON (28Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) with an estimated solvent content of 46%. An MIR electron density map (Fig. 1 B) was calculated using CCP4 programs (26Collaborative Computation Project Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19764) Google Scholar) and displayed using the program O (29Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). The map was of excellent quality and was easily interpreted to build the entire structure, including side chains, with the exception of residues 1–3 and 74–90. The model was then refined by alternating rounds of XPLOR and manual revision using O. In later rounds water molecules were included. The final round of refinement was performed using REFMAC (26Collaborative Computation Project Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19764) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the final model was evaluated using PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The numbering of the final model corresponds to the sequence of the mature processed protein. The structure of sPBP 5′ was determined by MIR with anomalous scattering. The data collection and phasing statistics are shown in Tables I and II, and portions of both the MIR and final 2/Fo −Fc electron density maps are shown in Fig.1. The final structure has an R factor of 19.6% (Rfree = 27.0%) at 2.3-Å resolution (Table III).

Derivative abbreviations are as in Table I. As defined by PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), 90.0% of the residues lie within the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot. Three residues fall within disallowed regions. Of these, Ala-155 and Lys-219 both lie within loop regions with weak density, whereas Ile-212 is a hydrophobic core residue with excellent density. Residues with the highest B factors are located exclusively at the termini or in surface-exposed loops. Certain parts of the molecule have been omitted from the model where they correspond to regions of poor electron density, likely due to disorder. These are residues 1–3 at the N terminus, seven residues at the C terminus (six of which are non-native and result from the genetic construct), and an external loop comprising residues 74–90. The apparent flexibility of these latter residues is consistent with the increased susceptibility of the G105D mutant enzyme to proteolysis compared with PBP 5 wild type. Proteolysis of sPBP 5′ generates characteristic 30- and 10-kDa fragments by cleavage between residues 87 and 88, which reside within this external loop (31vanderLinden M.P. Mottl H. Keck W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). sPBP 5′ is composed of two domains that are oriented approximately at right angles to each other (Fig. 2). Each domain is formed from contiguous primary sequence, residues 3 to 262 for domain 1 and residues 263 to 356 for domain 2. The N-terminal region of sPBP 5′ is a loop that extends away from domain 1 and makes a slight contact with domain 2 via Lys-6. The principal feature of domain 1 is a five-stranded anti-parallel β sheet that forms the hydrophobic core. This is packed on one side by an extended loop at the N terminus, α10, and a loop connecting β8 and β9 that contains a small α helix (α9). The other side is comprised primarily of an array of seven α helices. In addition, there are three β hairpin-like structures, β3-β4, β5-β6, and β7-β8, one of which (β3-β4) contains the disordered residues 74–90. The active site of PBP 5 is located within this domain at the boundary of the five-stranded β-sheet and the helical array (see below). It is immediately apparent that domain 1 has the same fold as Class A and Class C β-lactamases (discussed below). This domain, which is almost exclusively comprised of β structure, is a sandwich of two anti-parallel β sheets, one three-stranded and the other two-stranded. The two-stranded sheet is kinked at residues Gly-272 and Asp-293, causing the two sides of the sheet to be at right angles. The effect of this is to form a loose β barrel at the C-terminal end of the domain. Compared with domain 1, domain 2 has a relatively hydrophobic surface as judged by an electrostatic plot (data not shown), although none of these hydrophobic residues are particularly well conserved in other CPases. The significance of this apparent hydrophobicity and the role of this domain in the function of the protein are unknown. A search of the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (32Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) revealed no genuine structural similarities to domain 2. Since the hydrophobic cores of domains 1 and 2 extend to include the domain interface and because this region has comparatively low B factors, significant movements between domains 1 and 2 seem unlikely, suggesting that the relative juxtaposition of the two domains is conserved. A Blast search of the GenBankTM data base with E. coli PBP 5 as a query sequence identified two other E. coli PBPs (PBP 6 and PBP 6b) and PBPs from Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae as its closest matches. Alignment of these PBPs is shown in Fig. 3 along with secondary structure assignments from the three-dimensional structure of sPBP 5′. As expected, the regions of highest identity reside in and around the conserved sequence motifs (shown in parentheses) associated with the active site in domain 1: residues 42–53 (Ser44-X-X-Lys47), residues 110–114 (Ser110-X-Asn112), and residues 210–217 (Lys213-Thr214-Gly215) (19vanderLinden M.P. deHaan L. Dideberg O. Keck W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two additional highly conserved regions, comprising residues 149–154 and 195–203, also are located in close proximity to the active site (see Fig. 4). In general, the residues in domain 2 are less conserved than domain 1, and most of the conserved residues are within the hydrophobic core.Figure 4Active site architecture of sPBP 5′. The active site is formed by five structural elements (colored yellow, green, blue,purple, and orange). Potential hydrogen bonds are denoted by the dashed lines. Note the orientations of the imidazole side chain and backbone carbonyl group of His-151 and the position of Arg-198. This figure was produced using MOLSCRIPT (51Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The location of the active site is readily identified by plotting the conserved sequence motifs onto the sPBP 5′ structure. In common with other PBPs and β-lactamases, the active site is located in the cleft between the five-stranded anti-parallel β sheet and the large α helical cluster. As viewed in Fig. 2, the entrance to the active site is at the opposite end of the molecule from the C terminus and the membrane anchor (which is missing in our construct), in an ideal position to interact with cell wall peptides. The architecture of active site (Fig. 4) is comprised of the following elements: helix α2 (yellow), containing Ser-44 and Lys-47 of the S XXK tetrad; the turn between helices α4 and α5 (green), containing Ser-110 and Asn-112 of the SXN triad; and β9 (orange), the edge strand of the β sheet containing Lys-213, Thr-214, and Gly-215 of the KT(S)G triad. In addition, the loops between β5 and β6 and between β8 and α9 also contribute residues to the active site. These include His-151, present on the extended loop (blue) at the bottom of the cavity, and Arg-198, located on the loop (purple) at the top of the cavity. Both of these latter residues are conserved in related CPases (Fig. 4). The identification of Ser-44, Lys-47, Ser-110, Asn-112, and Lys-213 as active site residues is consistent with data showing that mutation of any of these renders PBP 5 highly deficient or, in some cases, completely inactive in both antibiotic binding and carboxypeptidation (19vanderLinden M.P. deHaan L. Dideberg O. Keck W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Malhotra K.T. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11386-11391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrogen-bonding network within the active site is extensive (Fig.4). The ε-NH2 group of Lys-47 plays a central role in this network, forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Ser-44, the amide carbonyl group of Asn-112, and the backbone carbonyl groups from both Ser-110 and His-151. In common with other penicillin-interacting enzymes, the ε-NH2 group of Lys-213 forms a hydrogen bond with Ser-110. In contrast to Class A β-lactamases, in which two structurally conserved water molecules are typically observed within the hydrogen bonding network (34Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frere J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), there are no visible water molecules in the immediate vicinity of the active site. However, further refinement and higher resolution data of sPBP 5′ may be necessary to firmly establish the presence or absence of potential active site water molecules. One of the most outstanding features of the sPBP 5′ structure is the similarity of domain 1 with the fold of Class A β-lactamases, as represented by TEM-1 (35Rhazi N. Galleni M. Page M.I. Frere J.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and PC1 (36Herzberg O. Moult J. Science. 1987; 236: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Notably, this structural similarity is considerably more pronounced than previously reported PBP structures, namely the Streptomyces R61d,d-peptidase (37Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Hite G.J. Bartolone J.B. Zhao H. Joris B. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6449-6458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PBP 2x from Streptococcus pneumoniae (38Pares S. Mouz N. Petillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The main chain atoms in the 209 residues of domain 1 of sPBP 5′ composing the common elements of secondary structure of penicillin-interacting proteins can be superimposed onto the PC1 β-lactamase fold (36Herzberg O. Moult J. Science. 1987; 236: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.7 Å and the TEM-1 β-lactamase (39Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) fold with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.5 Å. The similarity of domain 1 of sPBP 5′ and TEM-1 β-lactamase is shown in Fig. 5. The most significant differences between the two structures are 1) the N-terminal helix of TEM-1 is replaced by an extended chain in sPBP 5′, 2) the disordered region between residues 74 and 90 in sPBP 5′ is visible in TEM-1 as a small helix with connecting loops, 3) the extended loop (colored blue in Fig. 4, of sPBP 5′ has a slightly different conformation compared with its counterpart in TEM-1, the so-called Ω loop, and 4) in sPBP 5′ the connection between helices α8 and α9 contains a large β hairpin, whereas the equivalent connection in TEM-1, between helices α9 and α10, is direct. A comparable degree of similarity with Class A β-lactamases was also observed in the recently determined structure of the Streptomyces K15 d,d-transpeptidase (40Fonzé E. Vermeire M.

In particular, cytokine-induced production of nitric oxide has been shown to correlate with β cell apoptosis and/or inhibition of insulin secretion. In the present study, we investigated whether the interleukin (IL)-1β intracellular signal transduction pathway could be blocked by overexpression of dominant negative forms of the IL-1 receptor interacting protein MyD88. We show that overexpression of the Toll domain or the lpr mutant of MyD88 in βTc-Tet cells decreased nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation upon IL-1β and IL-1β/interferon (IFN)-γ stimulation. Inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA accumulation and nitrite production, which required the simultaneous presence of IL-1β and IFN-γ, were also suppressed by ∼70%, and these cells were more resistant to cytokine-induced apoptosis as compared with parental cells. The decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion induced by IL-1β and IFN-γ was however not prevented. This was because these dysfunctions were induced by IFN-γ alone, which decreased cellular insulin content and stimulated insulin exocytosis. These results demonstrate that IL-1β is involved in inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression and induction of apoptosis in mouse β cells but does not contribute to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, our data show that IL-1β cellular actions can be blocked by expression of MyD88 dominant negative proteins and, finally, that cytokine-induced β cell secretory dysfunctions are due to the action of IFN-γ.

Mathis D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cytokines, in particular IL-1β,1IFN-γ, and TNF-α, are thought to play an important role in this destruction mechanism, but their exact role in vivo is not completely understood. They are however involved in both direct effects through control of gene expression by β cells and in indirect effects through activation of endothelial and inflammatory cells present within the islets. The particular role of IL-1β has been much studied. In islets tested in vitro, IL-1β has been proposed to directly suppress β cell function through induction of the endogenous inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the production of NO (2Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). However, most of this early work has focused on rat islets and insulinomas, which appear to be exquisitely sensitive to IL-1β-induced cell death and inhibition of insulin secretion. In contrast, there are conflicting recent results regarding the role of NO in human islet β cell destruction, with many groups suggesting that NO may only partly or not at all be involved (3Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Welsh N. Cetkovic-Cvrlje M. Nieman A. Geller D.A. Pipeleers D.G. Bendtzen K. Hellerstrom C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Rabinovitch A.

Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Studies on isolated mouse β cells or insulinomas have suggested the following intermediate situation: first, IL-1β alone does not appear to affect primary mouse β cells (6Pavlovic D. Chen M.C. Gysemans C.A. Mathieu C. Eizirik D.L. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1999; 10: 403-412PubMed Google Scholar), and NO generated by cytokine (IL-1β/IFN-γ)-treated islets may only be one of the ways by which mouse β cells are destroyed (7Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Schulz R. Rabinovitch A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1006-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Zumsteg U. Frigerio S. Hollander G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report suggested that NO, produced at lower levels, could even protect against necrosis induced by alloxan and streptozotocin in purified rat β cells stimulated with IL-1β only (9Ling Z. Van de Casteele M. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This study also showed that IL-1β stimulation of rat β cells led to an NO-dependent increase in expression of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, heat-shock protein of 70 kDa, and heme-oxygenase 1, enzymes that are involved in the natural defense mechanisms against reactive oxygen species. IL-1β action depends on its interaction with a specific plasma membrane receptor composed of the IL-1 receptor and its accessory protein (IL-1RAcP). Activation of the receptor leads to association of MyD88 with the IL-1/IL-1RAcP complex and subsequent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and NF-κB via recruitment of a TNF receptor-associated factor 6/ IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-dependent pathway (10Auron P.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The MyD88 protein is an adaptor molecule that also participates in the IL-18 and lipopolysaccharide receptor signaling pathways in mammals. It contains two protein-protein interaction domains, aDrosophila-like Toll domain and a Death domain. TheDrosophila Toll receptor is an homologue of the mammalian IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide receptors. It leads to the activation of the Pelle-like kinase, which has a strong similarity to the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase that phosphorylates and targets to degradation the IkB-like Cactus protein, thereby allowing the NF-κB homologue Dorsal to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. It is thus believed that MyD88 is involved in an ancient and very conserved innate immune response to microorganism mediated by the lipopolysaccharide and IL-1 receptor family (11Burns K. Martinon F.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). MyD88 function depends on homodimerization, which requires intact Toll and Death domains and association of the protein with the IL-1 receptor through the Toll domain. Important for the present study, it has been recently reported that interference with the intracellular IL-1 signaling pathway can be achieved by overexpressing either the Toll domain of MyD88 or the adaptor containing a Death domain mutation. This mutation (MyD88F56N) is similar to the lpr mutation found in the Death domain of the FAS receptor, which blocks the Fas-Fadd interaction (11Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). These two dominant negative mutants of the MyD88 protein (MyD88Toll and MyD88lpr) could therefore be used to suppress the IL-1 intracellular signaling pathway at a site close to receptor activation. To evaluate the potential of blocking this pathway by gene transfer in β cells and the consequence of this inhibition on NF-κB activation, NO production, and GSIS in response to cytokine treatment, we used the conditionally immortalized βTc-Tet cells. These cells have been established in culture from islets of transgenic mice expressing the SV-40 T antigen under the control of the tetracycline operator/tetracycline transactivator system (15Efrat S. Fusco-DeMane D. Lemberg H. al Emran O. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3576-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). They can be growth-arrested in the presence of tetracycline, and, in the non-proliferating state, their insulin content is similar to that of native β cells, and they secrete insulin with the normal glucose dose dependence (16Fleischer N. Chen C. Surana M. Leiser M. Rossetti L. Pralong W. Efrat S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importantly, when transplanted under the kidney capsule of diabetic syngeneic mice, these cells can control blood glucose for several months (15Efrat S. Fusco-DeMane D. Lemberg H. al Emran O. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3576-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). They are however rejected when transplanted in NOD mice. 2P. Cattan, J. C. Carrel, C. Boitard, P. Dupraz, S. Cottet, and B. Thorens, unpublished results. These cells thus represent a unique model to evaluate the action of cytokines on β cell function and survival when transplanted in a diabetic environment. We previously demonstrated that Bcl-2 overexpression in βTc-Tet cells increased resistance against certain apoptotic stresses, including staurosporine, hypoxia, and cytokines (17Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here we show that the presence of Bcl-2 did not change the ability of the cells to up-regulate the inos gene and to generate NO in response to IL-1β and IFN-γ. We show that IL-1β receptor signal transduction in mouse β cell is MyD88-mediated and that the use of dominant negative forms of this protein could attenuate IL-1β/IFN-γ-induced NO generation. Furthermore, we showed that the cells overexpressing the MyD88 dominant negative proteins showed increased resistance to cytokine-induced cell death and maintained their insulin secretory response to glucose. However, these cells treated with IFN-γ plus IL-1β or IFN-γ alone showed reduced GSIS, which could be explained by an IFN-γ-induced decrease of their intracellular insulin content and a decrease in the secretory activity stimulated by glucose. βTc-Tet or CDM3D cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 15% horse serum (Amimed), 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

For nitrite secretion measurements, medium was changed to RPMI 1640, which has a lower level of nitrite content. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern (RNA) blot as described previously using specific probes prepared by random primer labeling (18Gremlich S. Bonny C. Waeber G. Thorens B. J. Biol.

High titer stocks of lentiviral vectors packaged by the multiply attenuated lentivirus CMVΔR8.91 and pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus-G envelope protein (plasmid pMD-G) were prepared by transient transfection of 293T cells as described (17Dupraz P.

Viral stocks of LacZ virus were titered on human 293T or rat 208F fibroblasts in six serial dilutions (5- to 3125-fold), and the viral titer was determined by counting the number of blue cell foci per well and dividing by the dilution factor. MyD88 virus titers were determined by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neomycin-resistant colony formation in infected 208F fibroblasts as described (21Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar). Pure viral stocks were tested for the presence of replication competent retroviruses using the HeLa-p4 assay (22Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulus S. Bue H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 561-662Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, target cells were co-cultivated with HeLa-p4 cells for 1 month, and thereafter the HeLa-p4 cells were tested for the presence of β-galactosidase enzymatic activity, or target cell supernatant was applied to virgin HeLa-p4 cells. None of these tests revealed the presence of tat-transducing activity above background level. CDM3D cells were transduced with an multiplicity of infection of 20, and G418 selection (400 μg/ml) was applied 48 h after infection to select the pool of infected cells. 24 h before induction of apoptosis, proliferating or growth-arrested β cells were distributed over poly-lysine-coated 96-well microtiter plates (3 × 103 cells/well). Medium was changed the next day, and the indicated amount of cytokines was added in the presence or absence of tetracycline. The recombinant mouse cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and were used at the indicated final concentration (unit/ml). The percentage of viable, apoptotic, and dead or necrotic cells were assessed as described previously (17Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B.

Medium was removed from the well and replaced with the same volume of medium containing 20 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Fluka) and propidium iodide 10 μg/ml (Sigma). After 5 min at room temperature, the cells were examined with an inverted fluorescence microscope with ultraviolet excitation at 340–380 nm. In each experimental condition at least 500 cells were counted. A control plate was analyzed in parallel to determine spontaneous cell death, which was deduced from the in experimental values. Cells were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 105/well 48 h before incubation with cytokines. Following cytokine exposure for 48 h, cells were then incubated for 1 h in Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4 (KRBH), containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin with 2.8 mm glucose and 250 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma). The medium was changed again with KRBH, 0.5% bovine serum albumin containing 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose and isobutylmethylxanthine. Secreted insulin was quantitated by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research Inc.) as described (17Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B.

Briefly, cells were lysed in 250 μl of 75% ethanol, 1.5% concentrated hydrochloric acid. Aliquots of cell lysates were also analyzed for DNA content (26Rago R. Mitchen J. Wilding G. Anal.

Lysates in acid ethanol were neutralized with one-tenth volume of 1m Na2CO3, and DNA content was determined by fluorescence using a Fluoroskan-II microplate fluorometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) with the excitation filter set at 355 nm and the emission filter set at 460 nm. Nitrite accumulation in the conditioned culture medium was detected spectrophotometrically (at 540 nm) by the Griess reaction in the presence of 1 mmsulfanilamide and 0.1 m HCl (27Green L.C.

Concentrations (picomoles of NO2−/mg of protein) were calculated from the absorption before (A1) and after (A2) the addition of 70 mm naphthylethylenediamine and compared with a standard curve derived from NaNO2 (0 to 20 μm). Values shown are mean ± standard deviation of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The MyD88-lpr or Toll proteins were detected in immunoblot using the anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma) mouse monoclonal antibody as described (11Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L.

The iNOS protein level was determined in cell lysates prepared in 1% Triton X-100, 0.15M sodium chloride, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 with 50 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml of aprotinin at 4 °C for 10 min. Western blot was performed as described previously (28Gremlich S. Roduit R. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3216-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), using a mouse monoclonal anti-iNOS rabbit polyclonal antibody (N32030; Transduction Laboratories). The blot was stripped and reprobed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse actin kindly provided by Dr. G. Gabbiani (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). Densitometry scanning of the blots was performed using the Bio-Rad phosphorimager, IMAGE FX. Cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at a density of 105cells/well 48 h before transfection with the indicated plasmids using the LipofectAMINE-2000 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A total of 1 μg of DNA was transfected. This consisted of 0.2 μg of NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. C. Widmann, Institut of Cellular Biology and Morphology, University of Lausanne), or 0.2 μg of an iNOS-luciferase reporter plasmid (piNOS-1002luc) containing 1002 bp of the rat iNOS promoter linked to luciferase (kindly provided by Dr. D. Eizirik, Diabetes Research Center, Vrij Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium) (29Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), 0.7 μg of MyD88-Toll or MyD88-lpr in the lentiviral vector SIN-18-phosphoglycerate kinase-WHV, and 0.1 μg of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter), that was used to correct for transfection efficiency. 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with cytokines for 3 h, and relative activity of luciferase and β-galactosidase was determined as described (11Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokines on induction of iNOS was tested using the conditionally immortalized murine βTc-Tet cells that had been previously modified to stably express Bcl-2. These cells, referred to as CDM3D, have been shown to be easier to cultivate in standard medium, with a much reduced basal level of apoptosis, to fully conserve the capability of the parental cell line to be growth-arrested by tetracycline, and to secrete insulin with a normal glucose dose dependence (17Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, alone or in various combinations, were tested for their ability to stimulate NO production, as assessed by measuring the amount of nitrite in the supernatant of exposed cells. IL-1β at 10 units/ml combined with IFN-γ at 150 units/ml induced an NO production close to the maximal production achieved when the cells were exposed to a combination of all three cytokines (100 units/ml of IL-1β, 100 units/ml of TNF-α, and 150 units/ml of IFN-γ) (Fig.1 A). Adding IL-1β to higher doses in the presence of 150 units/ml of IFN-γ did not further increase NO production (not shown). Production of NO was associated with an increase in iNOS mRNA levels that also required the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ (same dose as above) (Fig.1 B). CDM3D cells were infected with recombinant lentiviruses directing the expression of the Toll domain or lpr mutant of MyD88 and the neomycin gene. Pools of infected cells were selected and expanded in the presence of G418. The proteins were detected in transiently transfected 293T cells by Western blot analysis (Fig.2 A). In the infected CDM3D cells, a lower level of expression did not permit detection with the FLAG antibody. Expression was however confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). To test whether the MyD88 mutant-expressing cells were still functional in correcting diabetesin vivo, they were implanted under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin-diabetic C3H syngeneic mice. Correction of hyperglycemia was observed for one month, after which the animals were killed (data not shown). CDM3D cells, MyD88-Toll CDM3D, and MyD88-lpr CDM3D cells were exposed to IL-1β/IFN-γ for 18 h, a time that gives the highest expression of iNOS mRNA. Fig. 3 Ashows that the mRNA for iNOS was strongly induced in the CDM3D cells but to a much lesser extent in the MyD88-Toll or lpr-overexpressing β cells. Expression of iNOS protein in CDM3D cells was detected 24 h after initiation of cytokine treatment (Fig.3 B). Inducible NOS was undetectable in the MyD88-Toll CDM3D cells and reduced 4-fold in MyD88-lpr CDM3D cells as compared with parental cells. In agreement with the above results, accumulation of nitrite in the conditioned medium of cytokine-treated cells was decreased by approximately 70% in the two MyD88 mutant-expressing cell lines (Fig. 3 C). NF-κB is the main factor controlling rodent inos gene transcription induced by IL-1β (30Eizirik D.L. Flodstrom M. Karlsen A.E. Welsh N. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether the lack of iNOS mRNA accumulation in the presence of the MyD88 dominant negative proteins was due to impaired activation of NF-κB. To address this question, an NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene and expression vector for either MyD88 dominant negative inhibitor were co-transfected in CDM3D cells. The cells were stimulated with cytokines for 3 h, and luciferase activity was measured. As shown in Fig.4 A, IL-1β/IFN-γ stimulation resulted in 2.9-fold ± 0.3 (n = 3) activation of the NF-κB reporter construct. Interestingly, stimulation with IL-1β only also activated the reporter construct, albeit to a lower level (2.2-fold ± 0.2 (n = 3)). Co-transfection of MyD88-Toll with the NF-κB reporter construct decreased both basal (0.7 ± 0.1 (n = 3,p < 0.05 versus untransfected cells)) and IL-β/IFN-γ-stimulated (1.6 ± 0.3-fold activation (n = 3, p ≤ 0.001)) of transcriptional activity. MyD88-lpr co-expression totally suppressed induction of the NF-κB reporter by both IL-1β or IL-1β and IFN-γ (p < 005, n = 3), and the basal level was again significantly reduced as compared with cells tranfected with the NF-κB reporter only (n = 3,p < 0.05). When an iNOS reporter construct was co-transfected with the MyD88-Toll or lpr proteins (Fig. 4 B) a near complete inhibition of iNOS reporter induction in response to IL-1β/IFN-γ stimulation was observed (Fig. 4 B). As expected, IL-1β alone was unable to induce the iNOS reporter gene even at higher doses (data not shown). In addition the basal level of reporter activity was significantly reduced in both cells as compared with CDM3D cells (p < 0.001, n = 3). We have shown previously that Bcl-2 expression in CDM3D cells conferred partial protection against cytokine-mediated induction of apoptosis (17Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that CDM3D, MyD88-Toll, and MyD88-lpr CDM3D cells were similarly resistant to a combination of 1000 units/ml of TNF-α and IFN-γ. Exposure of the cells to increasing concentrations of IL-1β (10 to 500 units/ml) in the presence of 1000 units/ml of TNF-α and IFN-γ revealed an increased resistance of MyD88 mutant protein-expressing cells to induction of apoptosis. To determine whether expression of MyD88-Toll or MyD88-lpr also protected CDM3D cells from inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by cytokines, we performed secretion experiments on cytokine-treated cells. CDM3D cells, expressing or not expressing the MyD88 mutants, were exposed to 10 units/ml IL-1β, 150 units/ml IFN-γ, or a combination of both for 48 h, and the cells were then exposed to 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose for 1 h after a 1-h preincubation at 2.8 mm glucose. Fig.6 a shows that the rate of insulin secretion at 2.8 mm glucose after the various treatments was similar in the three cell lines. Secretion at 16.7 mm glucose was markedly stimulated in control conditions in the three lines tested, and pre-exposure of the cells to IL-1β did not affect GSIS. However, pretreatment with IFN-γ markedly decreased GSIS in all three lines and had a similar effect as the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ. To determine whether the decrease in GSIS was due to a defect in stimulated exocytosis or to a decrease in insulin content, total cellular insulin content was measured in each condition. Insulin content was slightly, but not significantly, decreased in IL-1β-treated cells but markedly decreased in IFN-γ or IL-1β/IFN-γ-treated cells (Fig. 6 b). This decrease in insulin content could not be explained by a decrease in cell viability, because at the concentrations of cytokines used no apoptosis was detected. Furthermore, measurement of cellular DNA content at the end of the secretion experiments showed similar content in all conditions. When the secretion was expressed as a percent of the total intracellular insulin content (Fig. 6 c), the secretion rate of IFN-γ- and IL-1β/IFN-γ-treated cells was also significantly decreased, whereas the secretion rate of IL-1β-treated cells was not different from that of control cells. Here we studied the effect of cytokines on the mouse CDM3D cells, which were derived from βTc-Tet cells by overexpressing the Bcl-2 gene, and the possibility to further genetically modify these cells to make them resistant to the action of IL-1β. Using CDM3D cells and CDM3D cells expressing MyD88 dominant negative proteins, we showed the following: 1) induction of iNOS gene expression and NO production requires the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ; 2) the IL-1β intracellular signaling pathway leading to iNOS gene expression can be inhibited by MyD88 dominant negative proteins; 3) the presence of these dominant negative proteins improved resistance to cytokine-induced apoptosis, and 4) the reduction of GSIS was not prevented by the MyD88 mutant proteins, because it resulted mostly from the action of IFN-γ on cellular insulin content and on the secretory response. The induction of iNOS mRNA and NO production by the CDM3D cells requires the combined action of IL-1β and IFN-γ. This indicates that both cytokine-dependent intracellular signaling pathways need to be activated to increase iNOS gene expression. These data are similar to those obtained with human β cells where iNOS gene expression also requires the combined exposure to both IL-1β and IFN-γ. This is however in contrast to previous findings by others studying rat islets or purified rat β cells where iNOS gene induction is strongly activated by IL-1β alone (3Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Welsh N. Cetkovic-Cvrlje M. Nieman A. Geller D.A. Pipeleers D.G. Bendtzen K. Hellerstrom C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Rabinovitch A. Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Schulz R. Lakey J.R. Warnock G.L. Rajotte R.V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1058-1062PubMed Google Scholar). From this perspective, studying mouse islets may therefore be more relevant to the understanding of cytokine action on human β cells in the pathogenesis of type I diabetes. However, whether the same intracellular pathways are activated by these cytokines in mouse and human β cells is not yet established. Expression of the Toll domain of MyD88 and of MyD88-lpr markedly reduced activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity in response to IL-1β and IFN-γ and induction of iNOS mRNA, protein expression, and NO production. As these dominant negative forms of MyD88 do not interact with the IFN-γ signaling pathway, these data demonstrate that in the β cell line studied, IL-1β intracellular signaling depends on MyD88 interaction with the IL-1 receptor. This is therefore similar to IL-1 signal transduction in TH-1 cells and macrophages where the absence of MyD88 led to a complete inhibition of NF-κB activation by IL-1β (31Adachi O. Kawai T.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14459-14463Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The fact that NF-κB activation is suppressed in the presence of the MyD88 dominant negative proteins also indicates a critical role for this transcription factor in the control ofinos gene expression in mouse β cells, as previously suggested in studies of rat islet cells (29Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 35Kwon G. Corbett J.A. Rodi C.P. Sullivan P. McDaniel M.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is considerable in vitro data suggesting that NO secreted by β cells could be directly involved in their own demise (2Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 30Eizirik D.L. Flodstrom M. Karlsen A.E. Welsh N. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 36Eizirik D.L. Pavlovic D. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1997; 13: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There is however very little evidence for a toxic effect of NO on β cells in vivo. Circumstantial evidence for NO involvement in β cell destruction comes from study of transgenic NOD mice overexpressing iNOS in their β cells, which showed accelerated appearance of diabetes without insulitis (37Takamura T. Kato I. Kimura N. Nakazawa H. Yonekura H. Takasewa S. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 273: 2493-2496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Another report however showed that islets from iNOS−/− mice transplanted in NOD-severe combined immunodeficient mice were not protected from diabetes transferred by cloned diabetogenic CD4 cells. In this particular experimental system, only TNF-receptor I null islets were able to survive after transplantation (38Pakala S.V. Chivetta M. Kelly C.B. Katz J.D. Journal Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These data therefore suggest that NO production by β cells may not play a major role in islet destruction. Our present data support this previous conclusion. Indeed, NO generated by CDM3D cells in response to IL-1β and IFN-γ seemed to have little role in induction of apoptosis, because at the dose of cytokines that induced an almost maximal production of NO, we could only detect a small rate of cell death. However, further increasing IL-1β concentrations (from 10 to 500 units/ml) increased markedly the rate of apoptosis without increasing significantly NO production. Therefore there is no direct relationship between NO production and induction of cell death. That the IL-1β signaling pathway is involved in inducing cell death is nevertheless indicated by the protection, albeit partial, conferred by expression of MyD88 dominant negative proteins. One way by which IL-1 could induce apoptosis independently of NF-κB/iNOS activation could be by directly activating the c-Jun pathway that is involved in stress-induced apoptosis and that can also be stimulated by IL-1β in β cells (39Welsh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8307-8312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol.

Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is also altered by cytokine treatment. Here we show that exposing CDM3D cells to cytokines reduced GSIS only moderately in the presence of IL-1β, and the reduction was more important in the presence of IFN-γ and similar to that observed when both cytokines were present. This indicates that IFN-γ plays a major role in reducing insulin secretion. The effect of IFN-γ was 2-fold; there was a reduction in cellular insulin content, and when the secretion data are expressed as a percent of the insulin content, it appears that there was also a reduction of the secretory activity stimulated by glucose. IFN-γ may thus decrease insulin gene expression at a pretranslational stage and impair the normal glucose signaling pathway to insulin granules exocytosis. Preliminary data indicated that the reduction in insulin content was indeed proportional to a decrease in cellular insulin mRNA content (not shown). The mechanism by which IFN-γ mediates this inhibition is not yet known and will require further study. Treatment of type I diabetes by cellular transplantation will expose the cells to an environment characterized by reduced oxygen tension and the presence of an inflammatory reaction and/or a reactivated autoimmune system. Cytokines produced in these conditions may impair function and limit survival of the transplanted cells (43Efrat S. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that transferring Bcl-2 into βTc-Tet cells improved their resistance to hypoxia and other stresses (17Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) but does not completely protect against cytokine-induced apoptosis. Here we demonstrated that the stable lentivirus-mediated overexpression of MyD88 dominant negative proteins in CDM3D cells improved resistance to the pro-apoptotic action of cytokines. At the same time the unique characteristics of these cells to be growth-arrested and to properly secrete insulin both in vitro and in vivo are preserved. Transplanting these genetically modified cells in NOD mice will allow us to evaluate whether inhibition of IL-1β signaling pathways may prolong their survival in the autoimmune environment of these mice. We are similarly engineering CDM3D cells to express genes blocking the TNF-α/Fas and/or IFN-γ intracellular signaling pathways. Transplantation of these novel cell lines in NOD mice will allow us to gain some important insight in the role of these cytokines in β cell destruction and to determine whether genetic engineering may confer sufficient protection to allow cell survival after transplantation in a diabetic environment.

Each AChR subunit contains a relatively large amino-terminal extracellular domain of ∼200 amino acids followed by four hydrophobic domains of 20–30 amino acids in length (M1-M4) connected by hydrophilic loops of varying length and ending with a very short extracellular carboxyl terminus (reviewed in Ref. 5Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Springer Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg and Landes Publishing Co., Georgetown, TX1998Crossref Google Scholar). Although the exact topology of the AChR relative to the membrane has not yet been determined unambiguously, it is usually accepted that the four hydrophobic segments M1-M4 correspond to transmembrane (TM) domains (6Blanton M.P.

There is still contradictory evidence on their secondary structure. The original postulation of a four-helix bundle with an all-helical secondary structure (8Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanaba T.

Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) and computer-aided molecular modeling indicating that the dimensions of the AChR TM region are not compatible with a pentameric four-helix bundle (11Ortells, M. O., Barrantes, G. E. & Barrantes, F. J. (1998) in The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends, Barrantes, F. J., ed, pp. 85–108, Springer Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg and Landes Publishing Co., Georgetown.Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis data combined with patch clamp electrophysiology, and results from photoaffinity labeling with noncompetitive channel blockers, support the notion that the M2 domain lines the walls of the ion channel proper and are indicative of α-helical periodicity in the residues exposed to the lumen of the channel (4Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Recent NMR spectroscopy studies of the δM2 segment (12Opella S.J. Marassi F.M.

Biol. 1999; 6: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), indicate that this domain is inserted in the bilayer at an angle of 12° relative to the membrane normal, with no kinks, and in totally α-helical configuration. A synthetic peptide corresponding to theTorpedo αM2 segment in chloroform:methanol containing LiClO4 also adopts a totally α-helical configuration (13Pashkov V.S. Maslennikov I.V. Tchikin L.D. Efremov R.G. Ivanov V.T. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cryoelectron microscopy studies are further interpreted to indicate that the other putative TM domains (M1, M3, and M4) are relatively featureless, with a large portion of the polypeptide chain in an extended (or unresolved) β-sheet configuration, arranged in the form of a large β-barrel outside the central rim of M2 channel-forming rods (9Unwin N.

This interpretation is in contrast to the studies using photoactivatable hydrophobic probes, in which the observed periodicity of the lipid-exposed residues in M4 and M3 is consistent with an α-helical pattern (6Blanton M.P.

Méthot N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 29129-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, secondary structure analysis (CD and FTIR spectroscopy) of isolated and lipid-reconstituted TM AChR peptides indicate α-helical structure for M2, M3, and M4 segments (17Corbin J.

Furthermore, two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the αM3 segment of Torpedo AChR showed a totally α-helical structure (18Lugovskoy A.A. Maslennikov I.V. Utkin Y.N. Tsetlin V.I. Cohen J.B. Arseniev A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a recent NMR study of a synthetic γM4 peptide is also compatible with an α-helical secondary structure (19Williamson P.F. Bonev B. Barrantes F.J. Watts A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 147AGoogle Scholar). In the present work the spatial relationship between membrane-embedded domains of the Torpedo californica AChR and the membrane bilayer was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. The location of the pyrene-labeled cysteine residues with respect to the membrane was determined by differential quenching with spin-labeled lipids. Both in intact AChR and in reconstituted individual TM peptides, Cys residues were located close to the membrane-water interface, as predicted for the segments αM4 and γM4 (6Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Blanton M.P.

In the case of M1 segments, our fluorescence studies indicate that these membrane-embedded domains are not a straight α-helix and/or possess pronounced kinks. Our observations lend support to the hypothesis that M1 membrane-embedded domains in general depart from linear structures, thus extending the conclusion of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis (20Akabas M.H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12496-12500Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), fluorescence (21Kim J. McNamee M.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 771-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) studies on αM1. The spin-labeled fatty acids, derived from the stearic acid substituted on positions 5 (5-SASL, 5-doxylstearic acid), 7 (7-SASL, 7-doxylstearic acid), and 12 (12-SASL, 12-doxylstearic acid), and the equivalent phosphatidylcholine derivative 12-PCSL, were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL. Nitroxide-labeled CSL (3β-doxyl-5α-cholestane spin label) and 3-doxyl-17β-hydroxy-5α-androstane spin label (ASL) were from Aldrich Chemical Co., and used as received. The formula of the spin-labeled lipid analogs are shown in SchemeFSI. Pyrene maleimide (PM) was obtained from Molecular Probes and [125I]TID (10 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Affi-Gel 10 was purchased from Bio-Rad, Genapol C-100 (10%) from Calbiochem, and sodium cholate from Sigma. Asolectin, a crude soybean lipid extract, came from Avanti Polar Lipids and Spectra/Por Dispo Dialyzers (molecular mass cutoff: 2,000 Da) from Spectrum. AChR-rich membranes were isolated from the electric organ of T. californica (Aquatic Research Consultants, San Pedro, CA) according to the procedure of Sobel et al. (22Sobel A. Weber M. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), with the modifications described previously (23Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final membrane suspensions in ∼36% sucrose/0.02% NaN3 were stored at −80 °C. TheTorpedo AChR was solubilized in 1% sodium cholate, and PM (2 mm) was allowed to react with available cysteine residues (1 h incubation). The labeled AChR (PM-labeled AChR) was purified by affinity chromatography in the presence of asolectin lipids. Affinity column purification was performed using an acetylcholine affinity matrix (24Ellena J.F. Blazing M.A. McNamee M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5523-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with a number of modifications (25Blanton M.P. Wang H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1067: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, the affinity column matrix was prepared by coupling cystamine to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad), reduction with dithiothreitol, and final modification with bromoacetylcholine bromide. Affinity purified PM-AChRs were reconstituted with asolectin at a lipid:protein ratio of 800:1 on a mol/mol basis and stored at −80 °C. The ability of PM-AChR to undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions was verified by examining the extent of [125I]TID photoincorporation into PM-AChR subunits in the absence and presence of agonist. The amount of [125I]TID photoincorporation into AChR subunits is ∼10-fold greater in the resting state AChR than in the desensitized state and therefore [125I]TID subunit labeling is an extremely sensitive indicator of the conformational state of the AChR as well as of agonist-induced state transitions (26White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21595-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Blanton M.P. McCardy E.A. Gallagher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3469-3478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments of AChR subunits which contain the M1 or M4 transmembrane segment of the α- and γ-subunit were prepared as described in Corbin et al. (17Corbin J. Méthot N. Wang H.H. Baenziger J.E. Blanton M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 771-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Each TM peptide contains either a single cysteine residue (αM1, γM1, and γM4) or two cysteine residues (αM4), as shown in Scheme FSII. The isolated fragments in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate were reacted with pyrene maleimide (3 mm) overnight. The PM-labeled peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Brownlee Aquapore C4 column (100 × 2.1 mm). Solvent A was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol. The flow rate was maintained at 0.2 ml/min and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Peptides were eluted with a nonlinear gradient from 25 to 100% solvent B in 80 min. The elution of peptides was monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm as well as by fluorescence emission (350 nm excitation, 400 nm emission). Peptide-containing HPLC fractions were pooled and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Peptides were resuspended in 1 ml of 2% octyl-β-glucoside and asolectin lipid in 2% sodium cholate was added to achieve an estimated lipid to peptide molar ratio of ∼200:1. The octyl-β-glucoside and sodium cholate were removed by dialysis using Spectra/Por CE Dispo Dialyzers with a 2000 M rcutoff, for 2 days against phosphate buffer (10 mmphosphate, 5 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). Each sample was concentrated to 200 μl using a Centricon-3 and stored at −80 °C. A small aliquot of each sample was subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis in order to confirm the identity of the peptide and estimate its concentration (αM1, Ile210-Lys242; αM4, Val401-Arg428, γM1, Lys218-Lys251; γM4, Val446-Arg485). An additional aliquot was labeled with the hydrophobic photoreagent [125I]TID. The labeled peptide was resolved on a 1.0-mm thick Tricine gel (28Schagger H. von-Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10502) Google Scholar) and the dried gel subjected to autoradiography. Labeling with [125I]TID served as an additional test of peptide purity and to confirm that no significant peptide aggregation (irreversible) had occurred. Amino-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a Beckman Instruments (Porton) Model 20/20 protein sequencer using gas phase cycles (Texas Tech Biotechnology Core Facility). Peptide aliquots (∼10 μl) were immobilized on chemically modified glass fiber discs (Beckman Instruments), which were used to improve the sequencing yields of hydrophobic peptides. Peptides were subjected to 10 sequencing cycles and initial yield (I o) and repetitive yield (R) were calculated by nonlinear least square regression of the observed release (M) for each cycle (n): M =I o R n . These were carried out using an SLM model 4800 spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) with its cuvette holder thermostated at 20 °C. Whole PM-labeled AChR reconstituted in asolectin was made to a final concentration of 0.05 μm in 5 × 5-mm quartz cuvettes. Fluorescence quenching was carried out with nitroxide spin-labeled phosphatidylcholine (12-PCSL), spin-labeled cholestane (CSL), and androstane (ASL), and the spin-labeled stearic acid analogs 5-SASL, 7-SASL, and 12-SASL. The highest nitroxide concentration employed was 24 μm. Lipid concentration was kept at 37 μm. In the case of PM-labeled AChR peptide fragments, they were resuspended at a final concentration of 0.05 μm. Lipid concentration was 8 μm. Titration with spin-labeled probes was made up to a final concentration of 8 μm. Pyrene was excited at λexc = 345 nm and its emission was monitored at λem = 382 nm. Slits of 5 nm were used in both monochromators. Relevant corrections were taken into account, as follows: (i) inner filter effect due to the quencher absorption. The nitroxide labels used have a weak absorption in the UV, λ430 nm = 14m−1 cm−1 (29Green S.A. Simpson D.J. Zhou G. Ho P.S. Blough N.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7337-7346Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). From the absorption tail a value of E = 100m−1 at the pyrene excitation wavelength (λexc = 345 nm) is determined. The molar absorptivity of pyrene is 38,000 (30Narayanaswami V. Kim J. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12413-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From Equation 1 the correction factor C for the fluorescence intensity is obtained as,C=(Atotal/Af)×((1−10f−A)/(1−10total−A))Equation 1 where A f is the pyrenyl absorption andA total the absorption of both PM-labeled AChR (or peptide) and nitroxide spin label. Under the experimental conditions used, this factor amounts to only 0.2% for the highest concentration of nitroxide used. (ii) Effective quencher concentration in the membrane. The determination of effective spin label concentrations in the membrane volume [Q]L, should take into account the different incorporation of the various fatty acid probes in the bilayer described by its partition constantK p. This was carried out using the relationship (31Castanho M. Prieto M. Acuña A.U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar),[Q] L=(Kp/(1+(Kp−1)*γL*[L])*[Q] TEquation 2 where γL is the lipid molar volume and [Q]Tthe analytical quencher concentration. The partition constants used for the spin-labeled fatty acids are: 9.6 × 104 (5-SASL), 9.8 × 104 (7-SASL), and 2.9 × 104(12-SASL) (32Blatt E. Chatelier R.C. Saywer W.H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 39: 477-483Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These values are reported for a lipid system also in the fluid phase (egg phosphatidylcholine), and at 25 °C, a temperature close to the one used in this work. It should be stressed that since the partition constants depend on the mean occupation number of the quencher in the lipid structure, the ones corresponding to the lower occupation numbers were used. Incorporation of the ASL, CSL, and 12-PCSL was considered to be quantitative. For the lipid molar volume the value γL = 0.95 dm3 mol−1was used, as estimated from published data (33Cornell B.A. Separovic F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 733: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34Lewis B.A. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The values for [Q]L were also corrected for the dilution effect due to the quencher incorporation. (iii) Blank intensity corrections. Fluorescence intensities in the absence (F o) and the presence (F) of quencher were corrected by subtracting intensities measured upon injection of an equivalent amount of the ethanol solution according to Equation 3,(Fo/F) corr=1/(1−(F/Fo) ethanol+(F/Fo) Q)Equation 3 From the fluorescence quenching data, Stern-Volmer plots were obtained according to Equation 4,(Fo/F)=1+Ksv[Q] LEquation 4 where F o and F correspond to the fluorescence emission of pyrene-labeled AChR or transmembrane fragments in the absence and presence of spin-labeled lipids and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher. Plots ofF o/F versus [Q] yield a slope equal to K sv, the Stern-Volmer constant,i.e. the product of the bimolecular rate constantk q and the fluorophore lifetime (τ) (dynamic mechanism), which was considered invariant for all the fragments.K sv is a measure of the quencher concentration in the fluorophore vicinity, which allowed us to obtain topological information on the labeled cysteine transverse location. Any contribution from static quenching does not hamper the conclusions regarding the topography of the cysteine with respect to the membrane bilayer, as dealt with in a previous publication (31Castanho M. Prieto M. Acuña A.U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For labeling of the intact AChR at free cysteine residues, the AChR was solubilized from T. californica AChR-rich membranes in 1% sodium cholate and allowed to react with PM (2 mm) for 1 h. The PM-labeled AChR was then affinity purified and reconstituted into asolectin lipid vesicles (see “Experimental Procedures”). SDS-PAGE of PM-labeled AChRs showed that the majority of the fluorescence is localized in the α- and γ-subunits. The fluorescence was further mapped to large proteolytic fragments of the α- and γ-subunits: α-V8-20 (Ser173-Glu338), α-V8-10 (Asn339-Gly437), γ-V8-24 (Ala167-Glu372), and γ-V8-14 (Leu373-Pro489) (Fig.1 A). In the fragment α-V8-10 there are only two cysteine residues, Cys412 and Cys418, both of which are located in the transmembrane segment M4. In α-V8-20 there are three cysteine residue, Cys222 in the transmembrane segment M1 and Cys192 and Cys193 which are located extracellularly and contribute to the agonist recognition site. In the intact AChR, Cys192 and Cys193 form a vicinal disulfide bond leaving Cys222 as the site of reaction with PM. The ability of PM-labeled AChRs to undergo agonist-induced state transitions was tested by measuring the agonist sensitivity of the AChR with the hydrophobic photoreactive probe [125I]TID. The extent of [125I]TID photoincorporation into AChR subunits is ∼10-fold greater in the resting state AChR than in the desensitized state, and in the resting state the extent of [125I]TID incorporation into the γ-subunit is ∼4-fold greater than that into the α-, β-, or δ-subunit (22Sobel A. Weber M. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 23Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For PM-labeled AChRs we also found a greater extent of [125I]TID incorporation into the γ-subunit relative to the other subunits and the addition of agonist results in a substantial reduction of subunit labeling, indicating that labeled AChRs retain the ability to undergo agonist-induced state transitions (data not shown). Peptides containing the TM segments αM1 (Ile210-Lys242), αM4 (Tyr401-Arg429), γM1 (Lys218-Lys251), and γM4 (Val446-Arg485) were isolated from proteolytic digests and receptor subunits and their identity confirmed by amino-terminal sequence analysis (15Blanton M.P. McCardy E.A. Huggins A. Parikh D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14545-14555Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (see Scheme FSII). Peptides were labeled with PM and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Fig.1 B shows the reverse-phase HPLC elution profile of the fragment αIle210-Lys242, which contains the transmembrane segment αM1. Peak HPLC fractions (arrow) were pooled, the solvent removed, the peptide resuspended in detergent (octyl-β-glucoside) and reconstituted into asolectin lipid vesicles. The fluorescence spectrum of whole PM-labeled AChR reconstituted into asolectin vesicles consisted of only pyrenyl monomer emission (Fig.2 a). The extrinsic fluorescence of pyrene-labeled AChR was quenched with three different types of nitroxide spin-labeled lipid analogs: (a) 12-PCSL; (b) the CSL and ASL, with the nitroxide group at carbon 3; and (c) spin-labeled stearic acid analogs, with the nitroxide group at positions 5, 7, and 12 along the acyl chain (5-SASL, 7-SASL, and 12-SASL). Fig. 2 b depicts the Stern-Volmer plot of whole AChR quenching by spin-labeled lipid analogs. No deviation from linearity is apparent, and the data were therefore not fitted to a model assuming a fraction of non-accessible fluorophores (e.g. Ref. 35Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar).

In the case of spin-labeled stearic acid derivatives, the 5-SASL isomer quenched more effectively than the 7-SASL and the 12-SASL analogs (Table I), indicating a superficial location of the cysteine-bound pyrenes. PM-labeled AChR TM peptides (see Scheme FSII) were reconstituted into asolectin vesicles and studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon excitation at 345 nm, pyrenyl monomer emission with maxima at 382 and 402 nm was observed in all cases (Fig.3). For the γM4 fragment, an additional weak emission from the single tryptophan residue (Trp453) was observed upon excitation at a wavelength corresponding to intrinsic fluorescence (λexc = 280 nm, not shown). Although αM4 possesses two cysteine residues, and hence two potential pyrene tags, pyrenyl emission was not observed to be any stronger with this TM fragment, nor was there any indication of pyrenyl excimer emission (λem = 480 nm). Upon addition of the quenchers, a decrease in intensity was observed in all cases (Fig. 4 and Table I). As is observed for αM4 in Fig. 4, the Stern-Volmer plot shows a linear dependence. The two cysteines in αM4 are several residues apart, and are thus likely to exhibit different accessibility to the quenchers. If the two Cys residues had reacted with PM, a deviation from linearity would result; this is not the case (Fig. 4). Thus, of the two potential tags only a single cysteine in αM4 appears to have reacted to any significant extent (Cys412 or Cys418). Furthermore, and on the basis of previous studies showing that Cys412 exhibits a preferential reactivity to structurally diverse hydrophobic probes (15Blanton M.P. McCardy E.A. Huggins A. Parikh D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14545-14555Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is likely that Cys412is the residue labeled with pyrene in αM4. Quenching of the pyrenyl fluorescence in the other TM fragments followed the same pattern as that of αM4. The use of a families of nitroxide spin-labeled analogs having known graded series of depths in the membrane has set the experimental basis (30Narayanaswami V. Kim J. McNamee M.G.

From inspection of Table I it can be concluded that the fluorophore is in all cases very close to the membrane-water interface: quenching is highest for 5-SASL, much lower, similar values are obtained for 7-SASL and 12-SASL. The very high value of 5-SASL compared with the nearby located 7-SASL points to a very specific location of the former at a shallow position in the membrane. The quenching efficiency for CSL was determined for the γM4 fragment (Table I). The absolute value of"

To establish the position of PAX4 in the hierarchy of factors controlling islet cell development, we examined the control of the human PAX4 gene promoter. In both cell lines and transgenic animals, a 4.9-kilobase pair region directly upstream of the human PAX4 gene transcriptional start site acts as a potent pancreas-specific promoter. Deletion mapping experiments demonstrate that a 118-base pair region lying approximately 1.9 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start site is both necessary and sufficient to direct pancreas-specific expression. Serial deletions through this region reveal the presence of positive elements that bind several pancreatic transcription factors as follows: the POU homeodomain factor HNF1α, the orphan nuclear receptor HNF4α, the homeodomain factor PDX1, and a heterodimer composed of two basic helix-loop-helix factors. Interestingly, mutations in the genes encoding four of these factors cause a dominantly inherited form of human diabetes called Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young. In addition, PAX4 itself has at least two high affinity binding sites within the promoter through which it exerts a strong negative autoregulatory effect.

Within the forming pancreas, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor neurogenin3 functions as a pro-endocrine gene, initiating the program of endocrine differentiation in selected cells (10Gradwohl G.

The complete differentiation and maturation of the endocrine cells requires additional factors, including neuroD1/BETA2 (12Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.J.

Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Once neurogenin3 expression sets a progenitor cell on a course of endocrine differentiation, additional factors are necessary to determine which of the four endocrine cell types it will become. One of these islet cell-type determination factors is the paired homeodomain transcription factor PAX4. PAX4 functions as a potent transcriptional repressor and is expressed only transiently in the fetal pancreas, peaking during the period of beta and delta cell differentiation (16Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mice with a targeted disruption of the pax4 gene have a marked decrease in beta and delta cells with a commensurate increase in alpha cells (17Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Torres M. Oliver G. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 386: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), suggesting that PAX4 functions by repressing the alpha cell differentiation program and thereby deviates cells from a default alpha cell fate to an alternate beta or delta cell fate. In this model, once beta/delta cell type fate has been set, PAX4 expression is switched off. To understand the mechanisms that control the expression of PAX4 and thereby impact endocrine cell type fate decisions, we mapped and characterized the regulatory regions of the human PAX4 gene. We found that a small promoter element lying approximately 1.9 kb1 upstream from the transcription start site of the PAX4 gene is both necessary and sufficient to drive pancreas-specific expression. Remarkably, this sequence contains at least four functionally important binding sites for transcription factors, including four factors, HNF4α, HNF1α, pdx1, and neuroD1, that have been implicated in human beta cell dysfunction and early onset diabetes. Simultaneous exogenous expression of the above factors can stimulate the activity of the defined promoter element by 9-fold in a fibroblast cell line. In addition, thePAX4 gene promoter contains several binding sites for PAX4 itself, suggesting a model in which PAX4 inhibits its own expression, providing transient, self-limited expression of the PAX4gene during pancreatic development. The 5′ ends of human and murine PAX4 cDNA were identified by 5′-RACE, using a modification of the protocol from the 5′-RACE System 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2.5 pmol of either human PAX4-specific primer (5′-ggacactcacccttcagctg-3′) or murine PAX4 primer (5′-tcacacagccattagata-3′) were annealed to 1 μg of human islet RNA or murine E15.5 fetal pancreas RNA. Reverse transcription was carried out using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After first strand synthesis, the mRNA template was digested with RNase, and a homopolymeric tail added to the 3′ end using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. 35 cycles of primary PCR were used to amplify fragments, followed by 35 cycles of nested PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions, using Universal Amplification primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) in conjunction with PAX4-specific primers: human primer 1 (5′-ggcaattcgagccaccacag-3′) and primer 2 (5′-gcggatccaatgccctttggctccaag-3′); murine primer 1 (5′-ggctccgtgaaatgtcacag-3′) and primer 2 (5′-ttgctagctgcacaatctgc-3′). PCR products were subcloned into BluescriptII (Stratagene) and sequenced. NIH3T3, αTC1.6, and βTC3 cells were cultured as described previously (18German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transiently transfected using TRANSFAST lipid reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of DNA were transfected per million cells. Where expression vectors were cotransfected, 0.2 μg were transfected per million cells. Cells were harvested and extracts assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (19German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) using 2 μg of cellular protein extract. The human PAX4 gene was obtained from human cosmid clone g1572c264, and the sequences between −4958 bp and +46 relative to the transcription start site were subcloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the pFOXLuc1 plasmid (20German M. Wang J. Fernald A. Espinosa R. LeBeau M. Bell G. Genomics. 1994; 24: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of the PAX4 promoter and a full-length promoter with a deletion between −1963 and −1845 bp were amplified by PCR from the full-length promoter and confirmed by sequencing. The construction of the plasmid expressing luciferase under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat has been described previously (21deWet J. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helsinki D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). Construction of pBAT12.mPAX4, the DNA plasmid expressing mouse PAX4 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early gene promoter, has been described previously (16Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mutations in the paired domain (S43P and R44P) and the homeodomain (N220P and R222P) in the mouse PAX4 cDNA were produced in the pBAT12.mPAX4 plasmid and confirmed by sequencing. Each mutation has previously been shown to disrupt DNA binding through the paired domain and homeodomain, respectively (22Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O.

Two complementary oligonucleotides encompassing the pancreas-specific domain of the human PAX4 promoter (bp −1960 to −1909, 5′-gatctggcaagacctttgagttaatgtataattgtgagcagatggcggggg-3)′ were ligated into BglII/BamHI sites upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK −109 to + 51bp) promoter driving luciferase expression in the pFOXluc1 vector and confirmed by sequencing. The construction of thein vitro expression vector containing the mouse PAX4 cDNA has been described previously (16Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We used a carboxyl-terminally truncated PAX4 cDNA terminating at codon 274 because the synthesis of full-length PAX4 is less efficient but gives the same binding specificity (16Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); all results with truncated PAX4 were confirmed with full-length PAX4. The mouse PAX6 expression vector (pmPAX6) (24Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) was a gift from M. Busslinger, Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria. PAX4 and PAX6 proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/translation reaction, using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded oligonucleotide probes were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled oligonucleotides were column-purified and annealed to an excess of the complementary strand. EMSA buffers and electrophoresis conditions were as described previously (18German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) per lane. For PAX4 and PAX6 protein, 1 μl of the 50-μl in vitro translation reaction mix was added. Where antisera were used, 1 μl was added to the binding reaction 10 min prior to probe addition. HNF4α and HNF1α antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; PDX1 antisera were raised against bacterially expressed PDX1. Blocking peptides were added at a concentration of 1 μg per 10-μl binding reaction 10 min prior to the addition of probe. Unlabeled competing oligonucleotides were added at a 50-fold excess. The oligonucleotide probes used in EMSA, and their locations in relation to the transcriptional start site for the gene are shown (top strand) as follows: rat insulin I C2, bp −328 to −304, 5′-ctgggaaatgaggtggaaaatgctc-3′; rat insulin I E2, bp −242 to −234, 5′-gatcccaggccatctggcccg-3′; human PAX4 H4, bp −1960 to −1939, 5′-gtggcaagacctttgagttaa-3′; human PAX4 TAAT1/2, bp −1950 to −1926, 5′-tttgagttatgtataatgtgag-3′; human PAX4 E, bp −1928 to −1907, 5′-ttgtgagcagatggcgggggct-3′; human PAX4 TAAT 3/4, bp −1886 to −1860, 5′-ccagctaatgagggacaattagcccca-3′; human PAX4 P4.1; bp −4629 to −4583, 5′-gataagcagggtggaaaccggaatgatccatgtaataatggatta-3′; human PAX4 P4.2; bp −4164 to −4116, 5′-cccaattgtcaaaggtggaataatttgatcaacaaaataatgtattg-3′. All of EMSA results shown are typical of those seen on at least three separate occasions. RT-PCR was performed as described previously (16Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using cDNA from mPAC. αTC1.6, βTC3, and NIH3T3 cell lines, adult rat liver and purified islets, and dated mouse embryonic pancreas. The primers used to amplify all cDNAs were separated by an intron to distinguish contaminating genomic DNA from cDNA. Primer sequences for HNF4α amplification were primer 1 (5′-tgccctctcacctcagcaatg-3′) and primer 2 (5′-cccctcagcacacggttttg-3′). Products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The identity of PCR products was confirmed by cloning into the TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequencing. Both the wild-type full-length PAX4 promoter and the promoter containing a deletion between −1963 to −1845 were cloned into KpnI/XhoI sites upstream of the β-galactosidase gene in the plasmid pβgal-Enhancer (CLONTECH). The plasmid was linearized and microinjected (1.5 ng/μl) into murine pronuclei. Injected embryos were transferred to pseudopregnant females, and the fetal pancreata were harvested at E14.5. Tissues genotyping positive by PCR for the transgene were fixed for 30 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated overnight in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (400 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Tissues were then fixed again in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5 μm, and used for immunohistochemistry as described previously (2Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Commercially available primary antibodies were used for staining of glucagon (dilution 1:10000) and insulin (1:8000) (Linco Research Immunoassay) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The rabbit antisera raised against mouse neurogenin3 has been described previously (25Schwitzgebel V.M. Scheel D.W. Conners J.R. Kalamaras J.R. Lee J.E. Anderson D.J. Sussel L. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Development. 2000; 127: 3533-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were linked to alkaline phosphatase (insulin and glucagon) or peroxidase (neurogenin3) used at a dilution of 1:5000. Vector Red (Vector Laboratories) was used as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase staining. By using RNA purified from adult human islets and from embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) fetal mouse pancreas, the pancreatic transcription start sites of the human and murinePAX4 genes were determined by 5′-RACE. Although not identical, the 5′-RACE products identify tightly clustered start sites and the same first intron in both genes (Fig.1 A). Interestingly the pancreatic transcripts contain an additional two exons compared with the transcript previously characterized from human placenta (26Tao T. Wasson J. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Behn P.S. Chayen S. Duprat L. Meyer J. Glaser B. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To establish whether the 5′-flanking sequences can act as a cell-specific promoter, approximately 5 kb of flanking sequence was amplified by PCR from human cosmid clone g1572c264. The full-length promoter (−4958 bp) and four 5′-truncated promoters were placed in front of a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into the pancreatic beta cell line βTC3, the pancreatic alpha cell line αTC1.6, and non-islet NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B). Removal of the region between −4958 and −2153 bp increases reporter activity in all cell types, and deletion of sequences between −2153 and −1614 bp markedly decreases promoter activity in the pancreatic cell lines. An additional (although smaller) decrease in pancreatic promoter activity results from the deletion of sequence from −1614 to −1078 bp. Addition of 5′ genomic sequences between +46 bp and the translation start site at +2543 bp gives no increase in promoter activity (data not shown). Inspection of the promoter sequence between −2153 and −1614 bp reveals several potential binding sites for pancreatic transcription factors, all clustered between −1960 and −1861 bp (Fig.2 A). These include a potential HNF4α-binding site (27Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), four TAAT sequences that are commonly found in homeodomain protein-binding sites, and an E box, a recognition sequence for the binding of basic helix-loop-helix protein (bHLH). To test the importance of these potential binding sites, a series of small deletions were made between −1960 and −1866 bp in the PAX4 promoter (Fig. 2 B). In the βTC3 cells, removal of each of these sites in series, the potential HNF4α site (deletion −1947), TAAT1 and -2 (deletion −1930), the E box (deletion −1909), and TAAT3 and -4 (deletion 1866), produces a stepwise reduction in promoter activity. By contrast, in αTC1.6 cells, only the last of these deletions (TAAT3 and -4, −1866) significantly reduces promoter activity. We also deleted the sequences between −1963 and −1845 bp in the intact PAX4 promoter to test the importance of the pancreas-specific element in the context of the full-length promoter. In the βTC3 cells, this deletion completely disables the promoter (Fig.3 A). In addition, a single copy of the 5′ portion of the pancreas-specific element (−1960 to −1909 bp) can function as a pancreas-specific enhancer when linked to a heterologous promoter, the TK promoter from the herpes simplex virus (Fig. 3 B). Although the enhancement given by the pancreas-specific element is small (2-fold), this represents a significant increase above the high basal activity of the TK promoter. With two copies of the (−1960 to −1909) region ligated 5′ of the TK promoter, reporter gene activity increases to 12-fold above the basal level in βTC3 but not 3T3 cells (Fig. 3 B). Whereas the pancreas-specific element may be essential for the function of the PAX4 promoter in βTC3 and αTC1.6 cells, these tumor cells may not be representative of the cells in the developing pancreas where PAX4 is predominantly expressed. Therefore, we produced mice carrying a transgene with the −4958-bp human PAX4 promoter driving the bacterial gene encoding β-galactosidase. Initial analysis of mice harvested at E12.5 reveals that β-galactosidase expression is restricted to the pancreas (Fig. 4). Additional founder mice were harvested at embryonic day 14.5, 24 h after the peak of PAX4 mRNA expression in the fetal pancreas (16Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) for further analysis (Fig. 5). Out of 12 independent transgenic founders, strong β-galactosidase activity was detected in the pancreas of 8. In contrast, in a parallel experiment, no β-galactosidase activity was detectable in 9 founders using the −4958-bp promoter with the sequences between −1963 and −1845 bp (the pancreas-specific element) deleted. In the transgenic mice carrying the wild-type promoter construct, we used immunohistochemistry to identify the cells expressing β-galactosidase. The β-galactosidase expressing cells are located predominantly in the central area of the pancreas where the main ducts lie and endocrine cell genesis normally occurs. Most of the insulin-expressing cells at this stage also express β-galactosidase, but there are also many non-insulin-expressing cells that express β-galactosidase. Occasional cells co-express glucagon and β-galactosidase; but these cells are uncommon; and most alpha cells do not express β-galactosidase. Interestingly, not all β-galactosidase expressing cells express pdx1, and a subset express neurogenin3, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and a marker for islet cell precursors (11Apelqvist A. Li H. Sommer L. Beatus P. Anderson D.J. Honjo T. Hrabe de Angelis M. Lendahl U. Edlund H. Nature. 1999; 400: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 25Schwitzgebel V.M. Scheel D.W. Conners J.R. Kalamaras J.R. Lee J.E. Anderson D.J. Sussel L. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Development. 2000; 127: 3533-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that the PAX4 promoter is active in beta cell precursors and possibly occasionally in alpha cell precursors as well. To identify nuclear factors that bind to the pancreas-specific element in the PAX4 promoter, we synthesized a series of oligonucleotides spanning the transcriptionally active region and tested them for binding to nuclear proteins by electromobility shift assay (EMSA). An oligonucleotide (H4) encompassing the putative HNF4α-binding site binds to a low mobility complex present in liver and βTC3 cell nuclear extracts. The mobility of this complex from both liver and βTC3 cells is retarded (supershifted) by the addition of antisera directed to the carboxyl terminus of mouse HNF4α, an effect that is prevented by the addition of excess HNF4α carboxyl-terminal peptide (Fig. 6 A). A similar complex and supershifted complex is not seen in nuclear extracts from αTC1.6 cells (data not shown). In addition, in vitro produced HNF4α protein readily binds to the H4 oligonucleotide (data not shown). These results demonstrate that HNF4α is present in the βTC3 cell line and binds to the H4 site. HNF4α expression has previously been demonstrated in the pancreas but with unspecified cellular distribution (28Miquerol L. Lopez S. Cartier N. Tulliez M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8944-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Duncan S.A. Manova K. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Weinstein D.C. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To assess the expression of HNF4α in the fetal pancreas when the PAX4 gene is actively transcribed, we gauged HNF4α mRNA expression by RT-PCR and found that HNF4α mRNA peaks in the pancreas at E13.5 (Fig. 6 B), in parallel with the peak of PAX4 mRNA (16Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Unlike PAX4, however, HNF4α mRNA persists in the adult islet at detectable levels. Two HNF4α-derived PCR products of very similar size were detected in the products depicted in Fig. 6 B; these were sequenced and represent two previously reported alternate splice forms of HNF4α mRNA (30Sladek F.M. Ruse Jr., M.D. Nepomuceno L. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6509-6522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, no HNF4α mRNA was detected in αTC1.6 cells consistent with the observation that removal of the H4 site had no effect on PAX4 promoter activity in these cells. An oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide TAAT 1/2) containing the 5′ two TAAT sequences binds three major complexes (Fig.7 A). The lowest mobility complex present in pancreatic cell types is shifted by HNF1α antiserum (Fig. 7 A). The highest mobility complex in βTC3 extracts is recognized by pdx1 antiserum (Fig. 7 B). The αTC1.6 nuclear extract produces a complex with the same mobility but less intensity than the PDX1 band in βTC3 extracts, but this complex is not recognized by the pdx1 antiserum (data not shown). The E box in the pancreas-specific element from the PAX4 promoter is identical to the conserved 8-base pair sequence of the E boxes present in the human and rat insulin promoters. As shown in Fig. 7 C, identical slow migrating complexes present in both αTC1.6 and βTC3 extracts bind to both the human insulin promoter E1 element and the PAX4 promoter E element (oligonucleotide E). This complex has previously been shown to consist of a heterodimer containing ubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins such as E2A gene products (31Aronheim A. Ohlsson H. Park C.W. Edlund T. Walker M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3893-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32German M.S. Blanar M.A. Nelson C. Moss L.G. Rutter W.J. Mol.

Stellrecht C.M. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), a protein of limited tissue distribution. Finally, an oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide TAAT3/4) containing the two 3′ TAAT sequences binds three complexes recognized by pdx1 antiserum in βTC3 extracts (Fig. 7 D). Whereas one of the two more slowly migrating complexes most likely results from PDX1 binding to both TAAT sites, the other band probably is produced by interactions with an additional protein, such as PBX1 (36Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To test the ability of the identified transcription factors to activate the pancreas-specific element in a non-pancreatic cell line, we expressed each of the factors in 3T3 fibroblast cells along with a luciferase reporter construct driven by two copies of pancreas-specific element upstream of the minimal TK promoter. Although no single cDNA activates the pancreas-specific element (Fig. 8 A), a combination of the transcription factors can activate the construct up to 9-fold (Fig. 8 B). We also tested the ability of neurogenin3 to replace neuroD1 in this combination of factors because neurogenin3 is expressed abundantly in some progenitor cells that express PAX4 in vivo (Fig. 5). Neurogenin3 and neuroD1 are closely related, and when dimerized with Pan1/E47 both bind to the same E box consensus sequence(37). 2H. Watada and M. German, unpublished data. Although the complex in βTC3 nuclear extract that binds to the E box in the pancreas-specific element does not include neurogenin3 (data not shown), neurogenin3 is expressed at much lower levels in βTC3 cells than in the embryonic pancreas (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Expressing neurogenin3 in place of neuroD1 in the transcription factor combination results in a further increase in the activity of the pancreas-specific element in 3T3 cells (Fig. 8 B). Inspection of the PAX4 promoter sequence reveals a number of sequence elements that match or closely resemble the consensus DNA binding sequence for the PAX4 protein (38Smith K.M. Olson D.C.

https://openalex.org/W2031985455,"It has been proposed that the cortical actin filament networks act as a cortical barrier that must be reorganized to enable docking and fusion of the synaptic vesicles with the plasma membranes. We identified a novelneuron-associated developmentallyregulated protein, designated as Nadrin. Expression of Nadrin is restricted to neurons and correlates well with the differentiation of neurons. Nadrin has a unique structure; it contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain for Rho family GTPases, a potential coiled-coil domain, and a succession of 29 glutamines. In vitro the GAP domain activates RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 GTPases. Expression of Nadrin in NIH3T3 cells markedly reduced the number of the actin stress fibers and the formation of the ruffled membranes, suggesting that Nadrin regulates actin filament reorganization. In PC12 cells, Nadrin colocalized with synaptotagmin in the neurite termini and also with cortical actin filaments in the subplasmalemmal regions. Expression of Nadrin or its mutant composed of the coiled-coil and GAP domain enhanced Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of PC12 cells, but a mutant lacking the GAP domain inhibited exocytosis. These results suggest that Nadrin plays a role in regulating Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, most likely by catalyzing GTPase activity of Rho family proteins and by inducing the reorganization of the cortical actin filaments.

In PC12 cells, Nadrin colocalized with synaptotagmin in the neurite termini and also with cortical actin filaments in the subplasmalemmal regions. Expression of Nadrin or its mutant composed of the coiled-coil and GAP domain enhanced Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of PC12 cells, but a mutant lacking the GAP domain inhibited exocytosis. These results suggest that Nadrin plays a role in regulating Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, most likely by catalyzing GTPase activity of Rho family proteins and by inducing the reorganization of the cortical actin filaments. guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate bovine serum albumin GTPase-activating protein green fluorescent protein growth hormone glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction Neurotransmitter release, a fundamental step in the process of synaptic transmission, is accomplished by the rapid membrane fusion of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles with the target plasma membrane (1Calakos N.

The actin cytoskeleton has been proposed to play a number of roles in regulated exocytosis, particularly in endocrine and neural cells (3Trifaro J.M. Vitale M.L.

Morphological studies on chromaffin and neural cells demonstrated that most of the secretory vesicles are positioned at a distance of ∼250 nm from the plasma membranes, suggesting the presence of a physical barriers to the movement of secretary vesicles toward the release site on plasma membranes (5Burgoyne R.D.

Localization of actin filaments using anti-actin antibodies or fluorescence-labeled phalloidin on the secretory cells has shown the presence of actin filament networks underneath the presynaptic plasma membranes and disassembly of the cortical actin filament network upon activation of the secretory cells (7Vitale M.L.

It has been proposed that the cortical actin filament networks act as a reservoir of vesicles ready for docking at the release sites and as a cortical barrier that must be reorganized to enable docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with plasma membranes. Although several actin-depolymerizing proteins that mediate the actin filament disassembly, such as scinderin and gelsolin, are proposed to regulate filament disassembly and exocytosis (11Vitale M.L. Rodriguez Del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaro J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaro J.M.

Acta. 1995; 11: 85-91Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms underlying the precise regulation of actin filament networks during neurotransmitter release remain unknown. The Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins are molecular switches that regulate numerous cellular functions by controlling intracellular signaling events (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTP-binding proteins, consisting of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 proteins, regulate a number of cellular functions that require the reorganization of actin-based structures (15Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Recent investigations lead to the idea that Rho family proteins are also involved in signaling pathways that control actin filament reorganization during exocytosis. In chromaffin cells, RhoA is specifically associated with the membrane of secretory chromaffin granules and is suggested to control the priming of exocytosis by modifying the cortical actin network (17Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Popoff M.R. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20564-20571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P.

In mast cells, activation of GTP-binding proteins by GTPγS1 induces reorganization of actin filaments (19Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The expression of constitutively active mutants of either RhoA, Rac, Cdc42 proteins enhanced regulated exocytosis, and inhibition of endogenous Rac and Rho activities reduces the secretory response (20Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1429-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Brown A.M. O'Sullivan A.J. Gomperts B.D. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 7: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Rac and Rho are components of the signaling pathways that lead to the cytoskeleton reorganization necessary for exocytosis. The GTP-binding proteins cycle between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. This process is regulated by three types of factors: guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which stimulate the interconversion of the GDP-bound inactive form to GTP-bound active form; guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, which inhibit this reaction; and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate conversion from the GTP-bound form to GDP-bound form (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 23Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 245: 641-645Google Scholar). GAPs for Rho family of GTP-binding proteins belong to a family whose members share significant sequence homology in a conserved GAP domain, the RhoGAP domain (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). More than 15 proteins containing RhoGAP domains have been identified in mammalian cells, and these proteins are suggested to serve as downstream effectors in signal transduction events as well as controlling the activities of Rho family proteins (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 24Tatsis N. Lannigan D.A. Macara I.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Among these regulators of GTP-binding proteins, Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors was shown to be involved in regulated exocytosis (26Komuro R. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Orita S. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but the roles of GAPs or guanine nucleotide exchange factors in the process of exocytosis remain unknown. We report here the identification of a novelneuron-associated developmentallyregulated protein, Nadrin. Nadrin contains the conserved GAP domain that is active on the Rho family proteins, and it colocalized with the cortical actin filaments in PC12 cells. Expression of either the entire protein or various domains of Nadrin in PC12 cells cotransfected with growth hormone strongly affects high K+-induced growth hormone secretion. The expression of Nadrin is restricted to neuronal cells and is highly correlated with maturation of the central nervous system. We propose that Nadrin plays an important role in controlling neurotransmitter release by regulating reorganization of the cortical actin filament network in nerve endings. A λgt11 cDNA library constructed from the brain of an 8-wk-old female Wistar rat was screened by using monoclonal antibody 3A10, as described previously (27Harada A. Takeuchi K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Positive clones were purified by successive rounds of plaque purification. cDNA inserts were subcloned into a pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The library was rescreened with a partial cDNA probe of Nadrin from clone N (Ref. 27Harada A. Takeuchi K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar; GenBankTMaccession number AF022966) by DNA hybridization. Positive clones were purified, and cDNA inserts were subcloned into a pBluescript vector. The samples were sequenced on an ALFred DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an AutoCycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequence analyses were performed using Genetix Version 10.0 (Software Development Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and data base searches were performed using BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) and FASTA programs (29Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). The Nadrin amino acid sequence was analyzed using the COILS version 2.2 (30Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the PEST find programs (31Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). An expression vector for the GAP domain of Nadrin fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was made by subcloning the cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 218–482 of Nadrin into a pGEX-vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An expression vector for the GAP domain of 3BP-1 (amino acids 184–420) (32Cicchetti P. Ridley A.J. Zheng Y. Cerione R.A. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was made similarly. GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5αEscherichia coli cells, purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm glutathione), and dialyzed into 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The GAP activity of Nadrin was assayed using a GTPase-activating protein assay biochem kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, recombinant GST-tagged RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (1.5 μm) were preloaded 10 min at 30 °C with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, and 8.3 mm NaCl. After the addition of 25 mm MgCl2, preloaded GTPases (final concentration, 100 nm) were diluted in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm GTP), and proteins (20, 100, or 200 nm GST-GAP fusion protein) were added to reaction mixture. Aliquots were incubated for min at 25 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and affinity beads and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with ice-cold buffer and subjected to scintillation counting. An anti-Nadrin antibody was raised in Japanese White female rabbits against the synthetic peptide CPPKPGNPPPGHPGGQSSPG, corresponding to amino acids 562–580 of Nadrin, with the addition of an extra cysteine to the N-terminal end, as described previously (33Kaneda M. Takeuchi K. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptide was conjugated with maleimide-activated keyhole lympet hemocyanin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 250 μg of synthetic peptide keyhole lympet hemocyanin conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), followed by three injections of the antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Difco) at 4-week intervals. Immunogloblin G (IgG) was isolated from the pre-immune and immune sera of the rabbits by ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity chromatography on a protein G-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monoclonal antibody 1D12 was used for synaptotagmin detection (34Takahashi M. Arimatu Y. Fujita S. Fujimoto Y. Kondo S. Hama T. Miyamoto E. Brain Res. 1991; 551: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Organs were isolated from Wistar rats, then homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) SET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Protein levels in the homogenates were determined using the BCA system (Pierce). The protein concentrations of the samples were adjusted, and the samples were placed in reducing sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously with some modifications (27Harada A. Takeuchi K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Proteins from various sources were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes 4 °C using a protein transfer system (ATTO Co., Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were blocked by incubation in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5% skim milk (Difco)) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking and then incubated with anti-Nadrin antibody for 2 h at room temperature (IgG fraction, 4 μg/ml) in a blocking buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1/4000 dilution with the blocking buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20) using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subcloned PC12 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Fukui, The University of Tokyo) were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (Asahi Techno Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan) with 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium with 5% calf serum (JRH Biosciences). Neuronal and glial cell cultures were performed as described previously (27Harada A. Takeuchi K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cDNA constructs encoding the C-terminal GFP-tagged variants of Nadrin (amino acids 1–780), domain I + II (amino acids 1–465), domain I (amino acids 1–233), and domain III (amino acids 463–780), were generated by PCR using primers that engineered 5′ XhoI and 3′BamHI restriction sites into XhoI- andBamHI-digested pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). To create a Nadrin mutant that lacks GAP activity, a point mutation was introduced so as to alter Arg-288, which is suggested to be required for the catalytic activity of GAP (35Rittinger K.

Bahler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to Ala by overlap PCR (37Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated intoXhoI- and BamHI-digested pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH Laboratories). The nucleotide sequences of PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands. PC12 cells were plated at a density of 7 × 105 cells on 35-mm dishes and grown overnight. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of Nadrin expression vector by using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 1 day, transfected cells were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml, Sigma) and then cultured for 1 day or treated for 2 days with 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) to induce cell differentiation. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (38Emoto K. Kobayashi T. Yamaji A. Aizawa H. Yahara I. Inoue K. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12867-12972Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min and washed three times with PBS and blocked PBS containing 2% BSA (2% BSA-PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. For detection of synaptotagmin, the fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min. After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody 1D12 (25 μg/ml) in 2% BSA-PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with Cy3™-conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1/400 with 2% BSA-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For actin filament staining, fixed cells were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) (1/200 dilution PBS) for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were washed five times in PBS and mounted on microscope slides for observation and photography. The cells were examined with a confocal imaging system (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). NIH3T3 cells were plated at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well in 24-well dishes and grown overnight. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of GFP-Nadrin expression vector using TransFast reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). After 1 day, transfected cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and cultured for 1 day. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described above. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out using an Axiovert 135(Carl Zeiss). PC12 cells were plated at a density of 9 × 105 cells on collagen-coated 35-mm dishes (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Corporation, Palo Alto, CA) and incubated for 16–20 h. The cells were then co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pSIφGH (39Itakura M. Misawa H. Sekiguchi M. Takahashi S. Takahashi M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 265: 691-696Google Scholar) and 1.5 μg of the indicated expression vector using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GH release experiments were performed 72 h after transfection. PC12 cells were washed with Tyrode's-HEPES (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) and incubation for 4 min with low K+ buffer (Tyrode's-HEPES containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl) or high K+ buffer (Tyrode's-HEPES containing 87 mm NaCl, 55 mm KCl). The amounts of GH released into the medium and retained in the cells were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA) or an immuno enzymometric assay kit (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan). Secretion was expressed as a percentage of GH amounts released into medium relative to the total cellular GH amounts (40Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures of PC12 cells (2–3 × 107 cells) were placed on ice and rinsed and resuspended in SET buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were homogenized with 20 strokes of a Teflon glass homogenizer and then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant was saved (cytosol), and the pellet was homogenized with a Teflon glass homogenizer in one of the extraction buffers. The suspension was then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant and pellet were saved and dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer. The extraction buffers were SET buffer containing the inhibitors mentioned above and one of 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, or 0.5 m KCl. In a previous study we showed that monoclonal antibody 3A10 recognizes a series of developmentally expressed brain proteins with molecular masses of 150-, 120-, 118-, 106-, 104-, 79-, and 77-kDa, whose expression is correlated well with the maturation of the central nervous system (27Harada A. Takeuchi K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We purified the 79- and 77-kDa 3A10 antigens and identified them as synapsin Ia and Ib, respectively, by analysis of the sequences of peptide fragments (27Harada A. Takeuchi K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study, we cloned a gene encoding a 3A10-reactive 104-kDa protein by immunological screening of expression libraries constructed from adult rat brains. We designated the protein encoded by the gene as Nadrin (neuron-associated developmentallyregulated protein) because its expression is neuron-specific and developmentally regulated (see below). As shown in Fig. 1 A, Nadrin cDNA encodes a 780-amino acid protein composed of three distinct domains that are schematically indicated in Fig. 1 B. Primary sequence alignments indicated that domains I and II of Nadrin (amino acids 1–458) share 51% identity to mouse 3BP-1 (amino acids 1–406) (32Cicchetti P. Ridley A.J. Zheng Y. Cerione R.A. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and 62% identity to the human KIAA0672 protein (amino acids 1–470) (41Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Suyama M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Domain I (amino acids 1–248) is 24% identical to the N terminus of the endophilin II, which is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure (42Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Indeed, amino acids 165–200 of Nadrin are predicted by the COILS algorithm (30Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to have a nearly absolute probability of forming a coiled-coil structure. Other regions within domain I were also predicted to possess coiled-coil-forming motifs with lower probability than amino acids 165–200. Domain II (amino acids 249–458) showed an extensive homology to GAPs of the Rho family GTPases (RhoGAPs) (24Tatsis N. Lannigan D.A. Macara I.G. J. Biol.

Domain III (amino acids 498–780) comprises a serine/threonine/proline-rich region in which the proline, serine, and threonine content is approximately 50%. In addition, domain III contains one region of 29 successive glutamines (amino acids 596–624), one PEST sequence (amino acids 653–679) (31Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The sequence analyses suggest that Nadrin functions as a GAP for members of Rho-family small GTP-binding proteins. To examine the GAP activity of Nadrin on proteins of Rho family, the GAP domain (amino acids 218–482) of Nadrin was produced as a GST fusion protein inE. coli and was assayed for its ability to activate the intrinsic GTPase activity of GTP-bound RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the GAP domain was able to stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1. In a parallel analysis, the GAP domain of 3BP-1 stimulated the GTPase activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 but not that of RhoA (data not shown), which is consistent with previously published data (32Cicchetti P. Ridley A.J. Zheng Y. Cerione R.A. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Nadrin in NIH3T3 cells markedly reduced the number of actin stress fibers and formed the ruffled membranes (Fig.2 B). These results clearly demonstrate that Nadrin functions as a GAP for Rho family proteins and as a regulator of cellular actin filament organization. Tissue distribution of Nadrin in adult rats was analyzed by using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide composed of amino acids 562–580. The anti-Nadrin antibody bound specifically to a 104-kDa protein when Nadrin was expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). In adult rat tissues, the 104-kDa protein band was specifically detected in a brain homogenate but not in other tissues, indicating that Nadrin is specifically expressed in brain (Fig. 3 A). The expression of Nadrin was dependent on the developmental stage of the brain; Nadrin became detectable at the second postnatal week in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and at the third postnatal week in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb (Fig. 3 B). The expression level was maximal during the third and fourth postnatal weeks and remained high during adulthood. To examine whether Nadrin is expressed in neuronal or glial cells, primary cultures of neuronal and glial cells were establis"

Here we report the characterization of an active analog (compound 2) with enhanced IR kinase activation potency and selectivity over related receptors (insulin-like growth factor I receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor). The IR activators stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of partially purified native IR and recombinant IR tyrosine kinase domain. Administration of the IR activators to mice was associated with increased IR tyrosine kinase activity in liver.In vivo oral treatment with compound 2 resulted in significant glucose lowering in several rodent models of diabetes. In db/db mice, oral administration of compound 2 elicited significant correction of hyperglycemia. In a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model, compound 2 potentiated the glucose-lowering effect of insulin. In normal rats, compound 2 improved oral glucose tolerance with significant reduction in insulin release following glucose challenge. A structurally related inactive analog (compound 3) was not effective on insulin receptor activation or glucose lowering in db/db mice.

Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin receptor (IR)1 is a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular α subunits and two transmembrane β subunits. The binding of the ligand to the α subunit of IR not only concentrates insulin at its site of action, but also induces conformational changes in the receptor, which in turn stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the β subunit of the IR. Extensive studies have indicated that the ability of the receptor to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate intracellular substrates is essential for its mediation of the complex cellular responses of insulin (2Kasuga M.

Insulin receptors trans-phosphorylate several immediate substrates (on Tyr residues), including insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins 1–4, Shc, and Gab 1, each of which provide specific docking sites for other signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 domains (6White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These events lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Numerous studies have adduced that PI 3-kinase is required for the metabolic effects of insulin. Although the discrete pathways that couple PI 3-kinase to glucose regulation remain poorly defined, Akt (or PKB), a Ser/Thr kinase known to be PI 3-kinase-dependent, appears to be involved in insulin-mediated activation of glucose transport (7Kohn A.D.

Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1508-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central role of the insulin receptor in metabolic and growth control has been validated in insulin receptor null mouse models (10Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P.

Decreased cellular responses to insulin or perturbation of the insulin signaling pathways are associated with a number of pathological states. Mutations in insulin receptor gene that lead to alterations of receptor synthesis, degradation, and function have been described in patients with several uncommon syndromes associated with severe insulin resistance (12Taylor S.I. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1473-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for insulin resistance that proceeds, or is associated with, common forms of Type 2 diabetes remains poorly understood. However, several studies have shown modest decreases in insulin receptor number attributed to down-regulation in response to hyperinsulinemia in tissues or cells from Type 2 diabetic patients (13Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Caro J.F. Itoop O. Pories W.J. Meelheim D. Flickinger E.G. Thomas F. Jenquin M. Silverman J.F. Khazanie P.G.

Substantial decreases in insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity and an even more substantial defect in receptor-mediated IRS phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activation have been described using samples of tissue (e.g. muscle or fat) from rodents or human subjects with Type 2 diabetes (15Caro J.F. Sinha M.K. Raju S.M. Ittoop O. Pories W.J. Flickinger E.G. Meelheim D. Dohm G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F.

Although controversial, diminished insulin-stimulated Akt activation was documented in skeletal muscle from Type 2 diabetic patients (18Krook A. Roth R.A. Jiang X.J. Zierath J.R.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, in humans with Type 2 diabetes there are clear defects involving the insulin receptor and proximal steps in insulin signaling. Pharmaceutical intervention aimed at augmenting insulin receptor function may ultimately prove beneficial in patients with diabetes.We have previously reported the discovery of a small molecule fungal metabolite (l-783,281) with insulin-like activities in cells and in animal models of diabetes (20Zhang B. Salituro G. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Zhang Y. Royo I. Vilella D. Diez M.T. Pelaez F. Ruby C. Kendall R.L. Mao X. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Zierath J.R. Heck J.V. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Science. 1999; 284: 974-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Here we describe a new active analog of l-783,281 with improved potency for activation of insulin receptor in cells as well as improved selectivity toward insulin receptor versus other homologous receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, a structurally related inactive analog was also synthesized and used, along with the active compound, to establish the correlation between insulin receptor activation in vitroand glucose lowering in animals. The results of these studies further validate approaches designed to identify new small molecule insulin receptor activators as potential novel anti-diabetic agents.DISCUSSIONThe pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes is complex, involving the progressive development of insulin resistance and a relative deficiency in insulin secretion, leading to overt hyperglycemia. The molecular basis for insulin resistance in Type II diabetes is not fully understood. However, abnormalities in insulin receptor expression, structure (rarely), and function are present in association with chronic insulin resistance and diabetes. Thus, it has been described that patients with obesity and diabetes have impaired insulin receptor binding in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue (13Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Caro J.F. Itoop O. Pories W.J. Meelheim D. Flickinger E.G. Thomas F. Jenquin M. Silverman J.F. Khazanie P.G. Sinha M.K. J.

The defect is exacerbated by additive defect in insulin receptor kinase that is also present in tissues of patients with overt diabetes (14Caro J.F. Itoop O. Pories W.J. Meelheim D. Flickinger E.G. Thomas F. Jenquin M. Silverman J.F. Khazanie P.G. Sinha M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29Sinha M.K. Pories W.J. Flickinger E.G. Meelheim D.

Invest. 1987; 79: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). More recently, defects in the insulin receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway, including IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation, have been found in tissues from Type 2 diabetic patients or rodent models (16Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Sherman L.A. Carey J. Smith R.J. Dohm G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 31Heydrick S.J. Jullien D. Tanti J.F. Giorgetti S.

Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, augmenting insulin signaling by targeting insulin receptor activation may represent a potential approach to alleviate insulin resistance and improve glucose homeostasis in Type 2 diabetes.We previously reported on the discovery of a small molecule fungal metabolite (compound 1) that functions as an insulin mimetic in cells and in animal models of diabetes (20Zhang B. Salituro G. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Zhang Y. Royo I. Vilella D. Diez M.T. Pelaez F. Ruby C. Kendall R.L. Mao X. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Zierath J.R. Heck J.V. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Science. 1999; 284: 974-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In this study, we have described active and inactive analogs of compound1. We have shown that compound 2 is a potent and selective activator of insulin receptor. In contrast, a closely related analog (compound 3) is completely inactive, suggesting that the effect of the active compound is likely to be specific on the target receptor. Thus, compound 1 was not simply an isolated example, but it represents a lead from which the directed synthesis of new compounds with improved features can be derived.Insulin receptor belongs to a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Binding of insulin to the extracellular domain of the dimeric IR leads to autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in the intrinsic tyrosine kinase that resides in the cytoplasmic domain. This event triggers a cascade of signal transduction steps. The mechanism for activation of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase has been a subject of intensive investigation. High resolution structural information has been obtained through crystallographic studies of IR kinase domain (33Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar,34Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Based on crystal structures of the unphosphorylated low activity form, as well as the phosphorylated, active form of the IR, a model of cis-inhibition and trans-activation of the receptor was proposed. The unliganded receptors exist in the autoinhibitory conformation that prevents access of ATP and substrate to the active site. Upon autophosphorylation of Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163 in the activation loop, the IR kinase undergoes a major conformational change resulting in unrestricted access of ATP and substrate to the active site and full activation of the kinase. More recently, the three-dimensional structure of insulin receptor bound to insulin was determined by electron cryomicrospcopy (35Luo R.Z. Beniac D.R. Fernandes A. Yip C.C. Ottensmeyer F.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional reconstruction of the quaternary structure reveals that the both α subunits are involved in insulin binding and that the two β subunits are poised for trans-autophosphorylation. These structural studies have provided molecular basis of activation of IR.In the current study, we demonstrated that insulin receptor activator compound 2 stimulated activation of recombinant insulin receptor kinase (Fig. 2). It is possible that interaction of the compound with the inactive receptor kinase domain alters conformation of the protein, thereby partially relieving the autoinhibition and increasing accessibility of ATP to the active site. This hypothesis is being investigated. Further structural studies will be necessary to further define the mechanism of action of the insulin receptor activators at molecular level.Compounds 1 and 2 were capable of potentiating activation of IRTK in liver of normal mice following in vivotreatment at doses that were efficacious for hyperglycemia (in diabetic mice). Consistent with the lack of activity in cell-based and cell-free insulin receptor activation assays, compound 3 was without effect on insulin stimulation of IRTK in liver. When tested in the db/db mouse model, compound 2 elicited a glucose lowering effect at 2–4 h following single oral dose (5 mg/kg) (food withdrawn) or following chronic treatment, whereas compound 3 was not effective at an equivalent or higher dose. These results demonstrated a correlation between modulation of insulin receptor activation and glucose-lowering efficacy in the animal models and further validated the role of insulin receptor in the regulation of glucose homeostasis.It is of interest to point out that although compound 2 (10 mg/kg) was able to potentiate activation of hepatic IR by exogenous insulin in lean euglycemia mice, it did not cause hypoglycemia in this mouse model at the dose tested. In the murine model with insulinopenic diabetes induced by streptozotocin, oral administration of compound2 alone (10 mg/kg) was without effect on blood glucose levels. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodent model is characterized with in vivo insulin resistance (36Blondel O. Portha B. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 15: 382-387Google Scholar, 37Blondel O. Bailbe D. Portha B. Diabetologia. 1989; 32: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and altered regulation of insulin signal transduction pathway (32Saad M.J.A. Araki E. Miralpeix M. Rothenberg P.L. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 38Blondel O. Simon J. Chevalier B. Portha B. Am. J.

Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, co-administration of the compound with an otherwise subefficacious dose of insulin resulted in a significant degree of glucose lowering (Fig. 4), suggesting that the compound could function as an insulin sensitizer in this animal model of diabetes. In addition, we observed that treatment with compound 2 was able to improve glucose tolerance without causing hypoglycemia in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats.The above results, along with the apparent lack of hypoglycemic effects of the compounds in lean non-diabetic mice, suggest that compounds1 and 2 could potentially function as insulin sensitizers in vivo in the animal models. This notion contrasts with the ability of the compounds to function as full insulin-mimetics in CHO.IR cells. However, relative to the effects of exogenous insulin, the extent of in vivo IR activation by compounds administered alone was modest. Thus, we speculate that the molecular mechanism of IR activation by compounds is sufficient, only in part, to mimic that of insulin, this effect may be exaggerated in CHO.IR cells, an artificial system where >500,000 IRs per cell are expressed. In vivo, it is possible that direct interactions of compound with IRs may allow for further insulin-mediated activation (in all or selected subsets) of cell-surface receptors.In summary, we have characterized small molecule insulin receptor activator compounds that are capable of activating the receptor kinase in a variety of in vitro assays and in tissue followingin vivo treatment. The availability of the structurally related inactive analog provided an invaluable tool to establish the correlation between insulin receptor activation and glucose lowering in the animal model of diabetes. Exploratory mechanistic studies indicate that the active compounds interacted with and activated insulin receptor. In rodent models of diabetes, the active compounds had both insulin-like and insulin-sensitizing effects. These studies further validated the approach of targeting the insulin receptor for potential novel anti-diabetic agents. Insulin elicits a diverse array of biological responses by binding to its specific receptor (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin receptor (IR)1 is a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular α subunits and two transmembrane β subunits. The binding of the ligand to the α subunit of IR not only concentrates insulin at its site of action, but also induces conformational changes in the receptor, which in turn stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the β subunit of the IR. Extensive studies have indicated that the ability of the receptor to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate intracellular substrates is essential for its mediation of the complex cellular responses of insulin (2Kasuga M.

Szalkowski D. Li Z. Zhang Y. Royo I. Vilella D. Diez M.T. Pelaez F. Ruby C. Kendall R.L. Mao X. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Zierath J.R. Heck J.V. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Science. 1999; 284: 974-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Here we describe a new active analog of l-783,281 with improved potency for activation of insulin receptor in cells as well as improved selectivity toward insulin receptor versus other homologous receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, a structurally related inactive analog was also synthesized and used, along with the active compound, to establish the correlation between insulin receptor activation in vitroand glucose lowering in animals. The results of these studies further validate approaches designed to identify new small molecule insulin receptor activators as potential novel anti-diabetic agents. DISCUSSIONThe pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes is complex, involving the progressive development of insulin resistance and a relative deficiency in insulin secretion, leading to overt hyperglycemia. The molecular basis for insulin resistance in Type II diabetes is not fully understood. However, abnormalities in insulin receptor expression, structure (rarely), and function are present in association with chronic insulin resistance and diabetes. Thus, it has been described that patients with obesity and diabetes have impaired insulin receptor binding in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue (13Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Caro J.F. Itoop O. Pories W.J. Meelheim D. Flickinger E.G. Thomas F. Jenquin M. Silverman J.F. Khazanie P.G. Sinha M.K. J.

The defect is exacerbated by additive defect in insulin receptor kinase that is also present in tissues of patients with overt diabetes (14Caro J.F. Itoop O. Pories W.J. Meelheim D. Flickinger E.G. Thomas F. Jenquin M. Silverman J.F. Khazanie P.G. Sinha M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29Sinha M.K. Pories W.J. Flickinger E.G. Meelheim D.

Invest. 1987; 79: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). More recently, defects in the insulin receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway, including IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation, have been found in tissues from Type 2 diabetic patients or rodent models (16Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Sherman L.A. Carey J. Smith R.J. Dohm G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 31Heydrick S.J. Jullien D. Tanti J.F. Giorgetti S.

Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, augmenting insulin signaling by targeting insulin receptor activation may represent a potential approach to alleviate insulin resistance and improve glucose homeostasis in Type 2 diabetes.We previously reported on the discovery of a small molecule fungal metabolite (compound 1) that functions as an insulin mimetic in cells and in animal models of diabetes (20Zhang B. Salituro G. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Zhang Y. Royo I. Vilella D. Diez M.T. Pelaez F. Ruby C. Kendall R.L. Mao X. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Zierath J.R. Heck J.V. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Science. 1999; 284: 974-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In this study, we have described active and inactive analogs of compound1. We have shown that compound 2 is a potent and selective activator of insulin receptor. In contrast, a closely related analog (compound 3) is completely inactive, suggesting that the effect of the active compound is likely to be specific on the target receptor. Thus, compound 1 was not simply an isolated example, but it represents a lead from which the directed synthesis of new compounds with improved features can be derived.Insulin receptor belongs to a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Binding of insulin to the extracellular domain of the dimeric IR leads to autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in the intrinsic tyrosine kinase that resides in the cytoplasmic domain. This event triggers a cascade of signal transduction steps. The mechanism for activation of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase has been a subject of intensive investigation. High resolution structural information has been obtained through crystallographic studies of IR kinase domain (33Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar,34Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Based on crystal structures of the unphosphorylated low activity form, as well as the phosphorylated, active form of the IR, a model of cis-inhibition and trans-activation of the receptor was proposed. The unliganded receptors exist in the autoinhibitory conformation that prevents access of ATP and substrate to the active site. Upon autophosphorylation of Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163 in the activation loop, the IR kinase undergoes a major conformational change resulting in unrestricted access of ATP and substrate to the active site and full activation of the kinase. More recently, the three-dimensional structure of insulin receptor bound to insulin was determined by electron cryomicrospcopy (35Luo R.Z. Beniac D.R. Fernandes A. Yip C.C. Ottensmeyer F.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional reconstruction of the quaternary structure reveals that the both α subunits are involved in insulin binding and that the two β subunits are poised for trans-autophosphorylation. These structural studies have provided molecular basis of activation of IR.In the current study, we demonstrated that insulin receptor activator compound 2 stimulated activation of recombinant insulin receptor kinase (Fig. 2). It is possible that interaction of the compound with the inactive receptor kinase domain alters conformation of the protein, thereby partially relieving the autoinhibition and increasing accessibility of ATP to the active site. This hypothesis is being investigated. Further structural studies will be necessary to further define the mechanism of action of the insulin receptor activators at molecular level.Compounds 1 and 2 were capable of potentiating activation of IRTK in liver of normal mice following in vivotreatment at doses that were efficacious for hyperglycemia (in diabetic mice). Consistent with the lack of activity in cell-based and cell-free insulin receptor activation assays, compound 3 was without effect on insulin stimulation of IRTK in liver. When tested in the db/db mouse model, compound 2 elicited a glucose lowering effect at 2–4 h following single oral dose (5 mg/kg) (food withdrawn) or following chronic treatment, whereas compound 3 was not effective at an equivalent or higher dose. These results demonstrated a correlation between modulation of insulin receptor activation and glucose-lowering efficacy in the animal models and further validated the role of insulin receptor in the regulation of glucose homeostasis.It is of interest to point out that although compound 2 (10 mg/kg) was able to potentiate activation of hepatic IR by exogenous insulin in lean euglycemia mice, it did not cause hypoglycemia in this mouse model at the dose tested. In the murine model with insulinopenic diabetes induced by streptozotocin, oral administration of compound2 alone (10 mg/kg) was without effect on blood glucose levels. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodent model is characterized with in vivo insulin resistance (36Blondel O. Portha B. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 15: 382-387Google Scholar, 37Blondel O. Bailbe D. Portha B. Diabetologia. 1989; 32: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and altered regulation of insulin signal transduction pathway (32Saad M.J.A. Araki E. Miralpeix M.

Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, co-administration of the compound with an otherwise subefficacious dose of insulin resulted in a significant degree of glucose lowering (Fig. 4), suggesting that the compound could function as an insulin sensitizer in this animal model of diabetes. In addition, we observed that treatment with compound 2 was able to improve glucose tolerance without causing hypoglycemia in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats.The above results, along with the apparent lack of hypoglycemic effects of the compounds in lean non-diabetic mice, suggest that compounds1 and 2 could potentially function as insulin sensitizers in vivo in the animal models. This notion contrasts with the ability of the compounds to function as full insulin-mimetics in CHO.IR cells. However, relative to the effects of exogenous insulin, the extent of in vivo IR activation by compounds administered alone was modest. Thus, we speculate that the molecular mechanism of IR activation by compounds is sufficient, only in part, to mimic that of insulin, this effect may be exaggerated in CHO.IR cells, an artificial system where >500,000 IRs per cell are expressed. In vivo, it is possible that direct interactions of compound with IRs may allow for further insulin-mediated activation (in all or selected subsets) of cell-surface receptors.In summary, we have characterized small molecule insulin receptor activator compounds that are capable of activating the receptor kinase in a variety of in vitro assays and in tissue followingin vivo treatment. The availability of the structurally related inactive analog provided an invaluable tool to establish the correlation between insulin receptor activation and glucose lowering in the animal model of diabetes. Exploratory mechanistic studies indicate that the active compounds interacted with and activated insulin receptor. In rodent models of diabetes, the active compounds had both insulin-like and insulin-sensitizing effects.

https://openalex.org/W2080250107,"Hck, a protein-tyrosine kinase of phagocytes, is the unique member of the Src family expressed under two alternatively translated isoforms differing in their N-terminal site of acylation: p61Hck has an additional 21-amino acid sequence comprising a single myristoylation motif, whereas p59Hck N terminus has myristoylation and palmitoylation sites. To identify the molecular determinants involved in the targeting of each isoform, they were fused to GFP and expressed in HeLa and CHO cells. p61Hck was associated with lysosomal vesicles, whereas p59Hck was found at the plasma membrane and to a low extent associated with lysosomes. Their unique N-terminal domains were sufficient to target GFP to the corresponding intracellular compartments. Mutation of the palmitoylation site of p59Hckredirected this isoform to lysosomes, indicating that the palmitoylation state governs the association of p59Hck with the plasma membrane or with lysosomes. In addition, both isoforms and the nonpalmitoylated p59Hck mutant were found on the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role of this organelle in the subcellular sorting of Hck isoforms. Regarding their subcellular localizations, we propose that bi-acylated p59Hck might transduce plasma membrane receptor signals, whereas p61Hck and the nonpalmitoylated p59Hck might control the biogenesis of phagolysosomes, two functions yet proposed for Hck in phagocytes.

Three of these kinases, Src, Fyn, and Yes, are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Blk, Fgr, Hck, Lck, and Lyn are restricted to hematopoietic cells (Ref. 1Ziegler S.F. Marth J.D. Lewis D.B. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar; for a review see Ref. 2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar). Src PTKs are composed of distinct functional regions. The first three domains display high sequence homology among members of the Src family: the Src homology domain 1 (SH1), which lies at the C terminus of the molecule is responsible for the catalytic activity of the kinase. Two other Src homology domains, SH2 and SH3, allow interactions with cellular proteins through recognition of phosphotyrosine- and proline-rich domains, respectively (3Yu H. Rosen M.K. Shin T.B. Seidel-Dugan C. Brugge J.S. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 4Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The fourth domain is unique to each member of the family and contains the N-terminal motif MGXXX(S/T) that is myristoylated on glycine 2. Most of the kinases are also palmitoylated when displaying a cysteine residue at position 3, 5, or 6 (5Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Fatty acylation of Src PTKs has yet been shown to influence their interaction with cell membranes (6Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 12: 1-16Google Scholar, 7McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and as a consequence their intracellular distribution. Hck is a kinase of the Src family mainly expressed in phagocytes (8Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J. Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2267-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In human neutrophils, Hck is mainly found in the azurophil granule (lysosomal) compartment and, to a low extent, in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction (9Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These different locations correlate with functional roles proposed to Hck in the process of fusion between lysosomes and phagosomes (9Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol.

However, two Hck isoforms exist, but the precise function exerted by each of them has not yet been determined. The two isoforms are generated by alternative translation; p61Hcktranslation starts at a CTG, 21 codons upstream of the p59Hck ATG codon (16Lock P. Ralph S. Stanley E. Boulet I. Ramsay R. Dunn A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4363-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The two isoforms are myristoylated on glycine 2, but only p59Hck has a palmitoylated cysteine at position 3. Therefore, Hck is the unique example among the Src PTKs to be expressed as two isoforms, which naturally differ by their N-terminal domains and by their acylation states. Consequently, one would expect to find Hck isoforms in distinct subcellular compartments. Indeed, p59Hck cofractionates with the plasma membrane, and p61Hck cofractionates with lysosomes, but, surprisingly, p59Hck was also found in lysosomes (17Mohn H. Le Cabec V. Fischer S. Maridonneau-Parini I. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, despite differences in their N-terminal domains, p59Hck and p61Hck can be addressed to the same compartment. Because the location of proteins certainly conditions their functional role, we searched to identify the molecular determinants involved in the membrane addressing of Hck isoforms. To this end, separate expression of p59Hck and p61Hck was undertaken in HeLa and CHO cells, and their subcellular distribution was determined. We also studied whether their respective N-terminal domains were sufficient to address the reporter protein GFP to the compartment corresponding to the full-length Hck isoforms. Palmitoylation, in contrast to myristoylation, is a reversible post-translational modification (6Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 12: 1-16Google Scholar). A palmitoylation mutant of p59Hck in fusion with GFP was constructed to examine the role of palmitate in the subcellular addressing of this isoform. The wild-type Hck cDNA was a gift from N. Quintrell (8Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J. Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2267-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The CTG initiation codon of Hck was either deleted or mutated to an ATG codon by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the unique N-terminal domain using the antisense primer Hck-AS1, with either p59-S or p61-S sense primer (see below). This introduced a XbaI and a NheI restriction site, respectively, at the 5′ and 3′ end of the products, which were subcloned into pBK-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). The NheI site was used to fuse each unique N-terminal domain (codons 1–82 or 1–61 for p61Hck or p59Hck, respectively) to the GFP reporter gene yielding p61U-Hck-GFP and p59U-Hck-GFP. The 114- or 176-base pair XbaI toBamHI fragments issued from p59U-Hck-GFP and p61U-Hck-GFP were used to replace the wild-type Hck N terminus yielding p59Hck or p61Hck cDNA, respectively. For expression in eukaryotic cells in fusion with GFP, p59Hckand p61Hck cDNAs were then subcloned into pEGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) yielding p59Hck-GFP and p61Hck-GFP. The C3S point mutation was introduced into the p59Hck-GFP vector by inverse polymerase chain reaction using p59C3S-S and p59C3S-AS (see below). Conformity of the mutation was verified by sequencing. All oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Oligo express (Grenoble, France) and were as detailed: Hck-AS1, 5′-CTAGCTAGCGATGATGTCCTCAGAGCC-3′; Hck-AS2, 5′-CCATCGATATCGCTAGCCGGCTGCTGTTGGTACTGGCTCTC-3′; Hck-S, 5′-CATCATCACGGAGTTCATGGCC-3′; p59-S, 5′-GCTCTAGAGCGGGCGCCCAGGATGGGGTGC-3′; p61-S, 5′-GCTCTAGAGGGGCTGCCGAGATGGGGGGGCGC-3′; p59C3S-S, 5′-GCGGCCGCCATGGGGAGCATGAAGTCCAAGTTCC-3′; and p59C3S-AS, 5′-TCCCCATGGCGGCCGCCCGCTCTAGCGGAT-3′. HeLa and CHO cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa and CHO cells were seeded in 24-well plates for immunofluorescence experiments (3·104 and 1·104 cells/well on glass coverslips, respectively) or in 9-cm Petri dishes (106cells for HeLa cells) for immunoblotting, S100/P100 partitioning, Triton X-100 fractionation, and solubilization for kinase assay. The following day, DNA/calcium phosphate precipitates were added to the cells, which were washed after 16–18 h and incubated in fresh medium for an additional period of 48–72 h before analyses. White blood cells from healthy donors were isolated by Dextran sedimentation and centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque as described previously (11Astarie-Dequeker C. N′Diaye E.N. Le Cabec V. Rittig M.G. Prandi J. Maridonneau-Parini I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 469-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interface band containing mononuclear cells was removed, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cell pellet was resuspended in cold RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were then plated on glass coverslips inserted in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow adherence of monocytes. The nonadherent cells were removed, and the cell monolayer was washed vigorously twice with warm RPMI and used for immunofluorescence experiments 3 h later. Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and unreacted aldehyde groups were neutralized in 50 mm NH4Cl for 1 min. After washing and permeabilization (0.3% Triton X-100, 5 min), cells were washed for 10 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were then overlaid as indicated with 25 μl of one of the following primary antibodies diluted into PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin:rabbit anti-human Hck (1:100; Santa Cruz biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-human CD63 (1:100; CLB, Amsterdam, Netherlands), mouse anti-human Golgi (CTR 433, 1:2; Ref.18Jasmin B.J. Cartaud J. Bornens M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7218-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-hamster lysosomal glycoprotein lgp95 (E9A, 1:100; Ref. 19Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation period, the coverslips were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of affinity purified TRITC- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) directed against mouse or rabbit IgG. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS and mounted in Mowiol. The fluorescent staining was visualized under a confocal or a standard microscope. In some experiments, the Golgi apparatus was disrupted before cell fixation, by treatment with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A for 10 min (Sigma). In other experiments, the lysosomal pathway was labeled with 4 mg/ml lysine-fixable tetramethylrhodamine (molecular weight, 10,000; Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands), which was added to HeLa cells 24 h after transfection and left in contact with the cells for 16 h at 37 °C in complete medium (20Liu S.H. Marks M.S. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 72 h after transfection, HeLa cells (3.106 cells) were washed in PBS, lysed in 1 ml of reducing sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar), and boiled for 5 min. 110 of total proteins were electrophoresed through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, which was incubated with anti-Hck antibodies (1:2,000, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and revealed by ECL as described previously (9Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Proteins were solubilized in a buffer containing 2% Nonidet P-40, 3 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 μg/ml pepstatine, 1 μmaprotinine, 500 μm PMSF, and 100 μm sodium vanadate. Hck was immunoprecipitated and its kinase activity was assayed using acid-denatured rabbit muscle enolase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as a nonspecific substrate and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) as described previously (17Mohn H. Le Cabec V. Fischer S. Maridonneau-Parini I. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Proteins were then separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Hck-dependent phosphorylation of enolase was observed by using the Image QuaNT programm on a Molecular Dynamic Storm840 imager. Adherent transfected HeLa cells in 9-cm Petri dishes were trypsinized in the presence of EDTA and washed in PBS. Cells were counted and resuspended at 5·106 cells/ml in cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 3 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 μg/ml pepstatine, 1 μmaprotinine, 500 μm PMSF). Cells were sonicated; nuclei and cell debris were then centrifuged at 200 × g. The post nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant (S100) was collected, and the membrane pellet (P100) was resuspended in an equal volume of the following solution 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 3 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 μg/ml pepstatine, 1 μmaprotinine, 500 μm PMSF. The fluorescence in P100 and S100 fractions was measured with a spectrofluorimeter (480/509 nm). The percentage of insoluble GFP fluorescence was calculated as follows: % P100 = (P100 − P(o)100)/(S100 − S(o)100 + P100 − P(o)100), where P100 and S100 are fluorescence values measured in the crude membrane fraction and in the cytosol, respectively, and P(o)100 and S(o)100 are the corresponding values obtained from parallel experiments performed with mock-transfected HeLa cells. Adherent transfected HeLa cells in 9-cm Petri dishes were washed twice with PBS and layered with 750 μl of Triton X-100 buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 3 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 μg/ml pepstatine, 1 μm aprotinine, 500 μm PMSF). Soluble components were collected after a 10-min incubation period at 4 °C or 37 °C, as indicated, and the dishes were rinsed with the same volume of Triton X-100 buffer. The remaining insoluble cell constituents were scraped with a rubber policeman using 1.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 3 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 μg/ml pepstatine, 1 μm aprotinine, 500 μmPMSF. The two fractions were centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 15 min, and the supernatants were analyzed with a spectrofluorimeter (480/509 nm). When indicated, cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2.5 mmβ-methyl-cyclodextrin (Sigma) to destabilize GEMs. The percentage of insoluble GFP fluorescence was calculated as follows: % I = (I −I o)/(S −S o + I −I o), where I and S are fluorescence values measured in insoluble and soluble fractions, respectively, and I o andS o are the corresponding values obtained from parallel experiments performed with mock-transfected HeLa cells. The cellular localization of p59Hck and p61Hck was studied here by using engineered cDNAs (Fig.1) that allowed separate expression of each isoform in fusion with GFP (Fig.2 A) First, we show that GFP in fusion with Hck isoforms did not interfere with the kinase activity (Fig. 2 B) because these chimera were able to perform autophosphorylation and to phosphorylate the exogenous substrate enolase. In HeLa cells transiently expressing GFP, nuclei were strongly fluorescent and a diffuse staining was present in the cytoplasm (Fig.3). Cells expressing p59Hck-GFP showed a staining of the plasma membrane but not cells expressing p61Hck-GFP (Fig. 3).Figure 2Separate expression and kinase activity of p59Hck-GFP and p61Hck-GFP in HeLa cells. A, Westen blot. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated cDNAs, and expression of the corresponding proteins was visualized by Hck immunoblotting. No signal was obtained with GFP alone, and the chimeric p59Hck-GFP and p61Hck-GFP were detected at the expected apparent molecular masses 86 and 88 kDa, respectively. B, kinase assay. Hck-GFP isoforms or GFP alone were solubilized from HeLa cells immunoprecipitated and assayed for in vitro kinase activity in the presence of the exogenous substrate enolase and [γ-32P]ATP. Arrows indicate Hck auto-phosphorylation and enolase trans-phosphorylation. No phosphorylated proteins are detected in immunoprecipitates from GFP transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3p59Hck-GFP and p61Hck-GFP are present in distinct subcellular compartments. 48 h after transfection, HeLa cells expressing GFP, p59Hck-GFP, or p61Hck-GFP were fixed and observed by direct fluorescence. Cells expressing GFP show an intense staining of the nucleus and a diffuse staining of the cytoplasm, p59Hck-GFP is associated with the plasma membrane and intracellular patches are observed with p61Hck-GFP and also p59Hck-GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate that p59Hck was stably associated with cell membranes, cells were fractionated, and the majority of the p59Hck-GFP fluorescence was found in the membrane pellet P100 fraction (76 ± 14%, n = 3). In addition, part of p59Hck-GFP fluorescence (39 ± 3%, n = 5) was found in the cold Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig.4) where detergent-resistant glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (GEMs) and cytoskeletal components are present (22Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 23Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). When the Triton X-100 extraction was performed at 37 °C to solubilize proteins of GEMs but not those of the cytoskeleton (23Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar), the fluorescence associated with the detergent insoluble fraction returned to background levels (Fig. 4). Moreover treatment of the cells with β-methyl-cyclodextrin, a chemical agent that destabilizes GEMs by chelating cholesterol (24Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), allowed the redistribution of about 50% of the fluorescence from the detergent-insoluble to the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 4). These results from fluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation indicate that p59Hck is expressed at the plasma membrane and that part of it is present in GEM structures rather than in the cytoskeleton compartment. In addition, an intense juxta-nuclear staining was obtained with both isoforms (Fig. 3). Staining of the Golgi apparatus with the specific antibodies CTR433 (18Jasmin B.J. Cartaud J. Bornens M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7218-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies revealed its colocalization with p59Hck-GFP or p61Hck-GFP (Fig.5). Although p59Hck-GFP was undoubtedly associated with the Golgi, confocal microscopy was necessary to ascertain the association of p61Hck with the Golgi (Fig. 5, G–I). Similarly, the Golgi apparatus of human monocytes that naturally express Hck, was stained with anti-Hck antibodies (Fig. 5, J–L). The juxta-nuclear localization of p61Hck-GFP was not restricted to the Golgi because it was also found on surrounding vesicles (Fig. 5, G–I,arrowheads), which persisted when the Golgi apparatus was redistributed after cell treatment with brefeldin A (data not shown). In a previous study we have shown that Hck was partially localized on lysosomes of phagocytes (17Mohn H. Le Cabec V. Fischer S. Maridonneau-Parini I. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To verify whether the above vesicular structures belonged to the endosome-lysosome pathway, transfected HeLa cells were incubated for 16 h with rhodamine-dextran without chase of the fluorescent marker to stain the whole endocytic pathway. The vesicles stained by p61Hck-GFP, which contained rhodamine-dextran were close to the nucleus, as expected for late endosomes-lysosomes (Fig. 6,A–C), on the contrary vesicles positive for rhodamine-dextran adjacent to the plasma membrane, the location of early endosomes, were not labeled by Hck. In addition, p61Hck-GFP partially colocalized with CD63, a marker of the late endosome-early lysosome compartment (Fig. 6, D–F) (25Metzelaar M.J. Wijngaard P.L. Peters P.J. Sixma J.J. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Clevers H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3239-3245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, to confirm the association of p61Hck-GFP with lysosomes, we took advantage of a subset of CHO cells that contain large lysosomes identified by the presence of the lysosomal marker lgp95 (19Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7, A–C). p59Hck-GFP was clearly associated with the plasma membrane of these cells (Fig. 7, D–I), and in some cases (<5% of the cells), an association of this isoform with lgp95-positive lysosomes was observed (Fig. 7, G–I).Figure 7Association of p61Hck-GFP with lysosomes and p59Hck-GFP with the plasma membrane and lysosomes in CHO cells. CHO cells expressing indicated cDNA were observed by standard fluorescence microscopy. p61Hck-GFP (A) was associated with the membrane of large lysosomes stained with anti-lgp95 antibodies (B). Colocalization of these two proteins appeared in yellow(arrows in C). p59Hck-GFP was associated with the plasma membrane. Lysosomes were stained with lgp95 antibodies (E and H), and arrowheadsshow lysosomes not stained by p59Hck-GFP in the merged image (F). Occasionally p59Hck colocalized with lysosomal vesicles positive for lgp95 (I,arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we investigated the role of the unique domains in the subcellular targeting of p59Hck and p61Hck. For this purpose, chimeric cDNA comprising the unique domain of p59Hck or p61Hck, fused at their C terminus with the GFP gene (p59U-Hck-GFP and p61U-Hck-GFP, respectively) were constructed (Fig. 1). Observation by direct fluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells transfected p59U-Hck-GFP or p61U-Hck-GFP revealed an overall cellular staining identical to that obtained with the corresponding full-length constructs (Fig.8). Double labeling experiments with the appropriate antibodies indeed confirmed that both p59U-Hck-GFP and p61U-Hck-GFP were present on the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 8) and that p61U-Hck-GFP was on the CD63 positive endosomal-lysosomal compartment (Fig. 8). The plasma membrane localization of p59U-Hck-GFP was also clearly visible by direct fluorescence, and Triton X-100 solubilization experiments confirmed its association with GEMs (33% of the fluorescence in the detergent-insoluble fraction), whereas only 4% of p61U-Hck-GFP was found in this fraction. These findings support the conclusion that localization of each isoform of Hck to distinct subcellular compartments directly depends on determinants present in their unique domains, which differ by the additional 21 amino acids present in the longer isoform and by their state of mono- (p61Hck) or bi-acylation (p59Hck). To study the reason why p59Hck is found in the lysosomal fraction in neutrophils and is sometimes associated with lysosomes in CHO cells, the role played by the acylation state was examined. To this aim, we constructed a mutant of p59Hck (p59HckC3S-GFP) in which the cysteine residue at position 3, which is normally palmitoylated, was substituted for a serine (Fig. 1), a substitution previously shown to abolish palmitoylation of p59Hck (26Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Observation by direct fluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells expressing the p59HckC3S-GFP mutant showed the disappearance of the plasma membrane labeling previously seen with p59Hck-GFP (Fig.9, A and D). Furthermore, whereas about 40% of p59Hck-GFP was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 4), only 7% ± 2 (n = 3) of p59HckC3S-GFP remained in this fraction. Similarly to p59Hck and p61Hck, the p59HckC3S-GFP mutant was found on the Golgi apparatus (Fig.9, A–C). A punctuated staining was also clearly visible around the Golgi apparatus. By labeling the cells with either dextran-rhodamine (not shown) or CD63 antibodies, we observed that these vesicles corresponded to the endosome-lysosome compartment (Fig.9, D–F). In addition, when p59HckC3S-GFP was expressed in CHO cells, a co-staining with the lysosomal marker, lgp95 was clearly observed in most of the cells (Fig. 9, G–I). These results demonstrate that p59HckC3S is targeted to the same compartments than p61Hck and that the acylation state plays a critical role in the subcellular localizations. In this study, we show that chimeras between p59Hck or p61Hck and GFP transfected into different cell lines are directed to separate subcellular compartments. Both isoforms are located on the Golgi apparatus. p59Hck is mainly associated with the plasma membrane and to a low extent with lysosomes, whereas p61Hck is specifically on the lysosomal compartment. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the differential localization of Hck isoforms solely rely on their unique N-terminal domains, their acylation state is a critical determinant for addressing Hck to the plasma membrane or to lysosomes. These findings may have important implications for the functions of each Hck variant. Addition of GFP at the C-terminal end of Hck isoforms was used to improve the microscopic detection. It did not affect their kinase activity nor their cellular localization because the distribution of p59Hck-GFP and p61Hck-GFP was identical to that of p59Hck and p61Hck expressed in HeLa cells and visualized by using anti-Hck antibodies (data not shown). Hck was expected to be present at the plasma membrane because it has been shown to be activated by several membrane receptors and co-immunoprecipitated with some of them (14Skubitz K.M. Campbell K.D.

Here we show that cell adhesion regulates insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) mRNA synthesis. When fibroblasts are held in suspension, lower levels of IRS-1 mRNA, but not of IRS-2 mRNA, are detected, and this effect is due to the negative regulation of IRS-1 transcription rather than to decreased mRNA stability. Upon fibronectin- or vitronectin-mediated integrin stimulation, the level of IRS-1 mRNA was restored within 4 h. The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is known to be activated upon integrin stimulation, and we found that IRS-1 was not expressed in FAK−/− cells. Stable re-expression of epitope-tagged FAK in FAK−/−fibroblasts (DA2 cells) restored normal levels of IRS-1 expression, confirming that IRS-1 mRNA expression is regulated by FAK. It is known that integrins activate the JNK pathway. However, in adherent FAK−/− cells, we failed to detect activation of JNK, whereas JNK was stimulated in DA2 cells. This confirms the role of FAK in integrin-induced JNK stimulation. FAK-independent stimulation of JNK with anisomycin treatment both in FAK−/− cells and in suspended FAK+/+ cells confirmed that IRS-1 mRNA transcription can be partially regulated by JNK. We suggest that integrins can modulate insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathways by regulating the levels of IRS-1 in cells and that FAK-mediated signaling to JNK is one pathway involved in this process.

Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 8Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin.

It has been demonstrated that integrins can also influence the expression of several proteins. For instance, αIIbβ3integrins have a positive effect on Bcl3 protein translation in platelets (10Pabla R. Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Bray P.F. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, integrins activate the synthesis of platelet-derived growth factor B subunit mRNA in human monocytes (11Shaw R.J. Doherty D.E. Ritter A.G. Benedict S.H. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2139-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This correlates with high levels of c-Jun, c-Fos, and EGR2 mRNAs. In addition, adhesion of porcine vascular smooth muscle cells to fibronectin leads to the synthesis of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (12Zheng B. Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8994-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This effect is inhibited by Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide and echistatin, which antagonize integrins. Recently, it has been shown that integrins regulate the interleukin-8 mRNA level in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (13Walzog B. Weinmann P. Jeblonski F. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Bommert K. Gaehtgens P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1855-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). β2 integrin aggregation was found to induce de novo synthesis and secretion of biologically active interleukin-8. There are also several examples showing that integrins modulate the activity of transcription factors. In primary mouse mammary epithelial cells, the extracellular matrix is required for the prolactin-induced activation of STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) (14Edwards G.M. Wilford F.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Djiane J. Streuli C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9495-9500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, the engagement of αvβ3integrins by the extracellular matrix protein osteopontin rapidly increases nuclear factor-κB activity and induces the translocation of the nuclear factor-κB p65 form to the nucleus (15Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In osteoclasts, activation of α2 integrins is involved in the transcription of the gene encoding osteocalcin in response to ascorbic acid (16Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that integrins activate JNK (17Miyamoto S. Teramoto H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown recently that adhesion of NIH3T3 cells to fibronectin induces activation not only of Jun kinase, but also of the transcription factor AP-1 (21Oktay M. Wary K.K. Dans M. Birge R.B. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Using a dominant-negative form of FAK, the study demonstrated that the effect depends on the activation of FAK and of the proto-oncogene c-src (21Oktay M. Wary K.K. Dans M. Birge R.B. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In addition, FAK signaling is critical in the shear stress-induced stimulation of JNK and ERK in bovine aortic endothelial cells (22Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). FAK is one of the proteins implicated in the integrin signaling pathway. Following integrin engagement, FAK is activated and phosphorylated on tyrosine 397, which serves as a docking site for c-src (23Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). This association leads to further phosphorylation of FAK and allows its interaction with several signaling molecules such as the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase, Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein-2), and p130CAS(Crk-associated substrate) (24Chen H.C.

Since it has been demonstrated that integrins potentiate the insulin and IGF-1 signaling pathways, we studied the role of adhesion in the expression of IRS-1, a protein implicated in the intracellular cascade induced by insulin and IGF-1. We show here that in mouse fibroblasts, integrins regulate the expression of IRS-1, a major substrate of insulin/IGF-1 receptors and a central element of their signaling pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that FAK and JNK are key transducers of this effect of integrins. Culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]dATP were from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, leupeptin, benzamidine, pepstatin, and anisomycin were from Sigma. Aprotinin was from Bayer Pharma (Puteaux, France), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Protein A was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Antiserum to IRS-1 was prepared in our laboratory and was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence comprising amino acids 1223–1235 of rat IRS-1. Antibody to IRS-2 was kindly provided by M. F. White (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). Antibody to FAK was prepared in our laboratory by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 392–406. Antibody to IR (C19) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibody to phosphorylated JNK/SAPK was from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, Scotland). Wild-type (FAK+/+) and knockout (FAK−/−) fibroblasts were isolated from wild-type and knockout embryos generated by Ilic et al.(29Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). The stably transfected cells (DA2) have been described elsewhere (30Sieg D.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell culture dishes were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) or vitronectin (2 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. Dishes were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and warmed for 1 h at 37 °C before use. Fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Confluent cells were detached with trypsin, which was eliminated by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 10% fetal calf serum medium and kept in suspension for the indicated times. They were plated on coated dishes for increasing periods. Non-adherent cells were removed, and total RNA was extracted. Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 15 μg of total RNA were denatured with formaldehyde/formamide and resolved by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred onto a Hybond membrane (ICN Pharmaceuticals), which was hybridized at 42 °C for 18 h. The probes used were cDNA fragments of IRS-1 (1–2.8 kb), IRS-2 (2.9–3.9 kb), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 0.6 kb). They were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Rediprime kit) and purified with a ProbeQuant kit (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization of 18 S RNA was performed using the oligonucleotide 5′-ACG GTA TCT GAT CGT CTT CGA ACC-3′ labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) Cells were incubated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for 1–6 h and then lysed, and total RNA was extracted. Reverse transcription was performed on 5 μg of total RNA using the mouse mammary leukemia virus enzyme and oligo(dT) primers. The reverse transcription products were then used as templates for PCR amplification using gene-specific primers: for IRS-1, 5′-ACCATGGGGACAAGCCCGGCG-3′ and 5′-GGGGCTGCTGGTGTTGGAATC-3′; and for β-actin, 5′-GTGGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-TCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC. The linear range of the PCR was determined by checking the amount of PCR products after various cycles of amplification to allow comparison between different samples. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide incorporation. Cells were washed with buffer A (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, and 2 mmNaVO4) and then lysed for 15 min on ice with buffer A supplemented with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mm leupeptin, 4 mm benzamidine, 2 mm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min, cell lysates (800 μg of proteins) were added to antibodies (anti-IRS-1, serum dilution of 1:50; anti-IRS-2, serum dilution of 1:200; and anti-IR, 1 μg of purified Ig) preadsorbed on protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C for 3 h. Pellets were then washed three times with buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in Laemmli buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins or whole lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore Corp.) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol (pH 8.3). The membrane was blocked with TBS (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 140 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h and incubated with antibodies to IRS-1 (1:1000), IRS-2 (1:1000), IR (0.7 μg/ml), FAK (1:200), HA tag (1:4000), or phosphotyrosine (1:2000) for 60 min at room temperature and with antibodies to phospho-JNK/phospho-SAPK (1:1000) or JNK/SAPK for 1 night at 4 °C. The membrane was washed four times with TBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and then twice with TBS. Finally, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako AS, Glostrap, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature, washed four times with TBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and twice with TBS, revealed with chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Pierce), and exposed to sensitive films. In this study, we investigated the role of cellular adhesion in the regulation of IRS-1 expression. To this end, FAK+/+ fibroblasts either were kept attached or were detached from plates and kept in suspension. The two series of cells were then compared. Total RNA was extracted after different times of suspension, and IRS-1 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting. The results are presented in Fig. 1. After 2 h of suspension, the level of IRS-1 mRNA (normalized to amounts of 18 S rRNA) decreased (∼20% left) and remained very low at 4 h (∼12% left). IRS-2 mRNA, which was studied in parallel, was not down-regulated in suspended fibroblasts, but on the contrary, seemed to be up-regulated. The 18 S rRNA quantification was used as a loading control. Amounts of GAPDH mRNA (normalized to amounts of 18 S rRNA) were similar in suspended and adherent fibroblasts. Thus, disruption of cellular adhesion results in a marked loss of IRS-1 mRNA in fibroblasts. Since the level of IRS-1 mRNA was decreased in suspended fibroblasts, we next examined if this was due to decreased mRNA stability. To do this, suspended and adherent FAK+/+ fibroblasts were treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for 45 min, 1.5 h, and 3 h to block transcription. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, the levels of IRS-1 and IRS-2 mRNAs were already decreased after 45 min of actinomycin D treatment. After 3 h, both were undetectable. We calculated that the half-life of IRS-1 mRNA was 1 and 1.5 h in adherent and suspended fibroblasts, respectively. A similar degradation rate was observed for IRS-2 mRNA. The GAPDH and 18 S RNA amounts remained unchanged even after 3 h of actinomycin D treatment in suspended and adherent fibroblasts. We conclude that the decreased level of IRS-1 mRNA observed in suspended cells is not due to decreased mRNA stability.Figure 2Stability of IRS-1 mRNA in suspended and adherent fibroblasts. FAK+/+ fibroblasts detached from plates or left adherent were incubated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for 45 min to 3 h. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting. IRS-1, IRS-2, and GAPDH mRNAs were revealed using IRS-1 (1–2.8 kb), IRS-2 (2.9–3.9 kb), and GAPDH (0.6 kb) [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNAs, respectively. The 18 S rRNA was revealed with a [γ-32P]dATP-labeled oligonucleotide. An autoradiogram of a representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further investigate the role of integrins in the regulation of IRS-1 expression, we measured the synthesis of IRS-1 mRNA upon activation of integrins. To this end, FAK+/+fibroblasts were detached from plates and kept in suspension for 2 h. They were then replated on fibronectin or vitronectin, both of which engage the α5β1 or αvβ3 integrins, respectively. Total RNA was extracted after 1, 2, or 4 h of adhesion, and IRS-1 mRNA was revealed by Northern blotting (Fig. 3). Again, IRS-1 mRNA was decreased after 2 h of suspension. Importantly, the level of IRS-1 mRNA was restored after 4 h of adhesion to fibronectin as well as to vitronectin. The GAPDH and 18 S RNA amounts were unchanged. These experiments show that activation of integrins by fibronectin or vitronectin induces the synthesis of IRS-1 mRNA. Since the tyrosine kinase FAK is one of the major proteins activated in adherent cells, but inactivated in suspended cells, we next studied the potential role of FAK in the regulation of IRS-1 expression. To investigate the role of FAK in the control of IRS-1 mRNA levels, we used FAK knockout cells (FAK−/−) (29Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from FAK−/−, FAK+/+, and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blotting. As expected, the Northern blot revealed IRS-1 mRNA in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and FAK+/+ cells (Fig. 4,upper panel). However, no IRS-1 mRNA was detected in FAK−/− cells. On the contrary, the levels of IRS-2 mRNA were the same in FAK−/− and FAK+/+ cells. Note that GAPDH mRNA levels were also the same in both cell lines and that IRS-2 mRNA was also expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In summary, knockout of the gene encoding FAK leads to reduced synthesis of IRS-1 mRNA, but has no effect on IRS-2 mRNA. We next determined if there was a decreased stability of the IRS-1 mRNA in FAK−/− cells. As there were very low amounts of IRS-1 mRNA in these cells, a method more sensitive than Northern blotting was used, i.e. reverse transcription-PCR. Cells were treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for the indicated periods of time to block transcription. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4 (lower panel), the level of IRS-1 mRNA rapidly decreased in FAK+/+ cells, consistent with the half-life calculated from results shown in Fig. 2. The amount of IRS-1 mRNA was strongly reduced in FAK−/− cells compared with FAK+/+ cells. Due to the very low level of IRS-1 mRNA in FAK−/− cells, it was not possible to calculate its half-life. β-Actin mRNA was stable even after 6 h of actinomycin D treatment and was the same in both cell lines. As a whole, our results indicate that FAK may be required for synthesis of IRS-1 mRNA. Protein expression of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IR was determined in FAK−/− and FAK+/+ fibroblasts. To do this, FAK−/− or FAK+/+cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IR was performed. Immunopurified proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to IRS-1, IRS-2, and IR (Fig. 5). As expected, the IRS-1 protein was undetectable in FAK−/− cells, whereas no difference in the expression of IRS-2 and IR was observed between the two cell lines. In this experiment, FAK was correctly expressed in the wild-type cells, whereas no FAK was present in the mutant cells (data not shown). To further establish the role of FAK in IRS-1 gene expression, we investigated whether the expression of FAK in FAK−/− cells would restore IRS-1 protein expression. To do this, we used DA2 cells, which are FAK−/− cells stably transfected with an empty vector or a vector containing the cDNA encoding HA-tagged FAK (30Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 was performed using a specific antibody to IRS-1. Immunopurified proteins and total lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to IRS-1 or FAK. FAK expression was checked in all cell lines using an antibody to FAK (Fig. 6 B, middle panel). Due to the HA tag, FAK had an increased molecular mass in DA2 cells. An antibody to HA revealed that the protein observed in DA2 cells using the antibody to FAK corresponds to HA-tagged FAK (Fig. 6 B, lower panel). We found that IRS-1 expression was restored in the stably transfected DA2 cell line that expresses FAK (Fig. 6, A and B, upper panel). So far, we cannot explain why IRS-1 in DA2 cells seems to have an increased electrophoretic mobility compared with IRS-1 in FAK+/+ cells. Taking the results of Figs. 5 and 6 together, we suggest that FAK plays a positive role in the regulation of IRS-1 protein expression, but does not appear to be involved in IRS-2 or IR expression. It has previously been demonstrated in several cell types that integrins can activate JNK and that FAK is implicated in this process (20Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 21Oktay M. Wary K.K. Dans M. Birge R.B. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether this occurred also in FAK−/− cells. To this end, FAK−/− cells were serum-starved and kept in suspension for 1 h. Cells were then replated on fibronectin for 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h. Cells were lysed, and proteins were separated on a large-size polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed using antibodies to activated JNK. As shown in Fig. 7 (upper panels), JNK was not activated in FAK−/− cells in response to integrin engagement. Note that suspension of cells led to a weak stimulation of JNK. This effect could be caused by the engagement of stress signaling pathways due to serum depletion and suspension and is likely to be unrelated to the integrin signaling pathway. To document the role of FAK in integrin-induced JNK activation, we performed the same experiment in DA2 cells. The results presented in Fig. 7 (lower panels) demonstrate that the re-expression of FAK in FAK−/− cells is sufficient to restore the activation of JNK by integrins, which reaches a peak within 10 min and then fades out. Western blotting carried out with antibodies to JNK revealed similar levels of proteins under all conditions. To study the involvement of JNK in the synthesis of IRS-1 mRNA, FAK−/− cells were treated with anisomycin (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times to stimulate JNK. Total RNA was extracted, and IRS-1 mRNA was revealed by Northern blotting. Activation of JNK by anisomycin was tested after 30 and 60 min of stimulation. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting, and activated JNK and SAPK were revealed using a specific antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 8 (lower panels), JNK and SAPK were fully activated by anisomycin in FAK−/− cells after 30 min of treatment, and the stimulation started to decrease after 60 min. Fig. 8 (upper panel) shows that IRS-1 mRNA levels increased in a time-dependent manner in FAK−/−cells. However, the amount of IRS-1 mRNA in FAK−/− cells after 5 h of stimulation with anisomycin was still 2-fold smaller than that in FAK+/+ cells. Therefore, it appears that activated JNK only partially induces IRS-1 mRNA synthesis in the absence of FAK. Taken together, these results demonstrate that JNK is one of the pathways implicated in IRS-1 mRNA synthesis. To further establish the role of JNK in integrin-induced IRS-1 mRNA synthesis, we determined if JNK activation could restore the IRS-1 mRNA level in suspended cells. To this end, FAK+/+cells were treated with anisomycin at the indicated concentrations for 30 min. Cells were then kept in suspension for 2 h in the presence of anisomycin, and total RNA was extracted. IRS-1 mRNA expression was revealed by Northern blotting. The results are presented in Fig. 9 (upper panel). As previously demonstrated, the IRS-1 mRNA level decreased after 2 h of suspension. However, a dose-dependent increase in IRS-1 mRNA was observed in suspended cells treated with anisomycin. At 50 ng/ml anisomycin, the increase in IRS-1 mRNA was maximal, and the level of IRS-1 mRNA was very similar to the one detected in adherent cells. Activation of JNK by anisomycin was tested on whole cell lysates after 2 h of suspension under all conditions. Proteins were revealed by Western blotting using antibodies to phospho-JNK/phospho-SAPK and JNK/SAPK. As shown in Fig. 9 (lower panels), treatment with anisomycin induced a dose-dependent activation of JNK and SAPK. Interestingly, it seems that in suspended cells, anisomycin treatment slightly induced the expression of JNK. Therefore, it is possible that this effect contributes to the positive regulation of IRS-1 mRNA synthesis observed upon anisomycin treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of a cross-talk between signaling pathways used by integrins and those used by growth factors (8Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that adhesion is required for growth factors to induce the full array of their intracellular effects. More specifically, there have been examples for integrin regulation of insulin and IGF-1 signaling pathways (33Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33119-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Insulin and IGF-1 receptors are tyrosine kinase receptors, which are activated and autophosphorylated upon ligand binding. This leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the docking proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2 and to their subsequent interaction with several SH2 domain-containing proteins such as the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, Grb2, SHP-2 (SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosinephosphatase-2), and Nck (36Cheat"
https://openalex.org/W2155940571,"Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3 or stromelysin-1) specifically hydrolyzes the Ser337–Ser338 (P10–P9) and Val341–Ile342 (P6–P5) peptide bonds in human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Cleavage is completely abolished in the presence of the metal chelators EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline. A stabilized active PAI-1 variant was also cleaved by MMP-3. At an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/10 at 37 °C, PAI-1 protein cleavage occurred with half-lives of 27 or 14 min for active or stable PAI-1 and was associated with rapid loss of inhibitory activity toward tissue-type plasminogen activator with half-lives of 15 or 13 min, respectively. A substrate-like variant of PAI-1, lacking inhibitory activity but with exposed reactive site loop, was cleaved with a half-life of 23 min, whereas latent PAI-1 in which a major part of the reactive site loop is inserted into the molecule, was resistant to cleavage. Biospecific interaction analysis indicated comparable binding of active, stable, and substrate PAI-1 to both proMMP-3 and MMP-3 (K A of 12–22 × 106m−1), whereas binding of latent PAI-1 occurred with lower affinity (1.7–2.3 × 106m−1). Stable PAI-1 bound to vitronectin was cleaved and inactivated by MMP-3 in a manner comparable with that of free PAI-1; however, the cleaved protein did not bind to vitronectin. Cleavage and inactivation of PAI-1 by MMP-3 may thus constitute a mechanism decreasing the antiproteolytic activity of PAI-1 and impairing the potential inhibitory effect of vitronectin-bound PAI-1 on cell adhesion and/or migration. Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3 or stromelysin-1) specifically hydrolyzes the Ser337–Ser338 (P10–P9) and Val341–Ile342 (P6–P5) peptide bonds in human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Cleavage is completely abolished in the presence of the metal chelators EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline. A stabilized active PAI-1 variant was also cleaved by MMP-3. At an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/10 at 37 °C, PAI-1 protein cleavage occurred with half-lives of 27 or 14 min for active or stable PAI-1 and was associated with rapid loss of inhibitory activity toward tissue-type plasminogen activator with half-lives of 15 or 13 min, respectively. A substrate-like variant of PAI-1, lacking inhibitory activity but with exposed reactive site loop, was cleaved with a half-life of 23 min, whereas latent PAI-1 in which a major part of the reactive site loop is inserted into the molecule, was resistant to cleavage. Biospecific interaction analysis indicated comparable binding of active, stable, and substrate PAI-1 to both proMMP-3 and MMP-3 (K A of 12–22 × 106m−1), whereas binding of latent PAI-1 occurred with lower affinity (1.7–2.3 × 106m−1). Stable PAI-1 bound to vitronectin was cleaved and inactivated by MMP-3 in a manner comparable with that of free PAI-1; however, the cleaved protein did not bind to vitronectin. Cleavage and inactivation of PAI-1 by MMP-3 may thus constitute a mechanism decreasing the antiproteolytic activity of PAI-1 and impairing the potential inhibitory effect of vitronectin-bound PAI-1 on cell adhesion and/or migration. tissue-type plasminogen activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator matrix metalloproteinase-3 (stromelysin-1) plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 enzyme to substrate ratio pyroGlu-Phe-Lys-p-nitroanilide d-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Plasminogen, the zymogen of the fibrinolytic system, is converted into the active enzyme plasmin by tissue-type (t-PA)1 or urokinase-type (u-PA) plasminogen activator.

In contrast to other serpins, three different interconvertible conformations of PAI-1 have been described: an active conformation with inhibitory properties (forming a stable covalent complex with the target proteinase), a substrate conformation that is cleaved at P1-P1′ by its target proteinases (6Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a nonreactive latent conformation in which a major part of the reactive site loop is inserted into the molecule (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is synthesized in the active conformation but converts spontaneously into the latent conformation with a half-life of 1–2 h under physiological conditions (8Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1 is stabilized by binding to vitronectin (S protein), a protein present in the extracellular matrix and also detected in dimeric form in plasma (9Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Müller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ProMMP-3 (stromelysin-1) is secreted from different cell types as a 57-kDa single chain protein; conversion to MMP-3 involves removal of the NH2-terminal prosequence of approximately 80 amino acids to yield the 45-kDa active enzyme (10Marcy A.I.

MMP-3 has a broad substrate specificity; it cleaves proteoglycans, fibronectin, procollagen type I, collagens types III, IV and IX, and laminin, and it may activate procollagenase and progelatinase B (10Marcy A.I.

It has been shown previously that MMP-3 specifically hydrolyzes some components of the fibrinolytic system, including fibrinogen (14Bini A. Itoh Y. Kudryk B.J. Nagase H.

Recombinant human proMMP-3 was produced in Escherichia coli, using the plasmid pET-psf STR (the expression vector pET-8c containing the cDNA of a COOH-terminally truncated proMMP-3; a kind gift of Dr. A. I. Marcy, Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories, Rahway, NJ) (10Marcy A.I. Eiberger L.L. Harrison R. Chan H.K. Hutchinson N.I. Hagmann W.K. Cameron P.M. Boulton D.A. Hermes J.D.

Full-length natural human MMP-3 was a kind gift of Dr. H. Nagase (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Kansas Medical School, Kansas City, KS). Nonglycosylated recombinant active PAI-1 (45 kDa) was obtained and characterized as described (17Audenaert A.M. Knockaert I. Collen D. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19559-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the preparation contained 79% active, 12% latent, and 9% substrate PAI-1, as determined by incubation with t-PA followed by SDS-PAGE and densitometric gel scanning (18Gils A.

A stable PAI-1 mutant (with Asn150 to His, Lys154 to Thr, Gln301 to Pro, Gln319 to Leu, and Met354 to Ile mutation) with about 80% inhibitory activity and half-life at 37 °C of more than 150 h (19Vleugels N.

Biol. 2000; 297: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and a substrate-like PAI-1 mutant (with the P12 residue Ala335 mutagenized to Pro) were obtained as described (17Audenaert A.M. Knockaert I. Collen D. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19559-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Latent PAI-1 was obtained by incubation of active PAI-1 at 37 °C for 24–48 h (18Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12662-12666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Substrate and latent PAI-1 did not have detectable inhibitory activity, as monitored by titration with two-chain t-PA. Two-chain t-PA was obtained by plasmin treatment of ActilyseR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Boehringer, Ingelheim, Germany) and characterized as described (21Li X.-K. Lijnen H.R. Nelles L. Van Hoef B. Stassen J.M. Collen D. Blood. 1992; 79: 417-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1-resistant single chain t-PA (sct-PA-Δ(K296-G302), with deletion of Lys296 through Gly302), plasminogen, and plasmin were prepared as described (21Li X.-K. Lijnen H.R. Nelles L. Van Hoef B. Stassen J.M. Collen D. Blood. 1992; 79: 417-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polymeric rat vitronectin, which binds human PAI-1 to a similar extent as monomeric human vitronectin, 2P. J. Declerck, unpublished results. was obtained from Molecular Innovations Inc., (Royal Oak, MI). The chromogenic substrates S-2403 for plasmin and S-2288 for t-PA were purchased from Chromogenix (Antwerp, Belgium).d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (PPACK) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Nottingham, UK), and 1,10-phenanthroline was from Sigma. SDS-PAGE without reduction or after reduction with 1% dithioerythritol was performed on 10–15% gradient gels using the Phast systemR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R or silver staining. Protein bands were quantitated by densitometric gel scanning using the Gel-scan accessory of the Beckman DU60 spectrophotometer. A protein calibration mixture was used consisting of phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). Association rate constants (k ass inm−1 s−1) and dissociation rate constants (k diss in s−1) for the interactions between (pro)MMP-3 and different PAI-1 moieties were determined by biospecific interaction analysis using the BIAcore instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ProMMP-3 or MMP-3 were immobilized on the surface of sensor chip CM5 using the Amine Coupling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at pH 4.0, and binding of the PAI-1 ligands was evaluated as described in detail elsewhere (22Lijnen H.R. De Cock F. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, samples of PAI-1 treated with MMP-3 (E/S of 1/10 for 2 h at 37 °C) were run on a 10–20% Tris-Tricine gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a 0.45-μm ImmobilonTM-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein bands were visualized by brief staining with Amido Black and excised from the gel. Sequence analysis was performed on a ProciseTM, 492 Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), with identification of amino acids by high performance liquid chromatography. Human PAI-1 levels were measured by ELISA, using MA-7D4B7 for capture, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated MA-7F5 for tagging (23Declerck P.J. Alessi M.C. Verstreken M. Kruithof E.K.O. Juhan-Vague I. Collen D. Blood. 1988; 71: 220-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ELISA recognizes active, latent, and complexed PAI-1, indicating that the monoclonal antibodies do not react with the COOH-terminal peptide removed after interaction with proteinases. PAI-1 activity was also monitored with an immunofunctional assay; therefore, excess human two-chain t-PA was added to the samples and after incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, t-PA·PAI-1 complex was determined by ELISA using MA-15H12 for capture, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated MA-62E8 for tagging (24Declerck P.J. Verstreken M. Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A calibration curve was constructed using purified t-PA·PAI-1 complex. Figures were prepared using the curve fitting program of DeltaGraph. Active, latent, substrate, or stable PAI-1 (final concentration, 3 μm) were incubated with MMP-3 (final concentration, 60–300 nm) at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 80. At different time intervals (0–120 min), samples were removed from the incubation mixtures, EDTA (final concentration, 25 mm) was added to stop the reaction, and SDS-PAGE was performed under nonreducing conditions. The amounts of the different molecular forms of PAI-1 in the samples were determined by densitometric scanning of the gels and expressed as a percentage of the total value . In the experiments with active and stable PAI-1 moieties, PAI-1 activity was also monitored as a function of time. Therefore, samples were removed from the incubation mixtures, diluted 200–500-fold in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 38 mmNaCl and 0.01% Tween 80 and incubated with two-chain t-PA (final concentration, 20 nm) for 3 min at 37 °C. Residual t-PA activity was determined with S-2288 (final concentration, 0.5 mm) using a calibration curve constructed with two-chain t-PA (final concentration, 0–20 nm). In addition, mixtures of vitronectin (final concentration, 6 μm) and stable PAI-1 (final concentration, 3 μm) were incubated in solution (50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 80) for 0–120 min, before addition of MMP-3 (E/S of 1/10). The molecular forms of PAI-1 and vitronectin were monitored by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with silver staining, and PAI-1 activity was monitored by addition of two-chain t-PA, as described above. In separate experiments, polymeric rat vitronectin was coated to 96-well microtiter plates (1 μg/ml in PBS for 20 h at 4 °C), and after blocking with albumin (3% in PBS for 30 min at room temperature), human PAI-1 moieties (0–100 ng/ml) were added in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.004% Tween 80. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and extensive washing of the plates, bound PAI-1 antigen was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated MA-7F5. The second-order rate constant for the inhibition of two-chain t-PA (final concentration, 10 nm) by active PAI-1 (final concentration, 17 nm) was determined at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.01% Tween 80, by continuous monitoring ofA 405 nm in the presence of S-2288 (final concentration, 0.5 mm) (21Li X.-K. Lijnen H.R. Nelles L. Van Hoef B. Stassen J.M. Collen D. Blood. 1992; 79: 417-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of proMMP-3 (final concentration, 1–20 μm) on the inhibition rate was monitored in the same way. To avoid cleavage of PAI-1 by traces of active MMP-3 that may be present in the proMMP-3 preparation, all measurements were performed in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline (final concentration, 1 mm); this did not affect the hydrolysis rate of S-2288 by two-chain t-PA nor the inhibition rate by PAI-1 in the absence of proMMP-3 (data not shown). To evaluate whether active PAI-1 bound to proMMP-3 can still interact with t-PA, consecutive binding of both proteins to immobilized proMMP-3 was studied by biospecific interaction analysis. Therefore, a saturating concentration (500 nm) of t-PA- or PAI-1-resistant t-PA (sct-PA-Δ(K296-G302) was bound first to the proMMP-3, followed by active PAI-1 (500 nm). Additional binding of PAI-1 was determined by subtracting the binding curve for t-PA alone from that of t-PA plus PAI-1 and was compared with direct binding of PAI-1 (500 nm) to the insolubilized proMMP-3. Incubation of active PAI-1 (45 kDa) with MMP-3 (E/S ratio of 1/50 to 1/10) resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent conversion to a lower molecular mass fragment, compatible with removal of a small peptide (Fig. 1, inset). Addition of EDTA (final concentration, 25 mm) or 1,10-phenanthroline (final concentration, 1 mm) to the incubation mixture abolished the proteolytic cleavage, confirming that it is MMP-dependent. Densitometric scanning of SDS-PAGE with samples taken at different time points showed ≥60% cleavage within 60 min at E/S ratio of 1/10 (Fig. 1). To identify the cleavage site in PAI-1, it was digested with MMP-3 (E/S ratio of 1/10) for 2 h at 37 °C, as described above, and the reaction mixture was subjected to gel electrophoresis and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, as described above. This yielded one major sequence (>90%) for the residual PAI-1 moiety, corresponding to the intact NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (3Ny T Sawdey M. Lawrence D. Millan J.L. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6776-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), (Val-His-His-Pro-Pro-Ser), whereas for the cleaved peptide fraction, one major sequence (>80%) was detected (Ile-Val-Ser-Ala-Arg-Met), compatible with cleavage of the Val341–Ile342(P6–P5) peptide bond, and a minor sequence (Xaa-Thr-Ala-Val-Ile) compatible with cleavage of the Ser337–Ser338(P10–P9) peptide bond. Similar experiments with latent, stable, and substrate PAI-1 (E/S ratio of 1/10) revealed nearly quantitative hydrolysis of stable PAI-1 (≥90% within 2 h), and somewhat more limited hydrolysis of substrate PAI-1 (75% within 2 h), whereas latent PAI-1 appeared fully resistant to cleavage (Fig. 2). Incomplete cleavage observed with active PAI-1 (Fig. 1) may thus be due to some conversion of active to latent PAI-1 during the experiment. The half-lives for protein cleavage (at E/S ratio of 1/10) determined from semi-logarithmic plots of residual PAI-1 versus time (not shown) were 27, 23, or 14 min for active, substrate, or stable PAI-1, respectively. Full-length natural glycosylated MMP-3 at E/S ratio of 1/10 also induced hydrolysis of active and stable PAI-1 (60 and 82% protein cleavage within 2 h, respectively; not shown). Monitoring of PAI-1 activity in the experiments with active or stable PAI-1 indicated rapid loss of inhibitory activity upon addition of MMP-3; PAI-1 activity declined in parallel with the rate of proteolytic cleavage, with half-lives of 15 ± 2.6 or 13 ± 1.0 min for active or stable PAI-1, respectively (mean ± SD;n = 4). The faster disappearance of activity for the active PAI-1 as compared with protein cleavage is probably explained by partial conversion to latent PAI-1 during this experiment (t 12 of about 75 min under the conditions used). After 90 min of incubation, the residual PAI-1 activity was ≤10%; in agreement with these data. SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions did not reveal significant amounts of stable t-PA·PAI-1 complex (± 7% of the sample without MMP-3) after addition of equimolar amounts of two-chain t-PA and incubation for 3 min at 37 °C (not shown). In solution, MMP-3 cleaved vitronectin-bound stable PAI-1 as well as free stable PAI-1 in a time-dependent manner; protein cleavage at E/S ratio of 1/10 appeared somewhat slower in the presence of vitronectin (Fig. 3). PAI-1 activity, as monitored by addition of two-chain t-PA, decreased in a parallel manner, confirming proteolytic cleavage (t 12 of 20 or 27 min in the absence or the presence of vitronectin). Vitronectin itself was not cleaved by MMP-3 under these experimental conditions (Fig. 3, inset). Stable active PAI-1 as well as substrate PAI-1 bound in a concentration-dependent manner to vitronectin-coated microtiter plates as detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated MA-7F5 (Fig. 4). Substrate PAI-1 cleaved with t-PA (equimolar, 10 min at 37 °C) did not bind to vitronectin, whereas MMP-3 cleaved stable PAI-1 showed a low residual binding (≤25% of untreated stable PAI-1), probably because of residual noncleaved protein. Binding of stable active PAI-1 and of MMP-3 cleaved PAI-1 to insolubilized MA-7F5 was comparable, as determined by biospecific interaction analysis (K A of 0.39 ± 0.01 × 109 or 0.37 ± 0.02 × 109m−1; means ± S.D.,n = 3). Biospecific interaction analysis revealed comparable binding affinity of active, substrate, and stable PAI-1 to proMMP-3 (K A of 12 × 106 to 16 × 106m−1) and to MMP-3 (K A of 17 × 106 to 22 × 106m−1). Binding to proMMP-3 was, however, characterized by 2–3-fold lower k ass andk diss values, as compared with binding to active MMP-3. In contrast, the binding affinity of latent PAI-1 to proMMP-3 or MMP-3 was about 10-fold lower (K A of 2.3 × 106 or 1.7 × 106m−1, respectively), as a result of severalfold lower k ass and higherk diss (TableI).Table IApparent affinity constants of proMMP-3 and MMP-3 for binding to different molecular forms of PAI-1LigandProMMP-3MMP-3k ass (× 103)k diss (× 10−3)K A (× 106)k ass(×103)k diss (× 10−3)K A (× 106)M −1 s −1s −1M −1M −1 s −1s −1M −1Active PAI-129 ± 1.71.8 ± 0.2016 ± 1.947 ± 6.92.8 ± 0.5417 ± 6.1Latent PAI-16.9 ± 0.643.0 ± 0.402.3 ± 0.459.9 ± 2.26.0 ± 0.661.7 ± 0.19Substrate PAI-120 ± 0.701.4 ± 0.1115 ± 1.265 ± 4.73.0 ± 0.1722 ± 0.76Stable PAI-115 ± 1.11.2 ± 0.1312 ± 1.845 ± 6.52.6 ± 0.3517 ± 4.7Data are the means ± S.D. of three determinations. Open table in a new tab Data are the means ± S.D. of three determinations. The second-order rate constant (k 1 = 1 to 2 × 107m−1 s−1) of the inhibition of two-chain t-PA (final concentration, 10 nm) by PAI-1 (final concentration, 17 nm) was not affected by the presence of proMMP-3 (final concentration, ≤20 μm) (data not shown). The molecular interactions between proMMP-3, PAI-1, and t-PA were further investigated by biospecific interaction analysis. This revealed that single chain t-PA also binds to proMMP-3 (k ass = 68 ± 4.8 × 103m−1.s−1;k diss = 10 ± 0 × 10−3s−1 and K A = 6.6 ± 0.46 × 106m−1); a PAI-1-resistant t-PA mutant (sct-PA-Δ(K296-G302)) bound with comparable affinity (k ass = 49 ± 2.1 × 103m−1 s−1;k diss = 4.1 ± 0.40 × 10−3 s−1 and K A = 12 ± 0.75 × 106m−1). When a saturating concentration of single chain t-PA was first bound to proMMP-3, additional subsequent binding of active PAI-1 could be observed (corresponding to 1050 resonance units, as compared with 460 resonance units for direct binding of the same PAI-1 concentration to the proMMP-3 on the sensor chip; data are the mean values of two independent experiments). In contrast, when the proMMP-3 was first saturated with sct-PA-Δ (K296-G302), subsequent binding of PAI-1 was equal to the direct binding of PAI-1 to proMMP-3 (410 resonance units versus 420 resonance units). These findings confirm that active PAI-1 bound to proMMP-3 can still interact with t-PA and suggest that the binding sites on proMMP-3 for t-PA and PAI-1 are different. In separate experiments it was confirmed that active-site blocked t-PA (treated with excess PPACK) binds to insolubilized PAI-1 (k ass = 67 ± 7.0 × 103m−1 s−1; kdiss = 3.8 ± 0.3 × 10−3s−1, and K A = 18 ± 2.6 × 106m−1), whereas active-site blocked sct-PA-Δ(K2936-G302) showed no detectable binding to PAI-1 at a final concentration of 1 μm. PAI-1 belongs to the serpin superfamily, which comprises about 40 members, mainly inhibitory but also some noninhibitory serpins (26Marshall C.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 342: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Serpins can be inactivated by proteinases that they do not inhibit (27Travis J. Salvesen G. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar,28Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been reported previously that MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) inactivates several serpins by cleavage of a specific peptide bond at or around the P1–P1′ reactive site, located in a loop structure situated 30–40 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end. MMP-3 inactivates α1-proteinase inhibitor (cleavage of P2–P1 Pro–Met) (29Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. Suzuki K. Pizzo P.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol.

Jeffrey J.J. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2258-2265Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and by neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) (32Knauper V. Reinke H. Tschesche H.

Chem. 1991; 267: 5005-5012Google Scholar), which both hydrolyze the Phe–Leu (P7–P6) and Pro–Met (P2–P1) bonds in the reactive site loop. Stromelysin-3 (MMP-11) cleaves the Ala–Met (P9–P8) peptide bond in α1-proteinase inhibitor but does not proteolyze PAI-1 (34Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α1-Antichymotrypsin is also inactivated by MMP-1 and MMP-8, which both cleave the Ala–Leu (P2′–P3′) peptide bond (31Desrochers P.E.

Chem. 1991; 267: 5005-5012Google Scholar). Such interactions may constitute a mechanism whereby the local balance of proteinase inhibitory activity may be shifted in favor of proteolysis. Thus, inactivation of antithrombin III by neutrophil elastase was suggested to be a potential pathological mechanism of thrombosis associated with inflammation (35Carrell R.W. Owen M.C. Nature. 1985; 317: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and inactivation of α1-proteinase inhibitor by MMPs may decrease the inhibitor concentration at the site of inflammation (29Mast A.E.

PAI-1, the main inhibitor of the physiological plasminogen activators t-PA and u-PA, plays an important (patho)physiological role in the hemostatic system. High PAI-1 levels are associated with several thrombotic disease states, including deep venous thrombosis and coronary artery disease (36Juhan-Vague I. Alessi M.C. Declerck P.J. Baillière's Clin.

Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Decreased levels or deficiency of PAI-1, resulting in bleeding after trauma or injury, have been reported in isolated cases (36Juhan-Vague I. Alessi M.C. Declerck P.J. Baillière's Clin.

Besides its role in hemostasis, PAI-1 is involved in a variety of other (patho)physiological processes, including sepsis, ovulation, embryogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing (42Colucci M. Paramo J.A. Collen D. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 43Sappino A.P. Huarte J. Belin D. Vassalli J.D. J.

High PAI-1 levels are also a strong prognostic indicator of relapse in human cancers (47Kuhn W. Schmalfeldt B. Reuning U. Pache L. Berger U. Ulm K. Harbeck N. Spathe K. Dettmar P. Hofler H. Janicke F. Schmitt M. Graeff H. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 1746-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whereas noninhibitory serpins react with their target proteinases resulting in cleavage of the P1-P1′ peptide bond without formation of a stable complex, inhibitory serpins form a stable, covalent complex after the initial 1/1 stoichiometric reversible complex (48Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar, 49Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is secreted in an active conformation that spontaneously converts into a nonreactive “latent” conformation under physiological conditions (8Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon cleavage of the P1–P1′ reactive site peptide bond in active PAI-1, the new COOH-terminal end (P14–P1) inserts into β-sheet A to form strand s4A, whereas the new NH2-terminal (P1′–P10′) forms the β-strand s1C (50Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, the noninhibitory substrate conformation in which the P1-P1′ bond is accessible for cleavage, has an insertion of residues P16–P3 into β-sheet A (51Aertgeerts K. De Bondt H.L. De Ranter C.J. Declerck P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the latent conformation, the P14–P4 residues are inserted in the protein and form strand s4A of β-sheet A. The remainder of the reactive site loop (P3–P10′) exists in an extended conformation on the surface of the protein with the P1–P1′ bond inaccessible for target proteinases (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Our findings on cleavage of different conformational forms of PAI-1 by MMP-3 are compatible with these structural data. The cleavage sites in PAI-1 in relation to the active site loop are indicated in Fig.5. Active PAI-1 as well as a stable active PAI-1 moiety are efficiently cleaved by MMP-3; substrate PAI-1 is also cleaved, but latent PAI-1 is resistant to cleavage. Cleavage of the P10–P9 and P6–P5 bonds in PAI-1 is associated with inactivation of the serpin, as a result of removal of the P1–P1′ reactive site peptide bond. These MMP-3 scissile peptide bonds in PAI-1 are located more NH2-terminally of the P1–P1′ bond than in antithrombin III, α1-antichymotrypsin, or α1-proteinase inhibitor (29Mast A.E. Enghild J.J.

PAI-1 is stabilized by binding to vitronectin, which is present in plasma but also abundantly in the extracellular matrix (9Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Müller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native vitronectin accelerates the inactivation of human α-thrombin by PAI-1, which may be relevant for the control of extravascular proteolysis (52Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Ehrlich H.J. Klein Gebbink R. Preissner K.T. Keijer J. Esmon N.L. Mertens K. Pannekoek H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the presence of vitronectin, PAI-1 indeed displays a 200-fold accelerated thrombin inhibition, which may result from a conformational effect of vitronectin binding on the reactive site loop of PAI-1 (54Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 55Gibson A. Baburaj K. Day D.E. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5112-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This effect may also be counteracted by inactivation of PAI-1 following cleavage by MMP-3. Indeed, this proposed conformational change in the reactive site loop of PAI-1 upon interaction with vitronectin does not impair its cleavage by MMP-3. Furthermore, the MMP-3 cleaved PAI-1 moiety does not bind efficiently to immobilized vitronectin, as also observed for the t-PA cleaved substrate PAI-1. Although the major vitronectin-binding site is assumed to be located in the NH2-terminal domain of PAI-1 (25Ehnebom J. Björquist P. Sigurdardottir O. Deinum J. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 2000; 14: 47-57Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 56Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Erickson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cleavage in the COOH-terminal region containing the reactive center apparently affects the binding. This may be due to insertion of part of the reactive site loop into the molecule, thereby destroying the vitronectin binding site, as was previously observed for latent PAI-1. These observations may be relevant in view of recent findings that PAI-1 plays a role in cell adhesion and migration, independent from its antiproteolytic activity, as a result of high affinity binding to vitronectin thereby competing with u-PA receptor-dependent or integrin-dependent binding of cells to the extracellular matrix (57Deng G.

Fujita R.M. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, the blocking effect of PAI-1 on both u-PA receptor- and integrin-mediated cell adhesion is fully reversible with u-PA (57Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S.J. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 59Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 62Loskutoff D.J. Curriden S.A. Hu G. Deng G. APMIS. 1999; 107: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interpretation of the relevance of these findings is, however, complicated by the inhibitory effects of PAI-1, which modulate proteolytic activity in the cell environment (45Bajou K. Noel A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. HolstHansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The exact role(s) of PAI-1 in cell migration, and the role of its inhibitory activity versus adhesion properties, remains to be further delineated. Cleavage by MMP-3 may, however, represent a mechanism not only decreasing the antiproteolytic activity of PAI-1 but also impairing the competitive inhibitory properties on cell adhesion and/or migration by reducing the binding of cleaved PAI-1 to vitronectin. It is unclear whether such a mechanism could play a role in processes such as wound healing and tumor progression. Interestingly, PAI-1 associated with proMMP-3 can still functionally interact with t-PA, whereas interaction with active MMP-3 results in its neutralization. Taken together, cleavage and inactivation of PAI-1 by MMP-3 may constitute a mechanism whereby its inhibitory activity may be decreased in (patho)physiological conditions, allowing generation of enhanced proteolytic activity.

The effects of 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 are largely mediated via interaction with a specific nuclear vitamin D3 receptor (VDR).1 The VDR is a ligand-dependent transcriptional regulator, belonging to the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily (reviewed in Ref. 3Darwish H.M. DeLuca H.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 321-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VDR primarily interacts with specific DNA sequences composed of a hexanucleotide of direct repeat, binding as either a homodimer or as heterodimer with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (4Glass C.K. Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). Known target genes of VDR regulation include the cell cycle inhibitors p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 (5Silberstein G.B. Daniel C.W. Science. 1987; 237: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), perhaps accounting in part for the anti-proliferative effects of VDR ligands on some types of cells. Growth suppressive effects of VDR ligands on epithelial cancer cells in vitro have prompted interest in the possibility of applying natural or synthetic VDR ligands for the treatment of cancer (reviewed in Ref. 6van Leeuwen J.P.T.M. Pols H.A.P.P. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 1089-1105Google Scholar). Prostate cancer is among the types of tumor cells with documented sensitivity to VDR ligands. 1α,25(OH)2vitamin D3 and its less calcemic synthetic analogues have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of established human prostate carcinoma cell lines and primary cultures of normal and prostate cancer cells (7Ly L.H.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the particular cell line tested, VDR ligands can induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation, apoptosis, or combinations of these events (9Guzey M. DeLuca H. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1997; 98: 3-18PubMed Google Scholar). Functional VDR is necessary for the growth-inhibitory effect of VDR. However, prostate cancer cell lines vary in their sensitivity to 1α,25(OH)2vitamin D3 and its synthetic analogues in ways that cannot be explained by differences in VDR protein levels or rates of ligand metabolism, suggesting the existence of mechanisms for modulating VDR function at a post-ligand binding step. This variability in bioresponses to synthetic vitamin D3 analogues has also been observed in vivo in clinical trials involving men with advanced prostate cancer (10Gross C. Peehl D.M. Feldman D. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike W.P. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 1125-1200Google Scholar). The human BAG1 gene encodes several proteins, including BAG1, BAG1M (Rap46), and BAG1L, which differ in the length of their N-terminal domains but which all share a conserved C-terminal domain that binds the ATPase domain of heat shock 70-kDa (Hsp70) family molecular chaperones (11Takayama S.

Our findings indicate that the longest of the BAG1 protein isoforms, BAG1L, interacts with VDR in a ligand-inducible manner, enhancing VDR function and improving prostate cancer cellular responses to the growth suppressive effects of vitamin D3analogues. Thus, levels of BAG1L may be one of the determinants of vitamin D3 responses in normal and malignant tissues. 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3and 1α,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-22(E)-vitamin D3were generously provided by Dr. H.

These VDR ligands were prepared as 10−3m stock solutions in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. Stock solution concentrations were confirmed by spectroscopy (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices), using an extinction coefficient at 220–290 nm of 18,300 for 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. The spectroscopic confirmation for 1α,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-22(E)-vitamin D3 was slightly modified as described previously (16Perlman K.L. Sicinski R.R. Schnoes H.K. DeLuca H.F.

Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (PC3, LNCaP, ALVA31) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (293 and COS-7) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For most experiments, cells were cultured in medium in which the serum had been preadsorbed with activated charcoal to deplete steroid hormones (14Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). COS-7 and 293T cells were transiently transfected by a LipofectAMINE method. Cells at ∼50% confluence (∼2 × 105 cells) were seeded per well in six-well (9.4 cm2) plates (Corning, New York) in 2 ml/well of steroid-depleted medium. The next day, 2.2 μg of DNA was combined with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE in a total volume of 375 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for ∼ 0.5 h. Adherent cells were washed twice with serum-free pre-warmed Opti-MEM, and then DNA/LipofectAMINE mixtures were applied in 750 μl of Opti-MEM. After culturing at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h, 1.5 ml of 20% csFBS-containing medium was added per well. The following day, various concentrations of 1α,25(OH)2vitamin D3 or 1α,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-22(E)-vitamin D3 were added and cells were cultured for up to 3 days before preparing lysates for various assays.

After 2 days, cells were cultured in medium containing 0.6 mg/ml (active drug) G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was replaced twice weekly, until colonies of stably transfected clones arose. Clones were individually recovered and expanded in culture. Transient transfection reporter gene assays were employed for monitoring VDR trans-activation function. Briefly, cells were transiently transfected as described above with various amounts (20, 50, 100, and 150 ng) of pcDNA3 plasmids encoding BAG1L, BAG1L(ΔC), BAG1M, BAG1, BAG1S, or BAG1 (20–800 ng) (11Takayama S.

After 36–48 h, cell lysates were prepared using Promega reporter lysis buffer (Promega), normalized for total protein content, and relative levels of CAT and β-galactosidase activity were measured as described (14Froesch B.A. Takayama S.

Stably transfected clones of PC-3 cells containing pRc-CMV control (“Neo”) or pRc/CMV-BAG1L plasmids were seeded at 7.5 × 103 cells/six-well plate in 2 ml of normal medium for 24 h, then changed to medium in which the serum had been preadsorbed with activated charcoal to deplete steroid hormones. In some cases, VDR ligands were added, as indicated, and cultures were continued for up to 48 h. Cells were then cultured with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 1 h, collected by trypsinization, and fixed in 70% ethanol (final concentration ∼106 cells/100 μl). Fixed cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), then exposed to 2 m HCl, 0.5% BSA at room temperature for 20 min before re-washing with PBS/BSA and re-suspending in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium borate (Na2B4O7) (pH 8.7) for 2 min at room temperature, and washing a final time with PBS/BSA. Cells were incubated in PBS/BSA with 20 μl/106 cells fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (PharMingen) for 20 min in the dark. Finally, propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) was added, and the cells were analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson FACStar-Plus) using the Cell Quest and Mod-Fit programs. Cell lysates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA), normalized for total protein content (25 μg of protein), and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% gels, followed by electrotransfer to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Bio-Rad).

Untransfected ALVA31 and LN-CaP cells or 293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding BAG1L or BAG1L(ΔC) were cultured with or without 5 × 10−8m 1α,25(OH)2vitamin D3, and collected at 70% confluence. Cells were lysed on ice in HKMEN (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 142 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), then either passed several times through a ∼21-gauge needle to disrupt nuclei or NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce) was added according to the manufacturer's protocol. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min, the resulting supernatants from equivalent numbers of cells were subjected to immunoprecipitations in HKMEN using the anti-BAG1 monoclonal KS6C8, anti-VDR monoclonal IVG8C11, or anti-VDR polyclonal antiserum, bound to protein G-agarose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Control immunoprecipitations were performed using mouse IgG1 (Dako) or non-immune rabbit serum (Santa Cruz). Immune-complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of HKMEN and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting, as above. We initially explored the effects of BAG1 proteins on the trans-activation function of the VDR using transient transfection reporter gene assays in HEK 293T and COS-7 cells. Several isoforms of the BAG1 protein were compared, as depicted in Fig. 1. These isoforms of BAG1 all contain a conserved C-terminal domain “BAG domain” responsible for high affinity interactions with Hsc70/Hsp70 molecular chaperones and they possess an upstream ubiquitin-like domain, but they differ in the length of their N-terminal domains. The various isoforms of BAG1L arise by translation from alternative initiation codons within a common mRNA (11Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar, 25Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, only BAG1L contains both nucleoplasmin-like and SV40 large T-like candidate nuclear targeting sequences and is constitutively localized to nuclei (11Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar, 25Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To enforce expression of selected isoforms of BAG1, a cDNA encoding the longest isoform, BAG1L, and various 5′-truncated versions of cDNAs encoding BAG1M, BAG1, and BAG1S were subcloned into an expression plasmid, with additional modifications as described previously (11Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C.

Genomics. 1996; 35: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These plasmids were then co-transfected in various amounts with a fixed amount of plasmid encoding VDR and a VDRE-CAT reporter gene plasmid. Cells were supplied with physiologically relevant concentrations (5 × 10−9m) of 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. All data were normalized relative to cells stimulated with 1α,25(OH)2vitamin D3 in the absence of BAG1 expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 2, the longest isoform, BAG1L, enhanced the trans-activation function of VDR in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in a 2–4-fold increase in VDRE-tk-CAT reporter gene activation under these conditions. In contrast, BAG1M, BAG1, and BAG1S had little effect on VDR activity (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Moreover, although full-length BAG1L effectively enhanced VDR activity, a mutant of BAG1L lacking the C-terminal Hsc70/Hsp70-binding domain did not. This observation confirms the specificity of these finding obtained with full-length BAG1L and also suggests that the C-terminal BAG domain of BAG1L is required for potentiating VDR activity. Immunoblot analysis was performed to verify production of the BAG1L, BAG1L(ΔC), BAG1M, BAG1, and BAG1S proteins in transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3, BAG1L, BAG1L(ΔC), BAG1, and BAG1S were produced at comparable levels. The BAG1M protein was also produced, but due to internal translation initiation from the AUG, which normally gives rise to the shorter BAG1 protein, the steady-state levels of BAG1M achieved were only about half the other isoforms. Nevertheless, BAG1M protein was produced at levels far in excess of endogenous BAG1 and BAG1L, which migrate at ∼35 and ∼55 kDa and which can be seen as faint bands in the immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3). We conclude, therefore, that the selective enhancement of VDR activity seen with BAG1L but not with other BAG1 isoforms in transient transfection reporter gene assays is unlikely to be due to differences in the levels of production of these proteins. Importantly, expression of the various isoforms of BAG1 had no effect on levels of VDR, thus excluding alterations in the receptor for 1α,25(OH)2vitamin D3 as a trivial explanation for the results obtained in reporter gene assays (Fig. 3 B). Immunoblotting also confirmed the concentration dependence of BAG1L protein production in response to transfection of various amounts of expression plasmid DNA (Fig. 3 C), further validating the results obtained by reporter gene assays. The functional collaboration of BAG1L with VDR prompted us to explore whether these proteins physically interact, particularly given evidence that BAG1L can associate with certain other members of the NR family (13Liu R.

Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using lysates from untransfected ALVA-31 (Fig. 4) and LNCaP (data not shown) prostate cancer cells to explore whether the endogenous BAG1L and VDR proteins can form complexes. These lines were chosen because they contain relatively high intrinsic levels of both BAG1L and VDR, and because they are sensitive to 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3-induced growth suppression (10Gross C. Peehl D.M. Feldman D. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike W.P. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 1125-1200Google Scholar). 2M. Guzey, S. Takayama, and J. C. Reed, unpublished observations. BAG1L was immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from unstimulated and 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3-treated cells, and the resulting immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using an anti-VDR antibody. Anti-BAG1 immunoprecipitates prepared from lysates of 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 -treated cells contained associated VDR, whereas VDR was not found associated with BAG1L immune complexes derived from unstimulated ALVA31 (Fig. 4) or LNCaP (data not shown) cells. Control immunoprecipitates prepared using mouse IgG1 instead of anti-BAG1 antibody confirmed the specificity of these results. Comparisons of the levels of VDR and BAG1L proteins in ALVA31 and LNCaP lysates before and after treatment with 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 revealed no demonstrable difference, indicating that the association is not merely secondary to ligand-induced changes in the amounts of these proteins (data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that VDR associates with BAG1L in a ligand-dependent manner. The ligand-dependent association of BAG1L with VDR predicts that BAG1L should enhance VDR trans-activation function only when appropriate steroid ligand is provided. Accordingly, we performed transient transfection reporter gene assays in which cells were cultured with or without 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 in medium containing steroid-depleted serum. Co-expression of BAG1L with VDR in the absence of ligand did not increase VDR-mediated reporter gene trans-activation (Fig. 4 B). However, when 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 was provided, BAG1L more than doubled the levels of VDR-mediated induction of the VDRE-CAT reporter gene plasmid compared with COS-7 cells, which received VDR and 1α,25(OH)2vitamin D3 in the absence of BAG1L. Taken together, these results demonstrate that BAG1L associates with and potentiates the function of VDR complexes in a ligand-dependent manner. It has been shown that the last 47 amino acids of the BAG1 protein are required for binding to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and Hsp70 chaperones (11Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S.

To explore the functional consequences of removing the C-terminal domain from BAG1L on VDR, transient transfection reporter gene assays were performed, assaying VDR-mediated trans-activation of the VDRE-CAT reporter gene plasmid in the presence of increasing amounts of co-transfected pcDNA3-BAG1L (ΔC), which encodes a truncation mutant of BAG1L lacking the Hsp70/Hsc70-binding domain. As shown in Fig. 5 A, co-transfection of the BAG1L(ΔC) expression plasmid failed to enhance VDR activity and instead inhibited VDR activity in a concentration-dependent manner, reducing trans-activation of the VRE-CAT reporter gene by approximately half. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated dose-dependent production of the BAG1L(ΔC) protein, which reached levels roughly equivalent to full-length BAG1L at the highest concentrations of plasmid DNA transfected (Fig. 5 B). We conclude, therefore, that the Hsc70/Hsp70-binding domain of BAG1L is necessary for its stimulatory effects on VDR, and that deletion of this domain converts BAG1L from a stimulator to an inhibitor of VDR, presumably functioning as a trans-dominant competitor of the endogenous wild-type BAG1L protein. To explore the mechanism of the BAG1L(ΔC) protein further, comparisons were made of the ability of B"

Suppression of protein kinase C (PKC) activity can selectively induce apoptosis in cells expressing a constitutively activated Ras protein. We wished to determine whether reactive oxygen species serve as an effector of Ras-mediated apoptosis. Ras-transformed NIH/3T3 cells contained higher basal levels of intracellular H2O2 compared with normal NIH/3T3 cells, and PKC inhibition up-regulated ROS to 5-fold greater levels in Ras-transformed cells than in normal cells. Treatment withN-acetyl-l-cysteine reduced both the basal and inducible levels of intracellular H2O2 in NIH/3T3-Ras cells and antagonized the induction of apoptosis by PKC inhibition. Culturing NIH/3T3-Ras cells in low oxygen conditions, which prevents ROS generation, also inhibited the apoptotic response to PKC inhibition. These results suggest that reactive oxygen species are necessary as downstream effectors of the Ras-mediated apoptotic response to PKC inhibition. However, the generation of ROS alone is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in Ras-transformed cells because inhibition of cell cycle progression prevented the induction of apoptosis in NIH/3T3-Ras cells without inhibiting the generation of intracellular H2O2 observed after PKC inhibition.

Studies have shown that phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase, a direct downstream effector of Ras, plays a crucial role in mediating Ras protection against apoptosis by activating PKB1/AKT (9Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 10Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). PKB/AKT activation may prevent apoptosis by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (11Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar), allowing it to be sequestered by 14-3-3 proteins (12Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PKB/AKT may also activate NF-κB as a protective mechanism against apoptosis (13Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), as NF-κB activity is known to be protective against various forms of apoptosis (14Yin Foo S. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), including Ras-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of NF-κB activity results in apoptosis of Ras-transformed cells (15Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of the transcriptional repressor protein Par-4, which can inhibit NF-κB transcriptional activity, also induces apoptosis in Ras-transformed cells (16Nalca A. Qiu S.G. El-Guendy N. Krishnan S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29976-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to activation of phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase by Ras, activation of the Raf-MAP kinase pathway may also be necessary for Ras-mediated protection against apoptosis, downstream of growth factor signaling (17Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Curiously, Ras activation of the Raf-MAP kinase pathway may actually enhance apoptosis induced by c-Myc (9Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Ras can sensitize cells to apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli (6Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and high level expression of oncogenic Ras alone can induce apoptosis as well (18Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has demonstrated that the inhibition of PKC activity can also induce apoptosis in cells expressing activated Ras (7Chen C.Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16700-16709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). Like NF-κB, PKC can also protect against many forms of apoptosis (19Lucas M. Sanchez-Margalet V. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and basal levels of PKC activity may protect against Ras-induced apoptosis. Although the mechanisms by which Ras provides protection against apoptosis are being elucidated, less is understood about how Ras can induce apoptosis or sensitize cells to different apoptotic stimuli. Some studies (18Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Goillot E. Raingeaud J. Ranger A. Tepper R.I. Davis R.J. Harlow E. Sanchez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3302-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) have reported that the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and/or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase is important for Ras-mediated apoptosis, whereas others (21Parrizas M. Blakesley V.A. Beitner-Johnson D. Le Roith D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 234: 616-620Google Scholar, 22Ohmori M. Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Okumura K. Sasazuki T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4714-4717PubMed Google Scholar) show no role for extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation. Elucidation of the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in Ras-mediated apoptosis is complicated by the fact that activation of the Raf-MAP kinase pathway can also inhibit apoptosis (17Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). One downstream effector of Ras that could potentially mediate or initiate an apoptotic process is reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can influence numerous intracellular pathways, including those leading to programmed cell death (25Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 26Anderson K.M. Seed T. Ou D. Harris J.E. Med. Hypotheses. 1999; 52: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As intracellular second messengers, ROS also control a variety of Ras-mediated cellular effects (27Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether ROS mediated apoptosis of Ras-transformed cells in which PKC was inhibited. We report here that the generation of ROS is necessary for Ras to initiate apoptosis when PKC is inhibited. However, up-regulation of ROS alone is not sufficient for the induction of apoptosis by PKC. Our studies indicate that cell cycle progression is also necessary for Ras-mediated apoptosis to occur, independent of ROS generation. The NIH/3T3 mouse embryo fibroblast line and Balb/3T3 clone A31 mouse embryo fibroblast line were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). NIH/3T3-Ras cells were produced by stable transfection of NIH/3T3 cells with v-Ha-ras and selected and maintained in 0.5 μg of geneticin/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). KBalb cells were produced by stable transfection of Balb cells with v-Ki-ras and have been described previously (28Zullo J.N. Faller D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5080-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). KBalb-Bcl2 cells were produced by stable transfection of KBalb cells with a retroviral Bcl-2 expression vector (29Wagner A.J. Small M.B. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well and treated in triplicate with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) or 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol (HMG) (Calbiochem) for the times indicated. Background control wells were treated with 0.19% saponin for 10 min prior to assay. Wells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 500 μl of 1 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) in PBS was added to each well. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence was quantified on a Cytofluor 2300 fluorescent plate reader (Applied Biosystems) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/530 nm. Cells were plated at 1 × 105/plate in 60-mm dishes and treated for the indicated times. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and fixed in 35% ethanol, 65% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 25 μg of propidium iodide/ml and 50 μg of RNase A/ml in PBS. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and DNA profiles were analyzed by FACS using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Cells were plated at 1 × 105/plate in 60-mm dishes and treated for the indicated times. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 5 μg of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) (Molecular Probes)/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and analyzed immediately by FACS. For manipulation of ROS levels, cells were either treated with 20 mm NAC (Sigma) or placed in sealed chambers (Billups-Rothenberg), which had been flushed for 30 min with 95% N2, 5% CO2 as described previously (30Kourembanas S. Hannan R.L. Faller D.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) for 24 h before treatment with HMG. Cellular PKC activity was measured using a commercial assay, following the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology) and as described previously (7Chen C.Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16700-16709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with 150 μm HMG for 24 h or left untreated in normal culture conditions before harvesting with trypsin/EDTA. Cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl, and extracts were normalized for protein concentration. Subsequently, 100 μg of extract was incubated with a PKC-specific peptide substrate, [32P]ATP, and inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calmodulin kinase for 10 min at 30 °C.32P incorporated into the substrate was separated from residual 32P using p81 phosphocellulose paper and quantified by scintillation counting. NIH/3T3-Ras cells were treated as indicated for 24 h, either in low oxygen culture conditions or with sodium butyrate (5 mm) or TsA (100 ng/ml). For a control, NIH/3T3 cells were serum-starved in medium containing 0.5% donor calf serum for 24 h, and endogenous Ras was activated by PDGF (30 ng/ml) stimulation for 15 min. Ras activity was measured using the technique developed by de Rooij and Bos (31de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm NaF. Protein was normalized to 1 μg/μl, and activated Ras was affinity precipitated by mixing 1 mg of cell lysate with 10 μg of Raf-1 RBD agarose bead conjugate (Upstate Biotechnology) end over end for 30 min at 4 °C. Agarose bead conjugates were washed 3 times in lysate buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Beads were pelleted, and supernatant was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses gel. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with a pan-Ras antibody (Oncogene Research Products). Ras protein was detected using ECL-Plus chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Our laboratory has previously shown that down-regulation of PKC by chronic, high dose PMA treatment (32Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) could selectively induce apoptosis in Jurkat human T lymphoblastoid cells stably expressing v-Ha-Ras (PH1 cells) when compared with normal Jurkat cells (7Chen C.Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16700-16709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of PKC by high dose PMA treatment also selectively induced cell death in both v-Ki-ras-transformed Balb fibroblasts (KBalb) and v-Ha-ras-transformed NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (NIH/3T3-Ras) when compared with normal Balb and NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 1 a). Treatment with 100 nm PMA, a concentration that activates PKC but is insufficient to cause down-regulation of PKC, consistently caused less than 10% loss in cell viability of the Ras-transformed fibroblasts. In contrast, chronic high dose treatment of Ras-transformed fibroblasts with 500 nm PMA, a concentration known to cause down-regulation of PKC after prolonged exposure (32Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), caused between 85 and 95% cell death after 72 h. No loss in cell viability was seen in normal Balb or NIH/3T3 fibroblasts with either 100 or 500 nm PMA treatment. These findings demonstrate that the suppression of PKC activity, but not activation of PKC, can trigger cell death in the presence of oncogenic Ras activity. To determine whether a pharmacological inhibitor of PKC could also selectively induce cell death in Ras-transformed cells, the diacylglycerol antagonist HMG was used to treat both normal and Ras-transformed fibroblasts. Treatment of KBalb and NIH/3T3-Ras fibroblasts with 150 μm HMG caused Ras-specific cell death, similar to that achieved using chronic, high dose PMA down-regulation of PKC. Ras-transformed cells treated with 150 μm HMG underwent 80–90% loss in cell viability after 48 h, whereas less than 10% loss of viability was observed after treatment of normal Balb and NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 1 b). Other selective PKC inhibitors, such as Ro-31-8220 and GF109203X, were also able to induce differentially cell death in Ras-transformed cells. 2J. S. Liou and D. V. Faller, unpublished observation. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in KBalb cells by transfection with a retroviral expression vector inhibited the apoptosis induced by HMG treatment, consistent with our previous findings that Bcl-2 overexpression effectively inhibited death induced by chronic, high dose PMA treatment in cells expressing activated Ras (8Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that the dose of HMG that selectively induced cell death was also inhibiting PKC activity, anin vitro PKC activity assay was performed. Treatment with 150 μm HMG suppressed the cellular PKC activity of cells growing logarithmically in 10% serum-containing medium by greater than 4-fold (Fig. 1 c). Photomicroscopy of NIH/3T3-Ras cells treated with HMG showed changes in morphology consistent with apoptosis (Fig. 1 d). Quantification of apoptosis by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis showed that NIH/3T3-Ras cells underwent increasing amounts of DNA fragmentation over a 72-h period, with over 70% of the population containing a hypodiploid DNA content at 72 h (Fig. 2 a). In contrast, no increase in DNA fragmentation was observed in parental (normal) NIH/3T3 after 72 h of HMG treatment when compared with basal levels (Fig. 2 b). Concurrent analysis of cell cycle indicated that over 98% of parental NIH/3T3 cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase after PKC inhibition (Fig. 2 c). This cell cycle arrest was reversible, and NIH/3T3 cells resumed cell cycle progression once HMG was washed out of culture.2 To determine if reactive oxygen species served as effectors of Ras-mediated apoptosis, intracellular ROS levels were measured by FACS using the peroxide-sensitive fluorescent indicator, DCF. NIH/3T3-Ras cells showed higher basal levels of ROS compared with parental NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 3 a). KBalb cells also showed higher basal ROS levels compared with parental Balb cells.2 HMG treatment for 24 h caused an up-regulation of ROS levels in both NIH/3T3 and NIH/3T3-Ras (Fig. 3 b). However, whereas ROS levels were up-regulated by only 2-fold in NIH/3T3 cells in response to HMG, ROS levels increased by more than 7-fold in NIH/3T3-Ras cells. Treatment with the structurally unrelated PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 and GF109203X also resulted in similar up-regulation of ROS levels,2 suggesting that ROS generation by HMG correlated with PKC inhibition. To establish whether the up-regulation of ROS levels is necessary for Ras-mediated apoptosis, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used to pre-treat Ras-transformed cells. Treatment of NIH/3T3-Ras cells with 20 mm NAC for 24 h reduced the basal ROS to levels similar to those in parental NIH/3T3 (Fig. 4 a). Moreover, pre-treatment of NIH/3T3-Ras cells with NAC completely inhibited the up-regulation of ROS levels induced by HMG, reducing ROS to levels comparable to those found in untreated NIH/3T3-Ras cells (Fig. 4 b). Pre-treatment of NIH/3T3-Ras cells with NAC also effectively inhibited the DNA fragmentation induced by HMG. DNA fragmentation was reduced from a 13-fold increase in cells unprotected by NAC treatment to 2-fold in cells pre-treated with NAC (Fig. 4 c). Culturing cells under a low oxygen environment is another method for inhibiting intracellular ROS generation (33Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3-Ras cells were cultured in either normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h before treatment with HMG. After PKC inhibition, cells were maintained in normoxic or hypoxic conditions for another 48 h before analysis of DNA fragmentation by FACS. Whereas NIH/3T3-Ras cells maintained in normoxic conditions underwent a 10-fold increase in DNA fragmentation upon HMG treatment, DNA fragmentation was reduced to only 2-fold in NIH/3T3-Ras cells cultured in hypoxia (Fig. 5 a). In contrast, serum deprivation, which can induce apoptosis independently of ROS generation (34Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), was able to induce DNA fragmentation in NIH/3T3 cells, regardless of normoxic or hypoxic culture conditions (Fig. 5 b).Figure 5Low oxygen inhibits DNA fragmentation caused by PKC inhibition. Cells were cultured in a low oxygen environment in sealed chambers for 24 h or left in normoxic conditions. Subsequently, NIH/3T3-Ras cells were treated with 150 μmHMG (a) or NIH/3T3 cells were serum-starved as control (b). Cells cultured in low oxygen were returned to sealed chambers for another 48 h before analysis of DNA fragmentation. The percentage of the population of cells containing less than 2n of DNA in each condition is indicated. Results shown are representative of experiments performed two times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the mechanism by which PKC inhibition generates ROS, studies were performed using diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase (35Meier B. Cross A.R. Hancock J.T. Kaup F.J. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Pre-treatment of NIH/3T3-Ras cells with diphenylene iodonium did not inhibit the up-regulation of ROS by HMG, suggesting no role for NAD(P)H oxidase in generating ROS downstream of PKC inhibition (data not shown). Since mitochondria play an important role in many forms of apoptosis and are also a major source for ROS production (36Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the involvement of mitochondria as the source of ROS downstream of PKC inhibition. To explore the possibility that the inhibition of PKC generates ROS as a consequence of the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, studies were performed using cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (37Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of NIH/3T3-Ras cells with CsA did not affect the basal level of ROS in the cells but effectively blocked the up-regulation of ROS by HMG treatment (Fig. 6 a). Moreover, the inhibition of HMG-induced ROS generation by CsA correlated with inhibition of apoptosis. NIH/3T3-Ras cells pretreated with CsA exhibited nearly a 10-fold reduction in DNA fragmentation induced by HMG (Fig. 6 b). Previous results from our laboratory suggested that cell cycle progression may also be necessary for Ras-mediated apoptosis (7Chen C.Y. Liou J. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16700-16709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Attempts to use the cell cycle-arresting agents hydroxyurea or aphidicolin to inhibit the cell cycle progression of Ras-transformed cells resulted in high levels of cytotoxicity. However, the cell cycle-arresting agents sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TsA) were relatively nontoxic to NIH/3T3-Ras cells and were therefore tested for their ability to inhibit Ras-mediated apoptosis induced by PKC inhibition. Pre-treatment of NIH/3T3-Ras cells with either sodium butyrate (5 mm) (Fig. 7 a) or TsA (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 7 b) reduced the induction of DNA fragmentation in cells by HMG treatment from over 13-fold to less than 2-fold. Concurrent cell cycle analysis showed inhibition of cell cycle progression and accumulation of cells in G1 induced by both sodium butyrate and TsA treatments (Fig. 8 a). Treatment with either sodium butyrate or TsA reduced the percentage of cells in S phase by more than 5-fold. In contrast, treatment with isobutyramide, an analog of sodium butyrate (38Perrine S.P. Dover G.H. Daftari P. Walsh C.T. Jin Y. Mays A. Faller D.V. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 88: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), had no effect on the cell cycle distribution of NIH/3T3-Ras cells (Fig. 8 a) and also did not prevent induction of apoptosis by HMG.2 Thus, inhibition of apoptosis by these compounds correlated with inhibition of cell cycle progression. Our laboratory has shown that continued Ras activity is necessary to mediate apoptosis induced by PKC inhibition, as inhibition of Ras activity with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor can inhibit apoptosis. 3J. S. Liou and D. V. Faller, manuscript in preparation. To rule out the possibility that the inhibition of apoptosis by hypoxic culture conditions, sodium butyrate treatment, or trichostatin A treatment were due to effects on Ras activity, Ras activity was analyzed by affinity binding to a Raf Ras-binding domain (RBD) peptide that only binds the activated (GTP-bound) form of Ras. Stimulation of serum-starved NIH/3T3 cells with PDGF (30 ng/ml) resulted in an increase in Ras activity as measured by the Raf-RBD-GST pulldown assay (Fig. 8 b1). NIH/3T3-Ras cells constitutively expressed a relatively high level of activated Ras, and culturing NIH/3T3-Ras cells under hypoxic conditions, or treatment with either sodium butyrate or TsA, had no inhibitory effect on the levels of Ras activity (Fig. 8 b2).Figure 8Sodium butyrate and trichostatin A inhibit cell cycle progression but do not affect Ras activity or intracellular ROS levels. a, NIH/3T3-Ras cells were treated with 5 mm isobutyramide, 5 mm sodium butyrate, or TsA (100 ng/ml) for 24 h before staining with propidium iodide and cell cycle analysis by FACS.

Top1 is a monomeric protein that relaxes supercoiled DNA by creating a transient single-strand nick, with this nick involving the covalent attachment of Top1 to the DNA phosphate backbone via a phosphotyrosine bond. Recent structural studies of Top1 and the Top1-DNA covalent complex led to molecular models of the mechanism by which camptothecins inhibit the catalytic activity of Top1 (6Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 7Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J.

Nevertheless, formation of CPT-Top1-DNA ternary complexes is insufficient to explain the cytotoxic effects of CPT (9Goldwasser F. Bae I. Valenti M. Torres K. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2116-2121PubMed Google Scholar, 10Beidler D.R. Chang J.Y. Zhou B.S. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sorensen M. Sehested M. Christensen I.J. Larsen J.K. Jensen P.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Current models invoke interactions between ternary complexes and replication or transcriptional machinery as being important in conversion of ternary complexes to lethal forms of DNA damage (12Hsiang Y. Lihou M. Liu L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wu J. Liu L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4181-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether physical interactions between Top1 and other proteins (including proteins involved in replication or transcription) are important in the cytotoxic effects of CPT. Recently, an interaction between Top1 and the SV40 T antigen helicase was shown to modulate formation of Top1-CPT-DNA ternary complexes, suggesting that similar interactions between Top1 and cellular helicases may mediate the cytotoxicity of CPT (14Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Wu C. Simmons D.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3818-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, Top1 rapidly redistributes from the nucleolus to the nucleus or cytoplasm and is degraded after cellular exposure to CPT (15Beidler D.R. Cheng Y. Mol.

These alterations may confer transient cellular resistance to CPT and could be mediated by interactions between Top1 and other proteins.

Sternglanz R. Yeast. 1999; 15: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although relatively little is known regarding either protein, a Tof2p paralog, Net1p, is required for the proper nucleolar localization of Sir2 and Cdc14 (33Straight A.F. Shou W. Dowd G.J. Turck C.W.

Since helicases may generate supercoiling problems that are resolved by topoisomerases, a need for physical interactions between these two enzyme classes is easily understood. Indeed, binding of Top1 by T antigen is one of several examples of a physical interaction between a helicase and a topoisomerase (35Duguet M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical relevance of interactions between Top1 and other proteins is less clear. With regard to the nucleolin-Top1 interaction, there are three major domains in nucleolin: an acidic N terminus that contains multiple putative phosphorylation sites, a middle region containing four RNA-binding domains (RBDs), and a C-terminal glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domain. In addition to binding RNA and DNA (36Bugler B. Bourbon H. Lapeyre B. Wallace M.O. Chang J.H. Amalric F. Olson M.O. J. Biol.

To gain insight into the cellular role of the nucleolin-Top1 interaction, we studied both a recombinant form of nucleolin and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleolin ortholog NSR1. We find that the N terminus of nucleolin is necessary and sufficient for Top1 binding. Moreover, our results indicate that NSR1 is involved in the cellular localization of yTop1p and that loss of NSR1 alters cellular sensitivity to topoisomerase-targeting drugs but not to DNA damaging agents in general. S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table I. MRG13 is a MATα derivative of MRG5 (50Tsalik E.L. Gartenberg M.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TE25 was generated by transformation of FW251 with plasmid pICS16, which is designed to replace a 0.35-kilobase region in the NSR1 coding sequence with the URA3 gene (51Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16252-16258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption ofNSR1 was confirmed by PCR using primers that flank the 5′ integration site (data not shown), as well as by immunoblotting using an Nsr1p antibody. An identical strategy was used to disruptNSR1 in strains MRG13 and JN284, yielding TE13 and TE284, respectively. Immunoblotting was used to confirm loss of Nsr1p in TE13 and TE284.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeSource or Ref.FY251MATa ura3–52 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ20052Winston F. Dollard C.

Saleem A. Edwards T.K. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as a template. PCR products were ligated into the pKG vector (54Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) using the SmaI and HindIII sites in this vector. The resulting plasmids were named according to the encoded nucleolin residues and include pKG-Nuc1–323, pKG-Nuc323–707, pKG-Nuc1–225, pKG-Nuc224–323, pKG-Nuc1–125, and pKG-Nuc125–225. Regions of these vectors corresponding to 5′-cloning sites were sequenced to confirm that the proper recombinants had been obtained. Plasmid pKG-Nsr1 expresses Nsr1p linked to the C terminus of GST and was constructed using SmaI/HindIII restriction sites and PCR with pYCB5 (51Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16252-16258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a source for the NSR1coding sequence. Plasmid pYX-GFP expresses GFP in yeast under the control of theGAL1–10 promoter and was constructed using PCR with the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) as a source for GFP coding sequence. The GFP PCR product was ligated into theBamHI and HindIII sites of the pYX133 vector (Ingenius Co., Oxford, United Kingdom). Similar strategies were used to generate pYX-GFP-yTop1 and pYX-GFP-Nop1, which express GFP-yTop1p and GFP-Nop1p fusion proteins, respectively. For the former vector, pYCpScTOP1 (provided by Mary-Ann Bjornsti) was used as template to obtain a PCR product containing the S. cerevisiae TOP1coding sequence. The HindIII and XhoI sites in pYX-GFP were used to place TOP1 downstream from the GFP coding sequence in this vector. The same strategy and restriction sites were used to generate pYX-GFP-Nop1. The source of NOP1coding sequence was S. cerevisiae genomic DNA from strain W303-1A (55Cheng T.H. Li Y.C. Gartenberg M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of an appropriately migrating GFP fusion protein in cells transformed with the pYX-GFP-yTop1 or pYX-GFP-Nop1 vectors was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a GFP antibody (data not shown). Monoclonal antibodies were generously provided by the listed individuals for the following proteins: nucleolin, Ning-Hsing Yeh (56Fang S. Yeh N. Exp.

Dethlefsen L.A. Barley L.R. Zhou B. Cheng Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A polyclonal yTop1p antibody was obtained from Mary-Ann Bjornsti. Monoclonal GFP and actin antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively, and a polyclonal GST antibody was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Camptothecin lactone (CPT), methyl methane sulfonate, m-AMSA, and 1,10-phenanthroline were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions were prepared for CPT at 5 mg/ml in Me2SO, for m-AMSA at 10 mg/ml in Me2SO, and for phenanthroline at 100 mg/ml in ethanol. Bleomycin sulfate was obtained as a 3 units/ml stock from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Expression and purification of full-length nucleolin and nucleolin fragments using the pKG-Nuc plasmid and derivatives were performed as described previously (25Haluska P. Saleem A. Edwards T.K. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 0.35% Triton X-100 followed by extraction with 0.5 m NaCl as described (58Rubin E. Pantazis P. Bharti A. Toppmeyer D. Giovanella B. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2433-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pull-down assays using HeLa nuclear extracts and 10 μl of glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) loaded with approximately 4 μg of purified GST, GST-nucleolin, or GST-nucleolin deletion fragments were performed in 1 ml of binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) with approximately 20 μg of nuclear extract. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with binding buffer. Proteins remaining bound to the beads were examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using Top1 and GST antibodies. For pull-down assays using yeast extracts, cells were grown at 30 °C in appropriate media to an A 600 of 0.7–0.9, then pelleted and resuspended in 3 volumes of ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) with freshly added protease inhibitors (1 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The suspension was vortexed with acid-washed glass beads for 10 min at 4 °C and the resultant lysate cleared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and cleared of remaining precipitate by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, followed by incubation with 20 μl of glutathione beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads twice with 1 ml of RIPA buffer, bound proteins were analyzed by boiling the beads in loading dye, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Yeast transformed with pYX-GFP, pYX-GFP-yTop1, or pYX-GFP-Nop1 were first grown to anA 600 of 0.8 in media containing 2% raffinose but lacking tryptophan. Expression of GFP fusion proteins was induced by the addition of galactose to a 2% concentration, followed by an additional 2-h incubation. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining was performed by washing and resuspending cells in water, followed by addition of DAPI to a 0.1 μg/ml concentration. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed once with 50% ethanol and once with water, then resuspended in water. Cells were co-imaged by phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy using a Ziess Axioskop fluorescent microscope equipped with a DC-330T, high resolution CCD camera (Dage MTI, Michigan City, IN). Concurrent GFP and DAPI fluorescence imaging was accomplished using Endow GFP bandpass emission (excitation and emission wavelengths of 430–510 and 475–575 nm, respectively) and DAPI (excitation and emission wavelengths of 320–400 and 410–450 nm, respectively) filter sets (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). Images were captured digitally using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and cropped using Adobe Photoshop. Yeast whole cell lysates were prepared as described above for pull-down assays. For fractionation of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, yeast cell pellets were resuspended in spheroplast buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 m sorbitol) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then incubated with spheroplast buffer with 2 mg/ml Zymolase 100T (Seikagaku, Tokyo) for 40 min at 37 °C. The resulting spheroplasts were lysed in the following buffer: 18% Ficoll-400, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin. The lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g to pellet unlysed cells and spheroplasts. Nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing cytoplasmic lysate, was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, then concentrated using a Centricon 30 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Nuclei were lysed by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading dye. For growth rate assays, yeast were grown overnight in YPD medium in a shaking 30 °C water bath to stationary phase. After dilution in fresh media to an A 600 of approximately 0.03, subsequent growth at 30 °C was monitored by removal of aliquots and measurement of A 600. If A 600measurements were greater than 0.8, the aliquots were diluted in media 2-fold to ensure that the A 600 value remained linear with respect to cell number, with the linear range established by independent experiments. Least squares regression analysis was used to quantify the slopes of the exponential phase of growth for each strain, ascertained by plotting log10 A 600 as a function of time. Differences in slopes among the strains were examined using a two-sample t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. For drug sensitivity assays, cells were grown overnight and adjusted to an A 600 of 2.0 using fresh YPD media. Aliquots of 4 μl obtained from serial 10-fold dilutions were spotted onto YPD plates containing various drug concentrations, with the plates then incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Plates containing CPT were prepared with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.125% Me2SO as described previously (59Reid R.J.D. Kauh E.A. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12091-12099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In other experiments, equal numbers of cells (ranging from 200 to 400) were dispersed on YPD plates containing either no drug or various concentrations of drug. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 days, colonies greater than 1 mm in diameter were counted. To identify regions of nucleolin involved in Top1 binding, we generated a recombinant protein consisting of nucleolin fused to the C terminus of GST. Since we were unable to express a fusion protein containing the full-length nucleolin protein in bacteria, we used a galactose-inducible yeast expression system (54Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The GST-nucleolin fusion protein was purified from yeast extracts using glutathione affinity chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Purified preparations of GST-nucleolin contained a predominant M r 126 band, which is the expected migration of a GST-nucleolin fusion protein (Fig.1 A). ThisM r 126 protein was recognized by both nucleolin and GST antibodies (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). To determine whether the recombinant nucleolin binds Top1, beads loaded with either purified GST-nucleolin or GST alone were incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extracts in a phosphate-buffered saline-based buffer. Beads containing GST-nucleolin, but not GST alone, bound Top1 in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 C). Taken together with our previous results using purified mammalian nucleolin (23Bharti A.K. Olson M.O.J. Kufe D.W. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), these data indicate that both purified and recombinant nucleolin bind Top1 in vitro. Next, we investigated Top1 binding by a series of nucleolin deletion fragments. We expressed and purified nucleolin fragments containing the acidic N-terminal region () or portions thereof (,), or the remainder of the protein, consisting of the four RBD motifs and the GAR C-terminal domain (323–707; Fig.2 A). In each case, the purified preparation contained a band of the expected mobility that was reactive with a GST antibody (Fig. 2). In some preparations lower molecular weight bands that were reactive with the GST antibody were also detected and presumably represent degradation products (Fig. 2,A and B). In pull-down assays using HeLa nuclear extracts and GST-nucleolin fragments, an N-terminal nucleolin fragment containing residues 1–225 was identified as being necessary and sufficient for binding of Top1 (Fig. 2 B). Immunoblotting with a GST antibody indicated that these results could not be explained by the presence of different quantities of GST-nucleolin fragments (Fig. 2 B). Additional experiments indicated that two discrete fragments within the nucleolin N-terminal region, 1–125 and 125–225, were both capable of binding Top1, although more Top1 was bound by the 125–225 fragment than by the 1–125 fragment (Fig.2 C). Immunoblotting with a GST antibody indicated that this phenomenon was not due to the presence a greater quantity of the 125–225 fragment relative to the 1–125 fragment (Fig.2 C). Notably, the 125–225 nucleolin fragment has a predicted pI of 3.48, whereas the 1–125 fragment has a predicted pI of 9.45. In addition, the 224–323 fragment has a predicted pI of 3.70 and 38 sequential acidic residues (the longest uninterrupted acidic domain in the protein) and does not bind Top1. Therefore, although the acidic regions common to both the 1–125 and 125–225 nucleolin fragments may be involved in Top1-binding, global acidic charge is not sufficient to explain binding of nucleolin fragments to the relatively basic Top1 protein. The N terminus of nucleolin is implicated in NLS binding and nucleocytoplasmic transport (39Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 40Xue Z. Shan X. Lapeyre B. Melese T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 13-21PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, nucleolin binds an NLS-containing region in Top1 that is required for the nuclear localization of Top1 (23Bharti A.K. Olson M.O.J. Kufe D.W. Rubin E.H. J. Biol.

Taken together with our finding that the N terminus of nucleolin is sufficient for Top1 binding, these data suggest that nucleolin might function in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of Top1. While a variety of strategies might be envisioned to test this hypothesis in mammalian cells, the facility of yeast in previous studies of Top1 prompted us to investigate this question usingS. cerevisiae (61Reid R.J. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). TheS. cerevisiae protein Nsr1p is similar to nucleolin in sequence and function (51Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16252-16258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 62Lee W.

To determine whether yTop1p physically interacts with Nsr1p, we initially attempted co-immunoprecipitations using yTop1p and Nsr1p antibodies, but were not able to precipitate either protein using its respective antibody. We therefore constructed a vector expressing a GST-Nsr1p fusion protein under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. In SDS-PAGE analyses of lysates from yeast that were induced to express GST-Nsr1p, an appropriately migrating protein was recognized by an Nsr1p antibody (data not shown). Subsequently, lysates from cells expressing GST alone or the GST-Nsr1p protein were incubated with glutathione beads, with bound proteins subjected to immunoblotting using GST and yTop1p antibodies. In cells expressing GST alone, only GST was precipitated by glutathione beads (Fig. 3 C). By contrast, in cells expressing GST-Nsr1p, both this protein and yTop1 were precipitated by the beads (Fig. 3 C). Taken together with the prior nucleolin-Top1 data (23Bharti A.K. Olson M.O.J.

Biochemical separation and systematic studies of the individual Glut4-containing compartments have been limited by the lack of appropriate reagents. We have prepared a monoclonal antibody against a novel component protein of Glut4 vesicles and have identified this protein as cellugyrin, a ubiquitously expressed homologue of a major synaptic vesicle protein, synaptogyrin. By means of sucrose gradient centrifugation, immunoadsorption, and confocal microscopy, we have shown that virtually all cellugyrin is co-localized with Glut4 in the same vesicles. However, unlike Glut4, cellugyrin is not re-distributed to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation, and at least 40–50% of the total population of Glut4 vesicles do not contain this protein. We suggest that cellugyrin represents a specific marker of a functionally distinct population of Glut4 vesicles that permanently maintains its intracellular localization and is not recruited to the plasma membrane by insulin.

Several lines of evidence suggest that Glut4 travels through different intracellular membrane compartments during its recycling to and from the cell surface. First, Slot et al.(7Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. James D.E. Lienhard G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7815-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) showed by immunoelectron microscopy that intracellular Glut4 resides in different types of membrane structure. Second, the results of the mathematical analysis of Glut4 traffic are inconsistent with the existence of only one intracellular pool of Glut4, suggesting that there may be two or more distinct intracellular Glut4-containing compartments (9Holman G.D. Leggio L.L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the analysis of targeting sequences in the Glut4 molecule lead to a three-pool model of Glut4 recycling (one plasma membrane pool and two intracellular pools) (10Verhey K.J. Yeh J.-I. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fourth, ablation of recycling endosomes with HRP1-conjugated transferrin resulted in only partial removal of Glut4 (11Livingstone C. James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that Glut4 is present in recycling endosomes as well as in an unidentified separate compartment. Finally, biochemical separation of two (13Hashiramoto M. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or even three (14Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37755-37762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) intracellular Glut4-containing compartments has recently been reported. The nature of these multiple compartments is not completely understood. One of them, however, has been identified as early/sorting endosomes (7Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E.

Mainly because of the lack of appropriate reagents, neither compartment has ever been purified and systematically studied, and therefore it is not clear what the biochemical difference between them may be. To identify proteins that reside in different populations of Glut4 vesicles and may thus be used as specific protein markers for individual Glut4-containing compartments, we prepared monoclonal antibodies against several peripheral membrane proteins of Glut4 vesicles. We selected a hybridoma producing a monoclonal antibody against p28, a protein that has previously not been detected in Glut4 vesicles. Using this antibody, we immunopurified this protein from intracellular microsomes and identified it as cellugyrin by proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry. This result was confirmed by expression of the cellugyrin cDNA (15Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in COS cells. Cellugyrin represents a ubiquitous homologue of synaptogyrin (16Stenius K. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a major constituent of synaptic vesicles that is involved in regulation of exocytosis in PC12 cells (17Sugita S. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18893-18901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In rat adipocytes, at least 90% of cellugyrin is localized in Glut4-containing vesicles, whereas only 50–60% of Glut4 vesicles contain this protein. Unlike Glut4, cellugyrin is not redistributed to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation. These data strongly indicate that intracellular Glut4-containing vesicles are not homogenous but represent a mixture of at least two individual populations: cellugyrin-negative vesicles, which are recruited to the cell surface in response to insulin stimulation; and cellugyrin-positive vesicles, which are not translocated by insulin. Interestingly, cellugyrin-positive vesicles are enriched with SCAMPs and VAMP2 and practically lack VAMP3/cellubrevin. In the present study, we used monoclonal anti-Glut4 antibody 1F8 (18James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) for Western blotting and anti-Glut4 rabbit serum (19Baldini G. Hohman R. Charron M. Lodish H.F.

Rabbit anti-serum against sortilin was prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc., Hopkinton, MA using the peptide ac-CFGQSKLYRSEDYGKNFKD-amide (amino acids 17–34) as antigen. Monoclonal antibody against SCAMPs was described earlier (20Thoidis G. Kotliar N. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11691-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibody was fromZymed Laboratories Inc., monoclonal anti-VAMP2 antibody was from Synaptic Systems. The rat cellugyrin cDNA in the pCMV5 expression vector was a kind gift of Dr. Thomas Südhof, Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, TX. Glut4-containing vesicles were immunoisolated from rat adipocytes on acrylic immunobeads as described below and used for intraperitoneal injection of BALB/c mice according to the protocol described by Thoidis et al. (20Thoidis G. Kotliar N. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11691-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but without adjuvant. Mice were injected with the same amount of material (vesicles isolated from 0.5 mg of light microsomes (LM) on 0.2 ml of 1F8-beads) 4 times with 3-week intervals. The fusion of spleenocytes with SP2/0 mouse myeloma cells (2 spleen cells/1 myeloma cell) was performed 4 days after the final boost. The supernatants from resulting hybridomas were screened in a Mini-PROTEAN II multiscreen apparatus (Bio-Rad) by Western blotting using sucrose gradient-enriched (see below) and/or immunoisolated Glut4-containing vesicles. A positive hybridoma selected for this study was cloned by limiting dilution. Hybridoma culture supernatant was isotyped with the help of the Sigma ImmunoType kit (ISO-1), and the anti-p28 antibody was classified as IgG2a. This antibody was purified from the tissue culture supernatant on immobilized protein A with the help of ImmunoPure (A) IgG Purification Kit (Pierce). In parallel, nonspecific mouse IgG were purified from mouse serum (Sigma). The purity of the isolated immunoglobulins was confirmed by SDS-electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. The rat cellugyrin cDNA was transfected into COS cells (4 μg of cDNA/100-mm dish) using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (5 ml) was added 3–5 h after transfection; 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was substituted the next day. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed with 1 ml of extraction buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) for 10–15 min on ice, and microfuged for 5 min. The supernatant was analyzed by Western blot. A microsomal membrane fraction was isolated from rat liver according to Fleischer and Kervina (21Fleischer S. Kervina M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The microsomal pellet (40 mg) was solubilized in PBS with protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100 for 4 h at 4 °C, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, and pre-cleared with nonspecific IgG coupled to acrylic beads. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of anti-p28 immunobeads in a total volume of 10 ml overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. Immunobeads were then transferred to the column and washed with 15 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Elution was carried out with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5; three 3-ml fractions were collected. Eluted proteins were precipitated with three volumes of cold ethanol overnight at −20 °C, pelleted at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, solubilized in 200 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and separated by SDS-electrophoresis. The gel was stained with freshly prepared Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Three distinct protein bands were detected in the 25–30-kDa area. All of these bands were cut out from the gel along with a similar slice of the nonstained gel used for background setting. Each gel slice was split into two non-equal parts. The major part (about two-thirds of each slice) was washed with 50% acetonitrile (HPLC grade, Fisher) and stored at −70 °C. The smaller part of each gel slice was washed several times with deionized water, chopped, and extracted with Laemmli sample buffer overnight at room temperature, and the extracted material was electrophoresed. The gel slice that contained p28 was identified by Western blotting and submitted for sequence analysis to the Harvard Microchem laboratory. The presence of cellugyrin was determined in this material by Dr. W. Lane and associates by proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry. Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g) by collagenase digestion and transferred to KRP buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, 2.5 mmd-glucose, 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Insulin was administered to cells (where indicated) to a final concentration of 10 nm for 15 min, after which KCN was added to cells to a final concentration 2 mm for 5 min, and cells were washed 3–4 times with HES buffer cooled to 14–16 °C (20 mmHEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4), homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon pestle, and subcellular fractions prepared as described previously (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Rat tissues were excised and immediately homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer at 13,500 rpm in HES buffer on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 × g and the pellet discarded. The resulting supernatant was analyzed by SDS-electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-cellugyrin antibodies. Light and heavy microsomes (LM and HM) from rat adipocytes, suspended in PBS (150–200 μl) with protease inhibitors, were loaded on 4.6-ml 10–30% continuous sucrose gradients (in PBS) and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-50.1 rotor for 55 min at 4 °C. Membranes from the gradients were collected into 23–30 fractions starting from the bottom of the tubes. The protein concentration and refractive index were measured in aliquots. The position of Glut4- and cellugyrin-containing vesicles was determined by Western blotting of the gradient fractions. All high speed centrifugations were performed in a Sorvall Discovery 90 ultracentrifuge. Protein A-purified 1F8 antibody, anti-cellugyrin antibody, and nonspecific mouse IgG were each coupled to acrylic beads (Reacti-gel GF 2000, Pierce) at a concentration of 0.90, 2.0, and 0.91 mg/ml of antibody/ml of resin, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before usage, the beads were saturated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for at least 1 h and washed with PBS. LM from rat adipocytes were incubated separately with each of the specific and nonspecific antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times with PBS, and the adsorbed material was subsequently eluted with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and Laemmli sample buffer without reductants in order to avoid dissociation of the coupled antibodies. Isolated rat adipocytes were fixed and stained according to Malide et al. (24Malide D. Dwyer N.K. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Cushman S.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and blocked with blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were stained with anti-cellugyrin antibodies (10 μg/ml) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:200) and then with polyclonal anti-Glut4 rabbit serum (1:1000) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100). All dilutions of antibodies were done with the blocking solution. Each incubation with primary or secondary antibody lasted 1 h at room temperature. SlowFade-Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) was used for mounting cells on slides. Staining was examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), but without reducing agents, and were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were visualized with specific antibodies, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Autoradiograms were quantitated in a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Protein content was determined with the BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glut4 vesicles were immunoadsorbed from intracellular light microsomes, or LM (1 mg) with 0.2 ml of 1F8-beads as described previously (25Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hybridoma-producing anti-p28 antibody was selected and cloned. This antibody was purified from the tissue culture supernatant on immobilized protein A, coupled to acrylic beads, and used for immunoisolation of p28 from rat liver microsomes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of cellugyrin in the isolated material was determined by Dr. W. Lane and associates by proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry. To confirm this result, we expressed the rat cellugyrin cDNA (a kind gift of Dr. T. Südhof) in COS-7 cells, which have virtually no endogenous cellugyrin (15Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fig. 1demonstrates that our anti-p28 monoclonal antibody recognizes the recombinant protein, which strongly suggests that p28 is indeed cellugyrin. We also analyzed the expression of p28 in different rat tissues using our antibody. We found that this protein is present in every tissue studied with the exception of brain, which completely matches the tissue expression pattern of cellugyrin (15Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Kedra D. Pan H.-Q. Seroussi E. Fransson I. Guilbaud C. Collins J.E. Dunham I. Blennow E. Roe B.A. Piehl F. Dumanski J.P. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and confirms that p28 represents a ubiquitously expressed analogue of the brain-specific protein synaptogyrin (data not shown). To study the intracellular localization of cellugyrin in rat adipocytes, we fractionated these cells according to Simpson et al. (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and determined, by Western blotting, the cellugyrin content in different subcellular fractions (Fig.2). In both basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes, cellugyrin is readily detectable only in LM and HM fractions (Fig. 2). Longer exposures of the film allow detection of this protein in the plasma membrane, where the specific content of cellugyrin is much lower than in intracellular HM and LM (not shown), which may be explained by cross-contamination between the fractions. In these experiments, we did not detect any significant redistribution of cellugyrin between subcellular fractions in response to insulin stimulation. The apparent absence of cellugyrin in the plasma membrane may have two explanations. First, cellugyrin may be a truly intracellular protein that is not recruited to the plasma membrane even in the presence of insulin. Second, cellugyrin may rapidly recycle between the plasma membrane and its intracellular compartment but with an internalization rate so high that cellugyrin is not accumulated at the plasma membrane in any detectable quantities. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we blocked clathrin-mediated endocytosis in adipocytes by sucrose as described previously by Hansen et al. (32Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. vanDeurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, incubation of cells at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.45 m sucrose leads to the accumulation of recycling proteins, such as the transferrin receptor and Glut4, in the plasma membrane. However, only traces of cellugyrin can be detected in this fraction under all experimental conditions. A similar result was obtained upon inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by potassium depletion (32Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. vanDeurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) (results not shown); this suggests that cellugyrin is localized mainly in intracellular membranes both in the absence and presence of insulin. To further explore the intracellular localization of cellugyrin, we carried out sucrose gradient centrifugation of LM and HM fractions (Fig. 4). We found that cellugyrin is present in rather homogenous vesicles, which are very well separated from the total microsomal protein (not shown) and demonstrate a high degree of overlap with Glut4-containing vesicles in both insulin-treated and nontreated cells. The aim of the following experiments was to confirm co-localization of cellugyrin with Glut4 by immunoadsorption. As seen in Fig.5, anti-Glut4 antibody 1F8 can efficiently immunoadsorb cellugyrin from the LM (and also HM, not shown) fraction. As expected, cellugyrin can be eluted from 1F8-beads with Triton X-100, whereas Glut4 is resistant to Triton elution and can be removed from the beads only with SDS-containing sample buffer. We estimated by densitometry of autoradiograms that at least 90% of the total p28 in LM is localized in Glut4 vesicles. For example, when 50 μg of LM were taken for 50 μl of 1F8-beads (Fig. 5, lane 1), we were able to immunoadsorb 91% of the total Glut4 and 85% of total cellugyrin. When we increased the amount of LM for the same volume of beads (lanes 2 and 3), their binding capacity was exceeded, and some Glut4 vesicles did not bind to the beads. Under all conditions, however, we immunoadsorbed identical fractions of Glut4 and cellugyrin. However, when we carried out immunoadsorption with anti-cellugyrin immunobeads, we were able to bring down only about 50–60% of Glut4-containing membranes (Fig.6). We suggest, therefore, that cellugyrin is present only in a sub-population of Glut4-containing vesicles.Figure 6Anti-cellugyrin antibody immunoadsorbs only a fraction of Glut4 vesicles. LM (100 μg) in 0.5 ml of PBS with protease inhibitors were immunoadsorbed with anti-cellugyrin (α-cg) immunobeads (100 μl). The beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of PBS and eluted with 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then with 200 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. A representative result of three independent experiments is presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This result was confirmed by double-immunofluorescent staining of Glut4 and cellugyrin in rat adipocytes. With the help of confocal microscopy (Fig. 7), we show that a high degree of co-localization exists between cellugyrin and Glut4 in these cells. It is seen in Fig. 7, however, that although virtually all cellugyrin is co-localized with Glut4, a significant fraction of Glut4-containing membranes (about 40–50%) does not contain cellugyrin, which is consistent with the results of the immunoadsorption experiments. Interestingly, the middle section of Fig. 7 shows that Glut4-positive cellugyrin-negative vesicles are located closer to the cell surface than vesicles that contain both proteins. This observation may support indirectly the results of the subcellular fractionation (Figs. 2 and3), which shows virtually no redistribution of cellugyrin to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. We have found that all major recycling proteins previously found in Glut4 vesicles, such as IRAP, sortilin, receptors for transferrin, and IGFII/man 6-P are present in cellugyrin-containing vesicles (Fig.8). Unexpectedly, it turned out that cellugyrin-positive vesicles are enriched in SCAMPs and VAMP2 but do not have (or have only traces of) VAMP3 (cellubrevin). In agreement with these data, VAMP3 is translocated to the cell surface in response to insulin to a greater extent than SCAMPs and VAMP2 (Fig.9; see also Refs. 33Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11691-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the earlier observation that VAMP2 and VAMP3 are localized in different vesicular populations (33Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and may or may not indicate that in rat adipocytes, VAMP3 rather than VAMP2 plays the role of the v-SNARE in the process of Glut4 vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Other studies performed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (12Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J.

Peng X.-R. Coppola T. Regazzi R. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2403-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggest, however, that VAMP2 is the v-SNARE in Glut4 vesicles. We believe that more experiments are required to determine the functions of VAMP isoforms in individual populations of Glut4 vesicles.Figure 9Insulin-dependent protein translocation in rat adipocytes. The figure demonstrates Western blot of subcellular fractions (50 μg) prepared from insulin-treated and untreated adipocytes. All proteins were visualized by consecutive staining with either the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (VAMP2) or HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Glut4, cellugyrin, SCAMPs, and VAMP3). A representative result of three independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have developed a monoclonal antibody against a previously unknown protein in Glut4 vesicles and have identified this protein as cellugyrin, a homologue of a major synaptic vesicle protein, synaptogyrin. Synaptogyrin, a four-transmembrane protein, is distantly related to synaptophysin (16Stenius K. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and represents one of the most abundant proteins in synaptic vesicles. Its biological functions are not exactly clear. In a recent report, exogenously expressed synaptogyrin was shown to potently and specifically inhibit Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells (17Sugita S. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18893-18901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Knock-out experiments, however, have not revealed major biochemical changes in neurotransmitter release but have shown severely reduced short term and long term synaptic plasticity (36Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Hammer R.E. Unni V. Siegelbaum S.A. Bolshakov V.Y. Neuron. 1999; 24: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In fat cells (and also in skeletal and cardiomyocytes; not shown), virtually all cellugyrin is co-localized with Glut4. However, about 40–50% of Glut4 vesicles do not contain cellugyrin. Moreover, we have not detected any significant redistribution of cellugyrin to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation; this suggests that cellugyrin may, in fact, be present only in a distinct population of Glut4 vesicles with unique and specific properties. The possibility should be acknowledged that some Glut4 vesicles lack cellugyrin simply because its level of expression is low, so that not all Glut4 vesicles may have a copy of this protein. For the following reasons, however, we believe that cellugyrin-positive vesicles represent a distinct and independent compartment in adipose cells. First, their functional properties are different, because these vesicles are not translocated to the plasma membrane (Figs. 2 and 3). Second, cellugyrin-positive vesicles have unique and specific protein composition. We have shown that in addition to cellugyrin, these vesicles compartmentalize a significant fraction of Glut4-associated SCAMPs and VAMP2 and have no (or only traces of) VAMP3 (Fig. 8). The majority of previously obtained results are consistent with the hypothesis that the total pool of intracellular Glut4 is distributed between early/sorting endosomes and putative post-endosomal vesicles that are recruited to the cell surface in response to insulin (see the Introduction). Based on our data, it seems logical to propose that cellugyrin may be localized specifically in the former compartment. Because Glut4 constantly recycles to and from the cell surface both in the absence and in the presence of insulin (37Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vanucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its transition through the endosomal compartment should be accelerated by insulin. This, by the way, may be illustrated by Fig. 8, which shows that the amount of recycling proteins, such as the IGFII/man 6-P receptor, the transferrin receptor, IRAP, sortilin, and Glut4 itself, is significantly decreased in cellugyrin-positive vesicles after insulin administration. We believe, therefore, that the Glut4-containing endosomal compartment, although not translocatable directly to the plasma membrane, may still respond to insulin stimulation in as yet unknown fashion. It was also suggested that intracellular Glut4 may be present not only in the endosomal compartments but in the trans-Golgi network as well (3Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Others, however, have not detected trans-Golgi network markers in Glut4 vesicles (40Martin S. Reaves B. Banting G. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 41Bogan J.S. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The possibility still remains that cellugyrin-positive vesicles may represent a fraction of the trans-Golgi network; we will try to determine the cell biological nature of the individual Glut4-containing compartments in the near future. we thank He-Jin Lee and Vera Kandror for help with several experiments; Dr. Galini Thoidis for helpful advice, discussions, and critical reading of the manuscript; and Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1986818677,"Systematic analysis of structural changes induced by activating mutations has been frequently utilized to study activation mechanisms of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the thyrotropin receptor and the lutropin receptor (LHR), a large number of naturally occurring mutations leading to constitutive receptor activation were identified. Saturating mutagenesis studies of a highly conserved Asp in the junction of the third intracellular loop and transmembrane domain 6 suggested a participation of this anionic residue in a salt bridge stabilizing the inactive receptor conformation. However, substitution of all conserved cationic residues at the cytoplasmic receptor surface did not support this hypothesis. Asp/Glu residues are a common motif at the N-terminal ends of α-helices terminating and stabilizing the helical structure (helix capping). Since Asp/Glu residues in the third intracellular loop/transmembrane domain 6 junction are not only preserved in glycoprotein hormone receptors but also in other GPCRs we speculated that this residue probably participates in an N-terminal helix-capping structure. Poly-Ala stretches are known to form and stabilize α-helices. Herein, we show that the function of the highly conserved Asp can be mimicked by poly-Ala substitutions in the LHR and thyrotropin receptor. CD and NMR studies of peptides derived from the juxtamembrane portion of the LHR confirmed the helix extension by the poly-Ala substitution and provided further evidence for an involvement of Asp in a helix-capping structure. Our data implicate that in addition to well established interhelical interactions the inactive conformation of GPCRs is also stabilized by specific intrahelical structures."

They fold as modular units and are capable of recognizing and binding to short linear peptide sequences containing a phosphorylated tyrosine residue. Here we show that each of the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase selects phage displayed peptide sequences containing the core (L/I)-A-(R/K)-I-R. The serine/threonine kinase A-Raf, containing the sequence LQRIRS, is associated with the p85 protein in both quiescent and growth factor stimulated cells. This suggests that p85 and A-Raf exist in a protein complex in cells and that complex formation does not require growth factor stimulation. We also show that p85 and A-Raf can bind directly to each other in vitro and that this interaction is mediated in part by the p85 SH2 domains. Further, the p85 SH2 domains require at least one of four distinct basic-X-basic sequence motifs within A-Raf for binding.

The p85 subunit contains a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain capable of binding to proline-rich sequences, a region homologous to the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene product, a p110 binding domain (110), and two SH2 domains. PI 3-kinase activity increases in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) binding to its receptor, in large part because the p85·p110 complex is relocalized from the cytosol to the lipids at the plasma membrane, by p85 SH2 domains binding directly to tyrosine phosphorylated sites on the receptor (4Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Hu P. Mondino A. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The SH2 domains of p85 recognize and bind to proteins such as the PDGF receptor at sites that contain a pY-X-X-M sequence (pY = phosphotyrosine, X = any amino acid, M = methionine) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The residues within the p85 SH2 domain responsible for binding this sequence include a critical arginine residue that coordinates twice with the phosphate group of the phosphotyrosine residue and a hydrophobic pocket involved in methionine binding (6Mayer B.J.

Over the past several years, there have also been reports of SH2 domains binding to proteins via a phosphotyrosine-independent mechanism. These reports include several phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-dependent interactions (9Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havilk M.H. Maru Y. Witte O.N.

Virology. 1998; 247: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, there have been a few reports that concluded that the SH2-mediated interaction was phosphotyrosine-independent but did not determine whether or not the interaction was instead dependent upon phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (15Park I. Chung J. Walsh C.T. Yun Y. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12338-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Raffel G.D. Parmar K. Rosenberg N. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1867-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In each instance, the precise amino acid residues involved in mediating these SH2 domain interactions both within the SH2 domain and on the SH2-bound ligand have yet to be identified. There are also two reports of SH2 domains that can bind to unphosphorylated forms of the preferred tyrosine-containing peptides, albeit more weakly than their phosphorylated counterparts (19Bibbins K.B. Boeuf H. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Li S.-C. Gish G. Yang D. Coffey A.J. Forman-kay J.D. Ernberg I. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1355-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of these low affinity interactions has yet to be demonstrated. In this report, we describe a unique SH2 domain interaction involving the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and the serine/threonine kinase A-Raf. This is the first description of an SH2 domain interaction that requires positively charged basic residues within the SH2 ligand (i.e. the A-Raf protein) to mediate binding to the p85 SH2 domains. Our results indicate that there are four distinct sites on the A-Raf protein, each of which is sufficient for p85 SH2 domain binding. Further, we also find that the p85 SH3 domain can bind A-Raf, suggesting that the p85·A-Raf complex is mediated by multiple domain interactions. We observe the presence of this p85·A-Raf complex in both quiescent and PDGF-stimulated cells, but do not find a complex between p85 and the more extensively characterized c-Raf kinase. These results suggest the possibility that p85 may act as an adapter protein for A-Raf, as it has been shown to do for the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (5Hu P. Mondino A. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A phage display library (21Scott J.K. Smith G.P.

Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Throughout the selection, TrpE-bait samples remained immobilized on the beads and were recovered by centrifugation. Repeated rounds of selection used a fresh sample of immobilized TrpE-SH2 fusion protein. In addition, a control experiment using immobilized TrpE protein (no SH2) was also performed in order to control for sequences binding to non-SH2 components, such as the TrpE protein, TrpE antibodies, and protein A-Sepharose beads. Phage clones were randomly isolated after three rounds of selection for each TrpE-bait sample. The DNAs in their display regions were sequenced using the T7 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a primer (5′-CCA GAC GTT AGT AAA TGA ATT TTC TGT AT-3′), which binds 45 nucleotides 3′ to the display region. Note that GST fusion proteins should not be used unless the GST portion is removed since we observed a strong selection for the sequence RRWTWS with the GST protein alone and with several GST fusion proteins, each of which was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitations, immunoblotting, and stripping methods have been described (25Anderson D.H. Ismail P.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2321-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were: preimmune (IgG purified from normal rabbit serum using a DEAE Affi-Gel blue column (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's directions), A-Raf from Transduction Laboratories, and c-Raf from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The p85 antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were either from Transduction Laboratories (Fig.1, A and B) or were rabbit p85 antibodies raised against residues 314–724 of bovine p85α (Fig. 1, C andD). These antibodies were affinity-purified using a CNBr-activated Sepharose column to which the protein antigen had been conjugated, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The p85 antibodies used for immunoblotting were from Upstate Biotechnology. HA antibodies were from Roche Diagnostics (12CA5) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Fig. 5). Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.Figure 5The p85 SH3 domain and a p85 protein lacking only the SH3 domain (ΔSH3) can still bind the HA-A-Raf mutants, including C/R/D/E, defective in its ability to bind to the p85 SH2 domains.

Subsequent steps to generate and express the histidine (His)-tagged A-Raf protein were all carried out precisely as detailed in the Invitrogen MaxBac 2.0 transfection and expression manual. Briefly, the resulting plasmid was cotransfected with Bac-N-Blue DNA (Invitrogen) into Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant virus from the medium was harvested, diluted, and used to infect fresh Sf9 cells. The infected Sf9 cells were overlaid with agarose containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside to visualize the recombinant plaques. Recombinant virus from individual blue plaques were isolated and amplified in Sf9 cells, and the viral DNA was isolated from a portion of the viral particles in the culture medium. A PCR analysis of the viral DNA allowed the identification of pure recombinant baculovirus that had undergone homologous recombination with our plasmid encoding His-A-Raf. To obtain purified His-A-Raf protein, Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5, and harvested 4 days after infection. Sf9 cell pellets (108 cells) were lysed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl by two freeze/thaw cycles. After removal of the cellular debris by centrifugation, the majority (∼80–90%) of the soluble protein was His-A-Raf (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). The sample was further purified on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column, and the His-A-Raf-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (25Anderson D.H. Ismail P.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2321-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). His-A-Raf fractions were dialyzed against water, lyophilized and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). The cDNA encoding full-length human A-Raf was amplified using PCR and cloned into aBglII-EcoRI-digested HA3 vector. This vector is a modified form of pACTAG2 (26Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.-H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that encodes three copies of a 9-amino acid repeat of the hemagglutinin (HA) tag prior to the multiple cloning site. The single EcoRI and BglII sites were removed from non-essential regions of this vector using separate digest and fill-in reactions. A pair of oligonucleotides (5′-AGC CGC AGA TCT AGA GTT AAC TCG AAT TCT GAG GGC C-3′ and 5′-CTC AGA ATT CGA GTT AAC TCT AGA TCT GC-3′) were then ligated intoNotI-ApaI-digested vector to alter the multiple cloning site such that it now lacked a NotI site but instead contained the following unique sites: BglII,XbaI, HpaI, EcoRI, andApaI. In vitro transcription of HA-A-Raf mRNA was carried out using linearized plasmid DNA as a template and the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's directions. The HA-A-Raf mRNA was translated into protein using Retic Lysate IVT™ kit (Ambion) following the manufacturers protocol. Mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's directions. For site E, all four basic residues (KKKVK) were changed to alanine (AAAVA). The integrity of both wild type and mutant clones were verified by DNA sequencing of the entire coding region. NIH 3T3 cells (American Tissue Type Collection) were maintained as described (25Anderson D.H. Ismail P.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2321-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For PDGF stimulations, NIH 3T3 cells that were 80% confluent were serum-starved in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 2 days. They were then either stimulated for 5 min with 50 ng/ml PDGF BB or left unstimulated (25Anderson D.H. Ismail P.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2321-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HA-A-Raf samples were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells (American Tissue Type Collection) using a LipofectAMINE delivery system (Canadian Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were lysed, and samples were normalized after densitometric scanning of immunoblots of cell lysates (25Anderson D.H. Ismail P.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2321-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) prior to their use in reconstitution experiments. GST-p85 fusion proteins were generated by PCR amplification of the indicated p85 regions, and were cloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amino acids of bovine p85α present in each fusion protein are: SH3 (1–83), BCR (), N-SH2 (), 110 (), C-SH2, (), p85 (), and ΔSH3 (). The sequence of each clone was verified by DNA sequencing. All inductions yielded proteins of the expected size as judged by Coomassie staining. Pull-down experiments were carried out as described previously (23McGlade C.J. Ellis C. Reedijk M. Anderson D. Reith A.D. Panayotou G. End P. Bernstein A. Kazlauskas A. Waterfield M.D. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 991-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using 10 μg of GST fusion protein. A lysate control lane was included in each experiment and contained 10% of the amount of lysate present in the pull-down mixture. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz) to ensure that comparable amounts of GST-p85 fusion proteins were present in each experiment (data not shown). We have taken a systematic approach to directly address the possibility that at least some SH2 domains may be able to bind to peptides/proteins in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner, and if so to identify the sequences responsible for mediating SH2 domain binding. Phosphotyrosine-dependent SH2 domain interactions have been described as high affinity interactions (4Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

By using a phage displayed hexapeptide library, propagated in bacteria known to be devoid of tyrosine kinases (31Wang J.Y. Baltimore D. J. Biol.

The phage were engineered to express a library of hexapeptide sequences on their surfaces as targets for SH2 domain binding, yet each phage contained only one hexapeptide sequence (21Scott J.K.

To confirm that the library contained a wide variety of hexapeptide sequences, 50 phage clones were randomly selected and the DNAs in their display regions were sequenced. The sequences obtained in this random sample of the library encoded a diverse assortment of hexapeptides (data not shown), and all were distinct from the sequences in TableI. The individual SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) of p21 ras and phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) were expressed as TrpE fusion proteins, collected using anti-TrpE antibodies, and immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (22Anderson D.

Each was then used as bait to select phage displayed hexapeptides from the library, which were capable of binding to the SH2 domain. In addition, a control experiment using immobilized TrpE protein (no SH2) was also performed in order to control for sequences binding to non-SH2 components, such as the TrpE protein, TrpE antibodies, and protein A-Sepharose beads.Table IDisplay sequences of phage selected by bait proteinBait protein 1-aTrpE fusion proteins immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads using anti-TrpE antibodies.Display sequence 1-bAmino acid sequence of the display region, as deduced from the DNA sequence.

Open table in a new tab After three rounds of selection, each SH2 domain tested did show a preference for particular phage displayed hexapeptide target sequences and these were distinct from the TrpE-selected sequences (Table I). The sequence GDYTLF was selected by each of the GTPase-activating protein and phospholipase Cγ1 SH2 bait proteins to differing degrees, while the strongest selection was demonstrated by the SH2 domains of p85, which preferentially bound phage displayed peptides with a core sequence of (L/I)-A-(R/K)-I-R. Note that there were no tyrosine residues in any of the p85 SH2 domain-selected hexapeptides. They did, however, contain conserved positively charged basic residues within the sequence motif basic-X-basic. Since the p85 SH2 domains demonstrated the strongest sequence selection, we searched the sequence data base with each of the p85 SH2 selected hexapeptide sequences in order to identify potential p85 SH2-binding proteins. One of the proteins identified in the search was the serine/threonine kinase A-Raf, which contains the sequence LQRIRS (matching 5/6 amino acids of LARIRS). To determine if p85 and A-Raf formed a complex in cells, a coimmunoprecipitation analysis was carried out. Both anti-p85 and anti-A-Raf immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of NIH 3T3 cells, which had been serum-starved and stimulated with PDGF, or left unstimulated. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the resulting Western blot was probed with anti-A-Raf antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized with chemiluminescence (Fig.1 A). The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti-p85 antibodies (Fig. 1 B). A-Raf protein was present in both anti-A-Raf and anti-p85 immunoprecipitates, but not in the preimmune control lanes (Fig.1 A). Similarly, p85 protein was observed in both anti-p85 and A-Raf immunoprecipitates, and not in preimmune control lanes (Fig.1 B). This suggests that A-Raf and p85 are constitutively associated in NIH 3T3 cells since the p85·A-Raf complex was observed both prior to and after PDGF stimulation. It is important to note that the p85·A-Raf complex was observed in untransfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing endogenous levels of these two proteins. To determine if the related Raf kinase family member c-Raf was also able to form complexes with p85, a similar coimmunoprecipitation analysis was carried out. Anti-p85 immunoprecipitates did not contain detectable quantities of c-Raf protein (Fig. 1 C), nor did the reciprocal anti-c-Raf immunoprecipitates contain p85 protein (Fig.1 D). These results show that p85 associates with A-Raf but not c-Raf, suggesting that the ability to bind to p85 is a unique feature of the A-Raf family member. We then went on to address whether the p85 and A-Raf proteins were binding directly to each other, since it was possible that other mammalian protein(s) could be mediating p85·A-Raf complex formation. The cDNA encoding the full-length A-Raf protein was cloned into a vector that encodes three copies of a nine amino acid repeat of the HA tag prior to the multiple cloning site. The HA-A-Raf protein was then synthesized using anin vitro transcription/translation system. Two products of similar size were generated (Fig.2 B), with the larger corresponding to HA-A-Raf. The smaller corresponds to A-Raf lacking the HA tag, likely as a result of initiation at the methionine residue at the beginning of the A-Raf sequence. Both full-length p85 and the p85 C-terminal SH2 domain (C-SH2) were expressed in a bacterial system as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2 A). These GST-p85 fusion proteins were collected on glutathione-Sepharose beads and tested in a pull-down assay for their ability to bind the in vitro synthesized HA-A-Raf protein. Bound A-Raf was detected using a Western blot analysis. Both full-length p85, as well as the individual p85 C-SH2 domain, but not the GST protein, were able to bind to in vitro synthesized A-Raf protein (Fig. 2 B). Further evidence in support of a direct interaction between p85 and A-Raf was provided using a similar pull-down assay with isolated GST-p85 fusion proteins and purified baculovirus expressed His-tagged A-Raf (His-A-Raf). His-A-Raf was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system and purified (Fig. 2 C,lanes 2 and 3). Immobilized GST fusion proteins containing full-length p85, the N-terminal SH2 (N-SH2), and the C-SH2, but not GST alone, were capab"
https://openalex.org/W2006756069,"The structural and antigenic properties of a peptide (“CRK”) derived from the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120 protein were studied using NMR and SPR techniques. The sequence of CRK corresponds to the central portion of the V3 loop containing the highly conserved “GPGR” residue sequence. Although the biological significance of this conserved sequence is unknown, the adoption of conserved secondary structure (type II β-turn) in this region has been proposed. The tendency of CRK (while free or conjugated to protein), to adopt such structure and the influence of such structure upon CRK antigenicity were investigated by NMR and SPR, respectively. Regardless of conjugation, CRK is conformationally averaged in solution but a weak tendency of the CRK “GPGR” residues to adopt a β-turn conformation was observed after conjugation. The influence of GPGR structure upon CRK antigenicity was investigated by measuring the affinities of two cognate antibodies: “5023A” and “5025A,” for CRK, protein-conjugated CRK and gp120 protein. Each antibody bound to all the antigens with nearly the same affinity. From these data, it appears that: (a) antibody binding most likely involves an induced fit of the peptide and (b) the gp120 V3 loop is probably conformationally heterogeneous. Since 5023A and 5025A are HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies, neutralization in these cases appears to be independent of adopted GPGR β-turn structure.

Although the V3 loop represents an important target for the development of vaccines against AIDS, its high sequence variability also makes it a very problematic one (6LaRosa G.J. Davide J.P. Weinhold K. Waterbury J.A. Profy A.T. Lewis J.A. Langlois A.J. Dreesman G.R. Boswell R.N. Shadduck P. Holley H. Karplus M. Bolognesi D.P. Matthews T.J. Emini E.A. Putney S.D. Science. 1990; 249: 932-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the occurrence of the highly conserved residue sequence, “GPGR,” at the tip of the V3 loop has raised the possibility that these residues make up a conserved secondary structural element in gp120. The function of such a structural element, if one exists, is presently unknown, however. The precise predicted secondary structure adopted by the GPGR residues is a type II β-turn (6LaRosa G.J. Davide J.P. Weinhold K. Waterbury J.A. Profy A.T. Lewis J.A. Langlois A.J. Dreesman G.R. Boswell R.N. Shadduck P. Holley H. Karplus M. Bolognesi D.P. Matthews T.J. Emini E.A. Putney S.D.

In order to determine whether the conserved GPGR sequence confers certain secondary structural tendencies upon this region of the V3 loop, numerous NMR studies were conducted upon a variety of V3 loop-derived peptides (8–21). These peptides were shown to have only low density populations of folded structure and to be conformationally averaged in solution. Despite the report of a “core” gp120 protein complex crystal structure, this complex was prepared using a form of gp120 which lacked most of the hypervariable loops including V3 (22Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2520) Google Scholar). Information regarding the actual three-dimensional structure of the V3 loop in native gp120 is therefore still unavailable. Due to the linear and flexible nature of V3 loop peptides in solution, a variety of methods have been employed to induce greater and presumably more “native” structure in previously studied V3 loop peptides. These methods included aminoisobutyric acid substitution (10Ghiara J.B. Ferguson D.C. Satterthwaite A.C. Dyson H.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol.

One particular method used previously to induce structure in short, linear peptides involves covalent attachment (or “conjugation”) of the peptide to BPTI protein.

We began NMR and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies of a PND peptide in order to investigate the structural propensities of this peptide (while free and conjugated to BPTI), and their potential importance to the binding of this peptide by HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. The PND peptide of interest, “RK,” has the following sequence: Arg1-Ile2-Gln3-Arg4-Gly5-Pro6-Gly7-Arg8-Ala9-Phe10-Val11-Thr12-Ile13-Gly14-Lys15.

Bacheler L. Clapham P. Jenoski A.M. Leece B. Matthews T.J. McKnight A. Pomerantz R. Rayner M. Weinhold K.J. AIDS Res. 1990; 6: 1115-1123Google Scholar). Since a cysteinylated peptide was needed for the protein conjugation study, the free and BPTI-conjugated form of an N-terminal cysteinylated form of RK (“CRK”) were actually studied and compared by NMR techniques. To determine the overall importance of folded CRK structure to its binding by its cognate antibodies, 5023A and 5025A, SPR techniques were used to measure the binding of these antibodies to various forms of the CRK antigen- free CRK peptide, BPTI-conjugated CRK peptide, and intact gp120. Based upon the NMR and SPR data presented in this study, the relationship between peptide antigenic structure versusantibody binding preference (for this PND peptide and these antibodies) is then discussed. A N-terminal cysteinylated form of peptide RK known as CRK, Cys−1-Arg1-Ile2-Gln3-Arg4-Gly5-Pro6-Gly7-Arg8-Ala9-Phe10-Val11-Thr12-Ile13-Gly14-Lys15, was synthesized and studied. The cysteine residue was required for conjugation of RK peptide to BPTI protein via a heterobifunctional chemical linker. This 16-residue peptide was synthesized using a Rainin Automated PS-3 Peptide Synthesizer and Fmoc chemistry. The crude peptide was purified using a Rainin HPXL HPLC System equipped with a Rainin Dynamax-300A reverse phase column with acetonitrile as the elution solvent. The peptide composition was verified by amino acid analysis and its molecular weight by FAB mass spectroscopy (Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego, California). The peptide sequence and its purity (>95%) were evaluated by two-dimensional NMR techniques. The modification of BPTI and its coupling to CRK peptide was accomplished according to the method developed by Ebina et al. (34Ebina S. Lerner R.A. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 264: 7882-7888Google Scholar) with modifications. BPTI was modified using OMIU and then covalently linked to the chemical linker, SPDP, before peptide coupling. The modification of BPTI proceeds by conversion of its lysine residues to homoarginines. As a result, the N-terminal amino group remains as the only free amino group available for SPDP coupling. The cysteinyl side chain of the peptide is covalently attached to this linker. The protein was modified usingo-methylisourea and then purified using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech LKB FPLC system and a Mono-S ion exchange column. A NaCl salt gradient in a 20 mm glycine, pH 10.5, buffer was used to purify the modified protein. The main protein fraction, which eluted at NaCl concentrations greater than 0.54 m, was collected. This fraction was then dialyzed extensively against deionized, distilled water and subsequently lyophilized. The molecular weight of the OMIU-modified BPTI (OMIU-BPTI) was determined via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy to be 6681 (versus 6513 for native BPTI), the expected mass for correctly modified BPTI. Amino acid analysis also conducted upon this protein further verified that conversion of the lysine side chains had been achieved. CRK peptide was then coupled via its terminal cysteine side chain to OMIU-BPTI using the cross-linker, SPDP. A disulfide bond between the peptide cysteine sulfhydryl group and linking reagent (shown in brackets below) is formed to produce the final protein-peptide conjugate: BPTI-NH-{CO-CH2-CH2-S}-S-Cys-RK Peptide. “BPTI-CRK” is the abbreviation used to denote CRK peptide conjugated to OMIU-BPTI. The conjugate was then purified using an FPLC and a Mono-S column. The conjugate was eluted using a 0–100% 1m NaCl gradient in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The conjugate eluted at ∼0.95 m NaCl with this gradient and the fraction collected at this salt concentration was then dialyzed against 0.1 m NaCl followed by de-ionized, distilled water via ultrafiltration and an Amicon YM-3 membrane. NMR samples of CRK peptide, OMIU-BPTI, and BPTI-CRK peptide conjugate were prepared in 90% H2O, 10% D2O solutions at pH 4.1 with typical sample volumes of 0.5 ml. The various sample concentrations were 5.7 mm(CRK), 6.0 mm (modified BPTI), and 5.9 mm (BPTI-CRK). The pH of all NMR samples (uncorrected for deuterium isotope effects) was adjusted to 4.1 using DCl and NaOD solutions and an Orion520A pH meter. All proton resonances were ultimately referenced against DSS. To maintain the uncoupled cysteinylated peptide in its reduced state, dithiothreitol-d 6 was added to these samples using a molar ratio of dithiothreitol:peptide = 50:1. A Bruker DMX 500MHz spectrometer was used to acquire the NMR data presented. Standard NMR experiments and pulse sequences such as DQF-COSY (35Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Ernst R.R.

The water resonance was suppressed via the use of low level rf pulses applied at the beginning of the pulse sequence (usually 1.5 s long) and during the mixing time of a NOESY sequence. The sweep widths used were 5000–8012 Hz. The number of points collected was 8192 or 4096 during t 2 and 512 or 1024 points duringt 1. For each t 1 point, 32 scans were acquired for all the NMR experiments. All NMR probe temperatures were calibrated using neat methanol (41Van Geet A.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 679-680Crossref Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed using Felix 2.30 (Biosym Technologies, Inc.) software run either on a Silicon Graphics INDIGO R4000 or a Sun SPARCstation5 computer. Typical processed two-dimensional data matrices were 4 K by either 1 or 2 K. A π/2 phase-shifted sinebell window function was applied during F1 and F2 processing. Prior to F1 transformation, the first interferogram was multiplied by 0.5 to suppress t 1 ridges (42Otting G. Wider H. Wagner G. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 66: 187-193Google Scholar). The intensities of NOESY cross-peaks were measured by calculating the volumes of the cross-peaks as the integral of all the data point intensities within the cross-peak footprints. For the NOE intensity measurement of free and coupled peptides, the relative intensities of these NOEs were calibrated against thed αN(i, i+1) NOE observed between the F10 Hα and V11 HN protons of each peptide. Antibodies 5023A and 5025A were cleaved using papain and purified following standard procedures (43Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 628-629Google Scholar). All buffers were degassed before use and most steps in the procedure were conducted under N2 gas. The enzyme and antibody solutions were mixed in a 1:100 papain:antibody ratio. The cleavage proceeded at 310 K for 12 h before the addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 40 mm. This mixture was then incubated at 298 K for 1 h. The Fab was then dialyzed against a phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, buffer using an Amicon and a YM30 membrane. The Fab fragment was purified with a FPLC system equipped with a Pharmacia 5-ml pre-packed protein A column using a pH 7.0 phosphate-buffered saline wash buffer and a 50 mm citrate, pH 3.0, elution buffer. Binding kinetics were determined by SPR using a BIAcore 1000TM biosensor system (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ) (44Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjolander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). The BPTI-peptide conjugate and gp120 (strain LAV, obtained from MicroGeneSys, Inc. via the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) were immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chips at concentrations of 5 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, for the conjugate and 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, for gp120 using the amine coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer. Approximately 150 resonance units of each conjugate and 2500 resonance units of gp120 were immobilized; one RU corresponds to an immobilized protein concentration of ∼1 pg/mm2 (45Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Coll. Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Unreacted moieties on the surface were blocked with ethanolamine. The N-terminal cysteine of CRK was used to immobilize the peptide onto research grade CM5 sensor chips using a thiol-exchange coupling procedure. The carboxylated dextran surfaces of the sensor chips were first activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Reactive disulfides were then introduced by reaction with 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine in 100 mm borate buffer, pH 8.5. The N-terminal cysteinylated peptide was then introduced at concentrations of 5 and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively, in 10 mmacetate buffer, pH 4.5. Finally, unreacted moieties on the surface were blocked with cysteine. All measurements of 5023A and 5025A Fab binding to the conjugate, gp120, and peptide surfaces were carried out in HEPES-buffered saline which contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA. Analyses were performed at 298 K and flow rates of 30–50 ml/min. All surfaces were regenerated with 100 mm H3PO4. Association and dissociation rate constants were calculated by numerical integration and global fitting to a 1:1 interaction model using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore, Inc.) and the equation: dRU(t)/dt =k a C(R max − RU(t)) − k dRU(t), where RU(t) is the response at time t,R max is the maximum response, C is the concentration of analyte in solution, k a is the association rate constant, k d is the dissociation rate constant, and RU (0) = 0. Proton chemical shift assignments for uncoupled and BPTI-coupled CRK peptide (TableI) were made on the basis of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY data obtained from these samples according to standard assignment procedures (46Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1986Crossref Google Scholar). The spin systems were established from DQF-COSY and TOCSY data, while sequential resonance assignments were determined from NOESY data collected on these samples. All resonance assignments reported here for the various peptide and BPTI forms were obtained at 298 K and pH 4.1.Table IFree and conjugated CRK 1 H chemical shift assignmentsResidueNHαHβHOthersC-Cys−14.393.27 & 3.18Cys−14.293.12C-Arg18.944.491.79γH 1.62 δH 3.20 NɛH 7.23Arg18.814.471.82γH 1.66 δH 3.22 NɛH 7.21 *NηH 6.69C-Ile28.384.171.81γH 1.50 & 1.22 γCH3 0.94 δCH3 0.86Ile28.384.221.84γH 1.51 & 1.22 γCH3 0.90 δCH3 0.87C-Gln38.574.402.05 & 1.96γH 2.33 NɛH 7.52 & 6.88Gln38.574.422.09 & 1.99γH 2.36 NɛH 7.54 & 6.88C-Arg48.514.411.82γH 1.63 δH 3.18 NɛH 7.19Arg48.494.431.88 & 1.78γH 1.67 δH 3.21 NɛH 7.21 *NηH 6.69C-Gly58.354.17 & 4.068.314.05 & 3.84Gly58.344.30 & 4.058.314.09 & 3.85C-Pro64.462.27γH 2.03 δH 3.644.632.39 & 2.17γH1.87 δH 3.60 & 3.53Pro64.482.30 & 2.00γH 2.06 & 2.01 δH 3.674.642.40γH1.97 & 1.89 δH 3.57C-Gly78.523.958.644.00Gly78.523.978.644.02C-Arg88.164.301.82 & 1.72γH 1.59 δH 3.17 NɛH 7.198.344.31Arg88.164.331.82 & 1.74γH 1.61 & 1.63 δH 3.20 & 3.218.344.331.85 & 1.72NɛH 7.18 *NηH 6.69C-Ala98.284.291.31Ala98.274.311.32C-Phe108.204.663.11 & 3.032,6H 7.22 3,5H 7.34 4H 7.28Phe108.194.673.15 & 3.032,6H 7.25 3,5H 7.37 4H 7.30C-Val118.084.192.03γH 0.90Val118.084.212.05γH 0.93C-Thr128.294.384.14γH 1.20Thr128.284.354.16γH 1.21C-Ile138.264.221.80γH 1.50 & 1.22 γCH3 0.87 δCH3 0.86Ile138.254.231.90γH 1.52 & 1.24 γCH3 0.96 δCH3 0.89C-Gly148.503.97Gly148.493.98C-Lys157.894.231.84γH 1.39 δH 1.68ɛH 3.00 NH3+ 7.53Lys157.874.231.86γH 1.41 δH 1.71 ɛH 3.02 NH3+ 7.54 εH 3.02 NH3+7.54The proton resonances (in ppm) of free and conjugated CRK were assigned at pH 4.1 and 298 K.

In the uncoupled and coupled CRK peptide spectra (Table I), a major, as well as minor, set of resonances was observed for residues Gly5 to Arg8. Based upon thed ααα(i,i+1) NOEs observed between the Hα protons of the minor form of Gly5 and Pro6 that were measured from D2O samples of free CRK and peptide (data not shown), the minor resonances were attributed to the cis form of these peptides arising from cis-trans isomerization about the Gly5-Pro6 peptide bond. The amount ofcis conformer present in both peptide forms was estimated to be close to 10%. Nearly complete proton resonance assignments for native, 2Upon request, we will provide the 1H NMR assignments for native, OMIU-modified, and peptide-conjugated BPTI. Peptide J-coupling, temperature coefficient, and ROESY data will also be given upon request. OMIU-modified, and peptide-conjugated BPTI were obtained in order to determine whether chemical modification and peptide coupling significantly affected BPTI. This was accomplished via comparison of the native BPTIversus OMIU-BPTI HN and Hα resonance frequencies. Very few resonance frequency changes were observed for most BPTI residues regardless of BPTI form and most of these were less than 0.02 ppm. The largest changes (observed after linkage of SPDP to OMIU-modified BPTI) consisted of large frequency shifts involving the following protein resonances: the HN and Hα of Ala58 and the Hα of R1. The OMIU-modified Ala58 backbone resonances underwent substantial frequency changes due to peptide coupling: the NH, Hα resonances shifted from 8.05 (4.05) to 7.81 (4.13 ppm) after coupling. A corresponding R1 Hα frequency shift from 4.36 ppm (OMIU-BPTI) to 4.58 ppm (BPTI-CRK) was also seen. Comparison of the modified versus peptide-conjugated BPTI R1 amide HN frequency was not possible since the R1 amino group is converted to an amide after peptide coupling. The uncoupled peptide gave rise to medium-strong dαN(i, i+1) NOEs involving residues Arg1 through Gly14 (Fig.1A). A weakd αN(i, i+1) NOE was also observed between Arg1 and Ile2. At the same time, a few medium to weakd NN(i, i+1) NOEs were detected between residues Gly7-Thr12. Other sequential NOEs observed included ad βN(i, i+1) NOE between Ala9 and Phe10. In addition, strongd αδ(i,i+1) NOEs between both Gly5 Hα protons and the Pro6 Hδ proton were measured. Intraresidued Nα(i, i) NOEs were observed for residues Gly5, Gly7, Val11, Thr12, and Gly14. This type of NOE was also observed for Arg8. The intraresidued Nα(i, i) NOEs of Arg4 and Ala9 were overlapped with sequentiald αN(i, i+1) NOEs between Gln3-Arg4 and Arg8-Ala9, respectively. As observed for the uncoupled peptide, most of the backbone protons of the coupled peptides gave rise to strongd αN(i, i+1) NOEs (Fig. 1 B). For coupled CRK peptide,d NN(i, i+1) NOEs were measured between sequential residues beginning with Ile2-Thr12 (except Gln3-Arg4 and Ala9-Phe10). The strongestd NN(i, i+1) NOEs involved residues Gly7-Ala9. Furthermore, a weak Pro6-Arg8dαN(i, i+2) NOE was observed (Fig. 2 A). For residue Pro6, strongd αδ(i,i+1) NOEs between Gly5 and Pro6 were observed. Additionally, a d Nδ(i,i+1) NOE between the Gly5 HN and Pro6 Hδ protons was observed for coupled CRK. Another weak, but significantd δN(i, i+1) NOE between the Pro6 Hδ and Gly7 HN protons was also detected (Fig. 2 B). Other sequential NOEs observed included d βN(i,i+1) NOEs between residues Ile2-Gln3, Ala9-Phe10, and Val11-Thr12. For the conjugated peptide, strong to medium intraresidued Nα(i+1) NOEs were measured, except for residue Phe10, for which a weak NOE of this type was measured instead. This type of NOE was not observed for Cys−1 and Arg1. Intraresidued Nα (i+1) NOEs of Arg4 and Ala9 were overlapped withd αN(i, i+1) NOEs of Gln3-Arg4 and Arg8-Ala9, respectively. The corresponding Ile13 NOE was overlapped with an intramolecular BPTI NOE. The β−turn NOEs observed for conjugated CRK were absent in the corresponding free peptide NOESY data, regardless of the mixing time (100–600 ms) used. To verify whether this discrepancy was a consequence of the peptide correlation time, free peptide ROESY data2 were also collected (data not shown). The overall pattern of peptide resonanc"

This differentiation program starts with the formation of spermatogonia from germ line stem cells followed by mitotic divisions to produce primary spermatocytes. Primary spermatocytes then undergo meiotic divisions to give rise to haploid spermatid cells followed by the final differentiation step, spermiogenesis, to produce motile spermatozoa. In Drosophila, the process of spermatogenesis has been extensively studied at the cellular level (1Cooper K.W. Demerec M. Normal spermatogenesis in Drosophila . In: Biology of Drosophila.

Furthermore, recent molecular biological studies have identified several genes that function in spermatogenesis, includingβ2-tubulin, twine,boule, degenerative spermatocyte-1(des-1), and fuzzy onions (fzo). The gene product of β2-tubulin is one of the major components of the germ cell-specific cytoskeleton and is essential for normal germ cell development (6Kemphues K.J. Kaufman T.C. Raff R.A. Raff E.C. Cell. 1982; 31: 655-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Other genes,twine, boule, and des-1, are known to be required for the meiotic division. The twine gene encodes a Drosophila homologue of cdc25, a cell-cycle phosphatase, which is essential for the onset of the first meiotic division (7Alphey L. Jimenez J. White-Cooper H. Dawson I. Nurse P. Glover D.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 56: 151-169Google Scholar, 8Courtot C. Fankhauser C. Simanis V. Lehner C.F. Development. 1992; 116: 405-416PubMed Google Scholar, 9White-Cooper H.

The boule gene encodes a predicted RNA-binding protein showing strong homology with the product of the human DAZ gene, a candidate for the Y-chromosome azoospermia factor (10Eberhart C.G. Maines J.Z. Wasserman S.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 783-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), whereas the des-1 gene product is a novel membrane protein required for the initiation of meiosis (11Endo K.

In contrast to the extensive studies of spermatogenesis at the gene level, the upstream regulatory factors for these genes, such as extracellular signaling molecules, have not been well characterized. Insect-derived growth factor (IDGF)1 is the first soluble invertebrate growth factor to be identified, being purified from the conditioned medium of an embryonic cell line of the flesh fly,Sarcophaga peregrina (13Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This factor had no significant sequence similarity with any other growth factors so far characterized, but did show homology with atrial gland granule-specific antigen (AGSA) of Aplysia californica (about 25% sequence identity), a secretory protein with unknown function (14Sossin W.S. Kreiner T. Brinaga M. Schilling J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16933-16940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe the identification of a novel Drosophila gene,Male-specific-IDGF (MSI), which is expressed exclusively in testis and encodes a protein termed MSI, which is assigned as a novel member of the IDGF family. Data suggest that MSI is an extracellular signaling molecule required for spermatogenesis. PCR was done using Drosophila melanogaster genomic DNA as a template. DNA primers were designed from amino acid sequences of Sarcophaga IDGF that showed relatively strong homology with Aplysia AGSA. The nucleotide sequences of the primers for the initial PCR were 5′-TA(T/C) ATI AGI AGI ATG CC(T/C/A/G) AA(A/G) GG-3′ and 5′-CCI GCI AC(A/G) TCI GG(A/G) TA(T/C) TT-3′, which correspond to the IDGF amino acid sequences of 127YISSMPKG134 and338KYPDFVAG345, respectively. The primers for the nested PCR were 5′-ATI CGI CTI ACI TA(T/C) (C/A)G(T/C/ A/G) GA(T/C) AA-3′ and 5′-ATI AG(T/C) TTI GAI CC(A/G/T) AT (A/G) AA(A/G) TC-3′, which correspond to 151IRLTYRDN158 and306DFIGSKLI313, respectively. The 620-bp DNA fragment of the nested PCR product was amplified. The sequence analysis showed that it encoded a peptide with 162 amino acid residues split by a 132-bp intron. Because this peptide showed significant sequence homology with part of IDGF, this 620-bp DNA fragment was used as a probe for subsequent cDNA cloning. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Takara, Kyoto). One hybridization-positive clone was isolated from 1.5 × 105 clones of a Drosophila adult cDNA library (Stratagene) by plaque hybridization, and its complete sequence was determined. Data base searches were done using the BLAST program (15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar). A hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity plot of MSI was generated using the GENETYX program (Software Development, Tokyo) with the parameters described by Kyte and Doolittle (16Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17095) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of MSI cDNA has been deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession number AB025255. Schneider's line 2 cells (17Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), streptomycin (0.5 mg/ml), and penicillin G (120 units/ml) at 27 °C. A plasmid that drives the expression of MSI was constructed by amplifying the DNA fragment of MSI cDNA (nucleotides 1 to 1686 in Fig. 1 A) by PCR and ligating the PCR product downstream of the Drosophila actin 5C promoter. The transfection of the plasmid to Schneider's line 2 cells was performed as described by Hisahara et al. (18Hisahara S. Kanuka H. Shoji S. Yoshikawa S. Okano H. Miura M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 667-673PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of about 3.5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate and cultured overnight. The medium was then changed to serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The constructed plasmid DNA (1 μg) and 4 μl of Cellfectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were mixed. The mixture was added to each well, and incubation was continued for 4 h. The medium was then changed to serum-containing Schneider's insect medium and cultured for a further 2 days. The expression of MSI was examined by immunodetection. About one-tenth of the cells was transfected reproducibly under these conditions.Figure 1MSI is a new member of IDGF family with a single transmembrane region.

Three booster injections were given before harvesting the antiserum. In this peptide, V to P corresponded to residues 119 (Val) to 144 (Pro) of MSI. The N-terminal Cys was added to couple this peptide to Sepharose in preparation for purification of the antibody by affinity column chromatography. Fractionation of the transfected Schneider's line 2 cells was performed as follows: cells were homogenized in 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 ng/ml pepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant and precipitate were used as the cytosolic fraction and membrane fraction, respectively. Immunoblotting was performed essentially as described by Burnette (19Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter, which was then treated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-MSI antibody solution followed by peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit donkey IgG diluted 1:5000. The filter was then treated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. Immunofluorescence staining of the transfected Schneider's line 2 cells under non-fixative conditions was carried out as described by Hori et al. (20Hori S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 236: 497-501Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in 10 ng/ml anti-MSI antibody solution and kept on ice for 1 h. They were then washed three times with PBS containing 10% (v/v) FBS, and suspended in FITC-labeled secondary antibody solution for 40 min. The cells were then washed, transferred to 12-well multitest slides, and examined with a fluorescence microscope. Immunofluorescence staining under fixative conditions was performed as described by Hisahara et al.(18Hisahara S. Kanuka H. Shoji S. Yoshikawa S. Okano H. Miura M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 667-673PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfected cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and blocked in 1% (w/v) skim milk, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Then the cells were successively treated with 10 ng/ml anti-MSI antibody and FITC-labeled secondary antibody (Dako Corp.). Then they were washed three times with PBS, mounted in 50% (v/v) glycerol containing 2.5% (v/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and their fluorescence was examined under a fluorescence microscope. For whole mount immunostaining of testes, testes from adult flies were fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, then followed with the protocol as described above. We used yw strain in immunofluorescence study because of its low level of natural fluorescence. Large scale preparation of transfected Schneider's line 2 cells for the measurement of the growth factor activity of MSI was achieved by using a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask. Assay of the growth factor activity was carried out as described before (13Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The transfected Schneider's line 2 cells were suspended in serum-containing Schneider's insect medium at a density of 107 cells/ml, and 100 μl of the cell suspension was poured into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. The cells were incubated for 1 day at 27 °C. Then, 10 μl of [methyl-3H]thymidine (3.7 MBq/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 925 GBq/mmol) was added and incubation was continued for 1 more day. The medium was discarded, and the cells were washed thoroughly and solubilized with 150 μl of 0.5 n NaOH solution, and 150 μl of ice-cold 60% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to the cell lysate. The acid-insoluble radioactive material was trapped on a glass fiber filter (Whatman, GF/C), and the radioactivity was measured (21Komano H. Homma K. Natori S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. The probability of statistical differences between experimental groups was determined by Student's t test, as indicated. Total RNA was extracted fromD. melanogaster at various developmental stages by the guanidine-thiocyanate method (22Chomcznski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg) was separated on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel containing formaldehyde, blotted onto GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10 × SSPE (1 × SSPE: 180 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Hybridization was performed in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSPE, 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% (w/v) each of Ficoll-400, bovine serum albumin, and polyvinylpyrrolidone), and 0.2 mg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA solution for 16 h at 42 °C. The radiolabeled probe was the same as for the cDNA cloning (620-bp DNA). The filter was subsequently hybridized with an 18 S rRNA probe to estimate the amount of RNA loaded. RT-PCR was carried out using an RT-PCR kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers used to detect MSI mRNA were 5′-GTT AAC TTG GAA CAG GAC TTC GAG-3′ and 5′-TTC GAT ACT GAA ACT AAG GCC TCC GCC-3′. As an internal control, the ribosomal protein 49 (rp49) mRNA (23O'Connell P. Rosbash M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5495-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) was detected using oligonucleotide primers (5′-GAT CGA TAT GCT AAG CTG TCG CAC-3′ and 5′-CTC CTT GCT TCT TGG AGG AGA CGC-3′). The resulting PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% (w/v) agarose gels, blotted onto GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and detected by hybridization with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. These probes were 5′-AGT CCT CAG CGG GCG GGA TGT GAG G-3′ for MSIand 5′-CAC AAA TGG CGC AAG GGT A-3′ for rp49, respectively. Whole mount in situ hybridization to squashed testes was performed essentially as described by Endoet al. (11Endo K. Akiyama T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Cell. 1996; 90: 121-129Google Scholar). Chromosomal location of the MSI was determined according to the Drosophila laboratory manual (24Ashburner M. Drosophila : A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). IDGF is a growth factor of Sarcophaga embryonic cells. To gain more insight into the biological role of IDGF, we intended to isolate cDNA ofDrosophila IDGF. For this, we first amplified a possible genomic fragment of the Drosophila IDGF gene using degenerate primers designed after the amino acid sequences conserved between IDGF and AGSA. Then, we screened the cDNA library of adultDrosophila using this DNA fragment as a probe and finally isolated one cDNA clone. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of this cDNA clone are shown in Fig.1 A. This clone contained one open reading frame of 561 amino acid residues. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of this protein with those in the data bases revealed that this protein has significant homology only with IDGF and AGSA, with overall amino acid identity between IDGF and this protein being 35%. We termed this protein Male-specific IDGF (MSI) for the reason presented below. Hydropathy analysis revealed that MSI contains a single hydrophobic region with 17 amino acid residues, which could potentially form a helical transmembrane domain (Fig. 1 B). No other structural motifs were identified in the predicted amino acid sequence of MSI. As shown in Fig. 1 C, MSI shows homology with IDGF and AGSA in its long C-terminal region following the predicted transmembrane domain, suggesting that the long C-terminal region is an extracellular domain and short N-terminal region is an intracellular domain. As IDGF and AGSA are thought to be humoral factors, the transmembrane structure of MSI is unique. Possibly, MSI is a membrane-bound extracellular signaling molecule and a novel member of the IDGF family rather than an IDGF homologue of Drosophila. Because MSI was suggested to be a transmembrane protein, we examined its cellular localization by transiently expressing it in Schneider's line 2 cells, which have no endogenous expression of MSI. For this, MSI cDNA was expressed in these cells under the control of the Drosophila actin 5C promoter, and the cells were subjected to immunodetection using a specific antibody raised against the peptide derived from MSI. Results from the immunoblotting experiment are shown in Fig.2 A. MSI was recovered exclusively in the membrane fraction, when the cells were fractionated into the membrane and cytosolic fractions, while co-expressed β-galactosidase, which is a cytosolic protein, was recovered in the cytosolic fraction. The culture medium did not contain an appreciable amount of MSI, indicating that it is not a secretory protein (data not shown). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of the transfected cells under non-fixative conditions revealed that this protein is localized on the cell surface (Fig. 2, B and C). When fixed cells were stained with the same antibody, patches were detected along the edges of the cells (Fig. 2, D andE). These results support the conclusion that MSI is a transmembrane protein with its C-terminal side forming an extracellular domain, because the epitope recognized by the antibody used here is located in this domain. We next examined whether MSI exhibits growth factor activity, like IDGF. For this, [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation ofMSI-transfected Schneider's line 2 cells was compared with that of the control cells. As shown in Fig.3, thymidine incorporation ofMSI-transfected cells was significantly higher than that of the mock transfected cells at a cell density of 107cells/ml (p < 0.01), where the cells were confluent. Almost the same results were obtained with medium containing 5% and 12% FBS when cell density was 107 cells/ml. In contrast, no appreciable enhancement of cell growth was detected at lower cell densities. Possibly, contact of membrane-bound MSI to adjacent cells may not be sufficient under these conditions. In addition, no growth factor activity was detected in the conditioned medium of the transfected cells (data not shown). These results suggest that MSI in fact exhibits growth factor activity through cell-to-cell interaction. The enhancement rate of 1.5- to 2-fold may be reasonable, considering the fact that the ratio of MSI-expressing cells is about 10% and that MSI is a transmembrane protein. To determine when and where MSI functions, we performed gene expression analyses. Northern blot analysis throughout the life cycle of Drosophila revealed that the MSI mRNA is expressed in pupae and adult males, in association with the development of adult organs (Fig.4). The signal detected in pupae is likely to be from males, because its expression in the adult is restricted to the male. These results suggest that the tissue synthesizing MSI is testis. Results of RT-PCR to test whether expression is testis-specific or not are shown in Fig.5. MSI mRNA was detected in the testes of adult males but not in the carcass after removal of the testes, indicating that MSI is expressed exclusively in testis.Figure 5MSI is exclusively expressed in adult male testes. RT-PCR was performed using total RNA extracted from whole bodies (1), testes (3), and carcass after removal of testes (2) of adult males. As an internal control, a fragment of the ribosomal protein 49 gene (rp49) transcript was amplified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the cells expressing this molecule, in situhybridization with testis squashes was performed. Fig.6 shows that the mature primary spermatocytes are the cells that express MSI mRNA (Fig.6 B, open arrowheads). However, the signal was absent in the apical tip of the testis, where the stem cells and spermatogonial cells are localized. Nor was the signal detected in the developing primary spermatocytes that are localized between spermatogonial cells and primary spermatocytes (Fig. 6 B,solid arrowheads). No such signals were detected with a sense probe (Fig. 6 C). Next, the distribution of MSI was examined by immunofluorescence staining. Testes were successively treated with antibody and FITC-conjugated second IgG. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting, where it gave a single band with testis homogenate (Fig. 7 A). In contrast to in situ hybridization result, fluorescence was detected in the regions where spermatocytes at much later developmental stages, including spermiogenesis, are present (Fig. 7 B). Because the large number of gene products needed for postmeiotic stages are thought to be supplied in the mature primary spermatocytes by premeiotic transcription (2Lindsley D.L. Tokuyasu K.T. Ashburner M. Wright T.R.F. Spermatogenesis. In: The Genetics and Biology of Drosophila. 2d. Academic Press, London1980: 225-294Google Scholar, 3Fuller M.T. Martinez-Arias A. Bate M. Spermatogenesis.

Res. 1965; 2: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), MSI is likely to be a protein that functions in meiosis or spermiogenesis. To examine the relation between MSI and other genes, we investigated the expression level of MSI mRNA in four meiotic arrest mutants,aly 6 , can 3 ,mia 1 , and sa 1 . Linet al. (27Lin T.-Y.

Development. 1998; 125: 125-134PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the transcription of the genes involved in spermiogenesis, such asfzo (12Hales K.G. Fuller M.T.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) are greatly reduced in all these four mutants, whereas that of the genes required for meiosis, such as twine (7Alphey L. Jimenez J. White-Cooper H. Dawson I. Nurse P. Glover D.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 56: 151-169Google Scholar, 8Courtot C. Fankhauser C. Simanis V. Lehner C.F. Development. 1992; 116: 405-416PubMed Google Scholar, 9White-Cooper H. Alphey L. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1035-1044PubMed Google Scholar) and boule (10Eberhart C.G. Maines J.Z. Wasserman S.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 783-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) are not affected in the aly 6 mutant. As shown in Fig.8, no appreciable transcript ofMSI was detected in any of the four mutants, indicating that the expression of MSI is under the control of each of these four genes. However, the gene expression in twine mutant was not reduced (data not shown). These results suggest that MSIis needed for spermiogenesis rather than for meiosis. We mapped the locus of MSI at 75A on the left arm of chromosome 3 by in situ hybridization to a polytene (data not shown), where few deficiency strains or mutants that could evaluate the function of MSI have been reported so far. We identified a new member of the IDGF family fromDrosophila. Although MSI is a membrane-bound protein, it is structurally related to secretory IDGF and AGSA, suggesting that these three proteins belong to a common structural family. Of these, IDGF was shown to be a growth factor of Sarcophaga embryonic cells. Possibly, IDGF interacts with a specific receptor on the surface of these cells and stimulates their growth. By contrast, MSI was suggested to be a transmembrane protein consisting of a 47-residue intracellular domain and a long C-terminal extracellular domain with a 17-residue transmembrane domain. By analogy with IDGF, MSI is likely to be a membrane-bound signaling molecule and possibly interacts with other cells with its extracellular domain. In fact, MSI expressed in Schneider's line 2 cells was shown to localize on the surface and exhibits growth factor activity when cells are kept in high density. These results suggest that Schneider's line 2 cells contain receptor(s) for MSI. Gene expression studies revealed that MSI is a testis-specific protein, and its mRNA was detected exclusively in mature primary spermatocytes ready to enter into meiosis. Because most transcription in spermatocytes is shut off upon entry into meiotic division in spermatogenesis of Drosophila, it is known that mRNAs for a large number of genes required for postmeiotic spermatid differentiation are synthesized by premeiotic transcription and deposited in mature primary spermatocytes (2Lindsley D.L. Tokuyasu K.T. Ashburner M. Wright T.R.F. Spermatogenesis. In: The Genetics and Biology of Drosophila. 2d. Academic Press, London1980: 225-294Google Scholar, 3Fuller M.T. Martinez-Arias A. Bate M. Spermatogenesis. In: The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 71-147Google Scholar, 25Gould-Somero M. Holland L. Wilhelm Roux' Arch. Dev. Biol. 1974; 174: 133-148Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Olivieri G. Olivieri A. Mutat. Res. 1965; 2: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In accordance with these previous reports, MSI was shown to be expressed in the spermatocytes at the later developmental stages, suggesting that MSI functions in postmeiotic differentiation. Although MSI exhibits growth factor activity to embryonic cells such as Schneider's line 2 cells, it might convey a signal in the testis, because the cells at those developmental stages are differentiating rather than proliferating. The evidence that MSI is not expressed in meiotic arrest mutants so far tested suggests that it is likely to be a spermiogenic gene, according to the proposal of White-Cooper et al. (28White-Cooper H. Schäfer M.A. Alphey L. Fuller M.T. Development. 1998; 125: 125-134PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the expression pattern of MSI. The facts that MSI is a testis-specific protein and its transcription is under the control of meiotic arrest genes suggest that MSI plays a role in spermiogenesis. In spermatogenesis of Drosophila, developing germ cells are surrounded by cyst cells, and differentiation of the germ cells progresses in this delimited space (30Hardy R.W. Tokuyasu K.T. Lindsley D.L. Garavito M. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1979; 69: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 3Fuller M.T. Martinez-Arias A. Bate M. Spermatogenesis. In: The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 71-147Google Scholar). Although the cyst cells are required for the differentiation of the germ cells, the germ cells are also known to regulate the fate of the cyst cells (31Gönczy P. DiNardo S. Development. 1996; 122: 2437-2447PubMed Google Scholar). This close association of the germ cells and cyst cells suggests the presence of signaling processes between these two cells. On the other hand, signaling processes could also be present between two germ cells. However, no molecules have been identified that mediate cell-to-cell interaction in spermatogenesis. Judging from its IDGF-like structure and in vitro activity, MSI could be a candidate for such a molecule on the surface of postmeiotic spermatids, which transmits a specific signal to adjacent cells to bring them into spermiogenesis. The evidence described here raises the possibility that MSI has a function in spermiogenesis as an extracellular signaling molecule. To clarify the biological role of MSI in spermatogenesis, a loss-of-function mutation of the MSI gene would be helpful, and such strains could be generated by the technique of insertional mutagenesis with single P elements (32Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. P element-mediated transformation. In: Drosophila : a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 175-197Google Scholar, 33Cooley L. Kelley R. Spradling A.C. Science. 1988; 239: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The identification of the receptor for MSI, if any, would be also helpful to understand the function of MSI. We found three genes related toMSI in the data base of Drosophila genome. Those genes are likely to be for the new members of IDGF family, but their functions are unknown. We gratefully thank M. T. Fuller for providing the four meiotic arrest mutants, M. Miura for his gift of Schneider's line 2 cells, and J. Inoue for his gift of the DNA fragment of Drosophila actin 5C promoter. We are also grateful to K. Endo, H. Kanuka, and Y. Yagi for their courteous advice on the experimental procedures and to K. Nakane for her great help."

Mutagenic analysis indicated that this was due to relocalization of endogenous proteins that bind the first two SH3 domains of Nck. We therefore screened a Xenopus expression library with Nck SH3 domains to identify Nck-interacting proteins, and evaluated candidate binding proteins for a potential role in Nck-induced anterior truncation/ventralization. Of 39 binding proteins analyzed, only the Abl-related kinase Arg and the Cbl proto-oncogene product bound preferentially to the first two SH3 domains in tandem compared with the individual domains, consistent with a role in the developmental phenotype. High level overexpression of c-Abl or Arg alone induced anterior truncation, as did lower levels of an activated form of Abl; Cbl alone had no effect. In a sensitized system where subthreshold amounts of a ventralizing Nck mutant were expressed, co-expression of the combination of Abl or Arg and Cbl at modest levels strongly potentiated anterior truncation, while Arg, Abl, or Cbl alone were without effect. These results suggest a role for both Cbl and Abl family kinases in patterning the Xenopus embryo.

Src homology polymerase chain reaction glutathioneS-transferase amino acid(s) dorsoanterior index platelet-derived growth factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type hemagglutinin fibroblast growth factor Nck is an Src homology (SH)1 2/SH3 adaptor protein, which is thought to mediate the formation of multiprotein complexes in signal transduction. It consists of three SH3 domains and an SH2 domain (1Lehman J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), each of which can bind to other proteins in vivo andin vitro (reviewed in Ref. 2McCarty J.H.

Little is known about the physiological role of Nck, although the Drosophila homolog, Dock, has been shown to be required for proper guidance and targeting of retinal axons (3Garrity P.A. Rao Y.

Nck has also recently been implicated in modulating the response to T cell receptor engagement (4Bubeck Wardenburg J. Pappu R. Bu J.Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C.

Earlier work from our laboratory implicated Nck (and Nck-interacting proteins) in mesoderm patterning during early Xenopusdevelopment. We found that injection of RNA encoding mutant forms of Nck in which the first two SH3 domains were intact into the two dorsal blastomeres of four-cell stage embryos resulted in developmental defects. Injected embryos exhibited anterior truncation, and both whole embryos and activin-treated animal cap explants showed evidence of ventralization, with presumptive dorsal mesoderm adopting a more ventral fate (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of these results is that Nck expression alters the response of presumptive dorsal mesoderm to morphogenetic signals, affecting mesoderm patterning prior to and during gastrulation and thereby leading to defects in the dorsoanterior tissues of the resulting embryo. Mutation of the SH2 domain or either of the first two SH3 domains (SH3-1 and SH3-2) of Nck diminished ventralizing activity, while a construct encoding both domains (SH3-1+2) fused to a membrane-targeting signal promoted ventralization (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that relocalization of an endogenous protein or proteins that binds both SH3-1 and SH3-2 to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on the membrane was responsible for the Nck-induced ventralization/anterior truncation phenotype. Here we describe a screen for Xenopus Nck-binding proteins that may function downstream of Nck in mesoderm patterning. The results of this screen suggest that the Cbl proto-oncogene, and Arg and/or its close relative the Abl proto-oncogene, are likely to play a role in the Nck-induced patterning defects. The Abl and Arg nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are implicated in the control of cell proliferation, as well as neural development and responses to adhesion and DNA damage (Refs. 8Kruh G.D. Perego R.

To our surprise, we find that inXenopus Abl family kinases and Cbl work coordinately to enhance the Nck-induced phenotype. Although previous results had suggested that Nck SH3 domains could bind Abl and Cbl (17Wunderlich L. Goher A. Farago A. Downward J. Buday L. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 19Rivero-Lezcano O.M.

HA-tagged SH3 domains from human Nck were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (20Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and cloned into pGEX-2N. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads using standard protocols. Full-length human Cbl cDNA was obtained from H. Band. Internal deletion mutants of Cbl and murine Abl were generated by two-step PCR mutagenesis; primer sequences are available upon request. The Xenopus Abl fragment corresponds to amino acids (aa) 110–517 of murine type IV Abl and was kindly provided by K. Dorey and G. Superti-Furga. RNA was purified from stage 8 Xenopus embryos using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), mRNA isolated by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography, and cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primers and a cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). cDNAs were ligated into the Lambda ZAPII vector and packaged following manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene). Average insert size ranged from 0.5 to 6 kilobase pairs, analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. ∼50,000 phage were plated and duplicate nitrocellulose filters obtained. Filters were blocked overnight with 1% ovalbumin in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (TBST: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C, then incubated in the same buffer containing GST-Nck SH3-1+2-HA (2 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Positive plaques were detected with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA-11, BAbCo), followed by goat anti-mouse conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Jackson Immunoresearch). False positives were eliminated by binding to GST and detection with a monoclonal anti-GST antibody (21Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by M. Matsuda). cDNAs were excised from positive clones with the ExAssist helper phage (Stratagene). TheXenopus Arg and Cbl phage clones correspond to aa 392–end of human type Ib Arg and aa 342–end of human Cbl, respectively. The sequences have been deposited in GenBank™ (accession numbers AF237765and AF237766). Partial cDNAs were transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System following manufacturer's protocols (Promega). One third of the reaction contents were then incubated with 2.5 μg of GST proteins bound to 5 μl of glutathione-agarose beads in 75 μl of TNGT (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with TNGT, and bound proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). RNA was prepared from pooled staged embryos using Trizol reagent following manufacturer's instructions. Polyadenylated RNA was isolated by oligo(dT) chromatography using standard protocols. One μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane was electrophoresed in agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes by capillary action. Filters were hybridized with [α-32P]UTP-labeled riboprobe overnight and washed three times in 0.1× SSPE (1× SSPE: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1.25 mmEDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS at 65 °C before exposure to film. Antisense RNA probes were synthesized in vitro using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase from linearized pBK (Stratagene) or pGHXP (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and lysed in 1 ml of TXB (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% (v/v) aprotinin solution (Sigma A6279)). For Fig. 3 B, 300 μl of normalized lysate was precleared with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were then incubated with 1 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-Nck antibody or 1 μl of crude preimmune serum for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on 20 μl of protein A beads and washed three times in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 before adding sample buffer, boiling, and subjecting to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-Abl antibody (8E9, PharMingen). For Fig. 4, 100 μl of lysate was pre-cleared for 1 h with 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) and supernatant incubated with 1 μg of 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected on 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads and washed twice in TXB, once in TXB with 0.5 m NaCl, once in TXB with 10 mm NaCl, and twice in TXB again before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-HA antibody.Figure 4Mapping the binding site for Nck in Cbl.Full-length human Nck (tagged with Myc epitope) and Cbl mutants (tagged with HA epitope) were cotransfected as indicated in 293T cells.

Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nck mutants used here have been described (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Murine type IV c-Abl, human type 1B Arg (provided by G. Kruh), and HA-tagged human c-Cbl were fitted with appropriate restriction sites by PCR and subcloned into pGHXP. After linearization of plasmids withNheI, capped mRNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Inc.) following manufacturer's protocols. RNA was quantitated by ethidium bromide staining. Frogs were maintained and fertilized eggs obtained following standard protocols (23Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Embryo staging and quantitation of dorsoanterior index (DAI) were according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (24Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. North-Holland, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar) and Kao and Elinson (25Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), respectively. Our previous experiments involving expression of Nck mutants in early Xenopus embryos showed that Nck constructs in which the first and second SH3 domains (SH3-1 and SH3-2) were intact induced anterior truncation and mesoderm ventralization (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because Nck consists only of modular protein-interaction domains, this phenotype must be a consequence of endogenous proteins binding to Nck. Since our prior mutational analysis suggested that both SH3 domains of Nck were required in cis for the mesoderm patterning phenotype (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we aimed to identify Xenopus proteins that preferentially bind to Nck SH3-1+2 compared with either domain alone. We constructed a λ phage expression library using cDNA from mid-blastula (stage 8) embryos and screened the library for binding to a GST-SH3-1+2 fusion protein. Thirty-nine independent SH3-1+2-binding clones were isolated and further characterized. We tested each of these clones for binding to purified SH3 domains, and only two of these were found to bind more tightly to SH3-1+2 than to the individual SH3 domains. Sequencing revealed that these clones corresponded to theXenopus homologs of the proto-oncogene Cbl and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Arg, which is highly related to the Abl proto-oncogene. As shown in Fig. 1, when the cDNA inserts corresponding to Xenopus Arg and Cbl were transcribed and translated in vitro, the translation products bound very well to the GST fusion containing both SH3-1 and SH3-2, but weakly or not at all to the individual domains. This is consistent with results of another group, which found that multiple SH3 domains were required for mammalian Nck to interact with Cbl or BCR-Abl (17Wunderlich L. Goher A. Farago A. Downward J. Buday L. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For all other clones, solution binding was either weak for all domains tested, or required only the second SH3 domain, which seems to dominate interactions relative to SH3-1 (data not shown). Because the mesoderm patterning defect associated with Nck expression is first manifested in the early gastrula stage (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), anyXenopus protein involved in the phenotype would need to be present by this stage of development. To confirm that Arg and Cbl were expressed at this time, we performed Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from staged embryos probed with theXenopus Arg and Cbl probes. As seen in Fig.2, both messages were present in the unfertilized egg and throughout the cleavage and blastula stages. In the case of Arg, there was a spike of expression at stage 8 (corresponding to the mid-blastula transition, where zygotic expression begins) followed by a rapid decline after gastrulation. For Cbl, there was a large store of maternal message and relatively constant expression throughout development compared with the ornithine decarboxylase control message. We also obtained a cDNA forXenopus Abl (which is highly related to Arg) and examined its expression. In this case the pattern was more complex, showing several spliced forms or related messages, but there was significant expression of all forms throughout early development. We performed whole mount in situ hybridization experiments to localize Arg and Cbl message. In both cases, diffuse staining was observed from the late blastula through mid-gastrula stages; this staining was strongest near the animal pole, with no obvious dorsoventral bias (data not shown). We have previously shown that endogenous Nck message is present in maternal stores and is induced at the mid-blastula transition (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore Arg, Abl, and Cbl are all expressed in the blastula and early gastrula stages, consistent with a role in the Nck-induced mesoderm patterning defect. We next mapped the binding sites for Nck SH3 domains on Cbl and Abl. We chose to map the sites in human Cbl and murine Abl and not theXenopus Cbl and Arg clones for several reasons. First, we had full-length cDNAs and a variety of mutants for the mammalian homologs available. More importantly, we wish ultimately to relate the results from Xenopus injection experiments to mammalian systems, where both Cbl and Abl have been shown to function as oncogenes and otherwise affect signaling. Because theXenopus and mammalian versions of Cbl and Arg are so similar (66% and 64% identity for Cbl and Arg, respectively), it is reasonable to assume that their function will be conserved across species. Human Abl and Arg share over 90% identity in the region spanning the first common exon, SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains (8Kruh G.D. Perego R. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); although Abl and Arg differ somewhat in their biological activities (26Wang B. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mysliwiec T. Perego R. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 631-640PubMed Google Scholar), presumably due to their fairly divergent C termini, mouse knockout experiments have shown that they are at least in part functionally redundant (9Koleske A.J. Gifford A.M. Scott M.L. Nee M. Bronson R.T. Miczek K.A. Baltimore D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1259-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To map the binding sites in Abl for Nck SH3-1+2, we synthesized the catalytic domain and C terminus of c-Abl and various deletion mutants by in vitro transcription/translation and tested their ability to bind to GST-SH3-1+2 on beads. As shown in Fig.3 A, deletion of a proline-rich region of the Abl C terminus adjacent to the catalytic domain (ΔPro) eliminated binding to SH3-1+2; this region contains two binding sites for Crk SH3 domains, a nuclear localization signal, and a canonical type 2 SH3-binding site (18Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 29Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Deletion of the two Crk binding sites (“Crkless”) did not affect Nck binding, whereas deletion of the third site (“Nckless”) essentially eliminated binding of Abl to SH3-1+2. These experiments confirm that the predominant binding site in Abl for Nck SH3 domains is a single PXXP at position 631–636, as suggested previously (18Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This site is conserved betweenXenopus Arg (APQPPKR, with canonical type 2 SH3-binding site residues underlined), human Arg, and human and mouse Abl (APTPPKR), and Drosophila Abl (APAPPKR). We also examined the association of Nck with Abl in vivo. In lysates of 293T cells overexpressing full-length Nck and wt Abl, Abl efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Nck (Fig. 3 B). Mutants lacking the proline-rich Nck SH3 domain binding site also coprecipitated with Nck, albeit at somewhat lower levels. We have previously shown that binding of a Nck SH3-1+2 construct to Abl in 293T cells was almost completely eliminated by deletion of the proline-rich region of Abl (30Smith J.M. Katz S. Mayer B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27956-27962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); on the other hand, in experiments in cells expressing full-length Nck constructs, less Abl was co-precipitated with Nck SH2 domain mutants than with wt Nck. 2T. Miyoshi-Akiyama, L. M. Aleman, J. M. Smith, C. E. Adler, and B. J. Mayer, submitted for publication. Taken together, these results suggest that, in addition to the Nck SH3-mediated interaction mapped here, the SH2 domain of Nck can also contribute to Abl bindingin vivo. The Nck binding sites in human Cbl were identified by co-expression of full-length Myc epitope-tagged Nck with HA epitope-tagged Cbl in human 293T cells. Nck was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and coprecipitating Cbl was identified by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, deletion of the entire C terminus of Cbl (mutant 480) virtually abolished Nck binding. However, deletion of the major proline-rich region of the C terminus between amino acids 483 and 688 (ΔPRD1) did not affect binding, nor did deletion of a potential type 2 SH3-binding site at amino acids 820–826 (ΔPRD2). However when these two deletions were combined in mutant ΔPRD1+2, binding to Nck was almost completely eliminated, suggesting that either of these two regions is sufficient for binding to Nck SH3 domains. Although the SH2 and SH3-3 domains are also present in wt Nck, under the conditions of this experiment, they have only a modest effect on Cbl binding.2 The C-terminal Nck-binding site that we identified (VPERPPK) is absolutely conserved in mouse, human, and Xenopus Cbl, but is not present in Cbl-b or Drosophila Cbl; a potential variant is found inCaenorhabditis elegans Sli-1 (VPLPPAR). Our major goal was to ascertain whether either Abl (or Arg) or Cbl was involved in the anterior truncation/ventralization phenotype associated with Nck overexpression in Xenopus. Our previous results suggested that Nck mutants exerted their ventralizing effect by recruiting Xenopus proteins to the membrane (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that constitutive localization of Abl, Arg, or Cbl should ventralize in the absence of Nck mutant expression if it were the critical effector. It was impossible to test the effect of direct membrane localization of Abl and Arg, as both proteins already contain an N-terminal membrane localization signal (8Kruh G.D. Perego R. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Ben-Neriah Y. Bernards A. Paskind M. Daley G.Q. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 44: 577-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and other targeting sequences (e.g. actin-binding and nuclear localization signals), suggesting that the protein is normally partitioned among several subcellular compartments. In the case of Cbl, we constructed a version containing an N-terminal myristoylation signal derived from Src and tested the effects of expression by injecting mRNA into the two dorsal blastomeres of four-cell stage embryos. No obvious phenotypic effects were observed (data not shown), suggesting that relocalization of Cbl to the membrane was unlikely to be uniquely responsible for the Nck-induced phenotype. We also reasoned that if binding of Nck to endogenous Abl, Arg, or Cbl was responsible for the phenotype, overexpression of these proteins should enhance the ventralizing effect of Nck. The Lys-229 mutant of Nck, in which SH3-3 is mutated but all other domains are intact, is the most potent Nck mutant for anterior truncation/mesoderm ventralization (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When Nck Lys-229 is expressed at low levels (100 pg of RNA/embryo), however, the great majority of embryos develop normally (Table I and Fig.5). This sensitized system allowed us to test the effects of overexpression of candidate Nck effectors. As shown in Table I and Fig. 5, overexpression of Abl or Cbl alone did not enhance anterior truncation by Nck Lys-229. However, the combination of Nck Lys-229, Abl, and Cbl induced a phenotype that was much stronger than that induced by injection of any of the RNAs individually or pairwise. The effect of wt Nck, which we had previously shown to be less potent than the Lys-229 mutant (7Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was also enhanced by the combination of Abl and Cbl (Table I). We eliminated the possibility that this phenotype was simply due to increased levels of injected RNA, as neither co-injection of Abl and Cbl with a Nck mutant in which all binding domains are mutated (Nck Kall), nor co-injection of Nck Lys-229 and Abl with a Cbl mutant that cannot bind Nck (Cbl Δ1+2), could induce anterior truncation (Table I). Finally, human Arg behaved identically to Abl in these assays, synergizing with Cbl and Nck Lys-229 (Table I). Together, these results imply that anterior truncation/ventralization induced by Nck involves both Cbl and Abl family kinases.Table IInjected mRNAsmRNA injectedpg RNA/embryoDAINo. injected (% survival)54–32–1Experiment 1 Lys-22910096.63.40140 (96.7) Cbl1001000050 (96.0) Abl5089.110.9075 (73.3) Lys-229 + Abl100 + 507525050 (64.0) Abl + Cbl50 + 10080.919.1075 (90.7) Lys-229 + Cbl100 + 1001000075 (97.3) Lys-229 + Abl + Cbl100 + 50 + 10045.742.911.450 (96.0)Experiment 2 Lys-229 + Abl + Cbl100 + 50 + 10024.371.44.375 (93.3) wt Nck + Abl + Cbl100 + 50 + 1004750375 (88.0) Nck Kall + Abl + Cbl100 + 50 + 10080.617.91.575 (89.3) Lys-229 + Abl + CblΔ(1 + 2)100 + 50 + 1008218075 (97.3)Experiment 3 Arg5093.35.31.375 (100) Arg + Cbl50 + 10097.32.7075 (90.1) Lys-229 + Arg50 + 10076.720.12.975 (100) Lys-229 + Arg + Cbl50 + 100 + 10049.242.38.675 (94.7)mRNAs indicated were injected into the two dorsal blastomeres of four-cell-stage embryos and DAI was scored at stage 35.
