https://openalex.org/W2023629636,"Resensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) following agonist-mediated desensitization is a necessary step for maintaining physiological responsiveness. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the nature of GPCR resensitization are poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of β-arrestin in the resensitization of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), known to recycle and resensitize rapidly, and the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R), known to recycle and resensitize slowly. Upon agonist activation, both receptors recruit β-arrestin to the plasma membrane and internalize in a β-arrestin- and clathrin-dependent manner. However, whereas β-arrestin dissociates from the β2AR at the plasma membrane, it internalizes with the V2R into endosomes. The differential trafficking of β-arrestin and the ability of these two receptors to dephosphorylate, recycle, and resensitize is completely reversed when the carboxyl-terminal tails of these two receptors are switched. Moreover, the ability of β-arrestin to remain associated with desensitized GPCRs during clathrin-mediated endocytosis is mediated by a specific cluster of phosphorylated serine residues in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail. These results demonstrate that the interaction of β-arrestin with a specific motif in the GPCR carboxyl-terminal tail dictates the rate of receptor dephosphorylation, recycling, and resensitization, and thus provide direct evidence for a novel mechanism by which β-arrestins regulate the reestablishment of GPCR responsiveness.

The magnitudes of these physiological responses are linked intimately to the delicate balance between GPCR signal generation and signal termination. The termination of GPCR signaling is tightly regulated by a family of intracellular proteins termed β-arrestins (1Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

The interaction of β-arrestins with a phosphorylated receptor uncouples the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins, producing a nonsignaling, desensitized receptor. For many GPCRs, like the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), β-arrestins target the desensitized receptor to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis (4Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M.

In this process, β-arrestins function as docking proteins that link receptors to components of the endocytic machinery such as AP-2 and clathrin (11Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A.

Therefore, β-arrestins are involved not only in terminating receptor G protein coupling but also in initiating processes that regulate re-establishment of receptor responsiveness.

Some internalized GPCRs recycle rapidly back to the plasma membrane fully resensitized, while others are retained inside the cell and recycle slowly or not at all (5Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E.

The molecular mechanisms governing the rate at which receptors recycle and re-establish agonist responsiveness are poorly understood; however, the dephosphorylation of GRK-phosphorylated receptors in early endosomes appears to be a critical step in the resensitization pathway (14Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 17Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Lovett M. Vigna S.R. Frucht M.M. Krause J.E. Bunnett N.W. Mol.

An event presumably necessary for the dephosphorylation of GPCRs is their dissociation from β-arrestin, as suggested by in vitroevidence that the binding of visual arrestin to GRK-phosphorylated rhodopsin prevents rhodopsin dephosphorylation (26Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Jakes S. Ingebritsen T.S. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15770-15773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A common assumption is that β-arrestins do not dissociate from desensitized receptors at the plasma membrane but traffic with them into early endosomes (27Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 28Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). However, recent observations have demonstrated that the fate of the GPCR-β-arrestin complex can differ among receptors (29Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For some receptors, the receptor-β-arrestin complex dissociates at or near the plasma membrane shortly after the formation of clathrin-coated pits, and β-arrestin is excluded from receptor-containing endocytic vesicles. For other receptors, the receptor-β-arrestin complex remains intact and is internalized into endosomes. The ability of β-arrestin to remain associated with some receptors but not others suggests that β-arrestin may regulate the cellular trafficking and dephosphorylation of receptors and ultimately their kinetics of resensitization. In order to investigate the role of β-arrestin in the regulation of GPCR resensitization, two GPCRs, the β2AR and the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R), which share many of the same signaling properties but differ markedly in their ability to recycle and resensitize (5Zhang J.

We demonstrate using mutagenesis and chimeric receptors that the ability of β-arrestin to remain associated with desensitized GPCRs and internalize with them into endosomes dictates the properties of GPCR resensitization. These observations, therefore, provide direct evidence for an important mechanism by which β-arrestins can regulate the physiological responsiveness of GPCRs. Isoproterenol was purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc., and arginine vasopressin (AVP) was obtained from Sigma. The anti-HA 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody and the rhodamine-conjugated anti-HA 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [125I]Cyanopindolol, [3H]AVP, [3H]adenine, [14C]cAMP, [32P]ATP, [3H]ATP, [3H]cAMP, and [32P]orthophosphate were purchased from NEN Life Science Products.

The HA-tagged V2R cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Jurgen Wess (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All other constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction following standard protocols and contain the HA epitope. The β2AR-V2R chimera contains the first 341 amino acids of the β2AR (Met-1 to Cys-341) fused to the last 29 amino acids of the V2R (Ala-343 to Ser-371). The V2R-β2AR chimera contains the first 342 amino acids of the V2R (Met-1 to Cys-342) fused to the last 72 amino acids of the β2AR (Leu-342 to Leu-413). The V2R-S362X truncation mutant was generated by replacing nucleotides CCG encoding Ser-362 of the V2R with nucleotides TAA encoding a stop codon. The V2R-SSSTSS/AAAAAA mutant was generated by replacing Ser-362, Ser-363, Ser-364, Thr-369, Ser-370, and Ser-371 of the V2R with alanine residues. The V2R-TSS/AAA mutant was generated by replacing Thr-369, Ser-370, and Ser-371 of the V2R with alanine residues. The V2R-SSS/AAA and β2AR-V2R-SSS/AAA mutants were generated by replacing Ser-362, Ser-363, and Ser-364 of the V2R with alanine residues. The β2AR413-V2R10 chimera contains the full-length β2AR (Met-1 to Leu-413) fused to the last 10 amino acids of the V2R (Ser-362 to Ser-371). The β2AR360-V2R10 chimera contains the first 360 amino acids of the β2AR (Met-1 to Thr-360) fused to the last 10 amino acids of the V2R (Ser-362 to Ser-371). Sequences of the DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK-293 and COS-7 cells, grown as described previously (32Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and 5 × 105cells/100-mm dish, respectively. Transient transfections were performed using a modified calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (32Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Membrane binding assays were performed on transfected HEK-293 cells as described previously (33Hausdorff W.P. Hnatowich M. O'Dowd B.F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane proteins (2 μg) from cells expressing the β2AR and β2AR-V2R chimera were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature in the presence of 15 pm[125I]cyanopindolol and increasing concentrations of isoproterenol (10 pm to 30 μm). Membrane proteins (10 μg) from cells expressing the V2R and V2R-β2AR chimera were incubated in PBS containing 2% BSA at room temperature with increasing concentrations of [3H]AVP (0.5 nm to 16.0 nm). Binding was terminated by rapid filtration and consecutive washes with ice-cold wash buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH = 7.2). Wild-type and chimeric receptor expression levels were measured on whole cells as described previously (32Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK-293 cells expressing the V2R and V2R-β2AR chimera were incubated 2 h on ice in PBS containing 2% BSA with a saturating concentration of [3H]AVP, and bound radioactivity was extracted with 0.1 m NaOH. Nonspecific binding was determined under each respective condition in the presence of 10 μm propranolol or 10 μm unlabeled AVP. Receptor expression levels varied between 2000 and 4000 fmol/mg of whole cell protein for experiments with βarr2-GFP and between 500 and 1500 fmol/mg of whole cell protein for all other experiments. Receptor sequestration was assessed by flow cytometry as described previously (30Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequestration was defined as the fraction of total cell surface receptors that, after exposure to agonist, were removed from the plasma membrane and thus not accessible to antibodies from outside the cell. For recycling experiments, isoproterenol was removed by three rapid washes with serum-free medium at 37 °C and AVP was removed by successive washes with ice-cold PBS, acid (150 mm NaCl/5 mm acetic acid), PBS, and serum-free medium. βarr2-GFP trafficking was visualized in transfected HEK-293 cells on a heated (37 °C) microscope stage as described previously (31Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Images were collected sequentially using single line excitation (488 nm) with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510). For experiments assessing βarr2-GFP trafficking after agonist removal, cells were washed as described above to remove agonist and returned to a 37 °C incubator for 60 min. Colocalization of βarr2-GFP with rhodamine-labeled receptors was performed on transfected cells pre-incubated in serum-free medium containing a rhodamine-conjugated anti-HA 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100) for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with serum-free medium, treated with the appropriate agonist at 37 °C for 30 min, and imaged by confocal microscopy. βarr2-GFP and rhodamine-labeled receptor fluorescence were performed using dual excitation (488, 568 nm) and emission (515–540 nm, GFP; 590–610 nm, rhodamine) filter sets. Whole cell cyclase assays were performed on transfected HEK-293 cells using varying concentrations of isoproterenol (1 × 10−12m to 1 × 10−5m) or AVP (1 × 10−12m to 1 × 10−5m) as described previously (5Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For membrane adenylyl cyclase assays, transfected HEK-293 cells were harvested by scraping in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmEDTA, pH = 7.4) and membranes were prepared by disruption with a Polytron homogenizer for 20 s at 20,000 rpm followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g. The cell membrane was resuspended in lysis buffer by Polytron homogenization for 15 s at 20,000 rpm, centrifuged, and resuspended in ice-cold assay buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 15 mmMgCl2, pH = 7.4) to a final concentration of 1–2 μg/μl membrane protein. Equivalent amounts of membrane protein in 20-μl aliquots were assayed for agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in a final volume of 50 μl as described previously (5Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation was performed as described previously (5Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected HEK-293 cells were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free medium. Cells were stimulated with agonist for 10 min at 37 °C and then washed three times on ice with ice-cold PBS. For resensitization experiments, cells were washed to remove agonist as described above and either maintained on ice or allowed to recover at 37 °C. All cells were scraped in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors and solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and assayed for protein concentration (Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit). HA-tagged receptors were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C using the anti-HA 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody. Equivalent amounts of receptor, as determined by receptor expression and the amount of solubilized protein in each sample, were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and processed for autoradiography. Receptor phosphorylation was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. The mean and standard error of the mean are expressed for values obtained from the number of independent experiments indicated. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed t test. Binding and dose-response data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. The β2AR and V2R share many of the same signaling properties: both agonist-activated receptors couple to Gsα and stimulate adenylyl cyclase, desensitize in a GRK-dependent fashion, and internalize into early endosomes (5Zhang J.

In addition, residues in the carboxyl terminus of the V2R have been shown to play a critical, but undefined, role in the intracellular retention of this sequestered receptor (20Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, to gain insight into the mechanisms regulating the ability of these two receptors to recycle and resensitize, chimeric receptors were constructed in which the carboxyl-terminal tails of the β2AR and V2R were exchanged, one for the other, after the putative sites of palmitoylation. The β2AR-V2R chimera contains the first 341 amino acids of the β2AR (Met-1 to Cys-341) fused to the last 29 amino acids of the V2R (Ala-343 to Ser-371). The V2R- β2AR chimera contains the first 342 amino acids of the V2R (Met-1 to Cys-342) fused to the last 72 amino acids of the β2AR (Leu-342 to Leu-413). The chimeric receptors were essentially indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts with respect to their affinity for agonist, level of expression, and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for adenylyl cyclase activation (Table I).Table IBinding, expression, and adenylyl cyclase activation parameters for the wild-type and chimeric receptorsReceptorKdBmaxEC50nmpmol/mgnmβ2ARKh = 7.7 ± 0.6 Kl = 360 ± 301.7 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.01β2AR-V2RKh = 7.5 ± 1.0 Kl = 400 ± 301.4 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.15V2R2.4 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.1V2R-β2AR2.5 ± 0.31.1 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.1The ligand binding properties, expression, and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for the activation of adenylyl cyclase were determined for the wild-type and chimeric receptors in transfected HEK-293 cells.

Differences in the ability of the β2AR and V2R to recycle and resensitize might be due to differences in their sequestration pathways. The β2AR internalizes in a β-arrestin- and clathrin-dependent manner (34Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), but little is known about the sequestration pathway of the V2R other than it is blocked nonspecifically by sucrose (36Pfeiffer R.

HEK-293 cells were transfected with each receptor alone or each receptor together with the β-arrestin1 dominant negative mutant V53D (V53D), which blocks β2AR sequestration (34Zhang J.

Agonist-induced sequestration of the β2AR, V2R, and their chimeras was blocked by overexpression of V53D or K44A (Fig.1 A).

https://openalex.org/W1822687991,"The insulin receptor is a transmembrane protein of the plasma membrane, where it recognizes extracellular insulin and transmits signals into the cellular signaling network. We report that insulin receptors are localized and signal in caveolae microdomains of adipocyte plasma membrane. Immunogold electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy show that insulin receptors are restricted to caveolae and are colocalized with caveolin over the plasma membrane. Insulin receptor was enriched in a caveolae-enriched fraction of plasma membrane. By extraction with β-cyclodextrin or destruction with cholesterol oxidase, cholesterol reduction attenuated insulin receptor signaling to protein phosphorylation or glucose transport. Insulin signaling was regained by spontaneous recovery or by exogenous replenishment of cholesterol. β-Cyclodextrin treatment caused a nearly complete annihilation of caveolae invaginations as examined by electron microscopy. This suggests that the receptor is dependent on the caveolae environment for signaling. Insulin stimulation of cells prior to isolation of caveolae or insulin stimulation of the isolated caveolae fraction increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in caveolae, demonstrating that insulin receptors in caveolae are functional. Our results indicate that insulin receptors are localized to caveolae in the plasma membrane of adipocytes, are signaling in caveolae, and are dependent on caveolae for signaling.—Gustavsson, J., Parpal, S., Karlsson, M., Ramsing, C., Thorn, H., Borg, M., Lindroth, M., Peterson, K.

Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) associates with caveolae and is directly regulated by the caveola protein, caveolin. In the present study, we examined the effects of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) on the subcellular location of eNOS, on eNOS activation, and on caveola cholesterol in endothelial cells. We found that treatment with 10 μg/ml oxLDL for 60 min caused greater than 90% of eNOS and caveolin to leave caveolae. Treatment with oxLDL also inhibited acetylcholine-induced activation of eNOS but not prostacyclin production. oxLDL did not affect total cellular eNOS abundance. Oxidized LDL also did not affect the palmitoylation, myristoylation or phosphorylation of eNOS. Oxidized LDL, but not native LDL, or HDL depleted caveolae of cholesterol by serving as an acceptor for cholesterol. Cyclodextrin also depleted caveolae of cholesterol and caused eNOS and caveolin to translocate from caveolae. Furthermore, removal of oxLDL allowed eNOS and caveolin to return to caveolae. We conclude that oxLDL-induced depletion of caveola cholesterol causes eNOS to leave caveolae and inhibits acetylcholine-induced activation of the enzyme.

This impairment is due to a decrease in bioavailable endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO)1 (1Vane J.R. Anggard E.E. Botting R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). In the initial phase of the disease process, there is impaired responsiveness to receptor-dependent stimuli, such as acetylcholine, whereas responsiveness to receptor-independent stimuli such as the calcium ionophore A23187 is not altered. As such, the early pathogenesis involves attenuated endothelial NO production in response to extracellular stimuli, but the capacity for maximal enzyme activation and the breakdown of NO are not affected. As the disease progresses, there is nonspecific inhibition of NO bioavailability. Although this later inhibition is most likely multifactorial in origin, it is at least partly due to enhanced inactivation of NO by superoxide anions (2Cohen R.A. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1995; 38: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Harrison D.G. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1994; 89 Suppl. 1: 87-102PubMed Google Scholar, 4Flavahan N.A. Circulation. 1992; 85: 1927-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). These processes result in increased neutrophil adherence to the endothelium, thereby promoting a key step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (5Lefer A.M. Ma X.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The chronic inhibition of NO synthesis in rabbit models of hypercholesterolemia accelerates the development of vascular dysfunction and intimal lesions, providing additional evidence that the impairment of NO synthesis promotes atherogenesis (6Cayatte A.J. Palacino J.J. Horten K. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In vitro investigations have further shown that oxidized LDL (oxLDL) inhibits NO-mediated responses. Antioxidants reduce both the formation of free radicals and the oxidative modification of LDL that lead to impaired NO-related responses (7Plane F. Jacob M. McManus D. Bruckdorfer K.R. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 103: 73-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, NO is critically involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the initiating events are characterized by attenuated endothelial NO production in response to extracellular stimuli. A family of nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) are responsible for NO synthesis (8Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inducible NOS and neuronal NOS are primarily cytosolic enzymes, whereas the constitutive or endothelial NOS (eNOS) is primarily membrane-bound (8Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial NOS is both myristoylated and palmitoylated (9Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) reported that the caveola protein, caveolin, directly binds eNOS, thereby regulating the generation of NO.

The biological function of Golgi-localized eNOS and the relationship between Golgi and caveola pools of the enzyme has not been explored. The caveola microdomains to which eNOS is targeted are found in most cells. Caveolae are highly enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycolipids, and known signal transducing molecules (14Smart E.J. Ying Y.-Y. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 15Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 16Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Caveolae contain complete signaling complexes from extracellular receptors to intracellular effector systems. For instance, caveolae are enriched with the following (for a review, see Ref. 17Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar): heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins; protein kinase C; receptors for endothelin 1 and acetylcholine; an ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump and a form of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive Ca2+channel; and the small GTP-binding protein Ras. Recent studies further indicate that caveolae play a role not only in the compartmentalization of signaling molecules, but also in the modulation and integration of various responses to extracellular stimuli (11Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 18Feron O. Michel J.B. Sase K. Michel T.

In the present study, we hypothesized that oxLDL inhibits eNOS activation by disrupting the association of eNOS with caveolae. We examined the effects of oxLDL on the subcellular location of eNOS, eNOS activation, and caveola cholesterol. The present study demonstrates that oxLDL depletes caveolae of cholesterol and causes eNOS to translocate from the plasma membrane. In addition, oxLDL inhibits the ability of acetylcholine to efficiently activate the enzyme.

Low passage (<5) porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were kindly provided by Dr. Bernhard Hennig (University of Kentucky). The cells were cultured in a monolayer and plated in a standard format.

The HDL3 subfraction (d = 1.13–1.18 g/ml) was isolated from other HDL subfractions using a density gradient fractionator (ISCO). The HDL3 subfraction was used for all of the experimental treatments described herein. The purity of each lipoprotein fraction was assayed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. [3H]cholesteryl linoleate was incorporated into LDL as described previously (23Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8141-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Endothelial cells grown on glass coverslips were washed once with PBS and then incubated at 37 °C in lipoprotein-deficient serum containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) and 10 μg/ml oxLDL for 60 min. Control and oxLDL-treated cells were then washed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB) and fixed for 10 min with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PB. After fixation, the cells were rinsed three times with PB, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PB for 2 min, and rinsed three times in PB. Cells were then incubated for 30 min in a 1° antibody mixture containing polyclonal antibody to caveolin and monoclonal antibody to eNOS made up in PB plus 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed three time with PB and then incubated for 30 min in a 2° antibody mixture consisting of rhodamine isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse IgG made up in PB plus 1% bovine serum albumin. The concentration of individual antibodies in the mixtures was 20 μg/ml. Cells were washed three times with PB and once in distilled water and mounted in Fluoromount G containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2.2.2)octane as an anti-bleach agent. Cells were examined on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope, and fluorescence images were recorded using a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera. NOS activation was determined in whole endothelial cells by measuring l-[3H]arginine conversion to l-[3H]citrulline using methods previously described (34Davda R.K. Chandler L.J. Crews F.T. Guzman N.J. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were preincubated in PBS for 60 min at 37 °C. After the preincubation period, the incubation for NOS activity was initiated by aspirating the PBS from the wells and replacing it with 400 μl of PBS containing 0.75 μCi/mll-[3H]arginine. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the absence of exogenous stimulation (basal) or in the presence of varying concentrations of acetylcholine (10−10 to 10−4m). The NOS reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of ice-cold 1 ntrichloroacetic acid to each well. The preincubation and incubation were performed in the presence of either native LDL (nLDL) or oxLDL at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The amount ofl-[3H]citrulline generated was measured as described (34Davda R.K. Chandler L.J. Crews F.T. Guzman N.J. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In individual experiments performed in 24-well plates, four wells were used for each treatment group. Findings were confirmed in three independent experiments. NOS activation in the intact cells was completely inhibited by 2 mmnitro-l-arginine methyl ester.l-[3H]Arginine uptake was measured following nLDL or oxLDL pretreatment as done in the experiments evaluating eNOS localization and eNOS activation. Uptake was similar in nLDL- and oxLDL-treated cells. NOS enzymatic activity in cell lysates and subcellular fractions was determined by measuring the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline in the presence of excess amounts of all required substrates and cofactors (34Davda R.K. Chandler L.J. Crews F.T. Guzman N.J. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for determinations of prostacyclin production using methods we have previously described (35Jun S.S. Chen Z. Pace M.C. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 24-well plates were preincubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing either nLDL or oxLDL under the conditions used in the studies of eNOS localization and eNOS activation. Incubations for prostacyclin production were then performed over 15 min in the continued presence of nLDL or oxLDL. Basal (nonstimulated) prostacyclin production and that stimulated by 10−5m bradykinin or 10−5m acetylcholine were evaluated. Samples of incubation medium were assayed for the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1α, by radioimmunoassay (35Jun S.S. Chen Z. Pace M.C. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In all experiments, n = 4 for each determination, and findings were replicated in three independent studies. Biosynthetic labeling with [3H]palmitate, [3H]myristate, and [32P]orthophosphate was carried out exactly as described previously (10Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol.

For the acylation experiments, the gels were soaked in 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, or 1 mhydroxylamine, pH 7.5, for 14 h before being processed for fluorography. Palmitoyl groups are attached by a thioester linkage and are susceptible to hydrolysis by hydroxylamine, whereas myristate is insensitive to hydroxylamine. The immunoprecipitation studies were done as described previously (28Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We first determined if oxLDL alters the subcellular distribution of eNOS. Porcine pulmonary artery endothelial (PPAE) cells were incubated with 100% human lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) only or with 10 μg/ml HDL, 10 μg/ml nLDL, or 10 μg/ml oxLDL (15–20 nmol/mg TBARS) for 1 h at 37 °C before they were washed and subfractionated to isolate caveolae (28Smart E.J.

Table I demonstrates that the caveola fraction was not significantly contaminated with galactosyl transferase (Golgi) or NADPH cytochrome creductase (endoplasmic reticulum) but contained a significant amount of the alkaline phosphatase (plasma membrane) activity. Equal amounts of protein from each subcellular fraction were analyzed for the presence of eNOS and caveolin by immunoblotting. Caveolae isolated from control cells (Fig. 1 A, LPDS) and cells treated with nLDL or HDL (Fig.1 A, nLDL and HDL) were highly enriched in eNOS. Caveolin, a caveola marker protein, was also highly enriched in the caveola fraction (Fig. 1 B, LPDS, nLDL, and HDL). Dramatically, treatment with oxLDL induced eNOS and caveolin to move to the internal membrane fraction (Fig. 1, A and B). The internal membrane fraction contains ER, Golgi, mitochondria, and numerous other intracellular organelles, so the exact location(s) of the eNOS and caveolin was not revealed. oxLDL treatment did not cause PKCα or GM1, which are additional molecules shown to be enriched in caveolae (38Parton R.G.

In addition, the noncaveola protein, transferrin receptor, was excluded from the caveola fraction with all treatment conditions (Fig.1 C and data not shown). Importantly, the same data were obtained when the cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) (data not shown). This indicates that oxLDL causes eNOS and caveolin to translocate to an intracellular membrane and that the presence of intracellular eNOS and caveolin is not due to de novo synthesis. In addition, the removal of oxLDL and continued incubation in the presence of cycloheximide (50 μg/ml for 2 h) permitted eNOS and caveolin to return to the caveolae fraction (Fig. 1, A and B, Recovery).Table ICharacterization of PPAE subcellular fractionsSubcellular fractionProteinGalactosyl transferaseNADPH cytochromec reductaseAlkaline phosphataseμg%%%Postnuclear supernatant4223 ± 223100 ± 5.0100 ± 8.3100 ± 6.1Cytosol2011 ± 1637 ± 0.514 ± 6.86 ± 3.4Intracellular membranes1658 ± 10590 ± 8.784 ± 9.816 ± 8.0Plasma membranes563 ± 561.1 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.576 ± 5.8Caveola membranes31 ± 5NDND27 ± 3.4Nontreated PPAE cells were subfractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Galactosyl transferase, NADPH cytochromec reductase, and alkaline phosphatase activities were measured in each fraction and normalized with respect to the values obtained for the postnuclear supernatant fractions.

Presented data are the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments (n = 3). aN.D. means that the level of enzymatic activity was below the sensitivity of the assay. We used indirect immunofluorescence to confirm the subcellular fractionation data. PPAE cells were treated with LPDS, nLDL, or oxLDL as described above. The cells were co-labeled with anti-caveolin IgG (polyclonal) and anti-eNOS mAb (monoclonal). Fig.2 shows that caveolin and eNOS co-localize at the plasma membrane in cells treated with LPDS and nLDL. However, oxLDL caused both caveolin and eNOS to translocate to an intracellular location. Caveolin and eNOS remain co-localized even after leaving the plasma membrane. These data confirm the redistribution of caveolin and eNOS in subcellular fractions shown in Fig. 1. Because oxLDL induced the redistribution of eNOS, we tested the ability of acetylcholine to activate eNOS in intact cells exposed to oxLDL. NOS activity was determined in whole PPAE cells by using methods previously described (see “Experimental Procedures”) (41Lantin-Hermoso R.L. Rosenfeld C.R. Yuhanna I.S. German Z. Chen Z. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L119-L126PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure provides a direct assessment of the acute activation of existing eNOS while keeping signal transduction mechanisms intact (34Davda R.K. Chandler L.J. Crews F.T. Guzman N.J. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with oxLDL (Fig. 3, ●) significantly reduced acetylcholine-stimulated eNOS activation compared with nLDL controls (Fig. 3, ○). Oxidized LDL suppressed the activation of eNOS at all concentrations of acetylcholine tested, resulting in a shift in the dose-response curve to the right by 100-fold. The value obtained when cells were incubated in LPDS (no added lipoproteins) and 10−4m acetylcholine was 49.2 ± 7 fmoll-[3H]citrulline/well. In addition, to rule out the possibility of nonspecific disruption of signaling pathways, we demonstrated that oxLDL treatment did not affect bradykinin- or acetylcholine-stimulated prostacyclin production (TableII).Table IIoxLDL does not inhibit receptor-mediated stimulation of prostacyclin synthesisTreatment6-keto-prostaglandin F1αpg/wellBasal, nLDL271 ± 14Basal, oxLDL280 ± 19Bradykinin, 10−5m, nLDL377 ± 52ap < 0.005 compared with basal.Bradykinin, 10−5m, oxLDL478 ± 71ap < 0.005 compared with basal.Acetylcholine, 10−5m, nLDL388 ± 36ap < 0.005 compared with basal.Acetylcholine, 10−5m, oxLDL435 ± 53ap < 0.005 compared with basal.Cells were incubated for determinations of prostacyclin production using methods we have previously described (35Jun S.S.

Recently, chemical compounds such as Y-27632, Y-32885, and HA1077 have been shown to inhibit the Rho-kinase activity in a manner competitive with ATP (29Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T.

However, the modes of action and specificity of these chemical compounds have not yet been elucidated.Rho-kinase is composed of NH2-terminal catalytic, coiled-coil, Rho-binding, and COOH-terminal PH domains (6Matsui T.

When the COOH-terminal portion of Rho-kinase is deleted, the NH2-terminal portion containing the catalytic domain of Rho-kinase (CAT) becomes constitutively active and serves as the dominant active form both in vitro and in vivo(16Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The Rho-binding domain (RB) of Rho-kinase inhibits Rho-dependent activation of Rho-kinase in vitroand interferes with the Rho pathway in vivo (16Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain mutated at the ATP-binding site (kinase dead: CAT-KD) and the PH domain (PH) serve as dominant negative forms in vivo in some cases (16Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), while they have no or a very weak effect on the Rho-kinase activity in vitro. It has been also reported that ROCK I, an isoform of Rho-kinase, that is kinase dead and cannot bind to Rho (named as KD-IA) functions as dominant negative form in the cells (17Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that the COOH-terminal portion of Rho-kinase containing Rho-binding and PH domains (RB/PH (TT)), in which point mutations are introduced to abolish the Rho binding activity (15Leung T.

These results suggest that RB/PH (TT) functions as the dominant negative form of Rho-kinase by the different mechanism of inhibition from those of CAT-KD, RB, and PH.Here, we examined the mode of action and the specificity of inhibitors of Rho-kinase. We found that RB/PH (TT) directly and specifically inhibited the kinase activity of catalytic fragment of Rho-kinasein vitro. The expression of RB/PH (TT) specifically blocked the stress fiber and focal adhesion formation induced by the active form of Rho or Rho-kinase in NIH 3T3 cells, but not that induced by the active form of MLC.

In addition to MLC and myosin-binding subunit, Rho-kinase phosphorylates the ezrin/radixin/moesin family proteins and adducin in vitro (27Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K.

Recently, chemical compounds such as Y-27632, Y-32885, and HA1077 have been shown to inhibit the Rho-kinase activity in a manner competitive with ATP (29Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T.

However, the modes of action and specificity of these chemical compounds have not yet been elucidated. Rho-kinase is composed of NH2-terminal catalytic, coiled-coil, Rho-binding, and COOH-terminal PH domains (6Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). When the COOH-terminal portion of Rho-kinase is deleted, the NH2-terminal portion containing the catalytic domain of Rho-kinase (CAT) becomes constitutively active and serves as the dominant active form both in vitro and in vivo(16Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The Rho-binding domain (RB) of Rho-kinase inhibits Rho-dependent activation of Rho-kinase in vitroand interferes with the Rho pathway in vivo (16Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain mutated at the ATP-binding site (kinase dead: CAT-KD) and the PH domain (PH) serve as dominant negative forms in vivo in some cases (16Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), while they have no or a very weak effect on the Rho-kinase activity in vitro. It has been also reported that ROCK I, an isoform of Rho-kinase, that is kinase dead and cannot bind to Rho (named as KD-IA) functions as dominant negative form in the cells (17Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that the COOH-terminal portion of Rho-kinase containing Rho-binding and PH domains (RB/PH (TT)), in which point mutations are introduced to abolish the Rho binding activity (15Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Saya H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), although PH has minimal effects in these cases. These results suggest that RB/PH (TT) functions as the dominant negative form of Rho-kinase by the different mechanism of inhibition from those of CAT-KD, RB, and PH. Here, we examined the mode of action and the specificity of inhibitors of Rho-kinase. We found that RB/PH (TT) directly and specifically inhibited the kinase activity of catalytic fragment of Rho-kinasein vitro. The expression of RB/PH (TT) specifically blocked the stress fiber and focal adhesion formation induced by the active form of Rho or Rho-kinase in NIH 3T3 cells, but not that induced by the active form of MLC.

Upon invasion of a human erythrocyte, the parasite grows and matures surrounded by cytosol consisting predominantly of a single protein, hemoglobin. Amino acids derived from the proteolysis of hemoglobin are incorporated into parasite proteins and parasites require supplementation with only a few amino acids that are absent or deficient in hemoglobin for normal growth in culture (1Divo A.A.

This compartment has a pH estimated at 5.0–5.4 (3Yayon A. Cabantchik Z.I. Ginsburg H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 4Krogstad D.J. Schlesinger P.H.

Thus, it appears that the food vacuole of P. falciparum does not function in degradation and recycling of macromolecules in general. The catabolic capability of this organelle is focused on hemoglobin. Disruption of hemoglobin catabolism causes parasite death in an animal model and in culture (2Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A.

A cysteine protease, falcipain, is able to cleave denatured globin but not native hemoglobin (10Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin.

Exopeptidase activity capable of generating individual amino acids from peptide fragments is absent from the food vacuole (16Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, peptides may traverse the food vacuole membrane and could be converted to amino acids by exopeptidase activity in the parasite cytoplasm. An aminopeptidase that functions at neutral pH has been purified from parasites and characterized (17Florent I. Derhy Z. Allary M. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Schrevel J. Mol. Biol.

Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cleavage sites along the hemoglobin α and β chains were located an average of eight amino acids apart. Many cleavage sites corresponded to the peptide bonds previously identified as sites for the known vacuolar proteases. Twenty-four cleavage sites that could not be attributed to the known proteases of the vacuole were identified. Unlike the preference of plasmepsin I, plasmepsin II, and falcipain for hydrophobic residues, many of the novel cleavage sites contained polar residues at the P1 and/or P1′ positions. These results suggested that one or more vacuolar endopeptidases had remained unidentified (16Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the discovery of a novel proteolytic activity, purification of the enzyme responsible for this activity, characterization of the purified enzyme, and the corresponding molecular sequence data. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this enzyme, falcilysin, has a distinct, downstream role in the semiordered hemoglobin degradation pathway of P. falciparum.DISCUSSIONOur previous work suggested that there may be an additional unknown enzyme(s) in the food vacuole that participates in hemoglobin degradation (16Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This paper describes the identification of a novel metallopeptidase activity in P. falciparum. Falcilysin was purified from food vacuoles and characterized. It is an oligoendopeptidase of the M16 family which contains two subfamilies. Subfamily B contains consists of the mitochondrial processing peptidases and chloroplast stromal processing peptidases that cleave NH2-terminal signal peptides from proteins (35Rawlings N.D. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Bath, United Kingdom1998: 1360-1362Google Scholar). Subfamily A of family M16 consists of large proteins (approximately 100 kDa or more) that function as oligoendopeptidases. Substrates for these enzymes include peptides such as a-factor (40Fujita A.

Pierotti A.R. Barre N. Creminon C. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2056-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but this was not observed in falcilysin.The M16 family of metallopeptidases is growing. Besides the addition of falcilysin presented in this work, BLAST searches revealed sequence characteristics common to M16 family members in several uncharacterized protein sequences from different organisms (Fig.7). In fact, many potential M16 family members share greater sequence identity with falcilysin than the known members. Future investigations of these sequences will reveal which of these proteins function as metallopeptidases and whether one or more new types of enzymes with distinct biological functions are among them.As expected for a metallopeptidase of this class, falcilysin is unable to cleave polypeptides such as the α and β chains of hemoglobin (141 and 146 amino acids in length) but is able to cleave within peptides generated by the other proteases of the food vacuole. In this study falcilysin cleaved peptides up to 20 amino acids and preferred those 11–15 residues in length (Table I). It thus functions downstream of other vacuolar proteases, providing strong evidence for order in the hemoglobin degradation process. Our current understanding of the sequential nature of the proteolytic events is that the initial cleavages of the native hemoglobin molecule are made by the plasmepsins. Denatured or fragmented globin is susceptible to cleavage by falcipain as well as the plasmepsins (15Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Banerjee D. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Falcilysin cannot cleave hemoglobin or globin, but is able to cleave hemoglobin fragments. It is likely that many peptide intermediates are susceptible to cleavage by multiple enzymes. The distinct but overlapping roles of the proteolytic enzymes of the food vacuole and the location of exopeptidase activity across the food vacuole membrane in the parasite cytoplasm suggest that hemoglobin catabolism within P. falciparum is a semiordered pathway.The importance of zinc to intraerythrocytic P. falciparumhas been demonstrated. Levels of zinc increase in parallel with parasite maturation within the red blood cell (50Ginsburg H. Gorodetsky R. Krugliak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 886: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Treatment of cultures with dipicolinic acid does not prevent schizont rupture or reinvasion of host erythrocytes but blocks parasite maturation from the ring to the trophozoite stage, coincident with the onset of hemoglobin degradation (50Ginsburg H.

Rasnick D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The specific role of falcilysin in the essential process of hemoglobin degradation may have encouraging implications for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. Plasmepsins I and II as well as falcipain prefer to cleave the α and β chains of hemoglobin at sites with hydrophobic residues at the P1 and/or P1′ positions (10Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast, falcilysin sites are polar in character, with charged residues at the P1 and/or P4′ positions. Internal cleavage of the large peptides generated by the plasmepsins and falcipain at distinct sites is likely to be critical for production of peptides small enough to cross the food vacuole membrane for cytosolic amino acid production. Falcilysin appears to play an integral role in this process. Plasmodium falciparum is a protozoan parasite that causes the most lethal form of human malaria. Upon invasion of a human erythrocyte, the parasite grows and matures surrounded by cytosol consisting predominantly of a single protein, hemoglobin. Amino acids derived from the proteolysis of hemoglobin are incorporated into parasite proteins and parasites require supplementation with only a few amino acids that are absent or deficient in hemoglobin for normal growth in culture (1Divo A.A. Geary G., T. Davis N.L. Jensen J.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin proteolysis occurs within an acidic organelle, the food vacuole. This compartment has a pH estimated at 5.0–5.4 (3Yayon A. Cabantchik Z.I. Ginsburg H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 4Krogstad D.J. Schlesinger P.H. Gluzman I.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2302-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nonproteolytic acid hydrolases could not be detected in food vacuoles isolated from P. falciparum (5Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the food vacuole of P. falciparum does not function in degradation and recycling of macromolecules in general. The catabolic capability of this organelle is focused on hemoglobin. Disruption of hemoglobin catabolism causes parasite death in an animal model and in culture (2Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A.

The vital and specialized process of hemoglobin degradation within the food vacuole provides promising targets for the development of novel antimalarial drugs, greatly needed in the face of increasing resistance to existing chemotherapeutic agents (8Olliaro P. Cattani J. Wirth D. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 275: 230-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple proteases within the food vacuole facilitate the degradation of hemoglobin to peptide fragments. Three acidic proteases have been identified, purified from food vacuoles, and characterized (2Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G.

A cysteine protease, falcipain, is able to cleave denatured globin but not native hemoglobin (10Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 15Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Banerjee D. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol.

Exopeptidase activity capable of generating individual amino acids from peptide fragments is absent from the food vacuole (16Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, peptides may traverse the food vacuole membrane and could be converted to amino acids by exopeptidase activity in the parasite cytoplasm. An aminopeptidase that functions at neutral pH has been purified from parasites and characterized (17Florent I. Derhy Z. Allary M. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Schrevel J. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A. O'Callaghan S.A. Dalton J.P. J. Eukaryot.

When hemoglobin was incubated with food vacuole lysate at acidic pH, a series of discrete peptide fragments was generated (16Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cleavage sites along the hemoglobin α and β chains were located an average of eight amino acids apart. Many cleavage sites corresponded to the peptide bonds previously identified as sites for the known vacuolar proteases. Twenty-four cleavage sites that could not be attributed to the known proteases of the vacuole were identified. Unlike the preference of plasmepsin I, plasmepsin II, and falcipain for hydrophobic residues, many of the novel cleavage sites contained polar residues at the P1 and/or P1′ positions. These results suggested that one or more vacuolar endopeptidases had remained unidentified (16Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the discovery of a novel proteolytic activity, purification of the enzyme responsible for this activity, characterization of the purified enzyme, and the corresponding molecular sequence data. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this enzyme, falcilysin, has a distinct, downstream role in the semiordered hemoglobin degradation pathway of P. falciparum. DISCUSSIONOur previous work suggested that there may be an additional unknown enzyme(s) in the food vacuole that participates in hemoglobin degradation (16Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This paper describes the identification of a novel metallopeptidase activity in P. falciparum. Falcilysin was purified from food vacuoles and characterized. It is an oligoendopeptidase of the M16 family which contains two subfamilies. Subfamily B contains consists of the mitochondrial processing peptidases and chloroplast stromal processing peptidases that cleave NH2-terminal signal peptides from proteins (35Rawlings N.D. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Bath, United Kingdom1998: 1360-1362Google Scholar). Subfamily A of family M16 consists of large proteins (approximately 100 kDa or more) that function as oligoendopeptidases. Substrates for these enzymes include peptides such as a-factor (40Fujita A.

Inhibition by alkylating agents has been observed in insulysin (42Shii K. Yokono K. Baba S. Roth R.A. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), nardilysin (47Chesneau V.

Pierotti A.R. Barre N. Creminon C. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2056-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but this was not observed in falcilysin.The M16 family of metallopeptidases is growing. Besides the addition of falcilysin presented in this work, BLAST searches revealed sequence characteristics common to M16 family members in several uncharacterized protein sequences from different organisms (Fig.7). In fact, many potential M16 family members share greater sequence identity with falcilysin than the known members. Future investigations of these sequences will reveal which of these proteins function as metallopeptidases and whether one or more new types of enzymes with distinct biological functions are among them.As expected for a metallopeptidase of this class, falcilysin is unable to cleave polypeptides such as the α and β chains of hemoglobin (141 and 146 amino acids in length) but is able to cleave within peptides generated by the other proteases of the food vacuole. In this study falcilysin cleaved peptides up to 20 amino acids and preferred those 11–15 residues in length (Table I). It thus functions downstream of other vacuolar proteases, providing strong evidence for order in the hemoglobin degradation process. Our current understanding of the sequential nature of the proteolytic events is that the initial cleavages of the native hemoglobin molecule are made by the plasmepsins. Denatured or fragmented globin is susceptible to cleavage by falcipain as well as the plasmepsins (15Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Banerjee D. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Falcilysin cannot cleave hemoglobin or globin, but is able to cleave hemoglobin fragments. It is likely that many peptide intermediates are susceptible to cleavage by multiple enzymes. The distinct but overlapping roles of the proteolytic enzymes of the food vacuole and the location of exopeptidase activity across the food vacuole membrane in the parasite cytoplasm suggest that hemoglobin catabolism within P. falciparum is a semiordered pathway.The importance of zinc to intraerythrocytic P. falciparumhas been demonstrated. Levels of zinc increase in parallel with parasite maturation within the red blood cell (50Ginsburg H. Gorodetsky R. Krugliak M. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2010464023,"Microglia are phagocytic cells that are the main inflammatory response cells of the central nervous system. In Alzheimer's disease brain, activated microglia are concentrated in regions of compact amyloid deposits that contain the 39-43-amino acid Abeta peptide. We examined the uptake, degradation, and release of small aggregates of fibrillar Abeta (fAbeta) or soluble Abeta (sAbeta) by microglia. We found that although some degradation of fAbeta was observed over 3 days, no further degradation was observed over the next 9 days. Instead, there was a slow release of intact Abeta. The poor degradation was not due to inhibition of lysosomal function, since the rate of alpha2-macroglobulin degradation was not affected by the presence of fAbeta in the late endosomes/lysosomes. In contrast to fAbeta, internalization of sAbeta was not saturable. After internalization, sAbeta was released rapidly from microglia, and very little was degraded. These data show that fAbeta and sAbeta interact differently with microglia but that after internalization a large fraction of both are released without degradation."

The involvement of the latter factor in postreplicative mismatch repair thus remains to be demonstrated. mismatch repair hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer activation domain binding domain phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride chromosome dithiothreitol polymerase chain reaction wild type polyvinylidene difluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis insertion/deletion loop In lower organisms, lack of postreplicative mismatch repair (MMR)1 was shown to lead to frequent alterations in tracts of simple repetitive DNA sequences (1Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). As this so-called microsatellite instability was found also in tumors of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) kindreds, it was proposed that the latter syndrome was associated with a deficiency in MMR (2Ionov Y.

To date, six MutS homologues (hMSH1–6) and several MutL homologues (hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2, as well as a cluster of PMS-like (pseudo)genes on chromosome 7) have been identified in the human genome (19Horii A. Han H.J. Sasaki S. Shimada M. Nakamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this plethora of potential new cancer susceptibility genes changed the distribution of mutations only slightly: of the more than 350 kindreds documented in the HNPCC data base as of May 1999 (20Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), 61% were reported to carry mutations in hMLH1 and 36% in hMSH2. Only five kindreds have been described so far that appear to carry mutations in other loci: two in hMSH6 (21Miyaki M. Konishi M. Tanaka K. Kikuchi-Yanoshita R. Muraoka M. Yasuno M. Igari T. Koike M. Chiba M. Mori T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 22Akiyama Y. Sato H. Yamada T. Nagasaki H. Tsuchiya A. Abe R. Yuasa Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3920-3923PubMed Google Scholar), two in hPMS2(23Nicolaides N.C. Papadopoulos N. Liu B. Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W.A. Fleischmann R.D. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1994; 371: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar), and one individual from a family with a clear cancer predisposition could be shown to carry a mutation in thehPMS1 gene (23Nicolaides N.C. Papadopoulos N. Liu B. Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W.A. Fleischmann R.D. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1994; 371: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The under-representation of mutations in the hMSH6 locus is explained by the biochemistry of MMR. Mismatch recognition, the initial step of the repair process, is mediated principally by a heterodimer of hMSH2 and hMSH6. This abundant complex binds both base/base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops (IDLs) (13Palombo F. Iaccarino I. Nakajima E. Ikejima M. Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and is thus involved in the correction of misinsertions, as well as of primer/template slippage errors. However, the latter lesions are addressed also by a second heterodimer, formed by hMSH2 and hMSH3. The functional redundancy of hMSH6 and hMSH3 in the repair of small insertion/deletion loops means that only mutations in the hMSH2 gene abolish MMR in its entirety; hMSH6inactivation leads solely to the loss of repair of base/base mismatches, while a deficiency in hMSH3 appears to have no deleterious effect on MMR (24Marra G. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Roscilli G. Delmastro P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8568-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Could the unequal distribution of mutations in the family of human mutL homologues be explained by a similar phenomenon? Modrich and colleagues (25Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) were able to complement a mismatch repair-deficient extract of H6 (HCT116) cells by the addition of mismatch repair-proficient extracts of HeLa cells. By fractionating the latter extracts, they could demonstrate that the complementing activity was a heterodimer of hMLH1 and hPMS2 (15Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), which they named hMutLα. In subsequent studies, the mutator phenotype of tumor cell lines lacking either hMLH1 or hPMS2 appeared to be similar (26Kato T. Yatagai F. Glickman B.W. Tachibana A. Ikenaga M. Mutat. Res. 1998; 422: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), implying that no significant functional redundancy existed between hPMS2 and other MutL homologues. However, the following pieces of evidence question this statement. The first concerns the identification of one patient with an HNPCC family background, who harbored a mutation in thehPMS1 gene (23Nicolaides N.C. Papadopoulos N. Liu B. Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W.A. Fleischmann R.D. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1994; 371: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). As the mutation could not be shown to segregate with the disease due to lack of clinical samples from the other family members, it is unclear whether it is causative. However, this finding suggested that hPMS1 might be involved in MMR. Further evidence in support of this hypothesis came from recent reports, which demonstrated that Mlh3p, the closest Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of hPMS1, interacts with Mlh1p in a two-hybrid assay (27Pang Q. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4465-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and contributes to the repair of a subset of insertion/deletion loops (28Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12404-12409Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In an attempt to find biochemical evidence of the existence of a complex of MLH1 with the second MutL homologue, we expressed the human MLH1, PMS1, and PMS2 proteins in the baculovirus system and studied their interactions in some detail. The data presented below demonstrate that, in addition to its participation in hMutLα, hMLH1 can indeed form a stable heterodimer with hPMS1, a complex that we shall refer to as hMutLβ. We further show that, although hPMS1 is expressed in human cells at low levels, it also interacts with hMLH1 in vivo. Interestingly, the affinity of hMLH1 for hPMS1, as measured in the yeast two-hybrid assay, was apparently greater than for hPMS2. However, despite the ability of hPMS1 and hMLH1 to interact, we were so far unable to demonstrate the involvement of the resulting heterodimer in the mismatch repair process. The lines used in this study were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), with the exception of HEC-1A (a kind gift of Tom Kunkel), HCT116 + Chr. 3 (a kind gift of Richard Boland and Minoru Koi), and HEC-1A + Chr. 7 (a gift of Margherita Bignami). They were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HeLa, HEC-1A) or McCoy's 5A medium (HCT116), containing 10% fetal calf serum. The HCT116 cells complemented with chromosome 3 and the HEC-1A clone complemented with chromosome 7 were maintained in media containing 400 μg/ml G418. The pCite2 vectors containing the cDNAs of hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 were kindly provided by Andrew Buermeyer and Mike Liskay. All recombinant DNA manipulations were performed as described (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A BamHI/NotI fragment of the pCite2a-hMLH1 vector containing the hMLH1cDNA was subcloned between the BamHI/NotI sites of pFastBacI. Sequencing of the hPMS1 cDNA in pCite2c vector revealed two nucleotide differences in codons 4 (TTG → TGG) and 222 (ATG → ATC), as compared with the published hPMS1 sequence (23Nicolaides N.C. Papadopoulos N. Liu B. Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W.A. Fleischmann R.D. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1994; 371: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar), which result in amino acid substitutions L4W and M222I, respectively. Both substitutions were reverted to the published sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. The sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis are available on request. The pCite2c-hPMS1wt (Leu-4, Met-222) or the pCite2c-hPMS1 (Trp-4, Ile-222) vectors were first cleaved with NcoI, the overhangs were filled-in with Klenow polymerase, and the vectors were then cleaved withXbaI. The resulting fragments were cloned between theBamHI filled-in with Klenow polymerase and XbaI sites of pFastBacI. All the experiments described in this paper were carried out with the recombinant hPMS1 protein containing the published (wt) sequence. However, all the experiments were repeated in parallel also with the heterodimer containing the hPMS1 subunit with the two mutations. No differences were found between the two factors. The BamHI/XbaI fragment of the pCite2c-hPMS2 vector was subcloned between theBamHI/XbaI sites of pFastBacI. A fragment containing the polyhedrin promoter and the (His)6 tag was amplified by PCR from the pBlueBacHisB vector (Invitrogen) using primer BacUp(5′-GTGTCCAGTGTGGCTTGATA-3′) and primer BacRev(5′-AGCGGGTCCAAGTTTCCCT-3′), the overhangs were filled-in with Klenow polymerase, and the fragment was then cleaved with BamHI. The resulting fragment was cloned between the SnaBI site (filled-in with Klenow polymerase) and the BamHI site of pFastBacI. For expression of the (His)6 hMLH1, the original translational start ATG was mutated to AGC. A fragment of the hMLH1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from pFastBacI-hMLH1 using primer mr2(5′-CGGAATTCTATCTGTATGCACACTTTCCAT-3′) and mr4(5′-CGGGATCCAAGCTCGTTCGTGGCAGGGGTT-3′) and cleaved withBamHI and PvuII. The resulting fragment was cloned between the BamHI and PvuII sites of pFastBacI. ABamHI/XbaI fragment of the pFastBacI-hMLH1(M1S) vector was subcloned between the BamHI/XbaI sites of pFastBacI-His6B. An internal fragment of the hPMS1 cDNA coding for amino acids 335–634 was amplified by PCR from pFastBacI-hPMS1 using the primers mr_27(5′-GGTCGTCATATGACTTGTTATGGACCATTACC-3′) and mr_31(5′-GCGGATCCGTTATAGTGA CATTTGTGACTCC-3′). The PCR product was subcloned between the NdeI/BamHI sites of pET-16b. The BamHI/SalI fragment of pCite2c-hPMS2 vector was subcloned between theBamHI/SalI sites of pET-28c. The two-hybrid experiments were performed using the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH), following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The cDNAs ofhMLH1, hPMS1, or hPMS2 were subcloned into pAS2–1 (GAL4 DNA binding domain) or the pACT2 (GAL4 activation domain) vectors. For BD-hMLH1, the EcoRI fragment of pFastBacI-hMLH1 was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pAS2–1. For BD-hPMS1, theMunI/EcoRI fragment of pFastBacI-hPMS1wt was subcloned between the MunI/EcoRI sites of pAS2–1 (MunI cuts 7 nucleotides downstream of the translational start ATG; the fusion protein therefore lacks 3 amino acids at the amino terminus of the hPMS1 protein). For BD-hPMS2, theNdeI/SalI fragment of pET28c-hPMS2 was subcloned between the NdeI/SalI sites of pAS2–1. For AD-hMLH1, the NcoI/BamHI fragment of BD-hMLH1 was subcloned between the NcoI/BamHI sites of pACT2. For AD-hPMS1, the NcoI/BamHI fragment of BD-hPMS1 was subcloned between the NcoI/BamHI sites of pACT2. For AD-hPMS2, the EcoRI fragment of pCite2c-hPMS2 was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pACT2. Typically, 1.6 × 108 Sf9 cells were infected with either a single recombinant baculovirus or with a combination of two viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10. 72 h after infection, the cells were harvested and total extracts were prepared as described (31Jiricny J. Hughes M. Corman N. Rudkin B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8860-8864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). They were diluted to 0.15m salt with four volumes of buffer HE (0.25 mmHEPES, pH = 7.6, 1 mm EDTA), filtered, and directly loaded on a 6-ml HiTrap Heparin FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were eluted (hMutLα at 38.5 mS, hMutLβ at 34.2 mS, hMLH1 at 19.8 mS) with a 2%/ml salt gradient. The peak fractions were pooled, diluted to 0.12 m salt, filtered, applied to a 1-ml Resource-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a 2%/ml salt gradient. The fractions containing the pure proteins were pooled, dialyzed extensively against storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH = 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, and 0.5 mm PMSF), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. These assays were carried out as described previously (32Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared from HeLa, HCT116, and HEC-1A cell lines, using 5 × 108 cells harvested in the exponential growth phase. After resuspension in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH = 7.9, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT) at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml, the cells were allowed to swell for 10 min in a glass Dounce homogenizer on ice, and then lysed mechanically by applying four or more strokes with a tight pestle. When more than 80% of cells were lysed, the nuclei were pelleted, the supernatant was centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Wild type and mutant M13mp2 phage used to generate the mismatch-containing heteroduplexes were kindly provided by Tom Kunkel. The heteroduplex DNA contained the indicated base/base mispair or an IDL within the coding sequence of the lacZα-complementation gene, and a nick either 5′ or 3′ from the mispair. Substrate (1 fmol) was incubated with 50 μg of cytoplasmic extract, supplemented where necessary with 200 ng of the purified recombinant hMutLα or hMutLβ. The repair reaction (25 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES, pH = 7.8, 7 mmMgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 200 μm each CTP, GTP, and UTP, 100 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 100 fmol of creatine phosphokinase, and 15 mm sodium phosphate, pH = 7.5. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, the heteroduplex DNA was purified and electroporated into E. coli NR9162 (mutS), plated on minimal medium in a soft agar layer containing 0.5 ml of a log culture of E. coli CSH50, 0.5 mg of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 2 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, repair efficiency could be determined by analyzing the color of the plaques. To produce nuclear extract for immunoprecipitations, pelleted nuclei were incubated 30 min at 4 °C in an appropriate volume of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH = 7.9, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT). The extracted nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was dialyzed against storage buffer, centrifuged (20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. In the immunoprecipitation experiments, 250 μg of nuclear extract were incubated at 4 °C with 1 μg of the indicated antibody in a total volume of 800 μl of RIPA buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmPMSF, 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1% SDS dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline). After 1 h, 20 μl of a Protein A/G-agarose suspension (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were precipitated, washed three times with 800 μl of RIPA buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were separated on denaturing 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto PVDF membranes, and detected with the ECL-Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the protocol provided. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were hMLH1 (PharMingen, clone G168-728), hPMS2 (Oncogene, Ab-1), and hPMS1 (polyclonal rabbit antiserum generated at Eurogentec by immunization with a (His)6-tagged internal peptide of hPMS1 (amino acid 335–634), which was purified by affinity chromatography from BL21bacteria transformed with plasmidpET-16b-hPMS1(aa335–643)). Purified hMutLα (42 μg), hMutLβ (42 μg), or hMLH1 (25 μg) were mixed with 50 μg of the size marker mixture (β-amylase (200 kDa, s20,w = 8.95), yeast ADH (150 kDa, s20,w = 7.61), albumin (66 kDa, s20,w = 4.4); Sigma), diluted with HEN buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH = 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) to 350 μl, and loaded onto 10-ml, 10–30% sucrose gradients in HEN buffer and centrifuged (34,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 h in a Sorvall TH-641 rotor). 40 fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes. 20 μl of each fraction were analyzed on Coomassie Blue-stained, denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The gel filtration experiments were performed at 4 °C on a Superose 6 FPLC column (28 cm × 1.5 cm2, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with HE buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and calibrated with bovine thyroglobulin (Rs = 85.8 Å), apoferritin (Rs = 67.3 Å), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Rs = 52.2 Å), and bovine serum albumin (Rs = 36.1 Å). 50 μg of the purified heterodimers and 37 μg of purified hMLH1 were applied onto the column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. 150-μl fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses carrying cDNA inserts encoding hMLH1, hPMS1, or hPMS2. Interestingly, following infection with the individual viruses, only hMLH1 could be obtained in reasonable amounts (Fig. 1), while hPMS1 and hPMS2 were found mostly in the insoluble fraction (data not shown). We argued that this could be due to incorrect folding of the PMS proteins in the absence of their cognate partner, similar to the case of the MutS homologues (13Palombo F. Iaccarino I. Nakajima E. Ikejima M. Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The Sf9 cultures were therefore co-infected with all the possible combinations of the three baculovirus constructs. Co-infection of hPMS2 and hMLH1 vectors resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of soluble hPMS2 (Fig. 1), which is consistent with the hypothesis that co-expression of the two subunits of hMutLα ensures proper folding of the polypeptides. Similarly, the amount of hPMS1 was considerably increased in experiments where the latter expression vector was co-infected together with the hMLH1 baculovirus construct (Fig. 1). These results strongly implied that hMLH1 might form a heterodimer also with hPMS1. In contrast, no noticeable increase in protein expression was apparent following co-infection of the Sf9 cells with the hPMS1 and hPMS2 vectors, even though Northern blot analysis of the infected cells showed that the respective mRNAs were at least as abundant as seen in the hMLH1·hPMS1 and hMLH1· hPMS2 co-infections described above (data not shown). This implies that the low expression of the hPMS1 and hPMS2 proteins was associated most likely with post-translational processes such as protein misfolding and degradation. The recombinant hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1 proteins migrated through denaturing polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) with apparent molecular sizes of 86, 115, and 116 kDa, respectively. Similar migration was observed for the two former proteins in extracts of human cell lines (Refs. 15Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholarand 33Hampson R. Humbert O. Macpherson P. Aquilina G. Karran P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28596-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 5). Correlation with the predicted molecular masses of these polypeptides (hMLH1 = 84.5 kDa, hPMS2 = 95.8 kDa, and hPMS1 = 105.8 kDa) suggests that both hPMS2 and hPMS1 might be post-translationally modified or that they migrate aberrantly through polyacrylamide gels. The molecular sizes of the three MutL homologues estimated from SDS-PAGE were confirmed by Western blotting experiments (Fig. 1, lower panels). It should be pointed out that, in these blots, the recombinant hMLH1 often appears as a doublet. Since only a single band due to hMLH1 was observed in cell extracts from several different cell lines and since recombinant hMLH1 expressed with a His6 tag at the amino terminus could be purified as a single protein (data not shown), it would appear that the translation of hMLH1 mRNA generated from our baculovirus vector initiated at two separate, albeit closely situated sites. The purification of the human MutL homologues was achieved by a two-step procedure. First, the total extract was loaded at a low salt concentration (110 mm NaCl) on a HiTrap heparin FPLC column. hMLH1 could be eluted from this column at a salt concentration of ∼310 mm. In contrast, when cell extracts obtained following hMLH1·hPMS2 and hMLH1·hPMS1 co-infections were loaded, hMLH1 was retained on the column somewhat longer, eluting together with the respective PMS homologue at ∼420 mm (hMLH1·hPMS2) or ∼366 mm (hMLH1·hPMS1) salt. The peak fractions were pooled, diluted to 120 mm salt, and applied onto a Resource Q column. From this column the protein pairs eluted as single peaks. The purity of the recombinant proteins was >98%, as judged from a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The stoichiometric ratio of the two proteins in the purified complexes appeared to be 1:1. Taken together, the above results provide further evidence that hMLH1 interacts with both hPMS2 and hPMS1 to form the heterodimers hMutLα and hMutLβ, respectively. In order to determine the oligomeric state of the complexes, the purified proteins were subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 6 column. While hMLH1 eluted as a monomer (calculatedMhMLH1 = 85 kDa), the peaks of hMutLα and hMutLβ were clearly shifted toward higher molecular mass (Fig.3). The retention of the complexes suggested that they were eluting as heterotetramers, or that they migrated faster through the matrix because of their non-globular shape. A similar atypical chromatographic behavior was observed for the H6 (HCT116) complementing activity (15Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), as well as for the bacterial MutL protein (34Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

The sedimentation coefficients (s20,w) of the purified proteins were determined by band sedimentation on sucrose density gradients.

https://openalex.org/W2030102642,"Caveolin-1 is a principal component of caveolae membranes in vivo. Caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression are down-regulated in NIH 3T3 cells in response to transformation by activated oncogenes, such as H-Ras(G12V) and v-Abl. The mechanisms governing this down-regulation event remain unknown. Here, we show that caveolin-1 gene expression is directly regulated by activation of the Ras-p42/44 MAP kinase cascade. Down regulation of caveolin-1 protein expression by Ras is independent of (i) the type of activating mutation (G12V versus Q61L) and (ii) the form of activated Ras transfected (H-Ras versus K-Ras versus N-Ras). Treatment of Ras or Raf-transformed NIH 3T3 cells with a well characterized MEK inhibitor (PD 98059) restores caveolin-1 protein expression. In contrast, treatment of v-Src and v-Abl transformed NIH 3T3 cells with PD 98059 does not restore caveolin-1 expression. Thus, there must be at least two pathways for down-regulating caveolin-1 expression: one that is p42/44 MAP kinase-dependent and another that is p42/44 MAP kinase-independent. We focused our efforts on the p42/44 MAP kinase-dependent pathway. The activity of a panel of caveolin-1 promoter constructs was evaluated using transient expression in H-Ras(G12V) transformed NIH 3T3 cells. We show that caveolin-1 promoter activity is up-regulated approximately 5-fold by inhibition of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays we provide evidence that the caveolin-1 promoter (from -156 to -561) is differentially bound by transcription factors in normal and H-Ras(G12V)-transformed cells. We also show that activation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is sufficient to down-regulate caveolin-1 protein expression and promoter activity. Thus, we have identified two signaling pathways (Ras-p42/44 MAP kinase and PKA) that transcriptionally down-regulate caveolin-1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2088375664,"Intracellular signaling induced by the coagulation factors (F) VIIa and Xa is poorly understood. We report here studies on these processes in a human keratinocyte line (HaCaT), which is a constitutive producer of tissue factor (TF) and responds to both FVIIa and FXa with elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1/2, p38MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and up-regulation of transcription of the early growth response gene-1 (egr-1). Using egr-1 as end point, we observed with both agonists that phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase/Erk pathway were mediators of the responses. The responses to FVIIa were TF-dependent and up-regulation of egr-1 mRNA did not require presence of the TF cytoplasmic domain. Antibodies to EPR-1 and factor V had no effect on the response to FXa. We have provided evidence that TF is not the sole component of the FVIIa receptor. The requirement for proteolytic activity of both FVIIa and FXa suggests that protease-activated receptors may be involved. We now report evidence suggesting that protease-activated receptor 2 or a close homologue may be a necessary but not sufficient component of this particular signal transduction pathway. The up-regulation of egr-1 describes one way by which the initiation of blood coagulation may influence gene transcription. The ability of these coagulation proteases to induce intracellular signals at concentrations at or below the plasma concentrations of their zymogen precursors suggests that these processes may occur also in vivo.

The vitamin K-dependent serine protease clotting factors have traditionally been thought to exert their effects in the fluid phase of the body fluids or at the surface of cells in contact with such fluids. Increasing evidence indicates that activation of these clotting factors also elicits numerous and profound alterations in the biology of the cells on whose surface the activation takes place or where the activated factor is bound.

Factor V (FV), the cellular cofactor for FXa in formation of the prothrombinase complex (2Camerer E. Kolsto A.B. Prydz H. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 1-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), has to our knowledge not been shown to participate in any of these events. Both FVIIa and FXa must be proteolytically active to induce the signaling process(es) (12Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29034-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the case of FVIIa, TF serves as its binding receptor but does not undergo any proteolytic cleavage in the process. This suggests that another molecule is the substrate for cleavage by the indispensable protease activity of FVIIa, and that this cleavage may trigger the intracellular signaling. The presence of TF on the cell surface is, however, an absolute requirement for the FVIIa induced intracellular changes to occur. Our hypothesis is thus that TF efficiently binds FVII/FVIIa present in plasma and other body fluids, and presents it in activated form to another transmembrane protein, which is then cleaved to trigger the signaling process(es). Thrombin has long been known as a powerful cellular activator (19Coughlin S.R. Atheroscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Grand R.J. Turnell A.S.

Several of its effects were recently shown to be mediated through proteolytic activation of one or more of its receptors. All three presently known (PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4) are members of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) family (21Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.C.

Using a human keratinocyte line, we have addressed questions concerning the signaling pathway(s) of FVIIa and Xa and some of their cellular consequences, using altered expression of the egr-1 gene (25Khachigian L.M. Collins T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) as the end point. This zinc finger transcription factor (Krox-24, NGFI-A, and ZIF/268 are synonyms) showed rapid and transient induction in response to FVIIa and FXa. Trypsin, hirudin, ATP, bradykinin, actinomycin D, and Hepes were obtained from Sigma; U73122 and U73343 were from BIOMOL (PA); pertussis toxin (PTX), PD98059, and SB203580 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); keratinocyte SFM with additives, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), trypsin-EDTA, l-glutamine, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from Life Technologies, Inc.

Hepes-buffered salt solution (HBSS) consisted of (mm): NaCl, 136; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 1.2; Bacto-dextrose, 11; Hepes 10; pH 7.35. The constitutively TF-expressing keratinocyte line HaCaT (26Boukamp P. Petrusevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fuseing N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. U. Birk Jensen, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark. HaCaT cells were cultured in keratinocyte-SFM supplemented with recombinant epidermal growth factor (0.5 ng/ml) and bovine pituitary extract (25 μg/ml). After cell detachment during culture, trypsin was inactivated with FCS, which was subsequently removed by repeated washes in keratinocyte SFM. Prior to Northern and Western experiments starvation (2 h prior to agonist addition) and stimulation was done in DMEM without additives. The keratinocyte SFM was low in calcium (<0.1 mm) in order to keep the cells in an undifferentiated state. The change to DMEM prior to stimulation brought the calcium levels up to ∼1.8 mm. This change was done to facilitate Ca2+-dependent binding of the clotting factors to TF and possibly other surface receptors, and to allow calcium influx. Great care was taken to establish correct controls for the possible effects of this shift-up. The human kidney epithelial line HK-2 (ATCC) was cultured as described for the HaCaT cells. CHO cells expressing PAR2 were a kind gift from Johan Sundelin (University of Lund, Lund, Sweden) (27Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.-K. Strömbeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These were cultured in α-minimal essential medium without nucleosides, supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, l-glutamine, antibiotics, and methotrexate (20 nm). COS-1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% inactivated FCS,l-glutamine, and antibiotics. COS-1 cells were transfected with the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3, or pcDNA3 containing constructs coding for wild type (hTF1–263) or truncated (hTF1–245) human tissue factor cDNA. These constructs have been described in detail previously (28Camerer E. Pringle S. Skartlien A.H. Wiiger M. Prydz K. Kolstø A.-B. Prydz H. Blood. 1996; 88: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated construct was identical to wild type except that the sequence coding for the last 18 C-terminal amino acids had been deleted. The PAR2-expressing CHO-DG44 cells were transfected with hTF1–263 only. Transfection was done by standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedures with glycerol shock. Cells with stably integrated constructs were selected with 500 μg/ml G418. TF expression was confirmed by total activity measurement in cell homogenates (28Camerer E. Pringle S. Skartlien A.H. Wiiger M. Prydz K. Kolstø A.-B. Prydz H. Blood. 1996; 88: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surface TF activity was determined by a FXa chromogenic substrate assay (28Camerer E. Pringle S. Skartlien A.H. Wiiger M. Prydz K. Kolstø A.-B. Prydz H. Blood. 1996; 88: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was carried out on ethanol-fixed cells with htf1 and propidium iodide costaining (28Camerer E. Pringle S. Skartlien A.H. Wiiger M. Prydz K. Kolstø A.-B. Prydz H. Blood. 1996; 88: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments medium was always changed to DMEM without additives for 2 h prior to addition of agonist to the cells. Unless otherwise stated, pretreatment with inhibitor or vehicle was done in this 2-h period. Agonist or vehicle was made up to 20% of the final volume, preheated to 37 °C, and added gently to the cells. Cells were harvested by washing in ice-cold PBS, then scraped off into 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm LiCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% LiDS, 5 mmdithiothreitol) and sheared with a 21-gauge syringe. For isolation of mRNA, oligo(dT)-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were run on agarose/formaldehyde gels in MOPS buffer and blotted. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in ExpressHybTM solution from CLONTECH. Complete cDNAs were used to generate probes for egr-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and TF as described by Feinberg and Vogelstein (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar, 30Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probe used to detect the TF cytoplasmic domain had the sequence 5′-GTGGGGAGTTCTCCTTCCAGCTCTGCCCCACTCCTGCC-3′. For reprobing, the filters were stripped in 0.5% SDS at 100 °C for 5–10 min. Quantitation was done using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were washed as for mRNA isolation, and lysed directly in a reducing SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA, denatured for 5 min at 100 °C and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), and the membranes blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween) with 5% BSA. Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAPK or anti-MAPK antibodies (anti-Erk 1/2, anti-p38MAPK, and anti-JNK, 1/1000, overnight) followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1/1000, 1 h) was done at 4 °C. After repeated washes with Tris-buffered saline with Tween, the membranes were developed with Vistra ECF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Identical amounts of the same extracts were run in parallel for immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody and anti-MAPK antibody. Measurement of [Ca2+]c in single cells was done as described previously (1Røttingen J.-A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4650-4660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with a solution of 5 μm fura-2, 0.25% Me2SO and 0.005% Pluronic F-127 in HBSS. Pretreatments were within the 45-min fura-2 loading period, or 16–20 h prior to this in the case of PTX. After fura-2 loading, the cells were washed twice and incubated with 400 μl of HBSS. Additions to the cell cultures were done by injection of 100 μl into the well. Injection of the agonist vehicle was used in the control cultures. The Ca2+imaging and registration software has been developed in our laboratory (31Røtnes J.S. Iversen J.-G. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was calculated using the equation [Ca2+] = Kd β (R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R) (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Calibrations were done as described previously (33Røtnes J.S Røttingen J.-A. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 467-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out at 37 °C. The maximum and average Ca2+ increases were calculated as the difference between the values after application of agonist and the average Ca2+ levels before. The average reflects the integral of the Ca2+ response. Cells with spontaneous responses before addition of agonist (ranging from 0 to 13% in different experiments) were excluded by not considering cells that during the first 60 s of observation had either a higher absolute Ca2+ level than 400 nm or a difference of more than 75 nm between the maximal and minimal Ca2+ levels. All other cells, both responders and non-responders, were included in the calculations of the Ca2+ signals. The data are presented as means and their standard error (S.E.). Statistical significance was tested using a general mixed model analysis of variance (3V module BMDP). After subtraction of average background, intensity data obtained from the PhosphorImager for egr-1 mRNA were normalized to GAPDH mRNA intensities for all samples. -Fold induction of egr-1 mRNA was determined by setting to one the relative intensity (RI) in cells treated with vehicle only. Percentage of inhibition was calculated by the following formula: percentage of inhibition = 100 − 100 × ((RI of the given sample − RI of vehicle control)/(RI of normal agonist response − RI of vehicle control). Thus, a stimulatory effect will appear as a “negative inhibition,” and a reduction below basal levels of egr-1 will appear as a greater than 100% inhibition. Data are presented as means and their standard error (S.E.). Significance was tested using a two-tailed Student'st test with Welch's correction. A single asterisk (*) indicates a p value below 0.05, whereas a double (**) indicates a p value below 0.01. NS, not significant. Intensity data obtained from the PhosphorImager for the phosphorylated form of MAPKs were normalized to total MAPK intensities from identical amounts of the same samples run and blotted in parallel. -Fold increase in phospho-MAPK was determined by setting the RI in vehicle-treated cells to 1. Statistical analysis was as for egr-1 mRNA. We have previously reported that FVIIa triggers Ca2+ responses in MDCK cells, in COS-1 cells transfected to express TF, in J82 cells and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (1Røttingen J.-A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4650-4660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and that FXa induced responses similar to FVIIa in MDCK cells (12Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29034-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The signals varied between cell types and between individual cells within a population (1Røttingen J.-A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29034-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The response rate in MDCK was close to 100% (1Røttingen J.-A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.-G.

The spontaneously immortalized, non-tumorigenic keratinocyte human cell line (HaCaT) is a high level constitutive producer of TF. HaCaT cells responded with increased Ca2+ levels to both FVIIa and FXa, as well as to thrombin and SLIGRL, showing that this line also expresses PAR2 and thrombin receptors (Fig.1, panel A). FVIIa and FXa both triggered a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]c (Fig. 1, panel B) in almost all cells tested. Their response pattern differed from that of MDCK cells (12Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29034-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In HaCaT cells the Ca2+ oscillations were less prominent and non-synchronous and were replaced by a continuous elevation of [Ca2+]c, generally failing to reach baseline during the initial minutes of response. The responses lasted approximately as long as the MDCK cell responses (12Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29034-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), although this has not been explored in detail. If not otherwise stated, the experiments reported have been carried out with the HaCaT cell line. To facilitate dissection of the receptor/signaling system(s) engaged by FVIIa and FXa, we looked for a rapidly expressed, abundant mRNA regulated by these factors. The early growth response gene egr-1 showed rapid (30–60 min), transient (back to basal level within 2 h) and pronounced (10-fold) up-regulation of mRNA levels in response to FVIIa and FXa, as well as to SLIGRL and thrombin (Fig.2). Inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) added 5 min prior to stimulation abolished the induction of egr-1 by both proteases (p< 0.001; data not shown). The increase in egr-1 mRNA levels is thus highly likely to be a result of induced transcription rather than mRNA stabilization. This is the first demonstration of a transcription factor induced by these two clotting factors. Both [Ca2+]c and egr-1 mRNA responses were concentration-dependent. EC50values were an order of magnitude lower for the egr-1mRNA response than for the calcium response (3 and 54 nm, respectively for FVIIa; 13 and 130 nm, respectively, for FXa) (Fig. 3). Both proteases gave a maximum egr-1 response at concentrations below the plasma concentrations of the corresponding zymogen precursor (10 nm for FVII and 178 nm for FX) (34Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ responses in MDCK cells to FVIIa and FXa were previously shown to be specific (i.e. not caused by contaminants in the agonist preparations) and to require their intact proteolytic activity (12Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29034-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These experiments were repeated and expanded to ascertain that the Ca2+ and egr-1 mRNA responses seen in the HaCaT cells were specifically caused by the same factors in their activated state. Active site-inhibited FVIIa (FVIIai) did not induce responses in [Ca2+]c (data not shown) or egr-1 mRNA (Fig.4, panel A; TableI). A marked inhibition of bothegr-1 up-regulation and Ca2+ increase was seen when pretreating the cells with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to TF (htf1) (Fig. 4, panels A and B; Table I). This excluded involvement of endotoxin and other contaminants, as well as demonstrating also in the HaCaT cell line the absolute requirement for TF and for proteolytic activity of the agonists. Pretreatment of the cells with FVIIai inhibited the effect of FVIIa. This inhibition was to a large extent reversible when cell"

It has been reported that overexpression of thecdk inhibitor p27Kip1 results in the differentiation of the myelomonocytic U937 cell line and that this gene is the target of vitamin D3. To identify the sequences required for the positive regulation of p27Kip1transcription by vitamin D3, a 3.6-kilobase 5′-flanking region of the human p27Kip1 gene was examined by transiently transfecting luciferase reporter constructs into U937 cells. The transcriptional activity of this construct was activated by vitamin D3. Deletion and mutational analysis revealed that both a GGGCGG sequence (−545/−539) and a CCAAT sequence (−525/−520) were necessary to induce p27Kip1 gene expression. Importantly, the region containing both of these elements conferred positive responsiveness to vitamin D3 to a heterologous promoter. Gel shift assays showed that Sp1 binds to the GGGCGG sequence and that NF-Y binds to the CCAAT sequence. Consistent with the roles of these transcription factors, treatment with vitamin D3stimulated the DNA binding activities of these factors to each element and induced the change of one NF-Y subunit. We conclude that vitamin D3 stimulates transcription of the p27Kip1 gene by a novel mechanism involving Sp1 and NF-Y, but not the vitamin D receptor, during the early stages of U937 cell differentiation.

CTF, CCAAT box binding transcriptional factor CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 is not only a major regulator of mineral homeostasis but also a potent modulator of differentiation in several types of cells including monoblastic cells and osteoblasts (1Minghetti P.P. Norman A.W. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3043-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that the cdk inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 act as molecular switches that facilitate the vitamin D3-induced differentiation of the U937 myeloid leukemic cell line. These genes are regulated both at the transcriptional level and the post-transcriptional level by vitamin D3 during the early stages of this process (2Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Vitamin D3 transduces its signal to the nucleus directly, mainly through a regulatable DNA-binding transcription factor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR)1 (3Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar), and ligand-inducible effects on differentiation are initiated through the direct activation of target genes by VDR. In fact, vitamin D3 induces p21Cip1 transcription in a VDR-dependent manner through a functional vitamin D response element (VDRE) in its promoter (2Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of p27Kip1 by vitamin D3, we previously characterized the human p27Kip1 gene promoter (4Minami S. Ohtani-Fujita N. Igata E. Tamaki T. Sakai T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We found no canonical VDRE (5′-RGKTCANNNRGKTCA-3′) within a 3.6-kilobase 5′-flanking region upstream of the translation start site. This implies that p27Kip1 is regulated by mechanisms that are different from those of other vitamin D3 target genes, such as p21Cip1 (2Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), c-fos (5Schrader M. Kahlen J.P. Carlberg C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and osteocalcin (6Demay M.B. Gerardi J.M. DeLuca H.F. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown the involvement of a VDR-independent mechanism in the regulation of vitamin D3-induced cell differentiation. For instance, monocyte differentiation is mediated by vitamin D3 without requiring binding to VDR (7Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15962-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and keratinocyte differentiation-related genes are stimulated by vitamin D3 without the presence of VDRE (8Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clarification of the regulatory mechanisms of p27Kip1transcription is crucial for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D3 action and for the understanding of the early processes during monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Although the post-transcriptional regulation of p27Kip1 has been studied intensively (9Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 10Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 11Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the p27Kip1 gene.In this study, we have analyzed the p27Kip1 promoter in order to identify elements required for vitamin D3-induced up-regulation of transcription, which might reveal the early and novel mechanism of differentiation induction by vitamin D3.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed the vitamin D3-induced transcription of p27Kip1 as a model to understand a possible novel pathway of vitamin D3 action which does not directly involve VDR/VDRE and the mechanism of U937 differentiation. From transient transfection studies, we conclude that Sp1 and NF-Y mediate the vitamin D3-induced transcription via elements that are closely located adjacent to each other in the promoter region of p27Kip1. Importantly, the 44-bp element in the p27Kip1 promoter that carries Sp1 and NF-Y binding sites is sufficient for the response to vitamin D3, and both elements are required for this response. We believe that this is the first report that explains the molecular mechanism of vitamin D3-induced transcription that does not directly require VDR, although vitamin D3-dependent transcriptional repression that does not require VDR has been reported previously (28Ezura Y. Tournay O. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29865-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Alroy I. Towers T.L. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5789-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).The next question to be solved was how vitamin D3 activated the p27Kip1 gene expression via Sp1 and NF-Y. Binding activities of Sp1 and NF-Y to each element in the p27Kip1promoter were stimulated significantly after vitamin D3treatment. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis showed that Sp1 increased slightly, and one subunit of NF-Y changed to a low molecular weight form prior to the accumulation of p27Kip1 mRNA. These findings raise the hypothesis that post-translational modification of Sp1 and differential splicing of NF-YA induced by vitamin D3 lead to the activation of p27Kip1transcription through enhanced binding of these factors to regulatory elements in the p27Kip1 promoter. It has been shown that Sp1 can mediate responses to several inducers of myeloid differentiation, and several myeloid promoters are dependent on a functional Sp1 site (30Chen H.M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hauses M. Tonjes R.R. Grez M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11425-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF-Y also can mediate responses to several inducers of myeloid differentiation and macrophage maturation (15Orita T. Shimozaki K. Murakami H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23216-23223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Marziali G. Perrotti E. Ilari R. Testa U. Coccia E.M.

Blood. 1999; 93: 519-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), However, little is known about the mechanism of how NF-Y mediates these responses. We found that the form of NF-YA changes after differentiation induced by vitamin D3. Existence of two isoforms of NF-YA, which result from differential splicing, has been reported in human and mouse (16Li X.Y. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ishimaru F. Mari B. Shipp M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4136-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional difference between the two isoforms is not clear. However, there is a possibility that the two forms have different biological activities since two forms are expressed in various types of cells with a strong tissue-specific bias (16Li X.Y. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ishimaru F. Mari B. Shipp M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4136-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that a switch in isoform resulting in the decrease of high molecular weight form of NF-YA protein may be involved in the transcriptional activation of p27Kip1 by vitamin D3.Another question to be solved is why both Sp1 and NF-Y are required for the vitamin D3-induced transcription of p27Kip1. The possible mechanism is the involvement of histone acetyltransferases, known as transcriptional cofactors including p300, GCN5, and P/CAF (35Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that NF-Y interacts with p300 in vivo, and NF-Y establishes a pre-set promoter architecture that can facilitate transcription within chromatin by recruiting p300 protein (36Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similarly, NF-Y has been shown to be associated with GCN5 and P/CAF in vitro, and GCN5 activates NF-Y-dependent transcription in vivo (37Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We reported previously that histone deacetylase inhibitors activate the p21Cip1 gene promoter through Sp1 sites that can interact with Sp1 and Sp3 (18Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 241: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that NF-Y activates p27Kip1 transcription through modification of Sp1 sites by recruiting histone acetyltransferases.In this study, we found a novel pathway to mediate vitamin D3 action which does not directly involve VDR. We then searched for the genes that carry Sp1 and CCAAT sequence in their promoter regions. We found that both elements exist in the promoter region of VDR, whose transcription is also up-regulated by vitamin D3 (39Jehan F. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10138-10143Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Kamei Y. Kawada T. Kazuki R. Ono T. Kato S. Sugimoto E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, no VDRE exists in the promoter region of the VDR gene. This suggests that the regulatory mechanism we found might be more generally applicable to other genes that are regulated by vitamin D3.In U937 cell differentiation induced by vitamin D3, p21Cip1 acts as a molecular switch to trigger U937 cell differentiation, and its transcription is up-regulated along with p27Kip1 (2Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). In this experimental system, transcription of the p21Cip1 gene is activated during the initial processes by VDR/VDRE. The present study shows that p27Kip1 is activated at a slightly later stage by Sp1 and NF-Y in a cooperative manner. Such phased regulation of molecular switches by different transcriptional regulatory mechanisms will be important for the commitment event between growth and differentiation during development and cellular differentiation. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 is not only a major regulator of mineral homeostasis but also a potent modulator of differentiation in several types of cells including monoblastic cells and osteoblasts (1Minghetti P.P.

DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed the vitamin D3-induced transcription of p27Kip1 as a model to understand a possible novel pathway of vitamin D3 action which does not directly involve VDR/VDRE and the mechanism of U937 differentiation. From transient transfection studies, we conclude that Sp1 and NF-Y mediate the vitamin D3-induced transcription via elements that are closely located adjacent to each other in the promoter region of p27Kip1. Importantly, the 44-bp element in the p27Kip1 promoter that carries Sp1 and NF-Y binding sites is sufficient for the response to vitamin D3, and both elements are required for this response. We believe that this is the first report that explains the molecular mechanism of vitamin D3-induced transcription that does not directly require VDR, although vitamin D3-dependent transcriptional repression that does not require VDR has been reported previously (28Ezura Y. Tournay O. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29865-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Alroy I. Towers T.L. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5789-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).The next question to be solved was how vitamin D3 activated the p27Kip1 gene expression via Sp1 and NF-Y. Binding activities of Sp1 and NF-Y to each element in the p27Kip1promoter were stimulated significantly after vitamin D3treatment. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis showed that Sp1 increased slightly, and one subunit of NF-Y changed to a low molecular weight form prior to the accumulation of p27Kip1 mRNA. These findings raise the hypothesis that post-translational modification of Sp1 and differential splicing of NF-YA induced by vitamin D3 lead to the activation of p27Kip1transcription through enhanced binding of these factors to regulatory elements in the p27Kip1 promoter. It has been shown that Sp1 can mediate responses to several inducers of myeloid differentiation, and several myeloid promoters are dependent on a functional Sp1 site (30Chen H.M. Pahl H.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11425-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF-Y also can mediate responses to several inducers of myeloid differentiation and macrophage maturation (15Orita T. Shimozaki K. Murakami H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23216-23223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Marziali G. Perrotti E. Ilari R. Testa U. Coccia E.M.

Blood. 1999; 93: 519-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), However, little is known about the mechanism of how NF-Y mediates these responses. We found that the form of NF-YA changes after differentiation induced by vitamin D3. Existence of two isoforms of NF-YA, which result from differential splicing, has been reported in human and mouse (16Li X.Y. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ishimaru F. Mari B. Shipp M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4136-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional difference between the two isoforms is not clear. However, there is a possibility that the two forms have different biological activities since two forms are expressed in various types of cells with a strong tissue-specific bias (16Li X.Y. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ishimaru F. Mari B. Shipp M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4136-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that a switch in isoform resulting in the decrease of high molecular weight form of NF-YA protein may be involved in the transcriptional activation of p27Kip1 by vitamin D3.Another question to be solved is why both Sp1 and NF-Y are required for the vitamin D3-induced transcription of p27Kip1. The possible mechanism is the involvement of histone acetyltransferases, known as transcriptional cofactors including p300, GCN5, and P/CAF (35Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that NF-Y interacts with p300 in vivo, and NF-Y establishes a pre-set promoter architecture that can facilitate transcription within chromatin by recruiting p300 protein (36Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similarly, NF-Y has been shown to be associated with GCN5 and P/CAF in vitro, and GCN5 activates NF-Y-dependent transcription in vivo (37Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We reported previously that histone deacetylase inhibitors activate the p21Cip1 gene promoter through Sp1 sites that can interact with Sp1 and Sp3 (18Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 241: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that NF-Y activates p27Kip1 transcription through modification of Sp1 sites by recruiting histone acetyltransferases.In this study, we found a novel pathway to mediate vitamin D3 action which does not directly involve VDR. We then searched for the genes that carry Sp1 and CCAAT sequence in their promoter regions. We found that both elements exist in the promoter region of VDR, whose transcription is also up-regulated by vitamin D3 (39Jehan F. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10138-10143Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Kamei Y. Kawada T. Kazuki R. Ono T. Kato S. Sugimoto E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, no VDRE exists in the promoter region of the VDR gene. This suggests that the regulatory mechanism we found might be more generally applicable to other genes that are regulated by vitamin D3.In U937 cell differentiation induced by vitamin D3, p21Cip1 acts as a molecular switch to trigger U937 cell differentiation, and its transcription is up-regulated along with p27Kip1 (2Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). In this experimental system, transcription of the p21Cip1 gene is activated during the initial processes by VDR/VDRE. The present study shows that p27Kip1 is activated at a slightly later stage by Sp1 and NF-Y in a cooperative manner. Such phased regulation of molecular switches by different transcriptional regulatory mechanisms will be important for the commitment event between growth and differentiation during development and cellular differentiation. In this study, we analyzed the vitamin D3-induced transcription of p27Kip1 as a model to understand a possible novel pathway of vitamin D3 action which does not directly involve VDR/VDRE and the mechanism of U937 differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2093115501,"Modification of the amino terminus of regulated on activated normal T-cell expressed (RANTES) has been shown to have a significant effect on biological activity and produces proteins with antagonist properties. Two amino-terminally modified RANTES proteins, Met-RANTES and aminooxypentane-RANTES (AOP-RANTES), exhibit differential inhibitory properties on both monocyte and eosinophil chemotaxis. We have investigated their binding properties as well as their ability to activate the RANTES receptors CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 in cell lines overexpressing these receptors. We show that Met-RANTES has weak activity in eliciting a calcium response in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, whereas AOP-RANTES has full agonist activity on CCR5 but is less effective on CCR3 and CCR1. Their ability to induce chemotaxis of the murine pre-B lymphoma cell line, L1.2, transfected with the same receptors, consolidates these results. Monocytes have detectable mRNA for CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5, and they respond to the ligands for these receptors in chemotaxis but not always in calcium mobilization. AOP-RANTES does not induce calcium mobilization in circulating monocytes but is able to do so as these cells acquire the macrophage phenotype, which coincides with a concomitant up-regulation of CCR5. We have also tested the ability of both modified proteins to induce chemotaxis of freshly isolated monocytes and eosinophils. Cells from most donors do not respond, but occasionally cells from a particular donor do respond, particularly to AOP-RANTES. We therefore hypothesize that the occasional activity of AOP-RANTES to induce leukocyte chemotaxis is due to donor to donor variation of receptor expression.

Members of both the α- and β-subclasses of chemokines may be expressed constitutively and have been shown to be responsible for leukocyte homing, whereas many others are inducible and have been shown to be up-regulated in inflammatory conditions, both in human disease as well as animal models of inflammation. Inflammatory chemokines include members of the MCP1 and MIP families, as well as the closely related proteins, RANTES and eotaxin. Chemokines mediate their biological effects through seven transmembrane-spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors, which also serve as the coreceptor with CD4 for HIV-1 infection. Cellular migration is a consequence of several signaling events, and many intracellular changes such as actin polymerization, shape change, and receptor polarization are implicated (4Nieto M. Frade J.M. Sancho D. Mellado M. Martinez A.C. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Many investigations have shown the importance of the amino-terminal region of the chemokine proteins for receptor activation via G-protein-coupled signal transduction. Several members of the CXC family have a three-residue motif, ELR (Glu-Leu-Arg), preceding the first two cysteines that is essential for receptor binding and for neutrophil chemotactic activity. Truncation of the first 5 residues, so that the arginine preceding the CXC motif of interleukin-8 is retained, produces a receptor antagonist (5Moser B. Dewald B. Barella L. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7125-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although activity of this antagonist has not been reported in vivo. Similarly modification of the amino-terminal region in several CC chemokines produces proteins with antagonistic properties. Deletion of the first 8 residues of RANTES results in a protein that is unable to mobilize calcium or to induce chemotaxis and is able to antagonize the response of the ligands that bind to RANTES receptors (6Gong J.H.

A similar truncation of MCP-1 also produces a protein antagonist (7Gong J.H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Rollins B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4851-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Extension of the amino-terminal region of RANTES, by the retention of the initiating methionine residue when the recombinant protein is produced in Escherichia coli, produces a nanomolar potent antagonist of monocyte migration, Met-RANTES (9Proudfoot A.E.I.

Similarly the chemical coupling of a five-carbon alkyl chain to the oxidized amino-terminal serine results in AOP-RANTES which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 infection of CCR5-using strains (10Simmons G.

Ligand binding triggers phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of the receptor by serine/threonine kinases which leads to receptor endocytosis. Chemokine receptor endocytosis is independent of G-protein coupling (15Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana S.F. J. Exp.

Down-regulation from the cell surface of chemokine receptors that function as coreceptors for HIV infection has been proposed to be a key mechanism for the inhibitory effects of these chemokines on HIV-1 cell entry (15Amara A.

We have further investigated the abilities of the modified chemokines Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES to activate receptors via the G-protein-coupled pathways both in cell lines overexpressing recombinant receptors as well in primary leukocytes. Our results show that the ability of Met-RANTES or AOP-RANTES to elicit functional responses in eosinophils is donor-dependent and in monocytes is dependent on their differentiation into the macrophage phenotype. We therefore investigated their abilities to induce chemotaxis on cell lines transfected with each of the known RANTES receptors. In these systems AOP-RANTES is a full agonist for activation of CCR5-bearing cells but is weaker in activating CCR1 and CCR3. Met-RANTES has only weak activity on all three RANTES receptors.

MIP-1β, MCP-3, and eotaxin were purchased from PeproTech. CHO stably transfected cells with CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 were produced as described (19Coulin F. Power C.A. Alouani S. Peitsch M.C. Schroeder J.M. Moshizuki M. Clark-Lewis I. Wells T.N.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 L1.2 cell transfectants were generated as described previously (20Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The affinities of Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES for CCR1 and CCR3 was determined by a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) using membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing the appropriate CC chemokine receptor as described (19Coulin F. Power C.A. Alouani S. Peitsch M.C. Schroeder J.M. Moshizuki M. Clark-Lewis I. Wells T.N.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of membrane were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-MIP-1α for CCR1 and 0.1 nm125I-MCP-3 for CCR3 and increasing concentrations of the unlabeled chemokine upon agitation for 4 h at room temperature. mRNA for β-chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 in freshly isolated monocytes and eosinophils was detected by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from eosinophils and monocytes using TrizolTM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed on 1 μg of RNA using an oligo(dT) primer with the SuperscriptTM preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). One-twentieth of the reverse transcriptase reaction mixture was then subjected to 35 cycles of PCR (2 min at 94 °C; 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C) using AmplitaqTM(Perkin-Elmer) in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 pmol of sense and antisense primer pairs for the CC chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5, and GAPDH as a control for the quality of the cDNA used in each PCR reaction, in an MJ Research DNA engine. Primers were designed to amplify the full coding sequence (∼1.1 kb), based on the receptor sequences obtained from the GenBankTMdata base. The predicted size of the GAPDH product was 1 kb. In addition, control PCR reactions were performed with each primer pair on RNA samples that had been incubated in the absence of reverse transcriptase (results not shown). The identity of PCR products migrating at the predicted size was verified following gel purification using a Wizard PCR preps kit (Promega), by direct sequencing using the same primers as for the PCR reaction, in an ABI 377 DNA sequencer. Cell surface expression of CCR5 was determined by flow cytometry using the monoclonal anti-CCR5 antibody MC-1 as described (17Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E.I. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The release of intracellular calcium stores was carried out as described previously (21Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J.

Monocyte chemotaxis was carried out using the micro-Boyden chamber assay essentially as described (21Lusti-Narasimhan M. Power C.A. Allet B. Alouani S. Bacon K.B. Mermod J.-J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2716-2721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Monocytes were purified from buffy coats using the following isolation procedure: 100 ml of buffy coat solution was diluted with 100 ml of PBS, layered on Ficoll, and centrifuged at 600 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The cells forming the interface were collected, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended at a concentration of 40–100 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. They were further purified from the lymphocyte fraction by adding 106 sheep red blood cells/ml, rosetted overnight at 4 °C, and separated by a second Ficoll gradient centrifugation at 900 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The monocytes were washed in PBS and resuspended at 2.5 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium. The purity was measured by forward and side scatter by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and was found to be 40–80% depending on the donor. Eosinophil chemotaxis was carried out as described previously (22Schroder J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 288: 266-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Eosinophils were purified from freshly drawn venous blood. The blood was mixed with acidic dextran containing anti-coagulant (0.4% citric acid, 1.3% sodium citrate, 1.5% dextrose, and 25 mm EDTA) prior to centrifugation at 500 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The plasma and white buffy coat fractions were discarded, and the remaining blood cell sediment was mixed with an equal volume of gelatin solution (2.5%, w/v, in 0.9% NaCl) previously warmed to 37 °C and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The yellowish supernatant containing polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a few red blood cells was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The eosinophils were separated by centrifugation on a discontinuous gradient of isotonic Percoll solutions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prepared by using 1.5 ml of Percoll solutions with densities of 1.075, 1.077, 1.0785, 1.080, 1.0825, and 1.085 g/ml in 15-ml polystyrene tubes. The crude polymorphonuclear leukocytes preparation was layered on the top of the gradient and centrifuged for 900 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were collected from each interface and aliquots stained with eosin to identify the purity of each eosinophil preparation. Fractions containing >90% eosinophils were collected, and the remaining contaminating red blood cells were lysed with aqueous 0.4% NH4Cl, pH 7.4, prior to use in chemotaxis assays. Chemotaxis assays with CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 L1/2 cell transfectants were performed in 24-well Biocoat transwell chemotaxis plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) as described previously (20Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Incubation was for 5 h, and data points were performed in duplicate. The extension of the amino terminus of RANTES does not abolish the capacity to bind to the three RANTES receptors, CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5. We have previously reported that Met-RANTES retains its binding to CCR1 (9Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.-O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2599-2603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and that both modified chemokines retain their high affinity binding to CCR5 (10Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Science. 1997; 276: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Although AOP-RANTES binds to CCR5 with classical monophasic binding properties, RANTES and Met-RANTES display biphasic displacement of the tracer. We have now compared the affinity of RANTES, AOP-RANTES, and Met-RANTES for CCR1 and CCR3 in a membrane-based scintillation proximity assay (SPA) shown in Fig. 1. AOP-RANTES has a comparable affinity to RANTES on CCR1, displaying an IC50 of 2 nm compared with 1.7 nmfor RANTES, whereas Met-RANTES has a lower affinity with an IC50 of 30 nm as previously reported (9Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.-O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2599-2603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). For CCR3, using 125I-MCP-3 as tracer to avoid the difficulties encountered using RANTES as tracer (23Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), we were not able to obtain the high affinity reported by Daugherty et al. (24Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.A. Malkowitz L. Sirotina A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) but obtained similar results to those reported by Ponath et al. (20Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) using heterologous competition. RANTES showed an IC50 value of 100 nm, and consistent with CCR1, Met-RANTES had a lowered affinity with an IC50 value of 360 nm. AOP-RANTES showed a higher affinity with an IC50 value of 32 nm. mRNA for CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 was analyzed in monocytes and eosinophils by RT-PCR. mRNA was detected for the five receptors in monocytes from three separate donors (Fig. 2 A). However, in eosinophils from a hypereosinophilic, but non-atopic patient, only CCR3 and CCR1 were detected (Fig. 2 B) as has been previously reported (20Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 24Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.A. Malkowitz L. Sirotina A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), whereas in eosinophils from an allergic patient, mRNA for receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 was detected (Fig. 2 C). The migration of freshly isolated monocytes in response to five chemokines was tested as follows: RANTES for CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 activity; MCP-1 for CCR2; eotaxin for CCR3; TARC for CCR4, and MIP-1β for CCR5, in order to investigate functional receptor expression. Monocytes from four donors tested responded to these ligands in separate experiments (Fig.3 a). The migration was greatest in response to RANTES and MCP-1, showing chemotaxis indices of 5 and 7, respectively, whereas the CCR3-, CCR4-, and CCR5-mediated responses induced by their respective ligands resulted in lower efficacies ranging between 3 and 4. Monocytes prepared from all donors showed a robust calcium mobilization in response to RANTES and MCP-1 in accordance with their efficacy in inducing monocyte migration, whereas eotaxin, TARC, and MIP-1β were unable to elicit a response (Fig. 3 b). Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES were unable to stimulate calcium mobilization in freshly isolated monocytes from all donors (results not shown). However, after 24 h in culture, AOP-RANTES was able to induce a robust calcium response in a dose-related manner in monocytes, and this response was significantly greater after 48 h in culture (Fig. 9 b). Met-RANTES was not tested in view of its weak activity on all RANTES receptors. The ability of Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES to antagonize chemotaxis was investigated against ligands with different receptor usage. Both proteins were able to antagonize RANTES-induced chemotaxis of freshly isolated monocytes. Met-RANTES inhibited RANTES-induced monocyte chemotaxis with an IC50of 11 nm, whereas AOP-RANTES was more potent with an IC50 of 1.4 nm (Fig.4 A). Met-RANTES was inefficient at inhibiting the response induced by ligands which are specific for CCR3. Inhibition of eotaxin-induced monocyte chemotaxis was only observed at high concentrations showing an IC50 of 150 nm (Fig. 4 B), and it was almost ineffective at antagonizing the eosinophil chemotaxis induced by eotaxin, although it was able to efficiently inhibit eosinophil chemotaxis induced by RANTES with an IC50 of 30 nm (Fig. 5). However, it was able to weakly inhibit MCP-3-induced eosinophil chemotaxis with an IC50 of 330 nm. AOP-RANTES, in accordance with its greater affinity for CCR3 than Met-RANTES, was able to inhibit eotaxin-induced monocyte chemotaxis (Fig. 4 B) with nanomolar potency (IC50 of 1 nm) and eotaxin-induced eosinophil chemotaxis with an IC50 of 45 nm(Fig. 5). In accordance with the retention of high affinity binding of both Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES for CCR5, they were both able to efficiently inhibit MIP-1β-induced monocyte chemotaxis with IC50values of 1.0 and 2.3 nm, respectively (Fig.4 C). The ability of Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES to induce monocyte chemotaxis was investigated with cells isolated from 3 and 6 donors, respectively, in comparison to the chemotaxis induced by RANTES (Fig.6, A and B). The chemotaxis index observed with RANTES varied from 4 to 11 depending on the donor. No response was observed for both modified proteins in almost all of the donors tested, with the exception of one donor whose monocytes responded only to AOP-RANTES with a chemotaxis index of 3.7, compared with 6 for RANTES using cells from the same donor in the same experiment. Eosinophil chemotaxis was similarly tested from several donors. Of the 8 donors tested, the eosinophils from 3 donors did not respond to Met-RANTES (Fig. 6 C). The remaining 6 patients showed a small response that did not exceed 20% of the response induced by RANTES on the eosinophils from the same donor. Similarly, AOP-RANTES showed no activity on eosinophils from one donor out of the four tested, whereas it induced a small response in two others. However, in the fourth donor, AOP-RANTES induced a chemotactic response equivalent to that induced by RANTES (Fig. 6 D). Both Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES tested at 100 nmwere able to induce a calcium response in CHO cells expressing CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 (Fig. 7 a). However, the kinetics of the response elicited by the modified proteins was significantly slower than that elicited by RANTES, with the exception of AOP-RANTES on the CHO/CCR5 cell line. Chemokines generally elicit a robust response within 2–4 s, whereas the response elicited by the amino-terminally modified proteins required 8–10 s (Fig.7 b). It is therefore difficult to judge whether the concentration of calcium mobilized reflects the actual activity of these modified proteins measured in this assay or is in fact an overestimate. The ability of Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES to elicit cellular migration through the three RANTES receptors was investigated using the murine pre-B cell line L1.2, transfected with the individual receptors (Fig.8). Met-RANTES was inactive on CCR1 and CCR3 but showed weak activity on CCR5 with significantly reduced potency. AOP-RANTES was able to induce a response comparable to wild type RANTES through CCR5 (Fig. 8 C). Furthermore, this derivative was more potent than Met-RANTES on the two other receptors, since it showed moderate efficacy on CCR3 (Fig. 8 B), but less on CCR1 (Fig. 8 A). Cell surface expression was investigated for CCR5 on monocytes using the monoclonal antibody, MC-1. No CCR5 was detectable by flow cytometry on freshly isolated monocytes from four separate donors (data not shown). After 24 h in culture, as the cells became adherent, half the population showed surface CCR5 expression, whereas after 48 h, CCR5 surface expression was detectable on the entire monocyte-derived macrophage culture (Fig.9 a). The modification of the amino terminus of RANTES by the addition of either a single amino acid due to the retention of the initiating methionine in recombinant RANTES (Met-RANTES) expressed inE. coli (9Proudfoot A.E.I.

These proteins were initially described as being inactive in calcium mobilization and chemotaxis assays in the pro-monocytic cell line, THP-1 (9Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J.

Schwartz T.W. Buser R. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Science. 1997; 276: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). However they retain the ability to activate certain cellular responses. AOP-RANTES is more active than RANTES in inducing CCR5 internalization (17Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E.I. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Receptor endocytosis is known to be an agonist-mediated event involving G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal region (27Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) but does not involve the classical G-protein-linked cascade (15Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana S.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Another modified RANTES protein, which is produced by the truncation of the first 8 amino acids to form RANTES-(9–68), is also able to mediate receptor internalization (15Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana S.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) but, in contrast to AOP-RANTES, is reported to be devoid of the ability to induce calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. From these observations it can be concluded that modification of the amino terminus of RANTES disturbs its ability to fully activate certain signaling events, while not affecting other receptor activation states that lead to events such as receptor internalization. We have shown here that both Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES are in fact capable of mediating calcium mobilization in CHO cells overexpressing RANTES receptors. However, the efficacy of these modified ligands should be interpreted with caution due to the difference in the kinetics of the response. The natural ligands induce a rapid, robust response to attain a certain magnitude of calcium influx, whereas the amount of calcium influx reported for the modified proteins requires a 2–3-fold increase in time of response, with the exception of AOP-RANTES activation of CCR5. This untypical response induced by these modified proteins could therefore lead to an overestimation of the calcium mobilized from internal stores typical of chemokine activity and could be in part the result of the opening of membrane calcium channels through alternative signal transduction mechanisms. Calcium mobilization induced by the modified RANTES proteins was not detectable in primary cells, but this could be attributed to the sensitivity of the method used. We have observed that calcium mobilization cannot be detected in freshly isolated monocytes in response to eotaxin, TARC, and MIP-1β, yet the mRNA for CCR3, -4, and -5 is detectable by RT-PCR. In contrast monocytes are able to respond to these ligands in the chemotaxis assays indicating that the appropriate receptors are expressed on the cell surface but possibly at levels too low to allow detectable calcium mobilization. RANTES and MCP-1, which induced a robust calcium response, were significantly more efficacious than eotaxin and TARC, which were not able to induce calcium, in mediating chemotaxis. Although freshly isolated monocytes had undetectable levels of CCR5 using the mAb MC-1, the specific CCR5 ligand MIP-1β induced a robust chemotactic response, and it was not able to mediate calcium. We therefore hypothesize that fewer surface receptors are required for cellular migration than for the mobilization of calcium when measured using Fura-2-AM-loaded cells. AOP-RANTES is unable to induce a calcium response in monocytes before the cells become adherent, and the ability of this protein to induce the response coincides with the ability to detect cell surface CCR5 expression by flow cytometry. Since RANTES is able to induce a robust calcium response in freshly isolated monocytes, presumably it does so through one of the other receptors, such as CCR1. It has been previously reported that circulating monocytes do not express detectable levels of surface CCR5 which is rapidly up-regulated as the cells differentiate into macrophages (28Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 29Naif H.M.

This is particularly relevant for HIV infection since HIV viral particles are not detected in circulating monocytes (31Massari F.E. Poli G. Schnittman S.M. Psallidopoulos M.C. Davey V. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4628-4632PubMed Google Scholar), whereas resident tissue macrophages are thought to be one of first targets of the HIV virus during transmission (32Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Clapham P.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By using L1.2 transfectants, we have shown that the modified proteins are able to activate the RANTES receptors CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 to mediate chemotaxis with varying efficiency. Met-RANTES is the least active, showing only minimal activity on CCR5, whereas AOP-RANTES is very poor at activating CCR1, has half the activity of RANTES on CCR3, but is fully active on CCR5. However, AOP-RANTES is only on rare occasions able to mediate the chemotaxis of primary cells. Although monocytes do have functional CCR5 as shown by the ability of MIP-1β to induce chemotaxis of these cells, AOP-RANTES is unable to do so despite its full activity on the L1.2/CCR5 transfectants. The possibility remains that AOP-RANTES can only activate a certain conformer of CCR5, which has been recently shown to adopt multiple conformational states (33Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and that MIP-1β is less sensitive to the different conformational states. The differential expression of chemokine receptors has been addressed recently by several laboratories. Here we show by the occasional reactivity of certain leukocytes to AOP-RANTES in in vitrochemotaxis assays that β-chemokine receptor expression varies considerably from donor to donor and may depend on the health state of the individual. The up-regulation of certain chemokine receptors by cytokine treatment in vitro was first reported by Loetscheret al. (34Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) who showed that in T lymphocytes interleukin-2 was able to significantly affect the levels of CCR1 and -2. Similarly, human neutrophils do not respond to MIP-1α and eotaxin, but treatment with inflammatory stimuli such as interferon-γ leads to up-regulation of CCR1 and CCR3 rendering these cells responsive to their ligands (35Bonecchi R.

Differential chemokine receptor expression has also been noticed in eosinophils using a murine model of airways inflammation following sensitization with cockroach antigen (36Campbell E.M. Kunkel S.L. Strieter R.M. Lukacs N.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 7047-7053PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, circulating eosinophils express predominantly CCR3 and CCR1, whereas the eosinophils that have been recruited into the airways express CCR2, -4, and -5 in addition to CCR1 and CCR3. 2N. Lukacs, personal communication. Although the expression of CCR5 on human eosinophils reported here was only detected on a single patient and is shown at the mRNA level, the reactivity of AOP-RANTES in a different allergic patient could indicate that CCR5 can be expressed in eosinophils in certain individuals. We are currently screening eosinophils from a panel of donors for CCR5 expression with anti-CCR5 mAbs. Met-RANTES has been reported to prevent the recruitment of eosinophils into the airways following ovalbumin challenge in ovalbumin-sensitized mice (1Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 376-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Gonzalo J.A. Lloyd C.M. Albar J.P. Wen D. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Martinez-A C. Bjerke T. Coyle A.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that Met-RANTES has a reduced affinity for CCR3 and is also very poor at inhibiting human eotaxin-mediated chemotaxis, as well as murine eosinophil chemotaxis induced by eotaxin, 3A. J. Coyle, personal communication. it must mediate the inhibition of eosinophil recruitment by a different mechanism. Either the inhibition is mediated by another RANTES receptor such as CCR1, CCR5, or another as yet unknown RANTES receptor or, alternatively, the effect is indirect. Since it also reduces the recruitment of lymphocytes in vivo(11Lloyd C.M. Minto A.W. Dorf M.E. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Salant D.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the production of specific eosinophil chemoattractants in situ may be modulated. The potent antagonistic effects of Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES in inhibiting inflammation and HIV infection, respectively, render them candidates as potential therapeutic agents. Here we have shown that both modified proteins have partial agonist activity and that AOP-RANTES is fully active on CCR5. These observations are important when considering their application therapeutically. However, a report of the systemic administration of recombinant fully active MIP-1α in a clinical trial showed no inflammatory side effects (37Clemons M.J. Marshall E. Durig J. Watanabe K. Howell A. Miles D. Earl H.K. Griffiths A. Towlson K. DeTakats P. Testa N.G. Dougal M. Hunter M.G. Wood L.M. Czaplewski L.G. Millar A. Dexter T.M. Lord B.I. Blood. 1998; 92: 1532-1540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that the chemoattractant property of chemokines does not necessarily induce inflammation per se, but accessory signals may be required. This hypothesis is substantiated by data from transgenic mice engineered to overexpress a chemokine ligand such as MCP-1 (38Grewal I.S. Rutledge B.J. Fiorillo J.A. Gu L. Gladue R.P. Flavell R. Rollins B.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the data presented here must be taken into consideration when envisaging such a therapeutic strategy. We are currently investigating the effects of administration of higher doses of these modified chemokines than those reported to date in animal models of inflammation. We thank M. Mack for the anti-CCR5 antibody, MC-1, and A. Meyer and B. Dufour for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1880366974,"In the present study we determined the long-term effects of persistent, local insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) expression on cardiac function in the SIS2 transgenic mouse. Cardiac mass/tibial length was increased in SIS2 mice by 10 wk of age; this cardiac hypertrophy became more pronounced later in life. Peak aortic outflow velocity, a correlate of cardiac output, was increased at 10 wk in SIS2 mice but was decreased at 52 wk. 72 wk SIS2 mouse hearts exhibited wide variability in the extent of cardiac hypertrophy and enlargement of individual cardiac myofibers. Sirius red staining revealed increased fibrosis in 72 wk SIS2 hearts. Persistent local IGF-I expression is sufficient to initially induce an analog of physiological cardiac hypertrophy in which peak aortic outflow velocity is increased relative to controls in the absence of any observed detrimental histological changes. However, this hypertrophy progresses to a pathological condition characterized by decreased systolic performance and increased fibrosis. Our results confirm the shortterm systolic performance benefit of increased IGF-I, but our demonstration that IGF-I ultimately diminishes systolic performance raises doubt about the therapeutic value of chronic IGF-I administration. Considering these findings, limiting temporal exposure to IGF-I seems the most likely means of delivering IGF-I's potential benefits while avoiding its deleterious side effects.—Delaughter, M.

The Nudix hydrolases comprise a large family of proteins characterized by the highly conserved array of amino acids GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U represents a bulky, hydrophobic, amino acid, usually Ile, Leu, or Val (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). A recent BLAST (2Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) search of the sequence data banks has revealed more than 300 putative proteins from over 80 species containing this amino acid motif, the Nudix box (Fig. 1). We have been systematically identifying and characterizing the enzymatic activities associated with these proteins, and we have found that almost all of the major substrates for these enzymes arenucleoside diphosphates linked to some other moiety, x, hence the acronym “Nudix.” The range of substrates acted on by various members of the family includes ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, nucleotide sugars, dinucleoside polyphosphates, NADH, and ADP-ribose. These substances are potentially toxic to the cell, signaling molecules, or metabolic intermediates whose concentrations require modulation during changes in the cell cycle or during periods of stress. We have suggested that the role of the Nudix hydrolases is to sanitize or modulate the accumulation of these metabolites (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Since the Nudix box is common to all of these enzymes, their specificity for the individual substrates must lie somewhere distal to the conserved region. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of four ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases, and we identify a proline residue downstream of the conserved sequence common to members of this subfamily of Nudix hydrolases. Furthermore, we have observed that other recurring amino acids in this same region are predictive of two other subfamilies of the Nudix hydrolases, the dinucleoside polyphosphate pyrophosphatases and the NADH pyrophosphatases. We also demonstrate that ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activity may play a role in tellurite resistance, since overexpression of this enzyme markedly increases the survival of cultures of Escherichia coli exposed to this toxic metalloid oxyanion. Primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Biochemicals and enzymes were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was from Stratagene, and enzymes used in standard cloning procedures were from Life Technologies, Inc. and U.S. Biochemical Corp. E. coli strain MG1655 was kindly provided by Dr. Frederick R. Blattner (University of Wisconsin), and strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis, Hemophilus influenzae, and E. coli BL21 (DE3) were departmental stocks. Genes of interest were amplified from genomic DNA with forward primers incorporating an NdeI site and reverse primers incorporating a BamHI site. The insert was prepared by digestion with NdeI and BamHI followed by gel purification and it was ligated with the corresponding restriction sites of pET11b under control of the T7 lac promoter for expression. The cloned genes, with their accession numbers in parentheses are as follows: ysa1, S. cerevisiae(Q09176); orf209, E. coli (P36651);yqkg, B. subtilis (P54570); hi0398, H. influenzae (AAC22057). The plasmid constructs are designated pYSA1, pOrf209, pYQKG, and pHI0398, respectively. BL21 (DE3) cells containing the respective plasmid were grown at 37 °C in LB broth on a shaker to an A600 of about 0.6 and induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a concentration of 1 mm. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 3 h, harvested, washed by suspension in isotonic saline, and centrifuged in preweighed centrifuge tubes, and the packed cells were stored at −80 °C. A summary of the steps involved in the purification of each of the enzymes follows. Cells were suspended in 3 volumes of 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (buffer A) supplemented with 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and 30% glycerol and disrupted in a French press. Glycerol was absolutely necessary for stabilization of the enzymatic activity throughout the purification procedure for YSA1. The protein was adjusted to 10 mg/ml, and nucleic acids were precipitated by adding streptomycin sulfate to a concentration of 1%. Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 50% saturation, and the precipitate was discarded after centrifugation. The supernatant was dialyzed and chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose, and active fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and chromatographed on a hydroxyl apatite column. Cells were extracted as above in buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA and treated with streptomycin sulfate. A 30–60% ammonium sulfate fraction of the streptomycin supernatant was chromatographed on a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-100), and the active fractions were pooled, concentrated by precipitation in 80% ammonium sulfate, dialyzed, and chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose. The purification of these two enzymes was considerably simplified, because almost all of the expressed protein leaked out of the frozen and thawed cells merely by washing them in buffer A. Endogenous proteins remained within the cells, resulting in an extract highly enriched for the expressed enzyme. The YQKG and HI0398 enzymes were recovered in an essentially pure state (>90%) by precipitating them in 70 or 30% ammonium sulfate, respectively. Enzyme velocities were quantitated by measuring the conversion of a phosphatase insensitive substrate, ADP-ribose, to the phosphatase-sensitive products, AMP and ribose 5-phosphate. The liberated inorganic orthophosphate was measured by the procedure of Ames and Dubin (3Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard incubation mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP-ribose, 0.2–2 milliunits of enzyme, and 2 units of alkaline intestinal phosphatase. After 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA, and inorganic orthophosphate was measured. A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min under these conditions. Note that 2 mol of phosphate are liberated per mol of ADP-ribose hydrolyzed. The standard assay mixture (minus alkaline intestinal phosphatase) was scaled up, and at various time intervals aliquots were analyzed by paper electrophoresis (4Markham R. Smith J.D. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and additional aliquots were used for the determination of inorganic orthophosphate in the presence and absence of added alkaline intestinal phosphatase. Induction of BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the cloned genes (see “Methods”) led to the appearance of new protein bands corresponding to molecular weights calculated from the respective amino acid content. Fig.2 shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel comparing induced cells containing the cloned genes with control cells containing the vector, pET11b, without the inserted genes. In each case, a well defined new band is visible. When extracts of the cells prepared as described under “Methods” were centrifuged and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, the bulk of the newly expressed protein was in the soluble fraction (data not shown). It is interesting that two of the expressed proteins HI0398 (from H. influenzae) and YQKG (from B. subtilis) were extracted without mechanically disrupting the frozen cells, leaving the bulk of the other proteins behind as mentioned under “Methods.” This is reminiscent of two other Nudix hydrolases, Orf17 dATPase (5O'Handley S.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24649-24654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the IalA diadenosine tetraphosphate pyrophosphatase (6Conyers G.B. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1203-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), both of which may be extracted by washing previously frozen cells. At present, it is not apparent why these proteins behave differently from most of the other Nudix hydrolases expressed in E. coli. Fig. 1 also shows the highly purified proteins resulting from the protocol described under “Methods.” These fractions were used for characterization of the enzymes reported below. Our initial studies of this group of enzymes began with Orf209. Although we did not know its enzymatic activity, we were influenced by our earlier work (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) indicating that all of the major substrates for the Nudix hydrolase family were derivatives of nucleoside diphosphates. Accordingly, we screened a number of candidates in this structural category and found that ADP-ribose was an excellent substrate for the enzyme. This is shown in Table I along with the three other enzymes included in this study. For comparison, the two additional ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases described in earlier works (7O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,8Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) are also reported in the table. The activities toward ADP-ribose are compared with rates with some naturally occurring nucleoside diphosphate derivatives known to be favored substrates for other members of the Nudix hydrolase family (8Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In each case, ADP-ribose is the preferred substrate, although there is a wide variation in absolute specificities. For example, MJ1149 from the archaebacterium, Methanococcus jannaschii, has no significant activity toward any of the other substrates, whereas Orf186 from E. coli and H10398 from H. influenzae have substantial activities on NADH and GDP-mannose, respectively. However, more rigorous kinetic analyses would be required for each of the putative substrates if a more substantive interpretation of the relative rates is in order. Kinetic parameters for ADP-ribose are compared in TableII, and a broad distribution in some of the constants is noted. These comparative values, derived under standard assay conditions, should be interpreted with caution, because differences in the physiology and ecology of the individual entries could have large effects on the data. For example, we have shown that the Vmax of MJ1149 increases 15-fold when assayed at 75 °C (8Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), raising the rate from 6.2 to 93 units/mg, and this temperature is still 10 °C below the normal habitat of the organism (9Jones W.J.

As with most of the Nudix hydrolases studied so far, the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase subfamily members have distinctly alkaline pH optima, ranging from pH 8 to 9. All absolutely require a divalent cation for activity, with Mg2+ at approximately 2 mm the preferred metal. Mn2+ at equal concentrations is 10–20% as effective. One of the enzymes from this study, Orf209, has approximately 40% of maximal activity when Mg2+ is replaced by Zn2+, and this is similar to the results seen previously for Orf186 (7O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Aliquots of standard reaction mixtures (omitting alkaline phosphatase), appropriately scaled up, were analyzed as described under “Methods.” No inorganic phosphate was formed during the course of the reactions. The disappearance of substrate ADP-ribose was coincident with the appearance of AMP, and inorganic orthophosphate was released upon incubation of the products with alkaline intestinal phosphatase. The course of the reaction may be written as ADP-ribose + H2O → AMP + ribose 5-phosphate.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggested that the conserved MutT signature sequence might designate nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity. However, subsequent work has revealed that the MutT enzyme is only one member of a large family of different enzymes with different substrates including sugar nucleotides, NADH, dinucleoside polyphosphates, and as shown in the present work, ADP-ribose (for a review, see Ref. 8Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the large body of evidence to the contrary, the MutT signature sequence (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU) has been erroneously linked to the MutT enzymatic activity and to antimutagenesis. For example, MJ1149 of M. jannaschii has been designated MutT in the TIGR sequencing project (14Bult C.J. Ahite O. Olsen G.J. Zhou I. Fleischman R.D. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar), whereas in reality it has neither nucleoside triphosphatase nor antimutagenic activity and is in fact a highly specific ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (8Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Also, a recent report (15Pennisi E. Science. 1999; 283: 1105-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) attributes the extreme radiation resistance of Deinococcus radiodurans to its large number of MutT genes insulating it from oxidative stress. In fact, only one of the genes has been identified so far, gdr8, designating a new enzyme, UDP-glucose pyrophosphatase, 1C. A. Dunn, S. Desai, and M. J. Bessman, unpublished results. unrelated to the MutT enzyme. This ambiguity between the “MutT motif,” an amino acid array shared by several different enzymes, and the “MutT enzyme,” connoting a specific physiological function, has caused considerable confusion. For this reason, we introduced the acronym, Nudix hydrolase, to define the family of different enzymes sharing the Nudix box signature sequence of amino acids, the MutT enzyme being only one member of this large family. Fig. 1 shows a Clustal (16Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) alignment of a partial list of putative enzymes containing the Nudix box (MutT motif) uncovered in a recent search of the data banks using the BLAST program (2Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (69694) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 contains 70 entries selected from a total of 300 putative proteins from 75 different species. Sequestered in this list are different families of enzymes acting on the substrates mentioned above and almost certainly some enzymes with novel, undiscovered activities. Since the Nudix box is common to all of these proteins, the determinant(s) of specificity must be supplementary to the Nudix signature sequence. One of our objectives in discovering and characterizing new members of this interesting family of enzymes is to recognize distinguishing features of the subfamilies in order to predict the enzymatic activity of undetermined entries. As the collection of characterized enzymes grows, alignments of those with similar activities become more revealing. Fig.3 A is an alignment of the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase subfamily showing a highly conserved proline, 15 or 16 amino acids downstream of the terminal glycine of the Nudix box. The checked entries have all been identified, and the remaining entries are predicted. Actually, we predicted the activity of the H. influenza and B. subtilis proteins before their respective genes were cloned and expressed, and we have recently learned that a human EST (Fig. 3 A, line 17) is also an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase 2H. Yang, M. Slupska, and J. H. Miller, personal communication. Similar alignments are shown in Fig. 3, B and C, for diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolases and the NADH hydrolases, respectively. In the former, there is a conserved tyrosine 16–18 amino acids downstream from the Nudix box, and in the latter, there is a consensus of eight amino acids in this region. When this 8-amino acid consensus sequence was first uncovered, there was only one known NADH pyrophosphatase with the Nudix motif. We have recently cloned, expressed, purified, and determined the activities of the two additional entries XGLO67w (S. cerevisiae), and F13H10 3W-L. Xu and M. J. Bessman, unpublished results. (C. elegans), both of which have the enzymatic activity predicted from the downstream signals. The three-dimensional solution structure for one of the Nudix hydrolases, MutT, has been solved by NMR spectroscopy (17Abeygunawardana C. Weber D.J. Gittis A.G. Frick D.N. Lin J. Miller A.-F. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14997-15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and it has a unique, loop 1-helix-loop 2 motif encompassing its catalytic and nucleotide binding site. The characteristic amino acids distinguishing the three families mentioned above would all be in loop 2 if this structural feature were conserved in all of the Nudix hydrolases. Preliminary studies on the crystal structure of the Orf209 ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase suggest 4S. Gabelli, M. J. Bessman, and L. M. Amzel, unpublished results. that the loop-helix-loop motif is present in this enzyme as well. The three-dimensional structures of two additional enzymes, Orf17, the dATPase (5O'Handley S.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), are also in the process of being solved, the former by x-ray crystallography4 and the latter by NMR spectroscopy, 5P. Leggett, M. J. Bessman, and A. S. Mildvan, unpublished results. so that we should soon have insight into the generality of the loop-helix-loop motif in the Nudix hydrolase family. It is interesting to note that one of the enzymes, Orf186, has both the conserved proline andthe conserved tyrosine (see Fig. 3, A and B). This correlates well with the specificity of Orf186, which is almost equally active on Ap3A and ADP-ribose (Table I). On the other hand, these amino acid predictors of activity should, at present, be viewed only as clues to narrow down the possibilities in identifying new members of the family, since not all of the enzymes fit the present patterns. For example, two Ap4A hydrolases from the yeastsSchizosaccharomyces pombe (19Ingram S.W. Stratemann S.A. Barnes L.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3649-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae(20Cartwright J.L. McLennan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8604-8610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) do not have the conserved tyrosine of the ApnA hydrolases, and Orf186, which also has substantial activity on NADH (see Table I) does not have the 8-amino acid consensus predictive of this activity. An opportunity to test our classification scheme and to demonstrate its potential utility was provided by the trgB gene of R. sphaeroides, which has been shown to be a tellurite resistance determinant (21O'Gara J.P. Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A, line 7, shows that TRGB contains the Nudix box and, in addition, the signal proline tentatively categorizing the protein as an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. To test whether this enzyme could confer the tellurite resistance phenotype, we transformed E. coli with a plasmid, pTRC, containing the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase gene (MJ1149) from the archaebacterium M. jannaschii, because the enzyme from this organism is highly specific for ADP-ribose (see Table I). Thegraphs in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate that the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase gene increases resistance to tellurite. In Fig. 4 A, it can be seen that the transformed culture retained almost 100% viability at a 50% survival rate for the parent culture. Likewise, there was approximately 60% survival versus 100% killing, at 0.5 μg/ml K2TeO3. Fig. 4 B shows the differential effect of tellurite on growing cultures of the transformed and parent cells. That this is a specific effect of the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase gene and not a general property of the Nudix hydrolases is shown in Fig. 4 C. None of the other genes tested confer tellurite resistance. Commensurate with the increase in tellurite resistance was a 5-fold increase in ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase in crude extracts of the transformed cells compared with the parent culture. 6C. A. Dunn and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observations. Tellurite resistance has been used for many years in the differential diagnosis of pathological microorganisms and is a complex process implicating many genes found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (for a review, see Ref. 22Taylor D.E. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 111-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Our experiments and classification scheme strongly suggest that one of these genes, trgB, designates an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase, implicating ADP-ribose itself as a factor in tellurite sensitivity. Although the role played by ADP-ribose in this process is not known, these experiments are an example of how functional genomics, the prediction of protein function from amino acid sequence, can aid in identifying the activities of unknown proteins involved in physiological processes. It is, perhaps, not surprising that ADP-ribose is directly involved in, or potentiates, tellurite toxicity. Cellular ADP-ribose arises from the hydrolysis of mono- and poly(A)DP-ribosylated proteins during the regulation of metabolic processes (for a review, see Ref. 23Moss J. Zahradka P. Mol. 1994; (eds) Cell. Biochem. 138: 5-255Google Scholar) and also by the large scale turnover of NAD+, amounting to approximately 30 and 90% of the total NAD+ synthesis inE. coli and HeLa cells, respectively (24Olivera B.M. Hughes K.T. Cordray P. Roth J.R. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. ADP- Ribose Transfer Reactions. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 353-360Google Scholar). Because of its free aldehydic group, ADP-ribose can derivatize terminal amino groups, lysines, and cysteines in proteins nonenzymatically (25Jacobson E.L. Cervantes-Laurean D. Jacobson M.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26McDonald L.J. Moss J. Mol. Cell.

Recently, the accumulation of ADP-ribose has been implicated in the liver damage caused by high levels of acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, Tylenol®) when it was shown that the acetaminophen metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinonimine, inhibits rat liver ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (30Ribeiro J.M. Agudo A. Costas A.J. Cameselle J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have also seen that this derivative inhibits YSA1, the yeast enzyme described in this paper.6It has also been reported that inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, one of the major sources of cellular ADP-ribose, prevent the liver damage caused by overdoses of acetaminophen (31Kroger H. Dietrich A. Ohde M. Lange R. Ehrlich W. Kurpisz M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These recent experiments support the large body of data implicating free ADP-ribose as a cytotoxic agent. As mentioned in the Introduction, we have suggested that the members of the Nudix hydrolase family of enzymes share common features including a conserved amino acid signature sequence and a specificity for nucleoside diphosphate derivatives and that one of their physiological functions is to sanitize the cell of potentially toxic metabolites. The ubiquitous ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases described in this paper meet these three criteria and qualify this subfamily as a bona fide member of the Nudix hydrolases. We are indebted to Drs. Samuel Kaplan and Mark Gomelsky for help with trgB."

Phosphorylation of BRCA1 has been implicated in altering its function, however, the pathway(s) that leads to the phosphorylation of BRCA1 has not been described. Here, a signaling pathway by which heregulin induces cell cycle-independent phosphorylation of BRCA1 was delineated. We showed that heregulin stimulation induced the phosphorylation of BRCA1 and concomitant activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT in T47D human breast cancer cells. Heregulin-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 was abrogated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors and by a dominant-negative AKT. In the absence of heregulin, the ectopic expression of the constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K was sufficient to induce BRCA1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the purified glutathione S-transferase/AKT kinase phosphorylated BRCA1in vitro. We have also shown that the phosphorylation of BRCA1 by AKT occurs on the residue Thr-509, which is located in the nuclear localization signal.

Heregulins (NDF/neuregulin) are a group of growth factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and survival of various breast cancer cell lines (1Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PI3K appears to regulate the phosphorylation and consequently the activity of the p70S6 kinase, protein kinase C isoforms, and the serine/threonine kinase AKT (3Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr.

AKT activity is regulated both by binding of PI3K lipid products to its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and by phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 residues located within its activation loop and the C terminus, respectively (4Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Activated AKT provides a survival signal that protects cells from apoptosis and mediates growth factor-induced cell proliferation (3Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin.

Here, we have studied the regulation of AKT activity by heregulin and its impact on the phosphorylation of BRCA1 in T47D cells. We show that heregulin stimulates phosphorylation of BRCA1 via PI3K/AKT in breast cancer cells. T47D cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), insulin (5 μg/ml), and antibiotics. Prior to heregulin stimulation, cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). T47D cells were then transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE following the protocol provided by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 293T cells were transfected by using the Ca2+-phosphate method. Flow cytometry (>10,000 cells/sample) was used to evaluate the cell cycle profile. The K227E p110 (28Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar) plasmids have been described elsewhere. The full-length AKT cDNA was amplified from the total RNA of HeLa cells by using reverse transcriptase-PCR and then subcloned into the Bluescript plasmid. To create the pLNCX-HA-AKT construct, AKT cDNA lacking an ATG start codon was re-amplified from the Bluescript plasmid by using a T3 primer and an AKT primer containing a Kozak and the HA sequence as well asBglII site. The amplified fragment was inserted into theClaI and BglII sites of the modified pLNCX plasmid. The kinase inactive mutant HA-AKT-K179M was generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenesis converted lysine 179 to a methionine and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The AKT substrate GLAS was created by cloning of the double-stranded primers containing the AKT consensus site GILGRPRAATFA between theBamHI and XhoI sites of the vector pGEX-5X3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To prepare GST-BRCA1 fusion proteins, BRCA1 fragments, generated by PCR, were cloned into the vector pGEX-T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) between sites BamHI andEcoRI. GST-BRCA1-3M was constructed by changing threonine at position 509 to alanine by PCR-mediated site-directed mutation. The PCR-derived constructs were confirmed as correct by direct sequencing. Competent Escherichia coli JM109 was transformed, and recombinant clones were screened by SDS-PAGE analysis of overexpressed fusion proteins and by restriction enzyme analysis. GST fusion proteins were produced by 10 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside induction and purified on a large scale by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione followed by concentration in a Centricon 30 filter (Amicon), and the buffer was exchanged to 5 mmNa3PO4 and 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4. To produce the GST-AKT and the GST-AKT-K179M (kinase-dead) proteins in baculovirus cells, 1.8 × 106 SF-9 cells were plated on a 175-cm2 flask and allowed to attach for 1 h. The media were removed, and 4 ml of high titer GST-AKT baculovirus was incubated with the cells for 1 h at 27 °C. Next, 20 ml of medium (SF900II supplemented with 10% FCS) was added to the cells (virus was not removed). 48 h post-infection, cells were scraped off the flask, spun down, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Lysate was spun at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was mixed with glutathione beads. Beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and GST-AKT was then eluted with free glutathione. The eluted protein was adjusted to 40% glycerol and stored at 20 °C. Serum-starved T47D cells were either untreated or treated with heregulin (rHRGβ1) (10 nm) for 30 min. Metabolic labeling experiments were performed as described (29Altiok S. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from 293T and T47D cells were prepared in cell lysate buffer as described (17Scully R. Chen J.J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of BRCA1 were performed by using either monoclonal BRCA1-17F8 (Genetex, San Antonio, TX), monoclonal D-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or polyclonal C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies. Proteins were separated by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and immunoblotted with one of the anti-BRCA1 antibodies by utilizing the ECL detection system. Anti-BRCA1 immunoprecipitates were washed in extraction buffer without phosphatase inhibitor and treated with λ-phosphatase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) as described (19Thomas J.E. Smith M. Tonkinson J.L. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 801-809PubMed Google Scholar). The total amounts of AKT and Ser-473 phosphorylation of AKT were detected by Western blot analysis. For Ser-473 phosphorylation of AKT, a phospho-specific AKT polyclonal antibody (SER473AKT), which recognizes AKT only when phosphorylated at Ser-473 (New England BioLabs), was used. The level of AKT expression was monitored by using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes AKT independently from its phosphorylation state (New England BioLabs). AKT was immunoprecipitated from total cell extracts with the C-20 antibody, and the kinase activity was assayed as described (24Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar), except GLAS was used as a substrate. Heregulin overexpression has been shown to induce aggressive tumor growth in breast cancer cells by activating the ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 receptor signaling cascades (20Krane I.M. Leder P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1781-1788PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lewis G.D. Lofgren J.A. Mcmurtrey A.E. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Bauer K.D. Sliwkowski M.X. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1457-1465PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tang C.K. Perez C. Grunt T. Waibel C. Cho C. Lupu R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3350-3358PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, amplification or overexpression of the ErbB-2 oncogene is associated with a poor prognosis in breast and ovarian cancer patients (23Hynes N.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which heregulin induces cell growth in breast cancer cells is not well understood. To investigate whether the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 is a downstream target of the ErbB signaling pathway in breast cancer cells, BRCA1 immunoprecipitates were prepared from whole cell lysates of serum-starved T47D cells untreated or treated with heregulin for different time periods. ErbB-2 expression level in T47D cells is similar to that in other breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7. However, ErbB-2 receptors are not overexpressed in T47D cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, BRCA1 was detected as an ∼220-kDa protein from the lysates of serum-starved T47D cells (lane 1). This protein was not seen when control rabbit IgG was used in immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Within 30 min of treatment, heregulin caused a significant decrease in the mobility of BRCA1 and gradually increased the density of the upper band as compared with the untreated cells (compare lane 1 withlanes 2 and 3). It appears that the decreased migration of BRCA1 in heregulin-treated cells is due to phosphorylation, because treatment with phosphatase converted the slower migrating form to a faster migrating, single protein band on SDS-PAGE (lane 4). To confirm that the 220-kDa protein that is phosphorylated in response to heregulin treatment is BRCA1, T47D cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged BRCA1. Because an anti-HA antibody was used for Western blot analysis, an approximately 220-kDa protein was detected in cells transfected with the HA-BRCA1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), whereas no such band was found in vector-transfected cells (data not shown). Consistent with the data obtained above, heregulin treatment caused a decrease in the mobility of HA-BRCA1 (lane 1 compared with lane 2). Thus, we concluded that the 220-kDa protein observed in the anti-BRCA1 immunoprecipitates is BRCA1. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 in response to heregulin most likely occurs on serine/threonine residues, because an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody failed to recognize BRCA1 after heregulin treatment, whereas the same antibody detected tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 receptors in the same extracts (data not shown). To directly determine whether BRCA1 was phosphorylated in heregulin-treated T47D cells, we assayed in vivo 33P incorporation into BRCA1 immunoprecipitated from [33P]orthophosphate-labeled cells (Fig. 1 C). The amount of 33P incorporated into the BRCA1 protein increased in response to heregulin within 30 min (Fig. 1 C, lane 2 compared with lane 3), whereas no significant change was observed in the expression level of BRCA1 (data not shown). BRCA1 phosphorylation has been reported to increase during the S phase of the cell cycle (16Scully R. Chen J.J. Plug A. Xiao Y.H. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M.

To check whether heregulin-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 correlates with S phase entry, we analyzed the DNA content of serum-starved T47D cells over 24 h following heregulin stimulation. As shown in Table I, treatment of cells with heregulin for 30 min did not lead to any change in the percentage of the cell population arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, although significant BRCA1 phosphorylation had occurred. A gradual exit from the G0/G1 phase was observed beginning 6 h after stimulation with heregulin. The phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, RB, in the same extracts was used as an additional indicator of cell cycle progression. A change in the phosphorylation of RB was observed beginning 12 h after heregulin treatment of cells (data not shown). These results show that the phosphorylation of BRCA1 by short term heregulin treatment precedes S phase entry.Table IFlow cytometry analysis of T47D cellsHeregulinG0/G1SG2 + M%%%−93.16.10.85 min94.35.10.630 min92.17.00.86 h82.912.15.012 h79.118.42.518 h74.622.33.124 h66.831.12.0Serum-starved T47D cells were untreated (−) or treated with heregulin (10 nm) for the indicated times. >10,000 cells were analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter for DNA content.

The numbers represent the percentage of cells in different phases of the cell cycle. We next tested which signaling pathway(s) is essential for phosphorylation of the BRCA1 protein by heregulin in T47D cells. Fig.1 D shows that in cells stimulated with heregulin for 30 min, BRCA1 underwent a mobility shift, which is consistent with the result observed in Fig. 1, A and B. The shift in mobility was partially blocked by pretreatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) (lane 4) but not with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm) (lane 3). As tested under the same conditions, heregulin-induced MAP kinase activity was inhibited by PD98059 (data not shown), suggesting that the PI3K pathway, but not the MAP kinase pathway, is required for the heregulin-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1. However, because the shift in mobility of BRCA1 was blocked partially by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, this suggests that a component of BRCA1 phosphorylation might be PI3K independent. The hypothesis that heregulin induces BRCA1 phosphorylation in T47D cells by enhancing the activity of PI3K was further tested by transient expression of a constitutively active p110 subunit (K227E) of PI3K in 293T cells. The mobility of BRCA1 immunoprecipitated from these cells was compared with cells transfected with the vector alone. As shown in Fig. 2, transfection with the Myc-tagged K227E p110 plasmid increased the migration of BRCA1 on SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A) and increased the activity of the endogenous AKT as detected by an increase in the SER473 phosphorylation (Fig.2 B). Expression levels of K227E p110 (Fig. 2 C) and the endogenous AKT (Fig. 2 D) were determined by Western immunoblotting using anti-Myc and anti-AKT antibodies, respectively. These results demonstrate that signaling initiated by activated PI3K is sufficient for phosphorylation of BRCA1 in the absence of heregulin. The results presented above strongly suggest that AKT, the downstream target of PI3K, might mediate BRCA1 phosphorylation in response to heregulin. To better understand the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by activation of ErbB receptors in breast cancer cells, growth-arrested T47D cells were treated with heregulin. Phosphorylation as well as activation of AKT were analyzed by using a phospho-specific antibody (which recognizes AKT only when phosphorylated at the Ser-473 residue) and by in vitrokinase assays, respectively. As shown in Fig.3 A, neither phosphorylation (upper panel) nor kinase activity (middle panel) of AKT was observed in unstimulated serum-starved T47D cells. However, stimulation with heregulin dramatically increased both the phosphorylation and the kinase activity of AKT within 1 min, which gradually increased during 30 min of treatment. No difference was observed in the protein levels of AKT between unstimulated and heregulin-stimulated cells as shown by an antibody recognizing AKT independently from its phosphorylation state (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). A similar pattern of phosphorylation of AKT at Thr-308 was also observed when a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes AKT only when phosphorylated at the Thr-308 was used (data not shown). Although previous studies suggested that AKT activation by various growth factors is PI3K-dependent, other mechanisms leading to AKT activation have also been reported (3Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 4Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism of AKT activation by heregulin in T47D cells, the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin, LY294002, and the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 were used. As shown in Fig. 3 B, both heregulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of AKT were completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with LY294002 (10 μm) but not with PD98059 (20 μm), which blocks MAP kinase activation by heregulin. These results demonstrate that PI3K activation is required for the phosphorylation on residue Ser-473 and for the activation of AKT. To analyze the importance of AKT in heregulin-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 in vivo, T47D cells were co-transfected with HA-BRCA1 and the kinase-inactive form of AKT, HA-AKT-K179M, carrying a point mutation that renders the kinase inactive. The AKT-K179M has been demonstrated to have a dominant-inhibitory effect toward wild-type AKT kinase activity (24Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A.

Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, treatment with heregulin caused a shift in the mobility of HA-BRCA1 (comparelanes 2 and 3), whereas in cells co-transfected with HA-AKT-K179M, heregulin treatment did not cause a change in the mobility of HA-BRCA1 (lane 1). The expression of HA-AKT-K179M was monitored by immunoblots using an HA-specific antibody (Fig. 4, lower panel). These results reveal that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is necessary and sufficient to phosphorylate BRCA1 in vivo and suggest that AKT mediates BRCA1 phosphorylation in response to heregulin. To test whether AKT functions as a BRCA1 kinase in vitro, BRCA1 was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved T47D cells, and its phosphorylation by AKT was assayed in an immunocomplex kinase assay. The GST-AKT kinase, as well as the GST-AKT-K179M, were expressed in the Sf-21 baculovirus system and then purified. Whereas GST-AKT significantly induced BRCA1 phosphorylation, the kinase-inactive form of AKT, GST-AKT-K179M, failed to phosphorylate BRCA1 (Fig. 5 A). To identify the phosphorylation domain of BRCA1 by AKT, we created six overlapping BRCA1 fragments spanning the entire BRCA1 open reading frame as GST fusion proteins. Approximately equal amounts of each GST-BRCA1 protein were incubated with the recombinant AKT, purified from baculovirus in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 8, mainly a fragment spanning amino acids 428–683, which is necessary and sufficient for interaction with AKT in vivo (data not shown), underwent phosphorylation with GST-AKT but not with kinase-inactive GST-AKT (lane 7). Interestingly, an AKT consensus sequence RXRXXTS is found in this fragment. Because the Thr-509 seems to be the most likely primary residue phosphorylated by AKT, a GST-BRCA1 fusion protein (GST-BRCA1#3M) was generated in which Thr-509 was converted to alanine. As seen in Fig. 5 B, mutation of this residue greatly diminishes the phosphorylation by AKT, demonstrating that Thr-509 is the primary site of induced phosphorylation of BRCA1. However, heregulin/PI3K/AKT-dependent phosphorylation of other phosphorylation sites of BRCA1 may also be affected and may have a low level of phosphorylation upon heregulin stimulation. AKT phosphorylates BRCA1 on Thr-509 (compare lanes 12 and13). Phosphorylation of BRCA1#3 by AKT seems to be comparable with the phosphorylation of the AKT substrate GLAS, containing the ideal AKT consensus sequence (27Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Anjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) fused to the GST protein. In conclusion, our results define a pathway by which activation of ErbB receptors by heregulin can regulate the phosphorylation of BRCA1 through PI3K/AKT in breast cancer cells and indicate that AKT may be a BRCA1 kinase in vivo. The localization of the AKT phosphorylation site in the nuclear translocation signal of BRCA1 suggests that phosphorylation by AKT may interfere with the nuclear translocation and consequently with the biological activity of BRCA1. Understanding the regulation of BRCA1 function by growth factors and their oncogenic membrane receptors may lead to new approaches for the treatment and prevention of both hereditary and sporadic breast cancers.

In bacteria and plants, l-cysteine is the precursor of most sulfur-containing metabolites including methionine and glutathione. Extracellular sulfate is first imported by specific transporters. Intracellular sulfate is then activated by ATP sulfurylase and adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate kinase to form adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, respectively. These activated sulfates are further reduced to sulfide. Sulfide then reacts with O-acetylserine, which is produced from serine and acetyl-CoA by serine acetyltransferase (SAT,1 EC 2.3.1.30). This final reaction forming l-cysteine, by transfer of the alanyl moiety of O-acetylserine to sulfide, is catalyzed byl-cysteine synthase (CS;O-acetyl-l-serine (thiol)-lyase, EC 4.2.99.8). In contrast to bacteria and plants, animals are presumed to lack the sulfur assimilation pathway and thus require exogenous methionine as a sulfur source.

SAT activity and O-acetylserine availability are the major regulatory factors in the control of the l-cysteine production in plants (6Rennenberg H.

Cytosolic isoforms of the SAT fromCitrullus vulgaris and Arabidopsis thaliana are regulated by feedback inhibition by l-cysteine, but not byl-cystine, glutathione, d-cysteine, or other structurally similar amino acids (5Saito K.

However, mitochondrial and chloroplast isoforms of theA. thaliana SATs are feedback-insensitive (8Noji M. Inoue K. Kimura N. Gouda A. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32739-32745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which indicates that the mode of regulation of cysteine biosynthesis is organelle-dependent. Entamoeba histolytica is an enteric protist parasite that causes amebic colitis and extraintestinal abscesses (i.e.hepatic, pulmonary, and cerebral) (9World Health OrganizationThe World Health Report 1995: Bridging the Gaps. 16. World Health Organization, Geneva1995: 377-385Google Scholar). This organism is amitochondriate, and its core metabolism involves several proteins that contain low midpoint redox potential iron-sulfur centers coordinated by cysteines, i.e. pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and a 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin. It requires a reduced medium for in vitro growth, although, in the host, it invades aerobic tissues. The mechanisms of its antioxidative defenses are poorly understood. Superoxide dismutase is present, but catalase and the glutathione system involved in antioxidative defenses of other organisms, including of its host, are absent (12Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Arrick B. Overdank Bogart T. Aley S.B. Science. 1984; 224: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The amino acid, l-cysteine, is the major thiol (12Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Arrick B. Overdank Bogart T. Aley S.B. Science. 1984; 224: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that plays an important role in the biology of this organism, including its antioxidative defenses and in its attachment to matrix, elongation, motility, and growth in vitro (14Gillin F.D. Diamond L.S. J. Protozool. 1980; 27: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Gillin F.D. Diamond L.S. Exp. Parasitol. 1981; 52: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The source of l-cysteine for E. histolyticaremains a puzzling question. The media used for in vitrocultivation contain high levels of this amino acid, and the organism is assumed to be dependent on exogenous cysteine. We have recently shown, however, that E. histolytica possesses the cysteine biosynthetic pathway (10Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Nozaki T. Arase T. Shigeta Y. Asai T. Leustek T. Takeuchi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1429: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We isolated and characterized the genes encoding two important enzymes in the pathway: ATP sulfurylase and CS. The significance of this pathway for E. histolytica is indicated by the observation that the steady state CS mRNA comprises a large proportion (up to 2%) of total mRNA (10Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, regulatory mechanisms and functional significance of this pathway have not been studied at the molecular level in E. histolytica. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic DNA encoding SAT from a clonal strain of E. histolytica and Entamoeba dispar by functional complementation. We show that the amoebic SAT is a regulated enzyme in the pathway and probably plays an important role in cysteine biosynthesis. In addition, unlike the bacterial and plant SATs, the amoebic SAT revealed several unique biochemical features including a feedback inhibition by both l-cysteine andl-cystine and a lack of association with CS. We also show that overproduction of CS, but not of SAT, confers partial resistance to hydrogen peroxide, implying the importance of cysteine biosynthesis in antioxidative defense.

One-half of the transformed JM39/5 E. coli was cultured on a M9 agar plate (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4–5 days. Eleven and nine colonies grew on the M9 cys- plate, on which the E. histolytica and E. dispar cDNA library-transfected cells were plated, respectively, whereas approximately 104colonies grew on the M9 cys+ plates. After screening twice, these putative E. histolytica or E. dispar SAT cDNA clones were confirmed to complement cysteine auxotrophy of JM39/5 cells. Total DNA was isolated and purified from trophozoites as described previously (26Nickel R. Tannich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We constructed a plasmid that produced glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-EhSAT fusion protein. An open reading frame (ORF) encoding EhSAT was amplified by PCR using cDNA as a template, oligonucleotide primers (5′-ggtggatccccgacaattacatttattcaattgcac-3′ and 5′-gacgttggatccttaaatcgatggtgaatttgct-3′ (BamHI sites underlined), and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cycling parameters were: 1) denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min; 2) annealing at 60 °C for 1 min; 3) elongation at 72 °C for 1 min; 4) 30 cycles. The 0.9-kilobase PCR fragment was digested withBamHI, electrophoresed, purified with Geneclean kit II (BIO 101, Vista, CA), and cloned into BamHI-digested pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the same orientation as thetac promoter to produce pGEX-SAT. E. coli JM39/5 strain was transformed with pGEX-SAT, and cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 37 °C for 2 h. The bacteria were harvested, washed with PBS, sonicated, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The GST-EhSAT fusion protein was purified from the supernatant fraction using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified GST-EhSAT was dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 10 h, reapplied onto the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, and digested in the column with factor Xa (New England Biolabs) at room temperature for 24 h. The recombinant EhSAT, which contained EhSAT and an extra three amino acids (GIP) at the amino terminus, was eluted from the column and dialyzed against PBS. After 108 E. histolyticatrophozoites were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA; 1 mm each of dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64); and 10 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (buffer A). The suspension was then subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, filtrated through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate membrane, and applied to a gel filtration column of TOYOPEAL HW 55 S (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with buffer A with or without 0.4 m NaCl. Elution was carried out with the same solution, and each fraction was analyzed for CS and SAT and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Approximately 10 μg of the purified recombinant GST-EhSAT was mixed with a 10-fold excess amount of purified recombinant EhCS1 (10Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) either in PBS or buffer A at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking. The mixture was then passed through an equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. After extensive washing with PBS or buffer A, 1 ml each of 1 mm O-acetylserine and 1 mm glutathione was sequentially applied to the column, and eluents were collected and concentrated with Centricon 10 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, CA). Each fraction was subjected to CS and SAT assays as well as SDS-PAGE analysis. A possible interaction between CS and SAT was assayed using the yeast two-hybrid system (for reviews, see e.g.Refs. 32Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1639-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 33McNabb D.S. Guarente L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). An ORF of EhCS1 and EhSAT was amplified by PCR using a set of oligonucleotide primers containing appropriate restriction sites and cloned into pAS2–1 (CLONTECH Laboratories) that contained GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DB), and pACT2 that contained GAL4 activation domain (AD) to make plasmid constructs (i.e. pDB-CS, pDB-SAT, pAD-CS, and pAD-SAT) to produce fusion proteins (DB-CS, DB-SAT, AD-CS, and AD-SAT, respectively). The entire ORF of each fusion construct was sequenced to verify the absence of mutations or frameshifts. pDB-CS, pDB-SAT, or pTD1 was co-introduced into S. cerevisiae Y184 strain together with pAD-CS, pAD-SAT, or pVA3 by the lithium acetate method (34Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected in a minimal medium (35Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) lacking tryptophan and leucine. Cultivation and lysis of the co-transformed yeasts, and β-galactosidase assay of the yeast lysates using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Physical maps of the plasmids described below are shown in Fig.1. A 1670-bp fragment containing the firefly luciferase gene (LUC) ORF was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5′-ctaagcttaatggaagacgcca-3′ and 5′-gggtcgacttacaatttggac-3′ (restriction sites underlined) and plasmid p72BGL (36Nozaki T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as a template. The 370-bp EhCS1upstream region was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-gggaattcatagataattaa-3′ and 5′-gaaagcttgttaatgtgttt-3′ and plasmid pEhCSg1 (10Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which contained the upstream, ORF, and downstream regions ofEhCS1. The 776-bp EhCS1 downstream region was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-gggtcgactaatttgaattg-3′ and 5′-gaggtaccaccgtattgtct-3′ and pEhCSg1. TheEhCS1 upstream, the LUC ORF, and theEhCS1 downstream regions were sequentially cloned into pBluescript SK+ II (pBS, Stratagene) to construct the plasmid pCLC. pNEOLUC was constructed by cloning an end-trimmed 1.7-kilobaseEcoRI-HindIII fragment (NEO cassette) that contains the ORF of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NEO) and the actin upstream and downstream regions of pA5′A3′NEO (37Hamann L. Nickel R. Tannich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8975-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) into the SmaI site of pCLC. We constructed pCSC by replacing the LUC ORF of pCLC with the EhSAT ORF that had been PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide primers 5′-ggaaagcttaatggacaattacatttattc-3′ and 5′-gtagtcgacttaaatcgatggtgaatttg-3′ and 0.1 μg of genomic DNA as template. The NEO cassette was cloned into theSmaI site of pCSC to produce pNEOSAT. To construct pNEOCS, the NEO cassette was cloned into the SmaI site of pEhCSg1. Distances between the putative regulatory elements in theEhCS1 upstream region (38Singh U. Rogers J.B. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8812-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the initiation codon ofLUC, EhCS1, or EhSAT in pNEOLUC, pNEOCS, and pNEOSAT were identical to those in the chromosomalEhCS1 locus. To create the E. histolytica cell lines that overproduced firefly luciferase (LUC), EhCS1, and EhSAT, the wild-type trophozoites were transformed with pNEOLUC, pNEOCS, or pNEOSAT by liposome-mediated transfection (39Olvera A. Olvera F. Vines R.R. Recillas-Targa F. Lizardi P.M. Dhar S. Bhattacharya S. Petri W. Alagon A. Arch. Med. Res. 1997; 28 (suppl.): 49-51Google Scholar). Approximately 105trophozoites were seeded onto 35-mm diameter wells of a six-well culture plate and cultivated in 12 ml of TYI-S-33 medium with a sticky attachment tape covering the top of the wells at 35 °C for 15 h. The LipofectAMINE-plasmid DNA complexes were prepared in OPTI-MEM I medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5 mg/mll-cysteine and 1 mg/ml ascorbic acid (transfection medium). Thirty μl of the transfection medium containing 3 μg of one of the plasmids was mixed with 15 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies) and kept at room temperature for 15 min. This mixture was combined with 20 μg (10 μl) of LipofectAMINE, kept at room temperature for 15 min, diluted with 945 μl of transfection medium, and added to the seeded trophozoites after removing TYI-S-33 medium. The plate was then incubated at 35 °C for 3 h. After incubation with the LipofectAMINE-DNA complex, 70–90% of the trophozoites were viable. The trophozoites were transferred to fresh medium and further cultivated at 35 °C for 18 h. G418 was then added to the cultures at 6 μg/ml. The amoeba lysates were electrolytically reduced at a current of 6 mm for 1 h (40Kadin H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 41Saetre R. Labenstein D.L. Anal. Chem. 1978; 50: 276-280Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) before deproteinization with perchloric acid. The thiol content was determined by measuring A412of the reduced product of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoate (42Jocelyn P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). An extinction coefficient of 14150m−1 cm−1 at 412 nm was used for 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoate. To assess the short term sensitivity of the transformants to hydrogen peroxide, the trophozoites were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1% glucose (PBSG) three times and resuspended in PBSG at 2.5 × 104/ml. One hundred μl of the cell suspension was mixed with an equal amount of PBSG containing various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and incubated at 25 °C. A 5-μl aliquot was taken at various times and mixed with 0.4% trypan blue, and viable cells were counted. To evaluate long term effect of hydrogen peroxide on growth, 3 × 104 trophozoites of the transformants were inoculated to 6 ml of TYI-S-33 medium in the presence or absence of 4, 8, or 12 mm hydrogen peroxide and cultivated at 35 °C for 48 h. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured by titration with potassium permanganate in the presence of 0.1n sulfuric acid. Experiments were performed in triplicate three times. Approximately 0.02–0.1% of E. coli transformants transfected with the E. histolytica or E. dispar cDNA library grew on the M9 cys− plate. Nucleotide sequences of five randomly chosen putativeE. histolytica SAT cDNA clones were identical in the overlapping region. The cDNA clone with the longest insert contained a partial ORF encoding a protein with significant similarities to SATs from other organisms. We have designated this gene as EhSAT. Five randomly chosen putative E. disparSAT cDNA clones were categorized into two groups based on the nucleotide sequences. Nucleotide sequences of three clones were identical in the overlapping region, and one of these contained a complete ORF, designated as the EdSAT1 gene. Sequences of two other E. dispar SAT cDNA clones were identical but differed from the EdSAT1 ORF at 7 nucleotide positions. We have designated this gene as EdSAT2. The fact thatEdSAT1 and EdSAT2 cDNA clones were obtained with comparable frequencies indicates that both of theEdSAT1 and EdSAT2 cDNAs encoded the functional SAT and that they were expressed in comparable amounts at the steady-state mRNA level. The composite sequence ofEhSAT revealed a 918-bp ORF that encoded a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34,404 Da and a pI of 6.63. EdSAT1 contained a 918-bp ORF that encoded a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34264 Da and a pI of 6.51. Southern blot analysis using the 32P-dCTP-labeledEhSAT cDNA probe showed that the restriction endonucleases that did not cut the EhSAT protein coding region gave a single band (data not shown). This indicates that theEhSAT gene exists as a single copy in the trophozoites ofE. histolytica. The deduced amino acid sequences of EhSAT, EdSAT1, andEdSAT2 were homologous to those of the SATs of bacterial and plant origins (Fig. 2) and revealed 36–52% identities within the most conserved region (corresponding to amino acids 106–261 of EhSAT). Among the homologues from other species, the SATs from two species of Cyanobacteria, Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 (accession numbers U23436 (43Nicholson M.L. Gaasenbeek M. Laudenbach D.E. Mol. Gen.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) showed the highest identities (48–52%) in the conserved region. One chromosomal (U23436) and one plasmid-borne SAT gene (srpH, L41665) were reported from Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, of which the latter showed the highest identity to the amoebic"

The absence of either α5 or α7 integrins leads to degenerative disorders of skeletal muscle, muscular dystrophies. To understand the cell survival signals that are mediated by integrin engagement with matrix proteins, we studied the early signaling events initiated by the attachment of muscle cells to fibronectin, an interaction that is mediated primarily by α5 integrins. Cells that express α5integrin rapidly spread on fibronectin, and this process is associated with the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Cells deficient in α5 integrin failed to spread or promote FAK phosphorylation when plated on fibronectin. For α5-expressing cells, both spreading and FAK phosphorylation could be blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), indicating that PKC is necessary for this “outside-in signaling” mediated by α5 integrin. Surprisingly, activators of PKC could promote spreading and FAK phosphorylation in α5-deficient muscle cells plated on fibronectin. This PKC-induced cell spreading appeared to be due to activation of α4 integrins (“inside-out signaling”) since it could be blocked by peptides that specifically inhibit α4integrin binding to fibronectin.

Such interactions are important in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar). Matrix proteins also function to promote survival of many cell types via integrins, as disruption of the binding of integrins to specific components of the extracellular matrix can lead to cell death (2Bates R.C. Lincz L.F. Burns G.F. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The importance of integrin signaling in the survival of muscle cells is demonstrated by the recent reports of muscular degenerative disorders in mice with specific integrin deficiencies (4Mayer U. Saher G. Faessler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. von der Mark H. Miosge N. Poeschi E. von der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 5Taverna D.

Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) showed that mice that are homozygous null for the gene encoding α7 integrin (which is a receptor for laminin) develop normally, but begin to show signs of muscle cell death by several weeks after birth. The degenerative process continues throughout life such that by 100 days of age, over half of all myofibers in limb muscle show signs of previous cell death and subsequent regeneration. Similarly, Taverna et al. (5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mice with a deficiency of α5 integrin (which is a receptor for fibronectin) develop a degenerative disorder of muscle as well. Muscle cells deficient in α5 integrin have impaired survival both in vivo and in vitro (5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These reports together indicate that expression of both α5 and α7 integrins is necessary for long-term integrity of myofibers. The intracellular signaling cascades that are activated when integrins bind to their extracellular ligands are varied (6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). These biochemical changes indicate that integrins are true signaling molecules, transmitting information from the extracellular compartment into the cell, so-called “outside-in signaling” (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 7Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). The specific pathways appear to differ depending on the specific integrin/ligand interaction and the type of cell. One of the earliest changes initiated by integrin engagement is clustering of integrins at focal adhesions and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as paxillin, talin, and the cytosolic enzyme focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 (8Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

FAK phosphorylation is considered to be a critical step in the downstream signaling that promotes cell spreading and cell survival. Although the details of these more distal events remain to be elucidated, there is evidence that the binding of integrins to their ligands may activate pathways that prevent apoptosis in a variety of cell types (3Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 12Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) appears to be one of the key intermediates in integrin-mediated signaling in many cell types (6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 7Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). In certain cell types, inhibition of PKC activity results in the inhibition of cell attachment and spreading as well as FAK phosphorylation (13Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 1: 152-161Crossref Google Scholar). Activation of PKC can promote the cellular changes mediated by integrin/matrix interactions (15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

These results together demonstrate a specific role of PKC in integrin-mediated signal transduction. Although integrin engagement leads to signal cascade activation, it is also clear that the process of cell attachment and spreading involves an “activation” of integrins themselves (“inside-out signaling”) such that there is increased affinity of the integrin for its extracellular matrix ligand. This activation promotes cell adhesion and may be an important step in the morphological changes that cells undergo when spreading on a solid substrate. Several studies have demonstrated that cell spreading is induced by PKC activation (15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Haller H. Lindschau C. Maash C. Olthoff H. Kurscheid D. Luft F.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Vuori and Ruoslahti (15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that PKC activity increases preceding cell spreading on fibronectin, but not on polylysine, indicating that PKC-mediated cell spreading depends upon the nature of the substrate with which the cell is in contact, as would be expected for a specific ligand/receptor interaction. In this report, we present evidence of outside-in signaling pathways that are initiated when muscle cells attach to fibronectin via α5 integrins (which are primarily, if not exclusively, α5β1 heterodimers). As in other cells, FAK phosphorylation appears to be an early and critical event in integrin-mediated signaling that leads to cell spreading and cell survival. We found that PKC activation is necessary for cell spreading on fibronectin. Surprisingly, we also found that PKC activation is sufficient to induce cell spreading on fibronectin even in the absence of α5 integrins. This appears to be due to inside-out signaling and activation of α4 integrins, which can then mediate cell attachment and spreading and FAK phosphorylation. These results provide evidence of the involvement of PKC in both outside-in and inside-out integrin signaling in a positive feedback process and of cross-talk between integrins. A model of integrin signaling pathways involved in muscle cell spreading and survival is presented. Cells deficient in α5 integrins were derived from limb muscles of neonatal mice that were chimeric for α5 integrin expression, as described (5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The muscles were cultured to isolate pure populations of myoblasts, and α5-deficient cells were selected by maintaining the cells in G418 for at least 2 weeks (5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells expressing α5integrin were generated by retrovirus-mediated transfer of a human α5 cDNA into α5-deficient cells; as controls, α5-deficient cells were infected with a control retrovirus (5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For growth, all cells were plated on dishes coated with 5 μg/ml laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in growth medium consisting of Ham's F-10 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). For assessment of cell adhesion and spreading on different substrates, 60-mm dishes were coated with fibronectin (5 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.), the GRGDNP (RGD) peptide (10–20 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.), or the DELPQLVTLPHPNLHGPEILDVPST (EILDV) peptide (20 μg/ml; Sigma) for 24 h at room temperature. One hour before plating, all dishes were coated with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells were trypsinized, treated as indicated, and then plated for 30 min. For study of peptide inhibition of spreading, the RGD or LDV peptide was preincubated with the cell in suspension for 20 min and plated on fibronectin in the presence of the respective peptide for 30 min. The cultures were assessed and photographed using a 40× phase-contrast immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. After trypsinization, cells were plated on fibronectin or the indicated peptides for 30 min. For PKC activation, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Alexis Biochemicals Corp., San Diego, CA) was added to the cells in suspension for 10 min at the indicated concentrations. The cells were spun, and the medium was changed before plating on respective substrate-coated dishes for 30 min. For PKC inhibition, bisindolylmaleimide I (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) or light-activated calphostin C (Sigma) was added to the cells in suspension for 20 min prior to plating. The protein kinase A activator dibutyryl cAMP (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was added 20 min prior to plating at 100 μm. After 30 min of plating, attached and unattached cells were collected, spun, and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells from both fractions were pooled and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing aprotinin (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μg/ml), sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (10 mm), and sodium fluoride (10 mm). Equal amounts of protein from precleared extracts were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-FAK antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 3 h on ice, followed by incubation with protein G-agarose for 1 h. Proteins from total extracts or after immunoprecipitation were electrophoresed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:5000; PY-99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were also probed (or reprobed after stripping) with the anti-FAK polyclonal antibodies (1:500) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Specific antibody binding was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, the bands were quantitated using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. We have shown previously that α5-deficient cells survive poorly and undergo apoptotic cell death when plated on fibronectin as the sole substrate (5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The poor survival of α5-deficient cells is reflected by the absence of spreading on fibronectin, whereas cells that express α5integrin attach and spread readily on fibronectin (Fig.1 A). In many cell types, the process of attachment and spreading is coincident with the formation of focal adhesions and the phosphorylation of FAK as well as other proteins that localize to focal adhesions (8Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Rynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 9Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Indeed, α5-expressing cells demonstrate robust FAK phosphorylation when plated on fibronectin (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with their inability to attach and spread, α5-deficient cells do not manifest any FAK phosphorylation on fibronectin (Fig. 1 B). However, the machinery to attach, spread, and form focal adhesions is clearly present in α5-deficient cells as evidenced by both cell spreading (Fig. 1 A) and robust FAK phosphorylation (Fig.1 B) when plated on laminin. Thus, the morphological and biochemical abnormalities of α5-deficient cells plated on fibronectin are not the result of a more generalized cellular defect. As further evidence that α5β1 integrin is the primary fibronectin receptor in normal muscle cells that mediates cell spreading and focal adhesion formation, we inhibited the binding of α5 integrins to fibronectin. The RGD peptide represents the region of the fibronectin protein to which α5 integrins bind (19Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2820) Google Scholar, 20Yamada K.M. Kennedy D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Of the other known fibronectin-binding integrins, only α4β1has been shown to be present in muscle (21Rosen G.D. Sanes J.R. LaChance R. Cunnigham J.M. Roman J. Dean D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 1107-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar); and α4β1 binds to fibronectin via a different peptide domain, the EILDV domain (22Guan J.L. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1990; 60: 53-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Thus, we used soluble RGD peptide to inhibit specifically the interaction of α5β1 with fibronectin. In solution, the RGD peptide acts as an inhibitor of binding even though the peptide can itself serve as an effective binding site for α5β1 integrin when immobilized on a solid surface (23Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 24Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows the effect of different concentrations of RGD peptide in solution on the phosphorylation of FAK when α5-expressing cells were plated on fibronectin. There was a dose-dependent inhibition of FAK phosphorylation by the RGD peptide, reaching 50% inhibition between 100 and 200 μm. The RGD effect was also reflected by an inhibition of cell attachment and spreading (data not shown). Clearly, the interaction of muscle cells with fibronectin requires an integrin that interacts with fibronectin via the RGD domain. This is further supported by the data presented in Fig.2 B. Here, the phosphorylation of FAK is compared when wild-type cells were plated on either fibronectin or immobilized RGD peptide. Myoblasts plated on the RGD peptide revealed the same extent of FAK phosphorylation as cells plated on fibronectin. Immobilized RGD peptide promoted the attachment and spreading of muscle cells as effectively as did fibronectin, consistent with the results of FAK phosphorylation. These data using the RGD peptide either as an inhibitor of fibronectin binding (when in solution) or as a ligand for α5 integrin (when immobilized), together with the data with α5-deficient cells (Fig. 1), strongly suggest that α5β1 integrin is the primary fibronectin receptor in myoblasts. Any other fibronectin receptors present on the cell surface are inadequate under such conditions to promote effectively the attachment, spreading, and formation of focal adhesions on fibronectin. Among the various signaling cascades that have been implicated in cell spreading and focal adhesion formation on fibronectin, PKC activation has been reported to be essential in several cell types (13Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the PKC pathway was necessary for spreading and FAK phosphorylation of myoblasts plated on fibronectin, we used two specific PKC inhibitors, calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide I. Both inhibitors were effective in blocking cell spreading and FAK phosphorylation when α5-expressing myoblasts were plated on fibronectin. However, calphostin C, used in this experiment, was found to be more potent in blocking cell spreading. Fig.3 A shows that the attachment and spreading of myoblasts was inhibited in the presence of calphostin C at doses that have been shown to block PKC activity (15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed complete cell spreading inhibition at 1 μm. In addition, calphostin C produced a dose-dependent inhibition of FAK phosphorylation in myoblasts plated on fibronectin without causing any change in the levels of FAK protein (Fig. 3 B). Clearly, PKC activation is necessary for integrin-mediated cell spreading in muscle cells. Because PKC activity appears to be critical to α5integrin-mediated muscle cell spreading and because PKC activation has been shown to promote and/or enhance cell spreading of different cell types (15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Haller H. Lindschau C. Maash C. Olthoff H. Kurscheid D. Luft F.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of PKC activation on both α5-expressing and α5-deficient myoblasts on fibronectin. As in other cells, activation of PKC with PMA led to more rapid spreading and FAK phosphorylation of α5-expressing cells (data not shown). To our surprise, PKC activation also led to rapid spreading (Fig. 4 A) and phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 4 B) in α5-deficient cells. This was clearly dependent on a fibronectin receptor because in dishes coated with only bovine serum albumin, PMA was ineffective in promoting spreading or FAK phosphorylation (Figs. 4, A and B). This was intriguing because whatever other fibronectin receptors might be present on α5-deficient cells, they were clearly inadequate to promote attachment and spreading without concurrent PKC activation (Figs. 1 and 2). The results of Fig. 4 (A andB) indicate that PKC activation might not only mediate downstream events of α5-mediated outside-in signaling (Fig. 3), but might also be acting in inside-out signaling to promote cell attachment to fibronectin through another fibronectin receptor. This action was specific for PKC activation because it was blocked by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, activation of protein kinase A with dibutyryl cAMP had no effect (Fig. 4 C), showing that it was not a nonspecific consequence of serine/threonine kinase activation. The puzzle was which fibronectin-binding protein might be mediating this interaction. As mentioned previously, of the known fibronectin-binding integrins, the only one that has been shown to be expressed by muscle cells other than α5β1 is α4β1, albeit in low abundance (21Rosen G.D. Sanes J.R. LaChance R. Cunnigham J.M. Roman J. Dean D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 1107-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PMA might increase the affinity of α4integrins on the cell surface for fibronectin via an inside-out signaling pathway. Thus, when sufficiently activated, α4integrins would then be competent to mediate cell spreading and focal adhesion formation on fibronectin. To test whether PKC-dependent spreading of α5-deficient cells on fibronectin was indeed mediated by α4 integrins, we blocked the binding of α4 integrins to fibronectin with a specific peptide inhibitor. The cells were treated in solution with the EILDV peptide, which, as mentioned above, represents the α4 integrin-binding domain on fibronectin. In the presence of the EILDV peptide, PMA treatment was ineffective in promoting spreading or FAK phosphorylation of α5-deficient cells on fibronectin (Fig.5 A). As an additional test of the hypothesis that, upon PKC activation, the effective adhesion and spreading of α5-deficient cells on fibronectin are mediated by α4 integrin activation, we tested untreated and PMA-treated α5-deficient cells on different substrates (Fig. 5, B and C). As shown above, PMA stimulation promoted adhesion and FAK phosphorylation on fibronectin. Consistent with the idea that this interaction is mediated by α4 integrins, immobilized EILDV peptide was as effective as fibronectin in promoting spreading and FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C). Immobilized RGD peptide was ineffective as a substrate, indicating that other fibronectin-binding integrins that interact with the RGD domain of fibronectin (e.g.α3β1 or αvβ6 (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar)) either were not present or were not activated upon PMA stimulation. Thus, whereas we cannot conclude that α4 integrin is the only integrin activated by increased PKC activity in α5-deficient myoblasts, it certainly appears that α4 is the critical integrin that promotes spreading on fibronectin under these conditions. Using both pharmacological and genetic approaches, we have demonstrated that α5 integrins mediate muscle cell spreading via PKC activation (outside-in signaling) and that PKC activation promotes muscle cell spreading on fibronectin by enhancing the binding of either α5 or α4 integrins (inside-out signaling). Below we present a model of integrin signaling that involves these distinct but interacting pathways (Fig.6). Upon integrin engagement with extracellular matrix proteins, there is a clustering of the integrins at focal adhesions (25Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). This aggregation leads in turn to the phosphorylation of various proteins, including FAK, talin, vinculin, and paxillin, and also to their localization to focal adhesions (10Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 25Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that activation of PKC is necessary for the interaction of α5 integrin with fibronectin to promote FAK phosphorylation and spreading of muscle cells. This adds to the growing body of evidence of the importance of PKC in outside-in integrin signaling. Woods and Couchman (13Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that kinase inhibitors prevent focal adhesion formation in fibroblasts plated on fibronectin. They also found that activation of PKC leads to the localization of proteins such as talin and vinculin to focal adhesions. Paxillin may in fact be a substrate for PKC, as it is phosphorylated on serine residues in a PKC-dependent manner (26De Nichilo M.O. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11016-11022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31172-31181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using specific PKC inhibitors, Haimovich et al.(14Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 1: 152-161Crossref Google Scholar) showed that PKC plays a crucial role in integrin signaling and FAK phosphorylation in platelets. Haller et al. (18Haller H. Lindschau C. Maash C. Olthoff H. Kurscheid D. Luft F.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that PKCα and PKCε translocate to nuclear structures and focal adhesions upon the binding of vascular smooth muscle cells to fibronectin. These results together suggest that PKC is an essential component in the proximal signaling pathway triggered by the binding of integrins to their ligands in certain cell types. Inside-out signaling is considered to be the main mechanism by which cells regulate integrin function (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 7Juliano R.L.

Acta. 1995; 1242: 77-98PubMed Google Scholar, 29Faull R.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins in an inactive state have a low affinity for their ligands; activation of integrins in response to specific physiological stimuli is associated with, or even defined as, an increased affinity for their ligands (29Faull R.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies with genetically deficient cells allow us to study inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling independently of one another and suggest that PKC activation can mediate inside-out signaling in muscle cells. Whereas α5-deficient cells failed to spread on fibronectin, treatment of the cells with PMA to activate PKC led to rapid and robust spreading and FAK phosphorylation. These events appear to have been mediated by the activation of α4 integrins since they were blocked by soluble EILDV peptide and promoted by immobilized EILDV peptide in place of fibronectin. The subsequent phosphorylation of FAK observed under these conditions would thus be due to the initiation of outside-in signaling via activated α4/fibronectin interactions. Several reports previously demonstrated enhancement of spreading on fibronectin by activation of PKC (15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brown P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Vuori and Ruoslahti (15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that activation of PKC activity is necessary for the adhesion, spreading, and migration of cells. Although T cells have integrins that bind fibronectin and laminin, it was shown that they will attach to these matrix molecules only upon PKC activation (32Shimizu Y. Van Seventer G.A. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These data reveal two important characteristics of integrin signaling. First, because PKC activation is both necessary for outside-in signaling and sufficient to promote inside-out signaling, a positive feedback loop is created. Indeed, the gradual morphological changes associated with cell spreading suggest a multistep process involving first the detection of the extracellular environment by the cell and then a progressive change of the cell membrane to interact with that environment. This is demonstrated most clearly by the fact that the changes do not occur when cells are plated in the absence of immobilized matrix proteins to which integrins can bind (10Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of such proteins initiates a signaling cascade inside the cells, and the cells in turn both alter their membrane properties to interact with the ligands and organize the ligands into a complex matrix. A positive feedback loop is intrinsic to such a process. The other interesting system characteristic that is highlighted by our data is cross-talk between integrins. In our cells, the consequences of outside-in signaling via α5 integrins lead to activation of α4 integrins. Lichtner et al. (33Lichtner R.B. Howlett A.R. Lerch M. Xuan J.A. Brink J. Langton-Webster B. Schneider M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) provided evidence of negative cooperativity between integrins with regard to affinity for extracellular matrix proteins. Kolanus and Seed (34Kolanus W. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) pointed out that multiple signaling pathways, in particular PKC, not only converge from different integrins, but also modulate integrin affinity, thus supporting direct cross-talk between different integrins in the cell. The model suggested by these data is a positive feedback loop of integrin engagement, signaling, and activation. In this model (Fig. 6), integrins exist in a dynamic equilibrium between an active state and an inactive state. When there is a sufficient number of active integrins for effective engagement with their extracellular ligands, outside-in signaling is initiated, leading to an increase in PKC activity, a further increase in integrin activation and affinity (inside-out signaling), and further outside-in signaling. This positive feedback loop promotes biochemical changes, including FAK phosphorylation and focal adhesion formation, which in turn lead to a downstream cascade of biochemical changes and changes in gene expression. The property of integrin cross-talk is demonstrated by the fact that initiation of the signaling pathway of one integrin can lead directly to the activation of another integrin. Clearly, these pathways would depend upon the specific cell type since different cells have different patterns of integrin expression and may have different balances between active and inactive states of those integrins. The use of genetically deficient cells in combination with specific integrin agonists and antagonists as we have used here will further reveal the details of these complex interactions. We previously demonstrated that a deficiency of α5 integrin leads to apoptotic death of muscle cells (5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Vachon et al. (35Vachon P.H. Xu H. Liu L. Loechel F. Hayashi Y. Arahata K. Reed J.C. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) showed that blockage of the binding of β1 integrins leads to apoptotic death of myotubes in culture. Other investigators have likewise demonstrated apoptosis of cells in which the interactions between integrins and matrix proteins have been disrupted (2Bates R.C. Lincz L.F. Burns G.F. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These data suggest that integrin signaling induces cell survival pathways, whereas a relative deficiency of those signals may initiate cell death pathways. The role of integrin signaling in muscle cell survival is most clearly demonstrated by the muscle degenerative disorders that develop in mice deficient in either α5 or α7 integrins (4Mayer U. Saher G. Faessler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. von der Mark H. Miosge N. Poeschi E. von der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar,5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A muscular degenerative disorder in humans was recently shown to be due to a mutation in the α7 integrin gene (38Hayashi Y.K. Chou F.L. Engvall E. Ogawa M. Matsuda C. Hirabayashi S. Yokochi K. Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. Kaufman S.J. Ozawa E. Gotto Y. Nonaka I. Tsukahara T. Wang J.Z. Hoffman E.P. Arahata K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Clearly, muscle cells possess multiple integrins with different matrix binding capacities, and those integrins function to maintain the integrity of differentiated muscle fibers. It is thus easy to understand why a deficiency of a single integrin does not prevent muscle growth, differentiation, and maturation. However, over time, a deficiency of specific integrins can result in a gradual, progressive death of muscle cells (4Mayer U. Saher G. Faessler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. von der Mark H. Miosge N. Poeschi E. von der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 5Taverna D. Disatnik M.-H. Rayburn H. Bronson R.T. Yang J. Rando T.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), as might be expected when there is a deficiency of one survival pathway amid many. The phenotype is not one of arrested development or immediate and widespread death. Rather, the phenotype represents a tilt in the balance between survival and death reflected in the gradual and stochastic loss of cells over time. Such a shift in balance in cellular signaling and gradual muscle cell loss may also be a model for the mechanism of muscle cell death in muscular dystrophies due to genetic defects in other membrane-associated proteins such merosin, dystrophin, and the sarcoglycans (39Matsumura K. Campbell K. Muscle Nerve. 1994; 17: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Like the multicomponent complex of proteins associated with integrins, these proteins form a stable complex at the membrane with links to the extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal structures. Less is known about the possible cell survival signals mediated by these proteins, although the muscle-specific form of laminin, merosin, has been shown to promote muscle cell survival (40Vachon P.H. Loechel F. Xu H. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1483-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and a reduction in α-dystroglycan leads to muscle cell apoptosis (41Montanaro F. Lindenbaum L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, muscular dystrophies due to abnormalities of integrin pathways may serve as a useful paradigm for similar investigations of pathogenetic mechanisms in other muscular dystrophies.

One such class of zinc metalloproteases, represented by neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP)1and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), has recently been highlighted because of their implications in some disease states and should thus provide plausible therapeutic targets for certain diseases (2Yanagisawa M. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3Turner A.J. Murphy L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In mammals, six members of this metalloprotease family have been identified: NEP; Kell blood group antigen (KELL); ECE-1 and ECE-2; PEX, which has been associated with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets; and the recently identified “orphan” peptidase XCE. All these members are type II integral membrane proteins containing a highly conserved consensus sequence of a zinc-binding motif, HEXXH (whereX represents any amino acid), in their extracellular C-terminal domain. Despite the apparent structural similarity among the members of this family, a large diversity of physiological functions exists. NEP, which is especially abundant in kidney and brain, is also expressed in various tissues as an ectoenzyme that can degrade many circulating small peptide mediators, such as enkephalins, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), tachykinins, and endothelins (ETs) (5Roques B.P. Noble F. Dauge V. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Beaumont A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 87-146PubMed Google Scholar). NEP is also known as the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, and its presence on leukemic cells has been associated with a better prognosis. Although the physiological substrates of NEP are still unknown, targeted disruption of the NEP gene in mice caused a dramatic sensitivity to endotoxin shock, suggesting that NEP may provide an unexpected protective role against endotoxin shock (6Lu B. Gerard N.P. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Bozza M. Zurakowski D. Finco O. Carroll M.C. Gerard C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2271-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vivo pharmacological inhibition of NEP has led to a decrease in blood pressure, and NEP-deficient mice were noted to have lower mean blood pressure levels than wild-type littermates, thus indicating that NEP may also play an important role in blood pressure regulation (7Lu B. Figini M. Emanueli C. Geppetti P. Grady E.F. Gerard N.P. Ansell J. Payan D.G. Gerard C. Bunnett N. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 904-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). ECE, another well characterized member of this metalloprotease family, is involved in the regulation of vascular tone, as well as in the development of some sets of neural crest cells (3Turner A.J. Murphy L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It converts the inactive ET precursors (big ETs) into biologically active ETs via a specific cleavage at Trp21-Val/Ile22 (8Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10284) Google Scholar, 9Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). ECE constitutes a potential regulatory site for the production of the active peptide. Two isozymes of ECE, ECE-1 and ECE-2, have been molecularly identified and make up a subfamily within this group of type II membrane-bound metalloproteases (9Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 10Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Both enzymes have been shown to cleave big ET-1 to produce ET-1 with a similar overall profile of inhibitor sensitivity in vitro as well as in transfected cells. However, ECE-1 and ECE-2 exhibit the following striking differences: (i) ECE-1 cleaves big endothelins in neutral pH, whereas ECE-2 functions in an acidic pH range, (ii) the sensitivity of ECE-1 to phosphoramidon is 250-fold lower as compared with ECE-2, and (iii) ECE-1 is abundantly expressed in endothelial cells and other cell types known to produce mature ET-1, whereas ECE-2 mRNA is detected in neural tissues including the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the adrenal medulla. Targeted disruption of the ECE-1 gene in mice revealed that ECE-1 is the physiologically relevant enzyme needed to produce active ET-1 (11Yanagisawa H. Yanagisawa M. Kapur R.P. Richardson J.A. Williams S.C. Clouthier D.E. de Wit D. Emoto N. Hammer R.E. Development. 1998; 125: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of ECE-2 has not yet been elucidated. The physiological substrates of the three other mammalian peptidases, KELL, PEX, and XCE, are still unknown. KELL, expressed on human red cells and other cell types, carries the epitopes for the Kell minor blood group antigen (12Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although the Kell blood group antigen is clinically important, its actual protease activity has yet to be described. The PEX gene was identified by positional cloning as a candidate gene for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, a dominant disorder characterized by impaired phosphate uptake in the kidney (13Francis F. Hennig S. Korn B. Reinhardt R. de Jong P. Poustka A. Lehrach H. Rowe P.S.N. Goulding J.N. Summerfield T. Mountford R. Read A.P. Popowska E. Pronicka E. Davies K.E. O'Riordan J.L.H. Econs M.J. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Oudet C. Pannetier S. Hanauer A. Strom T.M. Meindl A. Lorenz B. Cagnoli M. Mohnike K.L. Murken J. Meitinger T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). XCE was recently isolated by screening expressed sequence tag data base with the ECE-1 sequence (14Valdenaire O. Richards J.G. Faull R.L.M. Schweizer A. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). No protease activity for XCE has been detected; hence, its physiological significance is unknown. Recent gene targeting studies of ECE revealed that ECE-1 is a bona fide activating protease for big ET-1 and big ET-3 at specific developmental stages (11Yanagisawa H. Yanagisawa M. Kapur R.P. Richardson J.A. Williams S.C. Clouthier D.E. de Wit D. Emoto N. Hammer R.E. Development. 1998; 125: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the absence of ECE-1 (which resulted in craniofacial and cardiovascular defects), a significant amount of mature ET-1 peptide was still found inECE-1 −/− embryos, suggesting that other proteases can activate ET-1. This consideration led us to search for structurally related enzymes of this metalloprotease family. Here, we report the isolation of a novel enzyme, termed soluble secreted endopeptidase (SEP), by degenerate PCR using cDNA prepared fromECE-1 −/− embryos as template. The cDNA sequence predicts that SEP is a type II membrane-bound metalloprotease structurally related to NEP, ECE-1, and ECE-2. Transfection of the SEP cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells resulted in the presence of SEP protein not only in the membrane fraction of the cells but also in the supernatant, suggesting that these cells release soluble forms of the enzyme through proper secretory machinery. Enzymological analysis of the recombinant soluble SEP protein revealed that SEP hydrolyzes a variety of peptides, which are known as substrates of NEP and/or ECE, including big ET-1, ET-1, angiotensin I, ANP, bradykinin, and substance P. This suggest that SEP is likely a novel member of this metalloprotease family and may be involved in the metabolism of biologically active peptides. Synthetic human big ET-1 (1–38), human ET-1, ANP, angiotensin I, bradykinin, and substance P were obtained from American Peptides. Phosphoramidon, thiorphan, 1,10-phenanthroline, and captopril were obtained from Sigma. FR901533 (WS79089B) was a gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Near-termECE-1 −/− embryos were kindly provided by Dr. Masashi Yanagisawa (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). A partial cDNA clone encoding SEP was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR against wholeECE-1 −/− embryo mRNA with degenerate primers based on the highly conserved amino acid sequences of ECE-1, ECE-2, NEP, and PEX cDNAs (see Fig. 2). The PCR contained 60 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 15 mm ammonium sulfate, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.25 mm of each dNTP, 7.5 pmol of each degenerate primer, 5′-AT(A/G/C/T)GT(A/G/C/T)TT(C/T)CC(A/G/C/T)GC(A/T)GG-3′ and 5′-T(AG)TC(A/G/C/T)GC(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TT(C/T)TC-3′, 10 ng of first strand cDNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The initial five cycles were carried out at an annealing temperature of 37 °C, and then 35 more cycles were carried out at an annealing temperature of 48 °C. The PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel, and an approximately 300-base pair region was excised from the gel. The extracted DNA was subcloned into pT7 vector (Novagen) and sequenced. A cDNA library was constructed by using the SuperScript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) against poly(A)+ RNA from mouse testis. Approximately 1 × 106 plaques from the unamplified library were screened with random primed 32P-labeled RT-PCR product as probe. The 5′ end of the cDNA was cloned by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Life Technologies, Inc.) against theECE-1 −/− embryo and mouse brain. The first strand cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase by using a specific primer 5′-TCAGGTCCATTCGGTGGTACAGGGC-3′ (corresponding to amino acids 293–301 of SEP). With terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, an oligo(dC) anchor was added to the 3′ end of the first strand cDNA. The first round PCR was performed as recommended by the manufacturer with a specific 3′ primer, 5′-GACATCATGCCTTTTCTCCTGGGGG-3′ (corresponding to amino acids 283–291 of SEP) and a 5′ anchor primer. The product was then subjected to the second amplification by using a nested specific 3′ primer, 5′-ACTCCCGGGATGGCATGCCCAAGGT-3′ (corresponding to amino acids 218–226 of SEP). The product of this PCR was subcloned into pT7 vector and subsequently sequenced. For nucleotide sequencing, overlapping restriction fragments of the cDNA were subcloned into the pBluescript plasmid vector (Stratagene), and double strand plasmid DNA sequenced by a model 310 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Both strands of cDNA were covered at least twice. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 5 μg of total RNA from mouse tissues and oligo(dT)12–18 primers using SuperScript reverse transcriptase II (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. The PCR contained 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 15 mm ammonium sulfate, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, a 0.25 mm concentration of each dNTP, a 100 nmconcentration of each amplification primer, 10 ng of first strand cDNA, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. The primers, 5′-GGGAGCCATAGTGACTCTGGGTGTC-3′ (corresponding to amino acids 28–36 of SEP) and 5′-GCTATCACACAGCTTGGGGTGGTGC-3′ (corresponding to amino acids 75–83 of SEP) were used for both spliceoforms of mouse SEP. The PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. Antibody directed against SEP was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide, CPRGSPMHPMKRCRIW, corresponding to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of mouse SEP. Rabbits were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides in complete adjuvant, followed by antisera preparation. Immunoblot analysis was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG by using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Partially purified SEP and the membrane preparations from CHO/SEP and CHO/SEPΔ cells were incubated with either 1 unit of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase or peptide-N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C for 16 h. Control samples were incubated in parallel without endoglycosidases in the identical buffer at 37 °C for 16 h. The samples were then subjected to immunoblotting. CHO-K1 cells were cultured as described (15Emoto N. Nurhantari Y. Alimsardjono H. Xie J. Yamada T. Yanagisawa M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Double transfection of prepro-ET-1 and ECE-1a, SEP, or SEPΔ was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twelve hours after transfection, cells were refed with fresh medium. The medium was conditioned for an additional 18 h and was directly subjected to a sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay that showed no cross-reactivity between big ET-1 and ET-1. For in vitro enzymologic characterization, an SEP expression construct was transiently transfected into CHO-K1 cells. The medium was conditioned for 48 h in CHO-SFM II (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was subjected to a wheat germ lectin column (1 × 1 ml HiTrap wheat germ lectin; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 0.5 m NaCl. The column was washed and eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m N-acetylglucosamine. The active fraction was subsequently subjected to a Centriprep concentrator (Amicon). Cells were seeded onto coverslips and cultured for 2 days. Fluorescent immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (15Emoto N. Nurhantari Y. Alimsardjono H. Xie J. Yamada T. Yanagisawa M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, for intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), PBS containing 10% (v/v) normal goat serum was added. Following incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the normal goat serum/PBS was replaced with buffer containing polyclonal antibody (1:100) directed against bovine SEP C-terminal peptides. After incubation for 90 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed and then incubated in normal goat serum/PBS containing 7.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After 45 min at 37 °C, the cells were extensively washed. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with 90% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and 2.5% (w/v) 1,4-diazadicyclo-[2.2.2]-octane. For cell surface staining, cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Following two washes in PBS, the cells were treated with the SEP antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG as described above. Three negative control conditions were examined: staining with preimmune serum, with antibody after preabsorption, and omission of the primary antibody. None of these conditions resulted in cell staining. Reaction mixtures for enzyme assay (100 μl) contained 0.1 m MES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.5m NaCl, 0.5 μm peptide, and an enzyme fraction. For some experiments, the reactions were preincubated at 37 °C with various protease inhibitors for 15 min prior to the addition of the peptide. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1–12 h in siliconized 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The enzyme reaction was terminated by adding 1 μl of 10 mm EDTA. The mixture was then injected into a C18 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (μRPC C2/C18, ST4.6/100; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 10–80% linear gradient of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 43 min, followed by a 100% acetonitrile for an additional 3 min. Peptides were detected by absorbance at 220 nm. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectra were acquired on Voyager RP delayed extraction mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.). Radiation from a nitrogen laser (Laser Science, Inc.) (337 nm, 3-ns pulse width) was used to desorb ions from the target. All reflector delayed extraction experiments were performed using an extraction grid voltage of 14.5 kV and a pulse delay of 225 ns. A pair of highly degenerate oligonucleotide primers was designed based on conserved amino acid sequences of known members of the membrane-bound metalloprotease family: ECE-1, ECE-2, NEP, and PEX (see Fig. 2). Subsequent RT-PCR from near-term wholeECE-1 −/− mouse embryo RNA yielded cDNA products of the predicted size. We subcloned these cDNA fragments into plasmid vectors and determined the nucleotide sequence. The sequences from randomly picked plasmid clones revealed that the 300-base pair cDNA product was a mixture of two distinct cDNA sequences: most plasmid clones encoded mouse NEP, whereas the nucleotide sequence from one clone predicted a closely related polypeptide sequence to members of this metalloprotease family. We named this novel putative metalloprotease SEP. Using the cloned SEP RT-PCR product as a probe, we screened a mouse testis cDNA library, because SEP mRNA was most abundantly expressed in testis (see Fig. 3 B). We purified and sequenced several positive clones, with the overlapping nucleotide sequences of all these clones confirmed as being identical. The nucleotide sequences of the longest SEP cDNAs had a 5′ ATG triplet codon that was preceded by an in-frame stop codon and followed by a long open reading frame. The encoded amino acid sequence of SEP is shown in Fig.1.Figure 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the mouse SEP cDNA. The in-frame stop codon that precedes the 5′ ATG codon is marked by an asterisk. Sequences used for designing degenerate RT-PCR primers are marked bydots. An open box designates the predicted transmembrane domain. The sequence that is not present in SEPΔ is underlined. The zinc-binding motif is marked by a closed box. ‡, predictedN-glycosylation sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While screening to isolate a full-length SEP cDNA, we performed 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends on RNA fromECE-1 −/− embryo, mouse brain, and mouse testis using a nested set of specific internal primers to assess the 5′ diversity of SEP mRNA. This yielded two products. The nucleotide sequence of one product was identical to the 5′-end of the full-length SEP cDNA isolated by screening. However, the sequencing results of other clones revealed that they contained cDNA derived from SEP mRNA but lacked a 69-base pair nucleotide segment immediately following the putative transmembrane helix, presumably due to alternative splicing (Figs. 1 and 3 A). Based on these findings, we termed this clone SEPΔ. The SEP cDNA sequence encodes a novel 765-amino acid polypeptide, which shares important structural features with the NEP metalloprotease family (1Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar,4Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). (i) The cDNA predicts a type II integral membrane protein with a 17-residue N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a 21-residue putative transmembrane helix (Fig. 1, open box), and a large (727 residue) extracellular C-terminal part. (ii) The extracellular portion of SEP constitutes the putative catalytic domain and contains a highly conserved consensus sequence (residues 597–605) of a zinc-binding motif, ØXHEØØHØΨ (where Ø and Ψ represent an uncharged and a hydrophobic amino acid, respectively), that is shared by many metalloproteases. (iii) SEP has nine predicted sites forN-glycosylation in the extracellular domain, suggesting that SEP is a highly glycosylated protein, like NEP and ECE. (iv) There are 10 Cys residues in the extracellular domain that are conserved in all the proteins of this metalloprotease family. A search using the Entrez sequence data base pointed out a significant similarity of the SEP sequence to NEP, ECE-1, ECE-2, XCE, and PEX (Fig.2). The sequence similarity is especially high within the C-terminal one-third of the putative extracellular domain, including the region around the zinc-binding motif. Within this region (amino acids 511–765 of SEP), the identities of mouse SEP with respect to mouse NEP, human ECE-1, bovine ECE-2, and human XCE are 65.1, 47.7, 44.5, and 46.1%, respectively. Northern blot analysis using total RNA from a variety of mouse tissues revealed relatively large amounts of 3.8-kilobase SEP mRNA in testis (data not shown). Small amounts of SEP mRNA were also expressed in the ovary. No signal was observed in other tissues, including the brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and intestine. We then examined the expression of SEP and SEPΔ mRNA in various mouse tissues by RT-PCR using primers to amplify both subisoforms of SEP (Fig.3 A). Two fragments corresponding to SEP and SEPΔ (134 and 65 base pairs, respectively) were detected in all tissues examined as well as in theECE-1 −/− embryo (Fig. 3 B). Although RT-PCR is not strictly quantitative, the data suggest that SEP is the major isoform in testis, whereas SEPΔ is predominantly expressed in other tissues. To characterize the properties of cloned SEP and SEPΔ, we generated transfectant cells, CHO/SEP and CHO/SEPΔ, by transiently transfecting expression constructs driven by the SRα viral promoter (15Emoto N. Nurhantari Y. Alimsardjono H. Xie J. Yamada T. Yanagisawa M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis with an anti-SEP C-terminal peptide antiserum showed that both SEP and SEPΔ proteins are expressed as an approximate 110-kDa protein in the membrane preparation from these cells (Fig. 4). In addition, we detected appreciable amounts of SEP-immunoreactive material with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 126 kDa in culture medium conditioned with CHO/SEP cells, suggesting that these cells release soluble forms of SEP into the culture medium (Fig. 4). In contrast, we did not detect SEP immunoreactivity in the conditioned media of both CHO/SEPΔ and untransfected CHO cells. These observations demonstrate that CHO/SEP cells express the 110-kDa membrane-bound form of SEP as well as the 126-kDa soluble form of SEP in the medium, whereas CHO/SEPΔ cells express only the membrane-bound form. Because cDNA cloning of SEP revealed that it is a highly glycosylated protein, we assumed that the variation in the apparent molecular mass observed on immunoblot analysis was largely due to the presence of sugar moieties. To analyze the sugar side chains of SEP, we examined the sensitivity of both the 110-kDa membrane-bound SEP and the 126-kDa soluble forms of SEP to endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Fig.5). Proteins containing high mannose sugar moieties, found in the early secretory pathway, including the endoplasmic reticulum and a portion of the Golgi apparatus, are sensitive to both Endo H and PNGase F. In contrast, proteins of which the sugar side chains have been further modified to complex oligosaccharides, which occurs in the Golgi apparatus, are sensitive to PNGase F but resistant to Endo H. Treatment of solubilized membranes from CHO/SEP cells with either Endo H or PNGase F reduced the apparent molecular mass from 110 to 89 kDa, which corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of SEP. These observations suggest that the 110-kDa species observed in the membrane fraction of the cells is the partially glycosylated protein present in the early secretory pathway. In contrast, although PNGase F treatment of the conditioned medium reduced the size from 126 to 89 kDa, Endo H had no effect on these species, indicating that the SEP protein in conditioned medium is resistant to Endo H. These observations suggest that the presence of the SEP protein in the medium is due to its secretion after complete glycosylation during transit through the Golgi apparatus. Taken together, these results suggest that CHO/SEP cells express membrane-bound SEP protein in the membrane of the compartments along the early secretory pathway in the cell and also secrete a soluble form of protein in the culture medium through proper secretory machinery. To examine the subcellular localization of the membrane-bound SEP protein, we immunostained both CHO/SEP and CHO/SEPΔ cells with antibodies that recognize the common C-terminal ectodomain of SEP (Fig. 6). Without permeabilization, both cells stained faintly, indicating that these cells expressed little SEP on the cell surface (Fig. 6, B and D). After permeabilization, both cells showed strong intracellular staining (Fig.6, A and C). These findings indicate that the membrane-bound SEP expressed in CHO cells appears to be located inside the cells, presumably in the early secretory pathway, which is compatible with its sensitivity to Endo H. We first examined whether SEP can convert big ET-1 by a double transfection assay described previously (9Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M.

CHO/SEP and CHO/SEPΔ cells were transiently transfected with a prepro-ET-1 construct, with the amount of mature ET-1 subsequently secreted from these cells into the medium determined by a sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay.

https://openalex.org/W2002054287,"The α1β1 and α2β1 integrins are cell surface collagen receptors. Cells expressing the α1β1integrin preferentially adhere to collagen IV, whereas cells expressing the α2β1 integrin preferentially adhere to collagen I. Recombinant α1 and α2 integrin I domains exhibit the same collagen type preferences as the intact integrins. In addition, the α2 integrin I domain binds echovirus 1; the α1 I domain does not. To identify the structural components of the I domains responsible for the varying ligand specificities, we have engineered several α1/α2 integrin I domain chimeras and evaluated their virus and collagen binding activities. Initially, large secondary structural components of the α2 I domain were replaced with corresponding regions of the α1 I domain. Following analysis in echovirus 1 and collagen binding assays, chimeras with successively smaller regions of α1 I were constructed and analyzed. The chimeras were analyzed by ELISA with several different α2 integrin monoclonal antibodies to assess their proper folding. Three different regions of the α1 I domain, when present in the α2 I domain, conferred enhanced collagen IV binding activity upon the α2 I domain. These include the α3 and α5 helices and a portion of the α6 helix. Echovirus 1 binding was lost in a chimera containing the αC-α6 loop; higher resolution mapping identified Asn289 as playing a critical role in echovirus 1 binding. Asn289 had not been implicated in previous echovirus 1 binding studies.

The integrins constitute a large family of cell adhesion molecules that are involved in both cell-cell adhesion as well as the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix (for review see Ref.1Hynes R.O.

The integrins are involved in many important physiologic processes including development and differentiation, cell migration, wound healing, thrombosis and hemostasis, metastasis, and immune system function. Structurally, integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of two noncovalently associated integral membrane subunits. The α subunits range in size from 120 to 180 kDa, and the β subunits range in size from 90 to 110 kDa. Many integrin subunits associate with more than a single α or β subunit resulting in a large number of different integrins. The β1 integrin subunit associates with at least 11 different α subunits. Members of the resulting β1subfamily of integrins are cell surface receptors for specific components of the extracellular matrix. The α1β1 integrin is a cell surface receptor for several different collagens and laminin-1 (2Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Carbonetto S. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3287-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α1β1 integrin-dependent adhesion of cells to collagens or laminin requires the presence of divalent cations (3Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Carbonetto S. Dev. Biol. 1987; 121: 510-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, the α2β1integrin also serves as a cell surface receptor for collagens and laminins (for review see Ref. 4Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and the adhesion of cells via the α2β1 integrin to these ligands also depends upon the presence of divalent cations (5Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the substrate specificity of the α2β1 integrin depends upon the cell type on which it is expressed. The α2β1 integrin on platelets and fibroblasts is a collagen receptor (5Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); on endothelial and epithelial cells it is a receptor for both collagens and laminin-1 (6Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 7Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The α2β1 integrin also mediates echovirus 1 attachment and infection (8Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Science. 1992; 255: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Near their amino termini, the α1 and the α2integrin subunits share (along with approximately half of the integrin α subunits) an autonomously folding domain of approximately 220 amino acids known as the I (inserted) domain (for review see Ref. 9Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The α subunit I domains are critical determinants for ligand recognition and binding of both the α1β1 and the α2β1 integrins. Function blocking antibodies directed against both of these integrins map to their α subunit I domain, and several mutations in the I domains adversely affect ligand binding activity (10Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed I domains from both of these integrins bind collagens and laminin-1 in a manner that is saturable, blocked by function blocking antibodies against the parent integrin, and, like the parent integrins, dependent upon the presence of divalent cations (12Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kuhn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Commun. 1998; 5: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of several different integrin I domains have been solved, providing much insight into I domain structure. I domain structures that have been solved include those of the αM, αL, and α2 subunits (15Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 16Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 17Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of these three I domains are very similar. Each has a core that consists of a largely parallel β sheet structure, and the core is surrounded by several α helices. All three contain a single divalent cation-binding site in a crevice near the top of the β sheet. Unique to the α2 I domain, however, is an additional short α helix at the top of the domain, in close proximity to the divalent cation-binding site (17Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although cells expressing either the α1β1or the α2β1 integrins adhere to several different collagens, they exhibit different relative affinities depending on the identity of the substrate. For instance, cells expressing the α1β1 integrin preferentially adhere to collagen IV, whereas cells expressing the α2β1 integrin preferentially bind to collagen I (18Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Likewise, the binding of purified recombinant α1 and α2 integrin I domains to collagen types I and IV reflects the same relative affinities to these ligands as do the parent integrins (13Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kuhn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12311-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To identify the structural components of these I domains responsible for conferring the observed substrate specificities, we have engineered a series of α1/α2 integrin I domain chimeras and examined their ligand binding activities in collagen I and IV and echovirus 1 binding assays. Initially, with the aid of the crystal structure data mentioned above, relatively large structural components of the α2 integrin I domain were replaced with the corresponding region from the α1 integrin I domain. The chimeras were examined for both a gain of function (enhanced collagen IV binding activity) and a loss of function (echovirus 1 binding). Regions that satisfied one or both of these criteria were subjected to subsequent rounds of chimera construction, purification, and analysis to define further the critical structural and functional determinants. The cloning and expression of the α2 integrin I domain has been previously described (12Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding the I domain was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are:PCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferaseMIDASmetal ion dependent adhesion siteTBSTris-buffered salinebpbase pair(s)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the full-length α2 integrin cDNA as the template. This cDNA encodes Ser124–Met349 of the published α2 integrin sequence (19Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, a cDNA encoding a shorter I domain protein lacking the 35 amino-terminal amino acids was also prepared. The shorter protein, referred to as ΔI, contains Trp159–Met349. This proteins lack the DXSXS portion of the metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif (15Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The PCR primers were designed such that both of the amplification products would contain a BglII restriction site at their 5′ ends and a stop codon followed by anXhoI restriction site at their 3′ ends. The PCR products were digested with BglII and XhoI, purified in agarose gels, and cloned into BamHI- andXhoI-digested glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein expression vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase metal ion dependent adhesion site Tris-buffered saline base pair(s) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cDNA encoding the α1 integrin I domain was amplified by PCR using the full-length human α1 cDNA (Dr. Eugene E. Marcantonio, Columbia University) as the template. Analogous to the α2 I domain construct, this cDNA encodes Ser124–Met349 of the published α1 integrin sequence (20Briesewitz R. Epstein M. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with the α2integrin I domain, the PCR primers were designed to create a product that contained a BglII site at the 5′ end and a stop codon followed by a XhoI site at the 3′ end. The PCR product was digested, purified, and cloned into pGEX-5X-1 as described above. To facilitate the construction of chimeric α1/α2 integrin I domain cDNAs encoding the α2 integrin I domain with an internal region replaced with α1 I domain sequence, the cDNAs encoding both the I domains were transferred into pBluescript KS−(Stratagene). A 661-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment of pGEX-5X-1/α1 I, encoding the entire α1 I domain with the exception of the first seven amino acids, was isolated and ligated into pBluescript KS− digested withEcoRI and XhoI. For the α2 I domain, a 1157-bp BalI-XhoI fragment of pGEX-5X-1/α2 I, encoding all of the α2 I domain and containing approximately two-thirds of the GST coding sequence, was isolated and ligated into pBluescript KS−digested with SmaI and XhoI. Chimeric α1/α2 integrin I domain cDNAs were prepared by one of two methods, depending upon the length of the internal portion of α2 to be replaced with α1 sequence. An example of the construction of one of each type of chimera will be described. Chimera A, an example of one of the chimeras with a longer replacement, consists of the α2 I domain with an internal region from the α1 I domain consisting of the α1 helix and the α1-βB loop. First, pBluescript/α2 I was mutated using Kunkel's method (21Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) and oligo 1 as the mutagenic oligo (Table I). Oligo 1 introduced anEco47III site into the α2 sequence at the amino-terminal end of the α1 helix to create p4. Simultaneously, pBluescript/α1 I was mutated using oligo 2 as the mutagenic oligo. This introduced an EcoRV site at the amino-terminal end of the α1 helix (a position analogous to the position of the Eco47III site in p4) to create p3. Eco47III and EcoRV were chosen so that the proper amino acids, serine and isoleucine, would be encoded by the 3′ end of the α2 fragment and the 5′ end of the α1fragment, respectively, upon restriction enzyme digestion. The 3482-bpXhoI-Eco47III fragment of p4 and the 591-bpEcoRV-XhoI fragment of p3 were isolated and ligated to create p5, encoding amino acids 124–155 of α2followed by amino acids 155–349 of α1. (Note that amino acid 155 is present from both the α1 I and α2 I sequences. This is due to the fact that a one-amino acid gap must be introduced into the α1 protein sequence between Pro135 and Val136 to align the two protein sequences (see Fig. 1). Thus Ile155 of α1 corresponds to Ile156 of α2.)Table IRepresentative oligonucleotide primers used in this studyNameSequence of oligonucleotide, 5′ to 3′Oligo 1GCATCCCAAGGATAAGCGCTATTTGA TTCATCACOligo 2CACTGTCCCATGGGTAGATATCGTTG GAACCATCCAGOligo 3CTCCATACTGTACAAGGCCTACCTGT GTCTGTTTAGOligo 4GGCATACTGAATTAGCGCTACCTGTG TCTTTGTGOligo 33CATATTGGGATGTCTGCTTTGCTGCA ACAAGTACTTCTTCTTTGGTTTTAT ATG Open table in a new tab p5 was mutated using oligo 3 to introduce a StuI site at the carboxyl-terminal end of the βB strand to create p6. Simultaneously, pBluescript/α2 I was mutated using oligo 4 to introduce an Eco47III site at the carboxyl-terminal end of the βB strand to create p7. StuI and Eco47III were chosen so that the proper amino acids, glycine and leucine, would be encoded at the 3′ end of the α1 portion of p6 and the 5′ end of the α2 fragment, respectively, upon restriction enzyme digestion. The 3565-bp XhoI-StuI fragment of p6 and the 505-bp Eco47III-XhoI fragment of p7 were isolated and ligated to create p8, encoding amino acids 124–155 of α2 followed by amino acids 155–182 of α1, which is in turn followed by amino acids 184–349 of α2. It is important to note that although amino acids 155–182 of α1 are encoded in this chimeric I domain, only amino acids 160–178 differ in the two I domains. This is due to the fact that amino acids 155–159 of α1 are identical to amino acids 156–160 of α2 and that amino acids 179–182 of α1 are identical to amino acids 180–183 of α2 (Figs. 1 and 3). Finally, the 966-bp Bst BI-XhoI fragment of p8 and the 4669-bp XhoI-Bst BI fragment of pGEX-5X-1/α2 I were isolated and ligated to create the expression plasmid pGEX-5X-1/Ch A, capable of directing the expression of the GST-chimera A fusion protein. Chimera B2, an example of one of the chimeras with a shorter internal portion of the α1 integrin I domain, consists of the α2 I domain with an internal region from the α1 I domain consisting only of the α3 helix, amino acids 205–210 (VLVAAK). Amino acids 206–211 (MIVATS) of the α2 I domain sequence were replaced with amino acids 205–210 (VLVAAK) of the α1 I domain sequence in a single mutagenesis reaction using pBluescript/α2 I and oligo 5 (Table I) to create pBluescript/Ch B2. The 966-bp BstBI-XhoI fragment of pBluescript/Ch B2 and the 4669-bpXhoI-Bst BI fragment of pGEX-5X-1/α2 I were isolated and ligated to create pGEX-5X-1/Ch B2. The sequences of the cDNAs used in this study, including all of the chimeras, were determined using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing method (PE Applied Biosystems), and were compared with the published α1 and α2integrin sequences (19Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Briesewitz R. Epstein M. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trial inductions were performed to determine whether the selected clones could direct the expression of appropriately sized GST fusion proteins. Escherichia coli DH5α containing each of the plasmid constructs was grown at 37 °C in 5 ml of 2× YT medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Uninduced samples were removed from each culture after 1 h. Isopropylthiogalactoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were returned to the incubator for 3 h to permit for accumulation of the expressed proteins. Cell lysates from the uninduced and induced samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Constructs that directed the expression of recombinant proteins of the expected size were used for large scale induction of protein expression. For the purification of the fusion proteins, the inductions were performed as above except that the culture volume was increased to 500 ml and the expression was induced with 1 mmisopropylthiogalactoside when the A550 reached 0.3–0.4. At the end of the induction period, the cells were recovered by centrifugation at 2600 × g for 10 min, washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and stored at −70 °C until needed. The GST-I domain fusion proteins were expressed, purified, and characterized as recently described (12Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Immulon 2, Dynatech) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 ml/well of 30 μg/ml collagen I from calf skin (Sigma) or collagen IV from human placenta (Sigma) in 0.09% acetic acid. The wells were washed twice with 0.15 ml of TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 0.15 ml of 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in TBS. Purified recombinant I domain proteins were diluted to the desired concentration in wash buffer (TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either 1 mm EDTA or 2 mm MgCl2). The wells were washed once with 0.15 ml of the appropriate wash buffer, and then 0.1 ml of each recombinant protein was added and allowed to interact with the collagen substrate for 1.5 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed three times with 0.15 ml of the appropriate wash buffer and 0.1 ml of a 1:8,000 dilution of anti-GST antiserum (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the appropriate wash buffer was added for 1 h at room temperature. Following this incubation, the wells were again washed three times, and then 0.1 ml of a 1:20,000 dilution of pig anti-goat IgG secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the appropriate wash buffer was added per well for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were again washed three times, and 0.1 ml of tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (Sigma) was prepared according to the manufacturer's directions was added per well. After 15 min of substrate conversion, reactions were stopped with 0.025 ml of 4 n H2SO4, and the plates were read at 450 nm using a Molecular Devices Emaxmicroplate reader. Each protein was expressed and purified twice, and both preparations were tested in collagen I and IV binding assays. All data are presented as means of triplicate determinations.

Virol. 1993; 67: 6847-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was added to purified fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (10,000 cpm, 2 μg of protein/aliquot) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. Beads were washed to remove unbound virus and then dissolved for liquid scintillation counting. Additional aliquots of immobilized fusion proteins were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm equal protein loading. I domain-containing proteins were diluted to 10 μg/ml in TBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 and used to coat the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Immulon 2, Dynatech). Coating was carried out overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 ml of solution/well. The wells were washed twice with 0.15 ml of TBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 0.15 ml of TBS containing 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 mm MgCl2. Primary antibodies used include the human α2 integrin I domain monoclonal antibodies 6F1 (Dr. Barry S. Coller, Mt. Sinai Medical Center), 12F1 (Dr. Virgil L. Woods, Jr., University of California at San Diego), 5E8 (Dr. Richard B. Bankert, Roswell Park Cancer Institute), P1E6 (Chemicon), and AK7 (Chemicon). The monoclonal antibodies were diluted to 1 μg/ml in wash buffer (TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mmMgCl2). Following blocking the wells were washed once with 0.15 ml of wash buffer, and then 0.1 ml of primary antibody was added and allowed to interact for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with 0.15 ml of wash buffer, then 0.1 ml of a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the appropriate wash buffer was added per well for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were again washed three times, and 0.1 ml of tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (Sigma) prepared according to the manufacturer's directions was added per well. After 10 min of substrate conversion, reactions were stopped with 0.025 ml of 4 nH2SO4 and the plates read at 450 nm using a Molecular Devices Emax microplate reader. Each protein was expressed and purified twice, and both preparations were analyzed in the ELISA assays. All data represent means of triplicate determinations. Binding of the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins to a variety of extracellular matrix molecules has been examined previously. The α1β1 integrin preferentially binds to collagen IV, whereas the α2β1 integrin preferentially binds collagen I (18Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Analysis of the binding of the α1 and α2 integrin I domains to collagens I and IV using surface plasmon resonance and solid phase binding assays indicate that the substrate preferences of the α1 and α2 I domains reflect those of the parent integrins (13Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kuhn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12311-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We also have examined the binding of these I domains to collagens I and IV in solid phase substrate binding assays. In agreement with the above, we observed that the α1 I domain preferentially bound collagen IV, and the α2 I domain preferentially bound collagen I (Fig. 2 A). The collagen type preferences of the α1 and α2 I domains were confirmed by more extensive studies over a wide range of I domain concentrations (see Fig. 7, left and middle panels).Figure 7Binding of integrin I domain proteins to collagens I and IV. The binding of the α1 I domain, the α2 I domain, and chimeric I domain E1 to collagens I and IV was measured in a solid phase binding assay over a range of I domain concentrations from 1.6 to 400 nm. Binding was determined in the presence of either 1 mm EDTA or 2 mm Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The α2β1 integrin is also a cell surface receptor for echovirus 1 (8Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Science. 1992; 255: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Binding of echovirus 1 to the integrin is mediated by the α2 I domain (24Bergelson J.M. St. John N.F. Kawaguchi S. Pasqualini R. Berdichevsky F. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Cell Adh. Commun. 1994; 2: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We tested the binding of echovirus 1 to both the α1 and α2integrin I domains. As expected, the virus bound to the α2 I domain. However, the virus failed to bind to the α1 I domain (Fig. 2 B). To determine which regions of the α1 I domain were responsible for enhanced collagen IV binding activity and which regions of the α2I domain were required for echovirus binding, we designed a series of α1/α2 integrin I domain chimeras and examined their collagen I and IV and echovirus 1 binding activities. As a guide for designing the chimeras, we used the recently published crystal structure of the α2 integrin I domain (17Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Initially, relatively large portions of the α2 I domain were replaced with the analogous regions of the α1 I domain. Because loops and helices are exposed on the I domain surface, the initial round of chimeras contained loops and α helices from the α1 I domain. Fig. 3(A—F) shows the initial round of six α1/α2 I domain chimeras and indicates the regions of the α2 I domain that were replaced with α1 I domain sequence. Each of the chimeras was tested in collagen I and IV binding assays and the echovirus 1 binding assay. In addition, to assess the folded state of the I domain chimeras, each was tested by ELISA using a panel of five α2 integrin I domain monoclonal antibodies. Because any given epitope could be lost because of replacement of the epitope with protein sequence from the α1 I domain, the chimeras were considered to be folded properly if a majority of the monoclonal antibodies bound. The results of these analyses are shown in Fig. 3. The collagen binding data are given as percentages ± S.E. of control (binding of the α2 I domain to collagen I); the echovirus binding data are also expressed as the percentages ± S.E. of control (binding of echovirus 1 to α2 I domain). Of the six chimeras, A and C failed to bind to collagen I, collagen IV, and echovirus 1. Furthermore, neither of these chimeras was effectively recognized by any of the α2 I domain monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, we assume chimeras A and C are incorrectly folded, and no conclusions can be drawn from their lack of ligand binding. The remaining four chimeras, B, D, E, and F, were recognized by a majority of the antibodies and bound at least one of either collagen I, collagen IV, or echovirus at a level comparable with or greater than that of the α2 I domain. Of these four chimeras, B, D, and E showed enhanced collagen IV binding activity. This represents a gain of function; these chimeras have become more α1 I domain-like with respect to their collagen binding activity. Also, of the four chimeras showing positive antibody reactivity, only chimera E lost the ability to bind echovirus 1. This finding indicated an important role in echovirus 1 binding for the region of the α2 I domain consisting of the αC helix, the αC-α6 loop, and the α6 helix. To further localize regions of the α1 I domain responsible for enhanced collagen IV binding activity and regions of the α2 I domain necessary for echovirus 1 binding, iterative rounds of chimera design, expression, purification, and analysis were undertaken. The design of each round was based on the results of the analysis of the previous round. Fig.4 shows the resultant B series of chimeras. Because chimera B pos"

We show here that prolonged and invasive cell migration, a key mechanism in cancer metastasis, is linked to c-erbB-2 signaling. Cell lines with c-erbB-2 and EGFR expression and transphosphorylation activity display a high transendothelial invasiveness in an endothelial-extra-cellular matrix model mimicking a capillary vessel wall in vitro. Tyrosine-phosphorylated c-erbB-2 receptors and EGFR are localized predominantly in areas of the cell with high membrane extension activity. On the molecular level, there is a subtle cross talk between the transmembrane signaling molecule c-erbB-2 and the actin cytoskeleton at multiple levels, including the generation of the second messenger PIP2 and the mobilization of the actin-regulatory protein gelsolin.

We have analyzed the amyloidogenic processing of APP using chimeric proteins stably transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The extracellular and transmembrane domains of APP were fused to the cytoplasmic region derived from the CD3 γ chain of the T cell antigen receptor (CD3γ). CD3γ contains an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif (RKK), in the absence of which the protein is targeted to lysosomes without going through the cell surface (Letourneur, F., and Klausner, R.D. (1992)Cell 69, 1143–1157). We used the wild-type sequence of CD3γ to create an APP chimera predicted to remain in the ER (γAPPER). Deletion of the RKK motif at the C terminus directed the protein directly to the lysosomes (γAPPLYS). A third chimera was created by removing both lysosomal targeting signals in addition to RKK (γAPPΔΔ). This last construct does not contain known targeting signals and consequently accumulates at the cell surface. We show by immunofluorescence and by biochemical methods that all three APP chimeras localize to the predicted compartments within the cell, thus providing a useful model to study the processing of APP. We found that Aβ1–40 is generated in the early secretory and endocytic pathways, whereas Aβ1–42 is made mainly in the secretory pathway. More importantly, we provide evidence that, unlike in neuronal models, both ER/intermediate compartment- and endocytic-derived Aβ forms can enter the secretable pool. Finally, we directly demonstrate that lysosomal processing is not involved in the generation or secretion of either Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42.

Aβ can be produced as a 40-amino acid peptide (Aβ1–40) or, occasionally, as a more amyloidogenic form of 42–43 amino acids (Aβ1–42). Both forms are generated by the activity of two unknown proteases termed β- and γ-secretase from a larger amyloid precursor protein (APP), a ubiquitously expressed type I membrane glycoprotein (1Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Aβ peptide sequence begins at the extracellular domain of APP and ends within its transmembrane domain. In an alternative pathway, APP may be cleaved within the Aβ sequence by another protease termed α-secretase to generate a soluble ∼100-kDa N-terminal fragment (αAPPs) and a membrane-retained ∼10-kDa C-terminal fragment (2Weidemann A.

Because α-secretase activity takes place within the Aβ sequence, generation of intact Aβ and αAPPs are mutually exclusive events. The identities of α, β, and γ secretases are not known, and the subcellular location of their activities is currently unclear. It is generally thought that α-secretase cleavage occurs at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or at a late compartment in the constitutive secretory pathway, as well as from the cell surface (4Sisodia S.S.

Full-length APP at the plasma membrane may be internalized to generate Aβ in an unidentified intracellular compartment. APP can also be sorted to the endosomal/lysosomal compartments where several Aβ containing C-terminal APP fragments accumulate (8Haas C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J.

It is not known whether these potentially amyloidogenic fragments are indeed Aβ intermediates or simply undergo lysosomal degradation. Recently it was shown that in transfected COS cells both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 are produced at the cell surface, although the actual sites of production were not identified (12Hartmann T. Bieger S.G. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In contrast, in transfected neurons, Aβ1–40 appears to be produced at the TGN (6Kuentzel S.L. Ali S.M. Altman R.A. Greenberg B.D. Raub T.J. Biochem J. 1993; 15: 367-378Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Aβ1–42 at the endoplasmic reticulum (12Hartmann T. Bieger S.G. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 13Cook D.G. Forman M.S. Sung J.C. Leight S. Kolson D.L. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of different subcellular compartments in the production of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 we constructed several APP chimeric proteins. We fused the extracellular and transmembrane domains of APP to the cytoplasmic region derived from the CD3γ chain of the T cell antigen receptor (CD3γ). CD3γ contains an ER retention motif (RKK), in the absence of which the protein is targeted directly from the TGN to the lysosomes without going through the cell surface by virtue of two different lysosomal signals, LL and YQ (15Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). We used the wild-type sequence of CD3γ to create an APP chimera predicted to remain in the ER (γAPPER). A second APP chimera was constructed by removing the RKK motif, thus directing the protein directly to the lysosomes. Finally, a third chimera was created by removing both targeting signals in addition to RKK (γAPPΔΔ). This ΔLLΔYQ double mutation renders the cytoplasmic tail to be devoid of known sorting signals in its sequence, and the resulting mutant protein accumulates at the cell surface at high levels due to impaired internalization (15Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). This approach therefore provides the opportunity to target APP to multiple intracellular compartments. Our results suggest that, in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Aβ1–40 is generated in the ER/IC, as well as in the endocytic pathway, whereas, as previously reported for other cell models, Aβ1–42 is generated in the early secretory pathway, mainly in the ER/IC. More importantly, we provide evidence that, unlike in neuronal models, both ER/IC- and endocytic-derived Aβ forms can enter the secretable pool. Finally, we demonstrate that, in CHO cells, the lysosomes are not involved in the generation or secretion of either Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42. cDNAs encoding the chimeric APP/CD3γ proteins were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the expression vector pCI-NEO (Promega) from the parental APP751 containing the extracellular and transmembrane but lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail (residues 734–770; APP770 numbering) fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the γ chain of the CD3 (T cell) receptor (15Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Three different APP/CD3γ chimeric constructs were used: full-length tail (Gln-116 to Lys-159) was used to generate γAPPER; Gln-116 to Leu-156 (deletion of the C-terminal RKK residues) was used to generate γAPPLYS; and γAPPΔΔ was obtained by deleting residues L130L131 and Y137QPL140. Both the dileucine- and tyrosine-based targeting motifs were deleted in the last construct. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. CHO cell lines were transfected using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies) reagent and selected by G418 resistance. The stably transfected CHO cell lines expressing wild-type APP and various APP chimeras were chosen with comparable levels of expression of the exogenous gene product. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with G418 (200 μg/ml) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, with 5% CO2. All experiments using these transfected CHO cells were repeated 3–5 times, and results from either representative experiments or the mean (± S.E.) of all experiments are shown. Monoclonal antibodies 5A3 and 1G7 and polyclonal antibody 863 directed to the mid-region of APP have been described (16Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Marquez-Sterling N.M. Lo A.C.Y. Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 140-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-β tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and was used in Western blots at 1:5,000 dilution. APP-transfected cells grown on coverslips were fixed and permeabilized in methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. Following extensive washing in PBS, cells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS (PBS/BSA) and then incubated with 5A3/1G7 (10 μg/ml in PBS/BSA) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then extensively washed in PBS and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min at room temperature. Control samples were incubated with mouse IgG instead of primary antibody. Immunostained cells were visualized by conventional epifluorescence microscopy. Confluent cultures of stably transfected CHO cells were incubated in methionine-free DMEM for 20 min followed by incubation with methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 15 min (pulse labeling) or 8 h with 150 μCi/ml (long labeling). In pulse-chase experiments, cells were lysed immediately after brief pulse-labeling or incubated in DMEM with 1 mm methionine (chase) for the indicated time points. APP was immunoprecipitated with antibodies 5A3/1G7 or 863 (16Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Where indicated, cells were incubated for 4 h with 10 μm proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Calbiochem) or 8 h with 100 μmleupeptin (Sigma) before immunoprecipitation. Gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). Confluent cultures of stably transfected CHO cells were surface-biotinylated on ice using sulfosuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin, Pierce, IL) as described previously (16Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitations were performed using antibody 863 against APP. Biotinylation of precipitated APP was analyzed by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad) after enhanced chemiluminescence using an antibody against biotin (Jackson Laboratories). Ratios of biotinylated versus total APP were used to calculate relative amounts of cell surface APP. Internalization of cell surface APP was performed as described (5Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, iodinated (3–6 μCi/μg) whole 1G7 monoclonal antibody was diluted in binding medium (BM) (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mm Hepes + 0.2% BSA) and added to triplicate cultures of CHO cells grown to confluence in 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells were incubated with radiolabeled 1G7 antibody at 37 °C for 30 min, chilled on ice, and washed once with ice-cold BM. After extensive washing with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS, 1G7 antibody bound to cell-surface APP was uncoupled by two 5-min washes with ice-cold PBS, pH 2.5 followed by cell lysis with 0.2 mNaOH. Radioactivity from both the acid washes and the cell lysates was determined in a γ counter. The ratio of radioactivity of acid-resistant to acid-labile fractions constitutes a measure of internalized versus cell-surface pool of APP. Sandwich ELISA was performed as described (18Suzuki N.

BAN-50, specific for the N-terminal 10 amino acids of Aβ, was used as capturing antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA-27 (Aβ1–40) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BC-05 (Aβ1–42) were used as secondary antibodies. Stably transfected wild-type APP and APP/CD3γ (Fig. 1) CHO lines with comparable levels of expression were analyzed by immunoprecipitations after 8 h of [35S]-methionine labeling. The results are shown in Fig.2, a and b. Essentially, no differences in the levels of accumulated “mature” and “immature” forms of APP were found between APP, γAPPLYS, and γAPPΔΔ, indicating that at this level of analysis, all three forms are appropriately post-translationally processed through the secretory pathway. In contrast, very low levels of γAPPERmature forms were detected, suggesting that the majority of the newly synthesized protein is, as expected, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and does not undergo normal maturation.Figure 2Expression of APP and CD3γ/APP chimeras. Panel a, total APP was immunoprecipitated with antibodies 5A3/1G7 from cell lysates after 8 h [35S]methionine labeling. Note the absence of high molecular weight mature forms (m) from the γAPPER chimera (i, immature forms). Results from a representative experiment are shown. Panel b, quantitation of the ratio of mature to immature forms of APP shows a significant decrease for γAPPER, again representative of its lack of maturation. The results are mean ± S.E. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the subcellular localization of the APP chimeras, we first performed immunofluorescence on methanol fixed/permeabilized cells. As expected, APP localized mainly to diffuse vesicular structures with a juxtanuclear distribution (Fig.3), consistent with Golgi localization (20Caporaso G.L. Takei K. Gandy S.E. Matteoli M. Mundigl O. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3122-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, γAPPER-staining pattern showed a strong perinuclear ring extending into fine reticular structures, a distribution characteristic of ER resident proteins. γAPPLYS distribution partially overlapped with that of APP at a juxtanuclear region due to the presence of both proteins in the biosynthetic pathway, but also in larger vesicular structures in the periphery. These latter vesicular structures were more intensely stained after leupeptin treatment (not shown), suggesting that γAPPLYS does indeed localize to the lysosomes. Finally, γAPPΔΔ was found at the cell surface (arrowheads, γAPPΔΔ panel) in addition to the juxtanuclear staining also present in both APP and γAPPLYS. Double staining experiments also showed that γAPPER co-localized with calnexin, whereas γAPPLYS co-localized with the lysosomal markers LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 (not shown). Because accurate targeting of APP chimeras to different subcellular locations is essential in this study, additional biochemical approaches were used to further define the subcellular localization of the three APP/CD3γ chimeras. Recently, it became clear that selective degradation of ER membrane proteins occurs mainly through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (21Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 22Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Accordingly, if γAPPER is an ER resident protein, it should accumulate after treatment with MG-132, a specific proteasome inhibitor that has no apparent effect on lysosomal proteases (23Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, there was no effect on APP (Fig. 4 b), γAPPLYS or γAPPΔΔ (not shown), but γAPPERincreased substantially after MG-132 treatment, indicating that the latter chimera is retained in the ER. To further confirm that the vesicular staining seen for γAPPLYS corresponds to the lysosomes, the transfected cells were treated with leupeptin to inhibit lysosomal proteases. As presented in Fig. 4 a, leupeptin treatment results in accumulation of γAPPLYS, but not APP (Fig.4 a) or the other γAPP chimeras (not shown). A control immunoblot for β-tubulin (Fig. 4 a) shows that the modest increase in γAPPLYS after leupeptin treatment is not due to differences in the amount of protein loading. In the absence of targeting signals, γAPPΔΔ is predicted to be mainly cell surface distributed and deficient in endocytosis (15Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Consequently, cell surface accumulation of γAPPΔΔ was further examined by surface biotinylation, followed by lysis and immunoprecipitation of total cellular APP. Surface and total amounts of APP were estimated by dividing the amount of reactivity of the biotinylated versus total pools of APP (see “Materials and Methods”). The results showed that cell surface levels of γAPPΔΔ were ∼2.5-fold higher than those seen in APP (Fig. 5), a value comparable with that seen in a C-terminally truncated APP (5Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of cell surface γAPPER were essentially undetectable, whereas γAPPLYS was too low for accurate quantification, estimated to be approximately one-tenth of the amount of wild-type APP. The lack of cell surface molecules in γAPPER and γAPPLYS forms provided further confirmation of the intracellular localization of these chimeric proteins. Lastly, cell surface accumulation of γAPPΔΔ is correlated with a marked decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of radioiodinated 1G7 antibody (5Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). Moreover, secretion of sAPP (Fig.6) was increased ∼2.5-fold, a value also similar to what has previously been described for C-terminally truncated mutant APP (10Estus S. Golde T.E. Kunishita R. Blades D. Eisen M. Usiak M. Qu X. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 255: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results show that the APP-CD3γ chimeras are appropriately targeted to their predicted subcellular locations.Figure 6Release of sAPP from CHO cells transfected with wild-type APP or CD3γ/APP chimeras. Levels of sAPP, normalized to the actual rates of APP synthesis of the different cell lines. The results are the mean ± S.E. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in cell lysates and conditioned media from cells stably transfected with APP or γAPP chimeras using sandwich ELISA (see “Materials and Methods”). In comparison with APP, all γAPP chimeras showed differences in the levels of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, although in different ways. First, with respect to APP, there was a dramatic decrease in the secreted and intracellular pools of Aβ1–40 in γAPPLYS- and γAPPΔΔ-expressing cells (Fig.7 a). Because all three proteins presumably share similar processing steps through the secretory pathway up to the TGN, the differences in Aβ1–40 production are likely to originate late in the secretory pathway (i.e. a post-TGN compartment) and/or the endocytic pathway. Neither γAPPLYS nor γAPPΔΔ undergo efficient endocytosis, because in the former construct, the molecules were sorted away from the cell surface levels (Fig. 5) and in the latter construct, internalization was substantially impaired. Taken together, these results suggest that the endocytic pathway is a major site of production and subsequent release of Aβ1–40 (∼60–70% of the total detected), the remaining presumably originated in the early secretory pathway (i.e. ER, Golgi, and/or TGN, the three compartments shared by both chimeras). In contrast, however, levels of Aβ1–40 from γAPPER-expressing cells showed different changes with respect to wild-type APP. Specifically, although intracellular levels of Aβ1–40 were almost 75% higher, secreted levels were approximately one-half those of APP cells (Fig. 7 a). This suggested that only a portion of intracellularly generated Aβ1–40 molecules are released. Moreover, because γAPPER is retained in the ER and endocytic processing is largely absent, the high levels of intracellular Aβ1–40are unexpected. We hypothesized that the accumulation of Aβ1–40 in γAPPER transfected cells derives from its retention in the ER, where there is an enhancement of substrate available for γ-secretase activity. To test this hypothesis, we measured the half-life of APP and the three γAPP chimeras by pulse-chase labeling. Indeed, both γAPPΔΔand γAPPER showed markedly longer half-lives than wild-type APP (135.1 ± 3.38 min and 86.6 ± 4.3 min, respectively, versus 53.3 ± 6.9 min, n= 3, p < 0.001, analysis of variance) (Table I).Table IHalf-life of APP/CD3γ chimerasAPP75153.3 ± 6.9γAPPER86.6 ± 4.3γAPPLYS56.7 ± 1.42γAPPΔΔ135.1 ± 3.38Data from three independent experiments.

In contrast to Aβ1–40 levels, Aβ1–42levels (Fig. 7 b) were surprisingly unchanged in both γAPPLYS- and γAPPΔΔ-expressing cells as compared with wild-type APP. This was seen in both intracellular and secreted pools of Aβ1–42, a finding that suggests that even the secreted pool of Aβ1–42 was generated predominantly in the ER/IC. γAPPER behaved very differently from the other three constructs. As with Aβ1–40, the intracellular levels of Aβ1–42 were substantially higher in γAPPERcells as compared with wild-type APP and the other two APP/CD3γ chimeras (Fig. 7 b). In contrast to Aβ1–40, even the secreted levels of Aβ1–42 were also higher. In summary, with respect to wild-type APP, levels of Aβ1–42from γAPPER-expressing cells were increased ∼10- and ∼4-fold in the intracellular and secreted pools, respectively. Lysosomes have been hypothesized as a possible site of Aβ production. Several studies have indirectly addressed this question, but, to date, the role of the lysosomes in Aβ production is still unclear (24Haas C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Shoji M. Golde T.E. Ghiso J. Cheung T.T. Estus S. Shaffer M. Cai X.D. McKay D.M. Tintner R. Frangione B. Younkin S.G.

A. 1993; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Efficient targeting of APP to lysosomes enabled us to directly address this question. Accordingly, production of Aβ1–40 did not increase when APP was directly sorted to the lysosomes from the TGN, indicating that lysosomes are not involved in Aβ generation (Fig.7 a). The same can be concluded of Aβ1–42. Because no differences are found between APP, γAPPLYS, and γAPPΔΔ (Fig. 7 b), the lysosomal compartment is unlikely to be a major source of either Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 generation. Combining all the Aβ results of our study (Fig.7), we have analyzed the relative ratios of Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 expressed in CHO cells. Extracellularly, Aβ1–42 is consistently a minor fraction of total Aβ, and wild-type APP showed the expected ∼1:10 ratio of Aβ1–42 to Aβ1–40. The intracellular ratio is ∼6:10, a value similar to that reported in neurons (13Cook D.G. Forman M.S. Sung J.C. Leight S. Kolson D.L. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). However, there was an increase in the 42:40 ratios in both intracellular (between 2–3:1) and secreted (∼4:10) pools for all γAPP chimeras. And despite the differences in absolute levels of each Aβ species, the relative levels are surprisingly similar to each other. Intracellularly, this was achieved by either a large increase in Aβ1–42 (γAPPER) (although attenuated by a slight increase in Aβ1–40) or by a decrease in Aβ1–40 (γAPPLYS and γAPPΔΔ). A similar, although more modest trend, is seen extracellularly. The secreted 42:40 ratio increase was achieved by either a decrease of Aβ1–40 and an increase in Aβ1–42 (γAPPER) or by a decrease in Aβ1–40 secretion (γAPPLYS and γAPPΔΔ). Aβ is the major component of senile plaques in the Alzheimer's brain, and it is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease (1Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Consequently, much effort has been dedicated to the study of Aβ generation in a variety of models. Here, we have chosen to generate several chimeric APP proteins predicted to localize to particular organelles, to study the role of such subcellular locations in the generation and subsequent secretion of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. Although several recent reports have successfully used chimeric APP proteins to study the proteolytic processing of APP (27Schrader-Fischer G.S. Staufenbiel M. Paganetti P.A. J.

The strategy that we followed for APP subcellular targeting is based on a well characterized model, that of the γ chain of the CD3 receptor (Fig. 1) (15Letourneur F"

We established a mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cell line where ectopic expression of Smad7 is tightly controlled by doxycycline using an improved Tet-on system. Once induced by doxycycline, the recombinant Smad7 was localized predominantly in the perinuclear region and in the cytoplasm.

TGF-β stimulation did not alter substantially the cellular distribution of Smad7. Importantly, the expression of recombinant Smad7 differentially inhibited TGF-β signaling pathways. Consistent with previous studies, Smad7 inhibited TGF-β-stimulated induction of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor as measured by p3TP-Lux reporter.

Padgett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Subsequently, eight vertebrate Smad proteins in three different functional classes have been identified (16Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3997) Google Scholar). Smads 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 make up the receptor-regulated Smad subfamily with a conserved carboxyl-terminal SSXS motif; Smad4, also called DPC4 (deleted in pancreatic carcinoma locus4), is a collaborating Smad (or common Smad); and Smads 6 and 7 form an inhibitory Smad subfamily (16Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3997) Google Scholar). All Smad proteins share two regions of sequence similarity: Mad homology (MH) 1 at the NH2 terminus and MH2 at the COOH terminus. The receptor-regulated Smads contain a conserved SSXS motif at their COOH terminus, whereas the common Smad4 and inhibitory Smads 6 and 7 lack this motif. The receptor-regulated Smads 1, 5, and 8 appeared to mediate specifically signaling downstream of bone morphogenetic protein and its receptors, whereas Smads 2 and 3 function in TGF-β and activin signaling pathways (10Heldin C.-H.

Endogenous expression of Smad7 is induced rapidly by TGF-β, suggesting that the inhibitory Smads participate in a negative feedback loop that may control the intensity and/or duration of the response to TGF-β (31Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar).

When recombinant Smad6 and Smad7 are expressed, they exert their inhibitory effects by binding to TGF-β family receptors, thereby blocking the receptor-regulated Smads from interacting with the receptor (28Imamura T.

This mechanism would result in nonspecific negative regulation of TGF-β signaling pathways by inhibitory Smads (16Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3997) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether physiologic levels of inhibitory Smads can also interfere with receptor-mediated phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads. However, it has been demonstrated that at low levels, Smad6 does not block receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 (29Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Smad6 does compete with Smad4 for binding to phosphorylated Smad1, forming an inactive Smad1-Smad6 complex (29Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). This mechanism may provide selective inhibition by inhibitory Smads (16Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3997) Google Scholar). TGF-β mediates multiple cellular responses (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Robert A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors: Part I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 419-472Google Scholar), and it is not yet clear whether the inhibitory Smads selectively or nonselectively inhibit TGF-β signaling pathways. Unlike receptor-regulated Smads, a recent report showed that in the absence of TGF-β, recombinant Smad7 localizes in the nucleus but exports from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after TGF-β stimulation (32Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, using a zinc-inducible system, this report (32Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) concluded that Smad7 inhibits TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition. However, one clone, 10-3, in the report by Itoh et al. (32Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), showed little inhibition by Smad7. Furthermore, Smad7 expression only partially inhibited TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition in two other clones, 7-5s and 7-10. In the present work, we have investigated the negative regulatory role of Smad7 on two TGF-β-mediated biological responses using an improved tetracycline (Tet)-inducible system, where the expression of Smad7 is under the tight control of doxycycline. Once induced by doxycycline, Smad7 was expressed predominantly in the perinuclear region and in the cytoplasm. TGF-β stimulation did not alter substantially the cellular distribution of Smad7. Recombinant Smad7 inhibited TGF-β-stimulated induction of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) as measured by the p3TP-Lux reporter. However, expression of Smad7 had little effect on TGF-β-induced growth inhibition. Thus, Smad7 inhibits differentially at least two TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways. Mouse Smad7 cDNA with a flag tag at its NH2terminus in pcDNA3 (31Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from P. ten Dijke (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). To subclone the flag-tagged Smad7 cDNA into a tetracycline-inducible vector, pTRE (CLONTECH), to obtain pTRE-Smad7, aBamHI-XbaI fragment encoding full-length Smad7 and flag tag at its NH2 terminus and anXhoI-BamHI fragment from pTRE were ligated into pTRE at its XhoI and XbaI sites. An improved pTet-on vector (CLONTECH), pEFpurop-Tet-on, was generously provided by G. Vario (AMRAD, Melbourne, Australia). Briefly, the gene encoding the “reverse” tetracycline repressor (33Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 34Gossen M. Freundieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a pEF-BOS (35Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) vector, pEFr-PGKpuropAv18, which confers puromycin resistance. Thus, the EF-1α promoter drives the expression of the reverse tetracycline repressor, and stable cell lines can be selected by puromycin. The improved system resulted in robust induction and a minimum level of leakage (see Fig. 1). To obtain doxycycline (a tetracycline derivative)-induced Smad7 expression Mv1Lu cell lines, pTRE-Smad7 and pEFpurop-Tet-on were cotransfected into Mv1Lu cells by electroporation, and then the cells were selected in puromycin. Positive clones were screened first by luciferase assay according toCLONTECH protocol and then selected for their ability to express Smad7 in the presence of doxycycline by Western analysis using M2 antibody (IBI, Eastman Kodak Co.). Four clones were obtained, clones C, G, N, and Q. Mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells were a gift from A. B. Roberts (National Institutes of Health). The cells were grown in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL, Australia), 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Puromycin (2 μg/ml) was added to the medium for Smad7 expression clones. Transient transfections were performed using a FuGENETM 6 (Boehringer Mannheim) protocol, and transfected cells were assayed 48 or 72 h later. Cells were seeded at about 40% confluence in six-well plates and treated with doxycycline at a designated concentration for 24 h, then treated with or without TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in 150 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1.5% Trasylol (Bayer). The total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis using 12% polyacrylamide and Western blotting analysis using M2 antibody (IBI). To prepare soluble and insoluble fractions of cell lysates, the lysis buffer contained 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml 1–10 phenanthroline, 1% Trasylol, and 0.2 mg/ml leupeptin. Cells were lysed in this lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, and the cell lysates then were microcentrifuged to obtain a clear supernatant as the soluble fraction. The precipitates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in SDS sample buffer containing 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol, and this constitutes the insoluble fraction. Both the soluble and insoluble fractions were then subjected to Western analysis similar to that of total cell lysates using M2 antibody (IBI) or cyclin A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells were grown in 24-well plates (Nunc, Denmark) or in LAB TEK chambers (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and were treated the same way as cells for Western analysis. To coat the glass surface of a LAB TEK chamber with fibronectin, 40 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in phosphate-buffered saline was added to the chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in methanol for 15 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated with M2 antibody (20 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. Subsequently, these cells were washed again three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and once with H2O. Finally, immunofluorescence images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 confocal microscope. The p3TP-Lux (36Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell.

Roberts. p3TP-Lux (0.25 μg/well) was transfected into inducible Smad7 expression Mv1Lu cells grown in 24-well plates (0.125 μg/well for cells in 8-well LAB TEK chambers). At 6 h post-transfection, doxycycline was added to the medium to achieve the designated concentration. At 28 h post-transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.2% bovine serum albumin with the designated doxycycline concentration and stimulated with TGF-β1 for 20 h. Thereafter, cells were lysed in 50 μl/well lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CDAT, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Cell lysates (20 μl/well) were used to measure the total light emission in 10 s using a ML 3000 Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Chantilly, VA). Cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates (or 16-well LAB TEK chambers) and treated in a way similar to that in Western blotting analysis, but the treatment of TGF-β1 was for 20 h, and a quadruplicate of each concentration of treatment was used. Cells were pulsed with 0.2 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, 20 μl of 0.5 m NaOH was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then cells were harvested using Filtermate Harvester (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT), and the 3H radioactivity incorporated into DNA was counted by Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instrument Co.). To investigate how Smad7 regulates TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways, flag-tagged Smad7 was stably transfected into Mv1Lu cells. The transcription of the tagged Smad7 was under the control of doxycycline using an improved tetracycline-inducible system in which the expression of the reverse tetracycline repressor (33Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 34Gossen M. Freundieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar) was driven by the EF-1α promoter (35Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). In the absence of doxycycline, no Smad7 was detected in total cell lysate by Western analysis (lane 1, Fig.1 A). The level of Smad7 expression correlated with the amount of doxycycline present in the cell growth medium (Fig. 1 A). These results shown in Fig.1 A demonstrated that the expression of Smad7 in Mv1Lu clone C cells is tightly regulated by doxycycline. Using flag antibody M2-mediated immunofluorescence (Fig.2 B), it was confirmed that Smad7 expression was only detectable after exposure to doxycycline. Furthermore, the immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that Smad7 is expressed predominantly in the perinuclear region (seen as a ring around the nucleus) and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B, c–e), with less than 5% of the cells exhibiting nuclear localization of Smad7 (data not shown). To analyze further the doxycycline-induced expression and subcellular localization of Smad7, we used Western blots to analyze both the soluble (containing membrane-binding and cytoplasmic proteins) and insoluble (containing nuclear and cytoskeleton proteins) fractions of Triton X-100 cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 2 A, doxycycline induced Smad7 expression in the soluble fraction (top panels, Fig.2 A) where the nuclear expressing protein cyclin A was not detected (data not shown). In the insoluble fraction, Smad7 was absent (middle panels, Fig. 2 A), whereas the expression of cyclin A was easily detected (bottom panels, Fig.2 A). A similar expression pattern of Smad7 was observed after TGF-β stimulation (right panels, Fig.2 A), indicating that TGF-β treatment does not alter Smad7 subcellular localization substantially. Analysis by immunofluorescence showed that the intense Smad7 perinuclear ring appeared to be diffused, probably to the cytoplasm, after TGF-β treatment (Fig.2 B). To investigate whether the above results are caused by clonal selection, three more clones expressing recombinant Smad7 (G, N, and Q) were examined. In all three clones, Smad7 expression was induced by doxycycline, and the expressed Smad7 was detectable only in the cytoplasmic fraction (top panel, Fig.3 A) and not in the nuclear fraction (middle and bottom panels, Fig.3 A). As in clone C, cytoplasmic expression of Smad7 was observed for clones G, N, and Q by immunofluorescence (Fig.3 B). TGF-β did not mediate substantial change in the subcellular localization of Smad7 in clones G, N, and Q (Fig.3 B). Smad7 was first identified as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling because of its ability to inhibit TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter gene (27Topper J.N. Cai J.

Cells with inducible Smad7 expression are an appropriate system to analyze this result further because the expression of Smad7 is induced by stimulation to cells (31Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A.

As shown in Fig.4, A and C, in clone C, the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter measured as luciferase activity was inhibited by the treatment of doxycycline, which corresponded to expression of Smad7 (Figs. 1 and2). The extent of the inhibition correlated with the amount of doxycycline and therefore correlated with the level of Smad7 expression. TGF-β-induced cell growth arrest is the other biological function of TGF-β, which has been used often as readout of TGF-β signaling activity. Contrary to the inhibition of p3TP-Lux, in clone C, the doxycycline-induced expression of Smad7 had little effect on TGF-β-induced growth arrest, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 4, B andC). Clearly, Smad7 acts differentially: it inhibits TGF-β-induced p3TP-Lux activation (PAI-1 expression) but plays little role in the TGF-β-induced cell growth arrest pathways. We subsequently examined the effect of induced expression of Smad7 on TGF-β-controlled signaling pathways in several independent clones G, N, and Q. For all of the clones, the treatment with doxycycline, which corresponds to induced expression of Smad7, resulted uniformly in the block of the majority of TGF-β-induced p3TP-Lux activation (Fig.5 A). However, in no case did the expression of Smad7 reverse the TGF-β-mediated cell growth arrest (Fig. 5 B). Mv1Lu cells die when they are cultured with TGF-β for a long period, such as 3–4 days (36Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of TGF-β (5 ng/ml), almost all of the cells died in 3 days with or without the treatment of doxycycline (data not shown), further supporting that Smad7 expression does not block the TGF-β-induced growth inhibition pathway. Overall, our results on several cell lines clearly demonstrate that Smad7 inhibits TGF-β-mediated p3TP-Lux activation but has little effect on the growth arrest pathway. Smad7 has been reported previously to be localized in the nucleus (32Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol.

In the present study, we examined the effects of hyperglycemia (HG) on Ang II-induced JAK/STAT signaling events in cultured VSMCs. HG increases Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and promotes a partial tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme under basal conditions. In addition, HG increases both basal and Ang II-induced complex formation of JAK2 with the Ang II AT1 receptor. The extent of STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation are also increased under HG conditions. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation and activities of the SHP-1 and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatases, enzymes that regulate Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, are altered by HG. SHP-1, which is responsible for JAK2 tyrosine dephosphorylation in VSMC, is completely deactivated in HG, resulting in a prolonged duration of JAK2 phosphorylation under HG conditions. HG also enhances Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that HG augments Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation by increasing signal transduction through the JAK/STAT pathway.

Epstein M. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). One of the basic underlying causes of diabetic atherosclerosis appears to be hyperglycemia-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)1 proliferation. VSMCs cultured under hyperglycemic (HG) conditions, for example, proliferate at a significantly faster rate than those cultured under normal glucose (NG) conditions (2Natarajan R. Gonzales N. Xu L. Nadler J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). HG increases the de novo synthesis of the protein kinase C-activator, diacylglycerol. Thus, one hypothesized mechanism by which HG induces VSMC proliferation is through the chronic activation of one or more isoforms of protein kinase C (3Xia P. Inoguchi T. Kern T.S. Engerman R.L. Oates P.J. King G.L. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms by which HG has been suggested to stimulate VSMC proliferation are through nonenzymatic modification of macromolecules to form advanced glycation end products, changes in sorbitol and myoinositol metabolism, increased oxidant formation, and increased production of extracellular matrix molecules (1Sowers J.R. Epstein M. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 4King G.L. Brownlee M. Endocrinol. Metabol. Clin. North Am. 1986; 25: 255-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (256) Google Scholar). VSMC proliferation is also stimulated by a number of growth factors and hormones including angiotensin II (Ang II) (5Powell J.S. Clozel J.-P. Müller R.K.M. Kuhn H. Hefti F. Hosang M. Baumgartner H.R. Science. 1989; 245: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 6Daemen M.J.A.P. Lombardi D.M. Bosman F.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ.

Furthermore, Ang II stimulation of VSMC proliferation is very likely enhanced by HG because Ang II activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is increased in VSMCs cultured under HG conditions (9Natarajan R. Scott S. Bai W. Yerneni K.K.V. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 378-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have shown previously that activation of the MAPK pathway is essential to Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation (7Schieffer B. Drexler H. Ling B.N. Marrero M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C2019-C2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition to the MAPK pathway, a second pathway involved in Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation is the janus-activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway (8Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The JAK/STAT pathway involves the tyrosine phosphorylation and consequent activation of JAK tyrosine kinases. Activated JAK kinases phosphorylate latent transcription factors termed STATs, resulting in STAT homo- and heterodimerization and translocation of STAT dimers to the nucleus. In the nucleus, STAT dimers bind to specific response elements in gene promoters and direct transcription (10Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Cross-talk also appears to exist between the MAPK and the JAK/STAT pathways because serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by MAPK is required for maximal transcriptional activity of these factors (11Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Ang II stimulation of VSMCs results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and complex formation of JAK2 with the Ang II AT1 receptor (12Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by the protein-tyrosine phosphatases known as SHP-1 and SHP-2 (13Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation of JAK2 is accompanied by the tyrosine and/or serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and translocation of the two proteins to the nucleus (12Marrero M.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This signaling cascade appears to be essential to Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation, because treatment of VSMCs with the JAK2 inhibitor, AG-490, or electroporation of anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3-neutralizing antibodies completely blocks Ang II induction of cell proliferation (8Marrero M.B.

The JAK/STAT pathway and HG, thus, both have important roles in promoting VSMC proliferation. It is not known, however, whether HG affects JAK/STAT signaling in VSMC. Therefore, in the present study we examined the effects of HG on various Ang II-induced JAK/STAT signaling events associated with Ang II stimulation of VSMC proliferation. Anti-JAK2 phosphotyrosine-specific antibody was purchased from BIOSOURCE International. Anti-STAT1 antibody, anti-STAT3 antibody, anti-STAT1 phosphotyrosine-specific antibody, and anti-STAT3 phosphotyrosine-specific antibody were obtained from New England BioLabs. Anti-STAT1 phosphoserine-specific antibody and anti-STAT3 phosphoserine-specific antibody were procured from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-AT1 receptor antibody, anti-JAK2 antibody, anti-SHP-1 antibody, and anti-SHP-2 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody came from Transduction Laboratories. Cell Titer 96 AQueousnonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit was purchased from Promega. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. VSMCs were cultured from aortas of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as described previously (16Marrero M.B.

VSMC passages 8 to 15 were grown to 70–80% confluence, washed once in serum-free medium, and incubated for 24 h in either NG (5.5 mm), HG (25.0 mm), or NG (5.5 mm) plus mannitol (19.5 mm) before treatment with Ang II (100 nm). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (13Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol.

After 3 h, protein A/G agarose was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation then washed three times in ice-cold wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 then three times in phosphatase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 60 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Phosphatase activity was assayed as described previously (13Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ali M.S.

The final immunoprecipitated pellet was suspended in a total of 100 μl of phosphatase buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (10 mm final concentration) and was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m NaOH, and the absorbance of the sample at 410 nm was determined in a spectrophotometer. VSMC proliferation was quantitated using the Cell Titer 96 AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega). This assay is based on measuring the cellular conversion of the colorimetric reagent 3,4-(5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt into a soluble formazan by dehydrogenase enzymes found only in metabolically active, proliferating cells. The absorbance of formazan was measured at 490 nm using a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway in VSMC plays an essential role in Ang II induction of cell proliferation (8Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). VSMC proliferation is also stimulated by HG (2Natarajan R. Gonzales N. Xu L. Nadler J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Whether HG affects JAK/STAT signaling, however, has not been previously investigated. To determine whether HG alters either basal or Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing either NG (5.5 mm glucose) or HG (25 mm glucose) before stimulation for 0, 1, 5, 10, and 30 min with Ang II (100 nm). Cells were then lysed, and equal amounts of lysate from each condition (50 μg of protein) were immunoblotted with a JAK2 phosphotyrosine-specific antibody that recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated, but not the nonphosphorylated, form of JAK2. As shown in Fig. 1, under euglycemic conditions, Ang II induced a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 (130-kDa band) that was maximal between 1 and 5 min. Under HG conditions, both the extent and the duration of JAK2 phosphorylation were increased, suggesting that HG increases the magnitude and prolongs the duration of Ang II-induced JAK2 activation in VSMC. In addition, in HG, JAK2 was partially phosphorylated even under basal conditions, suggesting that HG promotes a partial constitutive activation of JAK2 even in the absence of Ang II. Lysates were also immunoblotted with an anti-JAK2 antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of JAK2. Equal amounts of JAK2 were detected for all conditions by the nonphospho-specific antibody, indicating that the differences detected with the phosphotyrosine-specific antibody were not due to differences in the amount of total JAK2 protein loaded in each lane. Similar results were also obtained in experiments in which JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was quantitated by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates with anti-JAK2 antibody (data not shown). In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 and in all others described in the present study, controls were included to determine whether the effects of HG might be due to hyperosmolarity. Thus, in addition to the NG control (5.5 mm glucose), we also included a control of 5.5 mm glucose plus 19.5 mm mannitol. In this experiment, as well as in all other experiments described hereafter, no effects of hyperosmolarity (glucose plus mannitol) were seen on any of the JAK/STAT-signaling events examined. Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in VSMC is accompanied by complex formation of JAK2 with the Ang II AT1 receptor (12Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Complex formation involves association of JAK2 with a YIPP motif in the C-terminal intracellular domain 4 of the AT1receptor, an event that appears to be a prerequisite for JAK2 phosphorylation and, hence, activation (18Ali M.S. Syeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To determine whether HG alters either basal or Ang II-induced complex formation of JAK2 with the AT1 receptor, VSMC were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing either NG or HG and then stimulated for 0 or 5 min with Ang II (100 nm). Cells were lysed, and the AT1 receptor was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of lysate (1 mg of protein) from each condition. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then immunoblotted with an anti-JAK2 antibody to determine whether the AT1 receptor and JAK2 coimmunoprecipitated as a complex. As shown in Fig.2, under NG conditions, no AT1 receptor-JAK2 complex was detected in the absence of Ang II treatment. A complex between the two proteins was detected, however, following a 5-min exposure to Ang II. Under HG conditions, the extent of Ang II-stimulated complex formation was significantly increased, suggesting again that HG enhances Ang II-induced JAK2 signaling in VSMC. Furthermore, in HG, a significant amount of JAK2 was associated with the AT1 receptor even under basal conditions, suggesting that HG may cause a non-Ang II-dependent constitutive activation of JAK2 in VSMC. We have shown previously that STAT1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and that STAT3 is both tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated in VSMCs in response to Ang II stimulation (12Marrero M.B. Schieffer B.

To determine whether HG alters either the basal or the Ang II-induced tyrosine or serine phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT3, we carried out immunoblotting experiments with phosphospecific antibodies that recognize either the tyrosine- or the serine-phosphorylated, but not the nonphosphorylated, forms of STAT1 and STAT3. VSMCs were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing either NG or HG and then stimulated with Ang II (100 nm) for 0, 1, 5, 10, 30, or 60 min. Cells were lysed, and equal amounts of lysate (50 μg of protein) were immunoblotted with the phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig.3, both the extent and the duration of the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (92-kDa band, which is sometimes resolved into a doublet on immunoblots (12Marrero M.B.

Lysates were also immunoblotted with an anti-STAT1 antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1. Equivalent amounts of STAT1 were detected for all time points by the nonphospho-specific antibody, demonstrating that the differences detected with the phosphotyrosine-specific antibody were not due to differences in the amounts of total STAT1 protein. It has not been previously determined whether Ang II induces serine phosphorylation of STAT1 in VSMC. Quantitation of serine phosphorylation of STAT1 in the present study, however, showed that Ang II does indeed induce the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 in VSMC and that the level of phosphorylated serine in STAT1 was increased by HG both in response to Ang II and in the basal state (Fig.4). When lysates were probed with the antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1, equal amounts of STAT1 protein were detected by the nonphospho-specific antibody in all conditions, indicating that the differences observed in STAT1 serine phosphorylation were not due to differences in the amounts of STAT1 protein.Figure 4Effects of high glucose on basal and Ang II-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1. VSMCs were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing either NG (○, 5.5 mm) or HG (●, 25 mm) and then treated with Ang II (100 nm) for the times indicated. Cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoblotted with phosphoserine-specific and nonphosphospecific anti-STAT1 antibodies.

HG increased the extent of Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein (89-kDa band, which is sometimes resolved into a doublet on immunoblots (12Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar)) (Fig.5) and increased both the extent and the duration of Ang II-induced serine phosphorylation (Fig.6). HG also induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3 under basal conditions. Differences that were detected in the tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT3 were not due to differences in the amounts of STAT3 protein as confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-STAT3 antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT3. The results of these studies of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 demonstrate that HG not only enhances basal and Ang II-induced JAK/STAT signaling at the level of JAK2 phosphorylation and activation but also at the level of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. We have shown previously that Ang II-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated by MAPK (15Liang H. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ang II-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 is also mediated by MAPK, we investigated Ang II-induced serine phosphorylation of the factor following exposure of VSMC to the MAP kinase kinase (and hence MAPK) inhibitor, PD98059 (19Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Preincubation of cells with the inhibitor (30 μm for 1 h) completely blocked Ang II-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 (data not shown), confirming that phosphorylation was catalyzed by MAPK.Figure 6Effects high glucose on basal and Ang II-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3. VSMCs were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing either NG (○, 5.5 mm) or HG (●, 25 mm) and then treated with Ang II (100 nm) for the times indicated. Cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoblotted with phosphoserine-specific and nonphosphospecific anti-STAT3 antibodies. Representative immunoblots are shown as well as densitometric analysis of three immunoblots probed with the phosphoserine-specific antibody (mean ± S.E.). Ser-P, phosphoserine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a previous study, we showed that the cytosolic SH-2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 have important and opposite roles in Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in VSMC (13Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHP-1 appears to be responsible for JAK2 dephosphorylation and undergoes tyrosine dephosphorylation itself (and consequently deactivation) during the time period when JAK2 is maximally phosphorylated. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase is subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated during the period of time when JAK2 is dephosphorylated. The time course of Ang II-induced SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, on the other hand, is very different. Phosphorylation and activation of SHP-2 is maximal during the period of time when JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation is maximal. Furthermore, as we have also reported previously, SHP-2 functions as an adaptor protein for JAK2 association with the AT1 receptor (13Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this association is required for JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (18Ali M.S. Syeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), SHP-2, in its role as an adaptor, facilitates Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. To determine whether HG affects the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of SHP-2 in VSMC, cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing either NG or HG and then stimulated with Ang II (100 nm) for 0, 1, 5, 10, or 30 min. Cells were lysed, and equal amounts of lysate (1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-2 antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 7 A, in NG, Ang II induced a tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 that was maximal at 5 to 10 min and was partially sustained for at least 30 min. In HG, the time course of Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 was similar to that in NG except that the extent of phosphorylation was approximately 2-fold higher at each time point. Immunoprecipitated SHP-2 proteins in these experiments were also assayed for tyrosine dephosphorylation activity by monitoring the rate of formation of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl phosphate as described previously (13Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ali M.S. Schieffer B. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Ling B.N. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12373-12379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7 B, SHP-2 activities for each time point and for each condition were altered in parallel with changes in SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation with approximately 2-fold higher activities in HG as compared with NG. HG thus appears to enhance the effects of Ang II on both SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and SHP-2 activity. To determine whether HG influences the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of SHP-1 in VSMC, cells were incubated for 24 h under either NG or HG conditions before stimulation with Ang II (100 nm) for 0, 1, 5, 10, or 30 min. Cells were lysed, and SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates (1 mg of lysate protein from each condition) with anti-SHP-1 antibody. SHP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and activity were then quantitated as described above for SHP-2. In NG, SHP-1 was transiently dephosphorylated in response to Ang II followed by a subsequent rephosphorylation to a level greater than that under basal conditions (Fig.8 A). SHP-1 catalytic activity in NG was also reduced in parallel followed by a subsequent increase (Fig. 8 B). In HG, SHP-1 was completely dephosphorylated and completely devoid of catalytic activity both under basal conditions as well as after Ang II stimulation (Figs. 8, A andB). HG thus appears to cause a complete deactivation of SHP-1 in VSMC. Because SHP-1 is responsible for JAK2 dephosphorylation in VSMC (13Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results provide an explanation for the increased JAK2 phosphorylation observed under HG conditions (Fig. 2). Increased JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in HG both basally and in response to Ang II is likely due to a lack of SHP-1 activity in HG and, hence, a lack of dephosphorylation of JAK2. Both hyperglycemia and Ang II are capable of stimulating VSMC proliferation (2Natarajan R. Gonzales N. Xu L. Nadler J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7Schieffer B. Drexler H. Ling B.N. Marrero M.B. Am. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ang II stimulation of VSMC proliferation may be augmented by HG. This hypothesis follows from the observation of Natarajan et al. (9Natarajan R. Scott S. Bai W. Yerneni K.K.V. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 378-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that Ang II activation of MAPKs in VSMCs is enhanced in HG. We have shown previously that MAPK activation is important in Ang II induction of cell proliferation (7Schieffer B. Drexler H. Ling B.N. Marrero M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C2019-C2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Whether HG augments Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation, however, has not been previously demonstrated. To determine whether HG enhances the Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation, cells were cultured in NG, NG plus Ang II (100 nm), or HG plus Ang II (100 nm). Cell proliferation was then quantitated over a period of 48 h by a colorimetric assay that determines the level of activity of dehydrogenase enzymes found only in metabolically active, proliferating cells. As shown in Fig.9, HG does indeed enhance Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation with the effect of Ang II in stimulating cell proliferation being approximately 2-fold higher in HG relative to that in NG. In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate that HG has significant effects on multiple basal and Ang II-induced JAK/STAT signaling events in VSMC as well as on Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation. Thus, in addition to the previously known effects of HG on chronic activation of protein kinase C isoforms and on basal and Ang II-induced activation of MAPK isozymes, HG appears to also augment Ang II induction of VSMC proliferation by increasing signal transduction through the JAK/STAT pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1998470358,"Signal regulatory proteins of the α subtype (SIRPα) are ubiquitous molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily that negatively regulate protein tyrosine kinase receptor-dependent cell proliferation. Their intracytoplasmic domain contains four motifs that resemble immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) and that, when tyrosyl-phosphorylated, recruit cytoplasmic SH2 domain-bearing protein tyrosine phosphatases (SHPs). ITIMs are borne by molecules that negatively regulate cell activation induced by receptors bearing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Because SIRPα are coexpressed with ITAM-bearing receptors in hematopoietic cells, we investigated whether SIRPα could negatively regulate ITAM-dependent cell activation. We found SIRPα transcripts in human mast cells, and we show that a chimeric molecule having the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains of SIRPα could inhibit IgE-induced mediator secretion and cytokine synthesis by mast cells. Inhibition required that the SIRPα chimera was coaggregated with ITAM-bearing high affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI). It was correlated with the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the SIRPα chimera and the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2. The phosphorylation of FcεRI ITAMs was decreased; the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ were reduced, and the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2 was abolished. SIRPα can therefore negatively regulate not only receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent cell proliferation but also ITAM-dependent cell activation.

Sano S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25569-25574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When cloned, these molecules were found to be the members of a multigene family of at least 15 transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily molecules named collectively SIRPs, in which two types, α and β, were recognized, differing by the presence (in SIRPα) or the absence (in SIRPβ) of an intracytoplasmic (IC) domain containing four tyrosine-based regulatory motifs (3Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). A neuronal adhesion molecule, previously described as P84, was found to belong to the SIRP family, and the widely expressed integrin-associated protein CD47 was recently identified as a ligand of P84 (5Jiang P. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J. Bol. Chem. 1999; 274: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SIRPα were shown to regulate negatively cell proliferation induced by growth factors via protein tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) and oncogene products. Little is known of the mechanism of inhibition by SIRPα, except that negative regulation was correlated with the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα and the recruitment of SHP-2 (3Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 6Stofega M.R. Wang H. Ullrich A. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7112-7117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). That SIRPα had inhibitory properties indicated that these molecules bear inhibition motifs rather than activation motifs. SHP-2-binding motifs found in SIRPα are indeed reminiscent of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). ITIMs are present in a large group of molecules (7Vivier E. Daëron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) that negatively regulate cell activation induced by receptors bearing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) (8Daëron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Negative regulation by ITIM-bearing molecules is correlated with the recruitment of SH2 domain-bearing phosphatases by phosphorylated ITIMs (9Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Cell. 1996; 87: 961-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Daëron M. The Immunologist. 1997; 5: 79-86Google Scholar). Thus, killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) inhibit cell-mediated cytotoxicity when they bind to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on target cells (11Moretta A. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Pende D. Vitale M. Poggi A. Mingari M.C. Moretta L. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Their IC domain contains two ITIMs that, when tyrosyl-phosphorylated, recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 (12Burshtyn D.N. Scharenberg A.M. Wagtmann N. Rajogopalan S. Berrada K. Yi T. Kinet J.-P. Long E.O.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 3168-3175PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, FcγRIIB, a family of low affinity receptors for IgG, negatively regulate cell activation via ITAM-bearing receptors when coaggregated with the latter by immune complexes (8Daëron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). FcγRIIB bear a single ITIM that, when tyrosyl-phosphorylated, recruits selectively the SH2 domain-bearing inositol-5-phosphatase SHIP (14Fong D.C. Malbec O. Arock M. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found recently that FcγRIIB are also capable of inhibiting RTK-dependent cell proliferation (15Malbec O. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). This finding opened the possibility that it might be a general property of ITIM-bearing molecules to regulate negatively not only ITAM-dependent cell activation but also RTK-mediated cell proliferation. If so, one could hypothesize that SIRPα might inhibit ITAM-dependent cell activation. By contrast with KIRs whose expression is restricted to NK cells and T cells (11Moretta A. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Pende D. Vitale M. Poggi A. Mingari M.C. Moretta L. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), SIRPα were found to be expressed by all human tissues examined, including hematopoietic cells (3Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), by neural and myeloid cells in rats (16Adams S. van der Laan L.J.V. Vernon-Wilson E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22719-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic cells also express ITAM-bearing receptors. Thus, myeloid cells express ITAM-bearing receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins (FcR) (18Reth M.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 19Daëron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). These comprise high affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI) (20Blank U. Ra C. Miller L. White K. Metzger H. Kinet J.P.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 3228-3236PubMed Google Scholar), and low affinity IgG receptors (FcγRIIIA) (23Ra C. Jouvin M.H.E. Blank U. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1989; 341: 752-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which all share the ITAM-bearing signal transduction subunit FcRγ (18Reth M.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). They also include the human-restricted, single chain, low affinity IgG receptors FcγRIIA/C that bear one ITAM in their own IC domain (18Reth M.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). If they could interfere with ITAM-dependent cell activation, SIRPα would negatively regulate not only the growth but also the many biological functions of hematopoietic cells triggered by Fc receptors. To investigate the hypothesis that SIRPα might negatively regulate cell activation induced by ITAM-bearing receptors, we constructed an experimental model in mast cells. Mast cells were chosen as an assay system because we found SIRPα transcripts in human mast cells. We report here that, when coaggregated with FcεRI, a chimeric molecule whose IC domain was that of human SIRPα could inhibit IgE-induced mediator release and cytokine secretion by mast cells. The experimental model used made possible the biochemical analysis of intracellular events associated with inhibition. Inhibition was correlated with the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the SIRPα chimera, with the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 by the phosphorylated chimera, with a decreased phosphorylation of FcεRI ITAMs, with attenuated Ca2+responses, and with an abolition of MAP kinase activation. cDNA sequences encoding the transmembrane (TM) and IC domains of SIRPα and of a human KIR were amplified from the human melanoma cell line HT-144 (from the ATCC) and from the p58.183 KIR cDNA (24Wagtmann N.

IgG and F(ab′)2 fragments of mouse anti-rat Ig (MAR) and FITC-conjugated MAR F(ab′)2 fragments (FITC-MAR F(ab′)2) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). MAR F(ab′)2 were trinitrophenylated with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (Eastman-Kodak Co.) and purified on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TNP10-MAR F(ab′)2 were obtained. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse mAb anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); mouse mAbs anti-SHP-1 and anti-SHP-2 were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); mouse mAbs anti-Erk1/2 and anti-phospho-Erk1/2 were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); HRP-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse Ig (GAM) antibodies and polyclonal goat anti-rabbit Ig (GAR) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). RBL transfectants were incubated for 1 h at 0 °C with 10 μg/ml 2.4G2 mAb in balanced salt solution containing 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed and stained by being incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with 50 μg/ml FITC-MAR F(ab′)2. Fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). RNA was extracted from 1 × 107 KU812, HMC-1, and cord blood-derived human mast cells. cDNAs were prepared and used as templates to amplify sequences corresponding to the TM and IC domains of SIRPα using the two oligonucleotides SIRPα sense and antisense. Amplified fragments were sequenced using the same two oligonucleotides. RBL transfectants, loaded with [3H]serotonin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with IgE anti-DNP and with 0 or 3 μg/ml 2.4G2 F(ab′)2, washed, and challenged for 30 min at 37 °C with TNP-MAR F(ab′)2 or with MAR F(ab′2) and DNP-BSA. The percentage of [3H]serotonin released was measured as described (30Daëron M. Bonnerot C. Latour S. Fridman W.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1365-1373PubMed Google Scholar). RBL transfectants, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with IgE anti-DNP and 0 or 3 μg/ml 2.4G2 F(ab′)2, were challenged for 3 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml TNP-MAR F(ab′)2. Cell-free supernatants were harvested and titrated for TNFα on L929 cells as described (33Latour S. Bonnerot C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2155-2162PubMed Google Scholar). RBL transfectants, previously sensitized with IgE anti-DNP and incubated with or without 2.4G2 F(ab′)2, were loaded with 5 mm Fluo-3-AM in the presence of 0.2% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in medium in which calcium had been buffered to 60 nm (equivalent to the intracellular Ca2+concentration in resting cells) with EGTA. One min later, they were challenged with TNP-MAR F(ab′)2 for 100 s, after which the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was raised to 1.3 mm with CaCl2. Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was monitored by flow cytometry with a FACScalibur using the software FCS assistant 1.2.9β (Becton Dickinson). RBL transfectants were incubated with IgE anti-DNP and 0 or 3 μg/ml 2.4G2 F(ab′)2, washed, and challenged for various periods of time at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml TNP-MAR F(ab′)2. Aliquots of 3 × 107cells were lysed for 10 min at 0 °C. For immunoprecipitation of FcγRIIB, lysis buffer contained 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For immunoprecipitation of FcεRI, lysis buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with immunoadsorbents for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose or 2.4G2 coupled to protein G-Sepharose was used to precipitate FcγRIIB from cells preincubated with 2.4G2 or not, respectively. Anti-mouse IgE antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) were used to precipitate FcεRI from cells sensitized with mouse IgE. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were saturated either with 5% BSA (Sigma) or with 5% skimmed milk (Régilait, Saint-Martin-Belle-Roche, France) and Western-blotted with HRP-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or with rabbit anti-FcγRIIB, mouse anti-SHP-1, mouse anti-SHP-2, mouse anti-FcRβ, or rabbit anti-FcRγ antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated GAR or GAM. Anti-SHP-2 antibodies detected two species of SHP-2. Anti-SHP-1 and anti-SHP-2 antibodies recognized specifically SHP-1 and SHP-2, respectively. HRP-conjugated antibodies were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When blotted sequentially with different antibodies, filters were stripped following revelation by being incubated for 30 min at 50 °C in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS. RBL transfectants were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with IgE anti-DNP and with 0 or 3 μg/ml 2.4G2 F(ab′)2, washed, and challenged with 10 μg/ml TNP-MAR F(ab′)2. Equal volumes of cell lysates, obtained as described for immunoprecipitation of FcγRIIB, were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes, and blotted with anti-phospho-Erk1/2 or with anti-Erk1/2 antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated GAR. HRP-conjugated antibodies were detected using the ECL kit. We investigated first the presence of SIRPα transcripts in RNA from human mast cells by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers that could amplify a 435-base pair long fragment corresponding to the TM and IC domains of human SIRPα. A single PCR product having the expected size was amplified from cDNAs from the human mast cell line HMC-1 and from cord blood-derived human mast cells but not from the basophil-like cell line KU812 (Fig. 1 A). PCR products amplified from HMC-1 and from cord blood-derived mast cells were sequenced. They had the same nucleotide sequence as cDNA encoding the TM and IC domains of human SIRPα (3Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether SIRPα could inhibit IgE-induced mast cell activation, we constructed a cDNA encoding a chimeric molecule having the extracellular domain of murine FcγRIIB and the TM and IC domains of human SIRPα (FcγRIIB-SIRPα). As a positive control, a cDNA encoding a chimeric molecule having the extracellular domain of murine FcγRIIB and the TM and IC domains of a human KIR (FcγRIIB-KIR) was also constructed (Fig. 1 B). Chimeric cDNAs were stably transfected in the rat mast cells RBL-2H3, which constitutively express FcεRI. Clones of transfectants expressing comparable amounts of FcγRIIB-SIRPα or FcγRIIB-KIR (Fig. 1 C) and, as negative controls, clones expressing tail-less FcγRIIB (FcγRIIB(IC1)) (30Daëron M. Bonnerot C. Latour S. Fridman W.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1365-1373PubMed Google Scholar, 33Latour S. Bonnerot C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2155-2162PubMed Google Scholar) were used for experiments. Several clones expressing each molecule gave comparable results. FcγRIIB-SIRPα, FcγRIIB-KIR, or FcγRIIB(IC1) were coaggregated with FcεRI in RBL transfectants sensitized with mouse IgE anti-DNP, incubated with F(ab′)2 fragments of the rat anti-mouse FcγRIIB mAb 2.4G2, and challenged with TNP-MAR F(ab′)2 as described previously (34Malbec O. Fong D. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1647-1658PubMed Google Scholar). Serotonin release induced under these conditions was compared with serotonin release induced by aggregating FcεRI with TNP-MAR F(ab′)2 in the same three transfectants sensitized with mouse IgE anti-DNP but not incubated with 2.4G2 F(ab′)2. When coaggregated with FcεRI, FcγRIIB-SIRPα inhibited serotonin release as efficiently as FcγRIIB-KIR, but not FcγRIIB(IC1) (Fig.2 A). To determine the conditions required for FcγRIIB-SIRPα to inhibit serotonin release, transfectants expressing FcγRIIB-SIRPα were sensitized with mouse IgE anti-DNP and incubated with 2.4G2 F(ab′)2. FcεRI and FcγRIIB-SIRPα were then either coaggregated by TNP-MAR F(ab′)2 as above or aggregated simultaneously, but independently, by DNP-BSA and MAR F(ab′)2, respectively. Cells sensitized with IgE but not incubated with 2.4G2 F(ab′)2 served as positive controls. Serotonin release was inhibited when FcεRI and FcγRIIB-SIRPα were coaggregated by TNP-MAR F(ab′)2 but not when they were simultaneously aggregated by DNP-BSA and MAR F(ab′)2 (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether FcγRIIB-SIRPα could inhibit an IgE-induced secretion of cytokine, FcεRI were either aggregated or coaggregated with FcγRIIB-SIRPα in transfectants expressing FcγRIIB-SIRPα, using the same ligands as above, and the amount of TNFα released in culture supernatants during the following 3 h was titrated using a bioassay. When coaggregated with FcεRI, FcγRIIB-SIRPα inhibited about 90% of the TNFα secretion (Fig. 2 C). We examined next the phosphorylation of FcγRIIB-SIRPα when coaggregated with FcεRI or not. FcγRIIB-SIRPα was immunoprecipitated from transfectants expressing FcγRIIB-SIRPα that had been incubated with medium alone, IgE anti-DNP and/or 2.4G2 F(ab′)2, and challenged with or without TNP-MAR F(ab′)2 for 3 min at 37 °C. Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that the basal phosphorylation of the chimera slightly increased when FcγRIIB-SIRPα was aggregated but not when FcεRI were aggregated. It increased dramatically when FcγRIIB-SIRPα was coaggregated with FcεRI (Fig.3 A). When FcγRIIB-SIRPα was coaggregated with FcεRI for various periods, its phosphorylation was apparent at 1 min, maximum between 3 and 10 min, and still visible at 30 min (Fig. 3 B). When coaggregated with FcεRI, tail-less FcγRIIB failed to be phosphorylated (data not shown). Four tyrosine residues are present in the IC domain of SIRPα, which are each constitutive of an ITIM-like motif. To identify SH2 domain-bearing phosphatases possibly recruited in vivo by FcγRIIB-SIRPα, the SIRPα chimera was immunoprecipitated after it had or had not been coaggregated with FcεRI, and phosphatases coprecipitated with FcγRIIB-SIRPα were identified by Western blotting. Some SHP-2 coprecipitated with weakly phosphorylated FcγRIIB-SIRPα in resting cells, and high amounts of SHP-2 coprecipitated with FcγRIIB-SIRPα that became heavily phosphorylated upon coaggregation with FcεRI. SHP-1 was coprecipitated with FcγRIIB-SIRPα following coaggregation of the chimera with FcεRI only. Under the same conditions, FcγRIIB-KIR, which was also phosphorylated upon coaggregation with FcεRI, recruited similar amounts of SHP-1 as FcγRIIB-SIRPα but much less SHP-2. SHIP was recruited neither by FcγRIIB-SIRPα nor by FcγRIIB-KIR (Fig. 3 C). An early step in IgE-induced signaling in mast cells is the tyrosyl phosphorylation of FcεRI ITAMs (35Paolini R. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) which enables the recruitment of SH2 domain-bearing cytoplasmic kinases, leading to an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and adapter molecules that connect phosphorylated receptors with the Ras pathway, leading to the transcription of cytokine genes. In RBL cells, FcεRI are associated with two ITAM-bearing subunits, FcRβ and FcRγ (20Blank U. Ra C. Miller L. White K. Metzger H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of FcεRI ITAMs was examined by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in RBL transfectants sensitized with IgE anti-DNP, after FcεRI were aggregated or coaggregated with the SIRPα chimera for 1, 3, or 10 min at 37 °C and immunoprecipitated with anti-IgE antibodies. FcRβ and FcRγ were identified by Western blot analysis of the same filter with corresponding specific antibodies. The phosphorylation of both FcRβ and FcRγ induced upon FcεRI aggregation was decreased upon coaggregation of FcεRI with the SIRPα chimera (Fig.4 A). Ca2+ responses were monitored in RBL transfectants following FcεRI aggregation or following the coaggregation of FcεRI with the SIRPα chimera and, as a positive control, with the KIR chimera, under conditions that permitted us to measure the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ separately. FcγRIIB-SIRPα and FcγRIIB-KIR similarly reduced both the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and the extracellular Ca2+ influx (Fig. 4 B). The activation of the Ras pathway was assessed by examining the phosphorylation of the MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2. When coaggregated with FcεRI, both FcγRIIB-SIRPα and FcγRIIB-KIR abolished IgE-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by aggregating FcεRI (Fig.4 C). SIRPα were described as negative regulators of growth factor-induced, RTK-mediated cell proliferation (3Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). RTKs transphosphorylate each other when dimerized by growth factors (36Heldin C.-H. Östman A. Cytokines & Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). They induce cells to enter the cell cycle and to divide. ITAM-bearing receptors have no intrinsic protein kinase activity, and they do not induce cells to proliferate. When aggregated by multivalent ligands, they are phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases, and phosphorylated ITAMs serve as docking sites for cytoplasmic SH2 domain-bearing protein tyrosine kinases and adapter molecules that lead to cell activation (37Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 1"
https://openalex.org/W2112435732,"TYK2, a Janus kinase, plays both structural and catalytic roles in type I interferon (IFN) signaling. We recently reported (Rani, M. R. S., Gauzzi, C., Pellegrini, S., Fish, E., Wei, T., and Ransohoff, R. M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1891–1897) that catalytically active TYK2 was necessary for IFN-β to induce the β-R1 gene. We now report IFN-β-mediated activation of STATs and other components in U1 (TYK2-null) cell lines that were complemented with kinase-negative (U1.KR930) or wild-type TYK2 (U1.wt). We found that IFN-β induced phosphorylation on tyrosine of STAT3 in U1.wt cells but not in U1.KR930 cells, whereas STAT1 and STAT2 were activated in both cell lines. Additionally, IFN-β-mediated phosphorylation of interferon-α receptor-1 (IFNAR-1) was defective in IFN-β treated U1.KR930 cells, but evident in U1.wt cells. In U1A-derived cells, the p85/p110 phosphoinositol 3-kinase isoform was associated with IFNAR-1 but not STAT3, and the association was ligand-independent. Further, IFN-β treatment stimulated IFNAR-1-associated phosphoinositol kinase activity equally in either U1.wt or U1.KR930 cells. Our results indicate that catalytically active TYK2 is required for IFN-β-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and IFNAR-1 in intact cells.

Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). U1A cells are completely refractory to IFN-α, yet retain a partial responsiveness to IFN-β (2Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), suggesting that IFN-β, but not IFN-α, activates both TYK2-dependent and -independent signaling pathways (3Uze G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of U1A cells with wild-type or mutant forms of TYK2 has revealed a surprising diversity of structural and catalytic functions for TYK2 in the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR-1/2) complex. For example, the N region (residues 1–591) of TYK2 was required for stable cytoplasmic accumulation of IFNAR-1 protein (4Richter M.F. Dumenil G. Uze G. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24723-24729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Individual Janus kinase homology domains within the N region were specifically implicated in IFNAR-1/TYK2 interaction and signaling in response to IFN-α (4Richter M.F. Dumenil G. Uze G. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24723-24729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the TYK2 kinase domain was found to be dispensable for some aspects of IFN-α/β signaling, such as the IFN-dependent induction of many classical IFN-stimulated genes (5Velazquez L.

Recent studies using alanine substitutions on the extracellular domain of IFNAR-2 has revealed the type I IFNs interacted differently with the two receptor subunits IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 (7Lewerenz M. Mogensen E. Uze G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TYK2 has been implicated in the direct phosphorylation of IFNAR-1 in vitro (8Colamonici O. Yan H.

Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1891-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) recently reported that catalytically functional TYK2 was required for induction of the β-R1/I-TAC gene by IFN-β. In addition to the above functions, TYK2 may also play a role in the recruitment of other signaling molecules to the IFNAR1/2 complex (11Yang C.-H. Shi W. Basu L. Murti A. Constantinescu S.N. Blatt L. Croze E Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8057-8061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). STAT3, which has been reported to “dock” on phosphorylated IFNAR-1, has also been described as an adaptor for coupling PI3K to the IFN pathway in Daudi cells (12Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Overexpression of STAT3 restored antiviral and antiproliferative responses in an IFN-resistant Daudi cell line (13Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although TYK2 is believed to mediate IFNAR-1 phosphorylation, which in turn is considered essential for recruiting STAT3 to the IFNAR-1/2 complex, the role of TYK2 in STAT3 activation has not been examined directly. PI3K designates a family of enzymes that phosphorylate the D3 position of phosphatidylinositol. PI3K consists of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) that associates with an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85). Ligand-dependent interactions between the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit and the phosphotyrosine containing YXXM motif present on several cytokine/growth factor receptors have been reported (14Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated lipid products of this enzymatic reaction may act as second messengers to activate protein kinases such as the Akt gene product (15Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) or certain forms of protein kinase C (16Coffer P. Lutticken C. van Puijenbroek A. Klop-de Jong M. Horn F. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar). p85/p110 PI3K exhibits enhanced lipid kinase and protein serine kinase activity in type I IFN-treated cells. A major substrate for PI3K activity in the IFN pathway appears to be insulin receptor substrate-1 as evidenced by the detection of IFN-α-dependent serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 in U-266 cells and inhibition of such phosphorylation by the semi-selective PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (17Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D.A. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments no interactions between p85 and TYK2, JAK1, IFNAR-1, or IFNAR-2c were detected suggesting PI3K did not interact with IFN-α signaling components upstream of insulin receptor substrate-1 (17Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D.A. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the role of serine/lipid kinases such as PI3K in the biological response to IFN remains poorly understood. In this report we demonstrate that catalytically active TYK2 is essential for IFN-β-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3 and IFNAR-1 in U1A-derived cell lines. We found PI3K to co-immunoprecipitate with IFNAR-1, but not STAT3. Furthermore, IFNAR-1-associated PI3K activity was markedly elevated by IFN-β in the presence or absence of catalytically active TYK2, consistent with the observation that PI3K association with the IFNAR-1 receptor component was phosphotyrosine-independent. Thus, it appears that in these cells TYK2 and PI3K activation are not interdependent, suggesting that these molecules have distinct downstream signaling functions. Human fibrosarcoma 2fTGH cells, mutant U1A, and derivative cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (2Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M.

Purified recombinant IFN-α2 (1 × 105 units/ml) was obtained from Wellcome Research Laboratories (Kent, United Kingdom), and recombinant IFN-β-1b (2 × 108 units/mg protein) was from Berlex Biosciences (Richmond, CA). IFNs were used at a final concentration of 1,000 units/ml unless stated otherwise. Cells were treated with 15,000 units/ml of IFN for 15 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (18Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol.

Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This mixture (200 μl) was incubated for 2 h with 100 μl of bovine genomic DNA-cellulose (Sigma). The DNA-binding proteins were eluted in high salt buffer, concentrated, and resolved by SDS-PAGE for analysis in Western immunoblotting experiments (18Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with recombinant IFN-β at 37 °C for 10–15 min before preparation of cell extracts. The antibodies used were: anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-STAT3 (D. Levy, NY University), anti-p85 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). STAT proteins were immunoprecipitated from extracts (19Han Y. Rogers N. Ransohoff R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Han Y. Watling D.

Incubation with primary antibody was for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed thoroughly followed by incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Tyrosine phosphorylation was monitored by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies PY20, (Transduction Laboratories) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells at 70–80% confluency in 150-mm-diameter culture dishes were serum-starved (0% fetal bovine serum) for 4 h to suppress endogenous PI3K activity (21Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and treated with IFN-β for varying times. Cells were lysed with buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 14 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Protein concentrations in cell extracts, determined by Bradford reactions, were equalized for each assay. For immunoprecipitation, anti-IFNAR-1 antibodies (22Croze E. Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Pu H. Pfeffer L.M. Perez H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33165-33168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were precoupled to protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, and immunoprecipitation was done at 4 °C for 3 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer 4 to 5 times. The kinase assay in 50 μl contained 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Sigma), 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6,000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/sample). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, an equal volume of water was added, and the reaction was stopped with 300 μl of MeOH:CHCl3 (2:1). After the sample was mixed, 100 μl of water and 200 μl of CHCl3was added. After vortexing, the organic phase was collected, dried, and resuspended in 25 μl CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) and spotted on thin-layer chromatography plates. The plates were developed in CHCl3:MeOH:4N NH4OH:water (45:30:3:5), dried, and exposed to X-O-mat film (Eastman Kodak). The signal was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyville, CA). The availability of sibling cell lines expressing equal amounts of catalytically active (U1.wt) or kinase-deficient (U1.KR930) TYK2 (6Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) provided an opportunity to examine the requirement for catalytic TYK2 in IFN-mediated STAT activation. This question was addressed using GDAC, a technique that monitors activated STATs without selection bias for DNA binding elements (18Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). U1.wt and U1.KR930 cells generated activated STAT1 and STAT2 upon IFN-α (results not shown) or β treatment (Fig. 1 a). GDAC failed to recover STAT3 from lysates of IFN-treated U1.KR930 cells (Fig. 1 a). The activation of STAT1 and STAT2 was 30–40% lower in the U1.KR930 cells compared with U1.wt cells as determined by densitometry analyzed using NIH Image v1.65. IFN-γ as expected mediated activation only of STAT1, equally in both U1.wt and U1.KR930 cells (results not shown). Phosphorylation of tyrosine on STAT1, -2, and -3 was assayed by immunoprecipitation Western blotting experiments. STAT1 and STAT2 were activated in U1.wt and U1.KR930 cells in response to IFN-β (Fig.2 a). Consistent with results obtained by GDAC, STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation was decreased by 45–50% in the U1.KR930 cells compared with U1.wt cells as determined by densitometry with NIH Image v1.65 (Fig. 2 c). No activation of STAT3 was seen in U1.KR930 cells treated with IFN-β (Fig. 2 b) although equivalent amounts of STAT3 protein were present in both the cell lines. The absence of activated STAT3 from IFN-induced DNA-binding complexes was confirmed by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with an oligonucleotide probe for the c-sis-inducible element. The c-sis-inducible element is a growth factor-responsive element, originally identified in the c-fos promoter, that binds homo- and heterodimers of STAT1 and STAT3 (23Hayes T.E. Kitchen A.M. Cochran B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1272-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). No STAT3 containing DNA-binding complexes were detected in the extracts from U1.KR930 cells (results not shown). These results, along with the observations defined by GDAC, indicate that STAT3 activation requires kinase function of TYK2. Binding of type I IFN to its receptor induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor subunits IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2. In vitro studies had revealed that TYK2 directly binds and phosphorylates IFNAR-1 (9Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Colamonici O.R. Uyttendaele H. Domanski P. Yan H. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3518-3522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). STAT3 has also been shown to associate with IFNAR-1 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (11Yang C.-H. Shi W. Basu L. Murti A. Constantinescu S.N. Blatt L. Croze E Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8057-8061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To examine the phosphorylation status of the IFN-α receptor subunits in the presence and absence of catalytically active TYK2, cell lysates from IFN-treated U1.wt and U1.KR930 cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to IFNAR-2c and IFNAR-1 and subjected to Western blot assay. As shown in Fig. 3, IFNAR-2c was phosphorylated in response to either IFN-β or IFN-α in both cell lines. IFNAR-1 immunoprecipitates from IFN-treated U1.wt cells, but not U1.KR930 cells, contained tyrosine-phosphorylated IFNAR-1 (Fig. 3). We concluded that catalytically active TYK2 is essential for tyrosine phosphorylation of IFNAR-1 in intact U1A-derived cells. The absence of STAT3 and IFNAR-1 phosphorylation in IFN-β-treated U1.KR930 cells provided an opportunity to examine IFN-β signaling to PI3K in the absence of these activated components. PI3K has been shown to be activated by IFN-α (17Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D.A. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar, 25Uddin S. Yenush L.

Studies using Daudi cells provided evidence that STAT3 can act as an adaptor to couple PI3K to the IFN pathway (12Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In that study, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was proposed to be essential for association with PI3K. In contrast, experiments using IFN-treated U266 cells showed no association of p85 with Tyk2, Jak1, IFNAR-1, or IFNAR-2c (17Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D.A. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). In UIA-derived cells, we found PI3K to co-immunoprecipitate with IFNAR-1 in the presence or absence of IFN-β in both U1.wt and U1.KR930 cells (Fig.4 a). IFN-inducible phosphatidylinositol kinase activity was detected in anti-IFNAR-1 immunoprecipitates, regardless of the presence of catalytically active TYK2 (Fig. 4 b). A 4–5-fold IFN-inducible increase in lipid kinase activity was observed in both cell lines. We also examined the role of catalytically active TYK2 in association of STAT3 with PI3K in the presence and absence of IFN-β. The p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K failed to co-precipitate with anti-STAT3 (as shown in Fig. 4 c), and failed to associate with phosphopeptides derived from STAT3 (results not shown). Further, STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation did not induce PI3K association in U1.wt cells. PI-specific lipid kinase activity was not detected in STAT3 immunoprecipitates by in vitro kinase assay. We concluded that activated STAT3 does not mediate adaptor function for recruitment of PI3K to the IFN-α/β receptor in U1A-derived cells. We addressed the function of type I IFN receptor signaling components and TYK2 kinase by studying human fibrosarcoma cells that possess all structural elements of the type I IFN receptor but lack the kinase function of TYK2. We found that catalytically active TYK2 is essential for IFNAR-1 phosphorylation by type I IFNs. In vitro studies had indicated that IFNAR-1 was a substrate for TYK2. Results reported here (Fig. 3) demonstrate that catalytically active TYK2 is required for IFN-β-mediated phosphorylation of IFNAR-1 in intact cells. However, phosphorylation of IFNAR-2 by IFNs was not dependent on kinase activity of TYK2. Further, despite the absence of IFNAR-1 phosphorylation in U1.KR930 cells, we did see transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes although the levels were lower than those for the wild-type UIA.wt cells (10Rani M.R.S.

Mogensen E. Uze G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have also shown that IFN-induced transcription does not require a direct interaction of ligand with IFNAR-1. Catalytically active TYK2 was essential for STAT3 phosphorylation by type I IFNs. Our data suggest that failure to phosphorylate IFNAR-1 abrogates STAT3 phosphorylation in U1.KR930 cells. The requirement for STAT1 and STAT2 to generate the transcription factor ISGF3 in response to type I IFN is well characterized (27Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). The role of STAT3 in the transcriptional response to IFN is less certain. STAT3 was initially characterized as a transcription factor that mediates cellular responses to IL-6 and EGF (31Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). STAT3 is activated by a number of growth factors, oncogenes, and nonmitogenic stimuli, and STAT3-null mice are not viable (32Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicated that STAT3 associates with the IFNAR-1 chain of the type I IFN receptor in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner upon IFN-α addition (11Yang C.-H. Shi W. Basu L. Murti A. Constantinescu S.N. Blatt L. Croze E Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8057-8061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Over-expression of STAT3 in a Daudi cell line resistant to antiviral and antiproliferative effects of IFNs restored an IFN-sensitive phenotype (13Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In our studies, U1.wt and U1.KR930 cells clearly manifested IFN-β-regulated antiviral competence. 2M. R. S. Rani and R. M. Ransohoff, unpublished observations. However, in U1.KR930, growth inhibitory responses to IFN-β were not observed. 3D. W. Leaman, M. R. S. Rani, and R. M. Ransohoff, unpublished observations. Therefore, STAT3 activation may be required for induction of genes that mediate antiproliferative effects of type I IFNs in certain cell types. Further insight into the role of STAT3 in IFN signaling and function may be obtained through the identification of IFN-inducible genes whose expression requires activated STAT3. By comparison, PI3K activity, readily induced by IFN-β in U1.KR930 cells, does not appear to be sufficient for IFN-β-mediated antiproliferative effects in the absence of activated STAT3. Genes whose maximal induction by IFN-β appears to require PI3K action have been reported (12Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). 4L. Hibbert, M. R. S. Rani, and R. M. Ransohoff, unpublished observations. Our results extend current understanding of the mechanism by which IFN-β activates PI3K in U1A-derived cell lines. Catalytically active JAK1 is known to be required for PI3K activation in response to IFN-α (33Burfoot M.S. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Smith J.M. Pons S. Paonessaw G. Pellegrini S. White M.F. Kerr I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24183-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate TYK2 kinase activity is not required for IFN-induced activation of P13K. We also found that p85 did not co-precipitate with anti-STAT3 nor associate with phosphopeptides derived from STAT3 (data not shown). Rather, we describe a novel pathway for IFN-β-mediated PI3K activation, through a ligand-independent association between p85 and IFNAR-1. In these cells, PI3K activation by IFN-β proceeded equally in the presence or absence of catalytically active TYK2. This result suggests that TYK2 and P13K signal downstream in parallel, rather than through an obligate kinase cascade. The physiological function(s) of PI3K activation by IFN-β remain to be defined through experiments in which both TYK2 and PI3K-dependent signaling are blocked. We thank George Stark for advice."
https://openalex.org/W1980837311,"Abstract We have recently reported that 23(S)-25-dehydro-1α-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone (TEI-9647) efficiently blocks the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3) (Miura, D., Manabe, K., Ozono, K., Saito, M., Gao, Q., Norman, A. W., and Ishizuka, S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 16392–16399). To clarify the molecular mechanisms of this antagonism, we examined whether TEI-9647 antagonizes the genomic effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3. 10−7 to 10−9 m TEI-9647 inhibited the transactivation effect of 10−8 m1α,25(OH)2D3 in a dose-dependent manner, while TEI-9647 alone did not activate the reporter activity driven by SV40 promoter containing two vitamin D response elements in Saos-2 cells. The antagonistic effect of TEI-9647 was also observed using the rat 24-hydroxylase gene promoter, but the effect was weaker in HeLa and COS-7 cells than in Saos-2 cells. TEI-9647 also exhibited antagonism in an assay system where the VDR fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the reporter plasmid containing the GAL4 binding site were used in Saos-2 cells, but did not in HeLa cells. TEI-9647 reduced the interaction between VDR and RXRα according to the results obtained from the mammalian two-hybrid system in Saos-2 cells, but did not in HeLa cells. The two-hybrid system also revealed that the interaction between VDR and SRC-1 was reduced by TEI-9647 in Saos-2 cells. These results demonstrate that the novel 1α,25(OH)2D3 analogue, TEI-9647, is the first synthetic ligand for the VDR that efficiently antagonizes the action of 1α,25(OH)2D3, although the extent of its antagonism depends on cell type."

Analysis of aromatase transcripts in various human tissues has revealed that their 5′ termini differ from one another in a tissue-specific manner upstream of a common site in the 5′-untranslated region (4Mahendroo M.S.

It is a consequence of expression driven by a distal promoter that resides more than 40 kilobases upstream of exon II. The JEG-3 cell line expresses the placental type transcripts inducible by a number of agents, which makes the cell line a good model system for studying the mechanisms of placental aromatase expression (10Ritvos O.

It is noteworthy that a common trans-factor is involved in the expression of two hormone related genes that are characteristic of human placenta.

A composite enhancer (−180/−111 bp) of the glycoprotein α-subunit gene promoter, featuring two cAMP response elements and an upstream regulatory element (URE), is responsible for its placental expression. URE has been further subdivided into three overlapping sites, an α-activator element, TSE, and URE1 (15Pittman R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also found that human GATA-2 and GATA-3 bind to the α-activator element, with TSE/URE1 forming an overlapping element that may be bound by two functionally interchangeable proteins, TSEBP and URE-binding protein (15Pittman R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-264504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, the trophoblast-specific enhancer region of the aromatase gene does not contain cAMP response element or GATA binding domains. There are some recognition sites for transcription factors like PEA, Sp1, and AD4 (17Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but none of them has proven to be functional. Furthermore, TSE does not exhibit enhancer activity by itself, as shown for both the hCG α-subunit gene (13Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and the aromatase gene (11Yamada K. Harada N. Honda S. Takagi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25064-25069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present report, we document identification of a new regulatory element, tentatively designated trophoblast-specific element 2 (TSE2), in the minimum enhancer region for placenta-specific transcription of the aromatase gene and cloning of a binding protein for the element by a yeast one-hybrid strategy. The cDNA we isolated encodes a protein previously reported as hGCMa (18Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), a mammalian homologue of theDrosophila protein that is the product of glial cell missing gene (gcm). The protein exhibits binding specificity identical to that of the binding activity for TSE2 in JEG-3 cells and is expressed solely in the placenta. These results are the first demonstration of intrinsic targets of a mammalian GCM protein.

Their PstI site was deleted. They were digested by BamHI and HindIII, and subcloned into pBLCAT2 employing BamHI/HindIII sites. Modified FB and HB CAT constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction with mutagenic primers and FB pBLCAT2 as a template. C3-, 2×(C3)-, 4×(C3)- and 5×(C3)-CAT2 were generated as follows. The modified C3 (C3B) fragment, 5′-GATCCATAAGACCCTCATTCCAGAG-3′, and 5′-GATCCTCTGGAATGAGGGTCTTAT-3′ were annealed, phosphorylated by nucleotide kinase (Takara), and ligated. The ligated DNA fragments were size-selected in a 2% GTG agarose gel, blunted using a fill-in reaction with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript KS+. Clones with one, two, four, and five tandem copies of C3 were further subcloned into pBLCAT2 at BamHI/HindIII. The orientation and the positions of the insertion and mutations are shown in Fig. 3 B. Inserted portions of each CAT construct were verified by sequencing. Methods for cell culture, transient transfections, and CAT assays were as described previously (11Yamada K. Harada N. Honda S.

Preparation of nuclear extracts from mammalian cells and details of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were as described previously (11Yamada K. Harada N. Honda S. Takagi Y. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 371: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) screening was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five tandem repeats of modified C3 (C3B), cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript KS+, were further subcloned into the yeast reporter plasmid pHISi-1 (CLONTECH) atXbaI/EcoRI or pLacZi atHindIII/SmaI. The reporter constructs were subsequently integrated into the yeast strain YM4271, yielding YM4271-TSE2-His3 and YM4271-TSE2-LacZ. These yeast strains were used as host strains for the library screening. The histidine yeast reporter strain was transformed with a MATCHMAKER human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) by the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method. Approximately 2.1 × 104 transformants were plated per 95 × 137-mm plate containing his− leu− minimal selective medium supplemented with 30 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma). Approximately 1 × 106 cDNA plasmids were screened in two different transformations. Sixty-two histidine-positive clones were selected by their large colony size and rapid growth. Crude DNA fractions were recovered from positive yeast clones and electroporated into the Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue. Plasmids were rescreened by transforming them into YM4271-TSE2-lacZ plating on leu− ura− minimal medium. The filter replica method using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (40 μg/ml) was used for β-galactosidase activities. Fifteen clones with high activities were selected and grouped into five distinct groups. Positive clones were further subcloned into pVL1392 (Invitrogen) and transfected into Spodoptera frugiperdaSf21 cells with linearized baculovirus DNA using a BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen). Recombinant virus amplification and infection were conducted following the manufacturer's instructions. The infected Sf21 cells were maintained at 27 °C in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described earlier (26Ogawa H. Hayashi H. Hori H. Kobayashi T. Hosono R. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Three days postinfection, cells were harvested in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in the buffer for preparation of nuclear extracts. They were processed as for extracts from mammalian cells, except leupeptin (1 μg/ml) and pepstatin A (2 μg/ml) were added to the homogenate and extraction buffer. A Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A) RNA/lane was purchased from CLONTECH. The blot was probed with a 506-bp fragment (483 bp/988 bp) of TSE2BP/hGCMa (Fig. 6 A). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 3 h in Express Hyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH), and washing was carried out twice with 0.1× SSC/0.05% SDS at 65 °C. The membrane was then stripped and reprobed with a β-actin probe. As we showed previously, the upstream region −301 from the transcription start site was sufficient to dictate the expression of the placenta-specific exon I of the aromatase gene. The region spanning −307 to −142 (designated as FB) was capable of dictating trophoblast-specific expression under a heterologous TK promoter. A smaller region that was designated as HB (−217/−142) also retained the cell type-specific enhancer activity although it was reduced to about 15 of that of FB (11Yamada K. Harada N. Honda S. Takagi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25064-25069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In EMSAs, the labeled HB fragment gave two specific binding complexes (indicated as an arrowhead and a double arrowhead in Fig. 1, lane 2) with nuclear extract prepared from JEG-3 cells. The major complex was displaced by a 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA fragments C4 (−177/−153) (lane 3) in HB and C2 (−300/−274) in the basal promoter FB region (11Yamada K. Harada N. Honda S. Takagi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25064-25069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As described previously, both C4 and C2 contained a motif recognized by TSE-binding protein originally described in the α-hCG gene (12Steger D.J. Altschmied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Pittman R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The minor, fast moving band was not displaced by unlabeled C4 but was competed by a 400-fold molar excess of a 22-bp DNA fragment corresponding to positions −205 to −184 from the transcription initiation site, designated as C3 (lane 4). When C3 was used as a radioactive probe (lanes 5–12), a single binding complex was observed. The formation of this complex was inhibited by a 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled HB and C3 as expected but not by C2 or C4. Unexpectedly, however, the α-hCG TSE analogues inhibited the binding. Mutation of the TSE at C−172 to T abolishes the competition to the TSE, whereas a mutant with T−169changed to C retains the activity (15Pittman R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutants were effective as a competitor for the binding to C3 probe (lanes 10 and 11). This result suggests that the 24-bp fragment TSE from α-hCG gene is an active competitor for binding to C3, although this competition is not due to the TSE recognition sequence itself. We tentatively named the core sequence in the C3 fragment the trophoblast-specific element 2 (TSE2), because, as we show later in this paper, this element is functional in the aromatase promoter, and its binding activity seems to be restricted in trophoblasts. To elucidate the recognition sequence for TSE2-binding protein in the C3 fragment, we planned a set of EMSAs in which a series of C3 analogues with sequential mutations were tested for their competition with the C3 probe. As shown in Fig. 2, mutations of AC or CC spanning −199 to −196 most affected competitive activity of the fragments. A 200-fold excess of mutant fragments was unable to compete with the C3 probe (lanes 4 and5). On the other hand, mutations introduced into the following five bases gave less significant effects. TSE analogues were also found to be weak competitors, suggesting lower affinities for the putative TSE2BP. As illustrated in the lower part of Fig.2 A, the 24-bp TSE fragment (a portion of it shown as a reverse sequence) of the α-hCG gene, contains the most critical four bases, ACCC, for recognition for TSE2BP and the adjacent TNA in the reverse direction. The critical mutation in the recognition motif of TSE-binding protein, namely C (shown as G with an asterisk) to T at −172 resulted in a less significant change in the TSE2BP recognition context. The functions of the TSE2 in the C3 region and the TSE-like element in C4 region (referred to as C4corehereafter) were examined. Two mutations were selected. One was a change of AG at −161/−162 to CT, shown as C4n in Fig.3, expected to disrupt the C4core that would be recognized by TSEBP. The other change was CC to AA (C3l) shown in Fig. 2. C4 is a distinct element that does not compete with C3, but it contains an ACCC motif also seen in C3 as illustrated in Fig. 2. The TSE in the α-hCG promoter competes with C4(11) and weakly with C3 (Fig. 1, lane 9, and Fig. 2, lane 8). In the α-hCG TSE, the regions necessary for the competition to C3 or C4 are partly overlapping. Any mutation introduced in either C3 or C4 might result in a new binding sequence for the other site and thus an ambiguous result in the CAT assay. To rule out this possibility, the competition abilities of these mutated fragments were tested to confirm that the mutation specifically destroyed the competitive activity toward the intended binding site but had no effect on the other binding (Fig. 3 A). When either of these mutations was introduced into the HB CAT construct under a heterologous TK promoter, the enhancer activity was virtually lost in the CAT assay, (Fig. 3 B). This result shows that the TSE2 in the C3 fragment and the C4core are both necessary for minimum enhancer activity of the trophoblast-specific promoter in the aromatase gene. TSE2 alone did not show any enhancer activity when one, two, four, or five copies were placed in tandem upstream of TK promoter. We previously showed that multiple copies of C2 that contain the binding site for TSEBP do not possess enhancer activity by themselves (11Yamada K. Harada N. Honda S. Takagi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25064-25069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The effect of C3 mutation was also examined in the basal enhancer carried by the FB fragment. The FB CAT reporter carrying the C3l mutation was about a half (48.6 ± 5.8%) as active as the wild type reporter. Recently, a binding protein to TSE in the α-hCG gene was identified as a transcription factor of the AP2 family (27Johnson W. Albanese C. Handwerger S. Williams T. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15405-15412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Binding activities to C2 and C4 were both competed by a consensus AP2 binding site. With the nuclear extract used in this study, the binding activity to C2 or C4 was not inhibited by anti-AP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). In the nuclear extract prepared in the presence of protease inhibitor mixtures, however, the binding complex appeared in a slower migrating position and was inhibited by the antibody (data not shown). The AP2 family protein thus seems to bind to the C2 and C4 region in the aromatase enhancer. TSE2 appears to be functionally involved in the expression of the placenta-specific aromatase transcript and, as we later show, occurrence of its binding activity seems to be restricted. A placenta-specific transcription factor might bind to this site. Since TSE2 does not contain any known cis-element of transcription factors, we applied yeast one-hybrid strategy (24Li J.J. Herkowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 25Lehming N. thanos D. Brickman J.M. Ma J. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1994; 371: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) to isolate a cDNA clone encoding the TSE2-binding protein. Five tandem copies of the C3B were ligated together and subcloned into the upstream region of the minimal promoter of either the pHISi-1 or pLacZi reporter plasmids and integrated into the yeast genome of YM4271. With the strategy described under “Materials and Methods,” we screened 1.0 × 106 cDNA plasmids and isolated 15 positive clones with high β-galactosidase activity. They encoded five different proteins with various types of DNA-binding domains. Apparently, the reporter sequence had ambiguously contained binding sites for multiple DNA binding proteins. To identify the “true” TSE2-binding protein, we subcloned the positive clones into pVL1392 and expressed them in the baculovirus/Sf21 insect cell system. Nuclear extracts were prepared from these virus-infected cells, and EMSA was performed. A cDNA encoding Caenorhabditis elegans protein kinase C in the reverse direction was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig.4, the virus containing clone B17 produced nuclear extract with one extra band at approximately 41 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In EMSA, the nuclear extract showed multiple specific binding complexes with the C3 probe. Control nuclear extract did not produce any binding complexes. All the multiple binding complexes produced by the expressed B17 competed with C3 but not with mutated C3 (C3l). The binding specificity of the expressed protein derived from clone B17 was further examined with various DNA fragments as competitors (Fig. 4 C). The binding complexes of the expressed clone were not inhibited by C3 mutants with effective mutations like C3l and C3p but weakly inhibited by C3s. They were weakly inhibited by TSE but not inhibited by C2 or C4. The specificity was essentially the same as that of the binding activity found in the JEG-3 nuclear extract, although the position of the bands appeared differently in gels. The complete nucleotide sequence of the B17 clone was determined by dideoxy sequencing (ABI). The complete nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequences of B17 were deposited in GenBankTM. The 2652-bp clone has an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 436 amino acid with a predicted molecular mass of 49,213 daltons. A data base search revealed it to be essentially the same cDNA as the human cDNA hGCMa described by Akiyama et al. (18Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). There are two nucleotide differences in the coding region; C in hGCMa is T in B17 at 17 bp from the translation start site, and G in hGCMa is A in B17 at 1157 bp, resulting in two changes of amino acid residues, Ser6 and Gly386 in hGCMa, to Phe6 and Glu386in B17, respectively. hGCMa has been described as a mammalian protein with a conserved GCM motif that constitutes the binding domain of the DrosophilaGCM protein (18Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). GCM is the product of the Drosophila gcm gene and a regulator of early gliogenesis. It is a transcription factor in Drosophila with a novel type of DNA-binding domain, termed the GCM motif in the amino-terminal region. Two groups have determined binding sites for the DrosophilaGCM protein by binding site selection assays (18Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 28Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When aligned, the two proposed GCM binding sites and TSE2 look similar (Fig.5 A). The first and the fifth guanines were put in TSE2 context (C3g1 and C3g2) and used as competitors in EMSA with C3 probe and the nuclear extract prepared from JEG-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, they demonstrated good competition. A 506-bp fragment of hGCMa/TSE2BP-specific region (483 bp/988 bp) was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis of various human tissues (Fig.6). A major 3.0-kilobase band and a minor bigger band (4.2 kilobases) were detected in placenta. Other tissues did not show any signal even after prolonged exposure. Binding activity to the C3 probe was detected in the nuclear extract prepared from human placenta (Fig. 7), which showed a similar electrophoretic pattern of specific binding complexes to that of Sf21 cells expressing hGCMa/TSE2BP. The nuclear extracts prepared from Hep-G2 or HeLa cells did not give a specific binding complex with C3 probe. Several cis-elements have been described to be a components of placenta-specific enhancers in various genes. Some of them, like PSE in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gene (19Wang Z. Melmed S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26069-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), PLE1 and PLE3 in the leptin gene (20Bi S. Gavrilova O. Gong D.-W. Mason M.M.

https://openalex.org/W1627004187,"The Fas (CD95, APO-1) receptor is a membrane-associated polypeptide that can mediate apoptosis in various cell types. Although Fas receptor is expressed in endothelial cells (EC), little is known about its function in these cells. The expression of Fas by liver endothelial cells (LEC) suggests that upon stimulation, apoptosis may occur in these cells. We show that Fas is highly and constitutively expressed in cloned murine liver endothelial cells (LEC-1). In contrast, FasL expression was not detected at the protein and mRNA level in these cells. Our results show that Fas ligation in LEC-1 induces apoptotic cell death, indicating that Fas receptor is functional in these cells. The doses of Fas agonist required to induce LEC-1 apoptosis were higher than those used previously in other cells, including hepatocytes, suggesting that LEC-1 are highly resistant to the Fas apoptotic pathway. TNF treatment of LEC-1 induced up-regulation of Fas receptor on these cells. In contrast, TNF did not induce the expression of FasL on LEC-1. An increased susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis was observed in TNF-treated LEC-1. Enhanced susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis was also observed in LEC-1 pretreated with actinomycin D, suggesting that transcription of message coding for protective proteins is necessary to protect these cells against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Up-regulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was observed in LEC-1 treated with a dose of Fas agonist that does not induce apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report that Fas mediates apoptosis in LEC, suggesting that apoptosis of these cells may participate in the liver damage observed in animals after receiving anti-Fas mAb or soluble FasL. Our findings also suggest that the Fas/FasL system may transduce activating signals independently of cell death in LEC-1.—Cardier, J. E., Schulte, T., Kammer, H., Kwak, J., Cardier, M.

https://openalex.org/W1612547865,"Peroxynitrite, a potent cytotoxic oxidant formed by the reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with the superoxide anion, was recently proposed to play a major pathogenic role in the inflammatory process. Here we have investigated the effects of endogenous melatonin, a known scavenger of peroxynitrite, in rats subjected to carrageenan-induced pleurisy. Endogenous melatonin was depleted in rats maintained on 24 h light cycle for 1 wk. In vivo depletion of endogenous melatonin enhanced the carrageenan-induced degree of pleural exudation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration in rats subjected to carrageenan-induced pleurisy. Lung myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation were significantly increased in melatonin-deprived rats. However, the inducible NO synthase in lung samples was unaffected by melatonin depletion. Immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine revealed a positive staining in lungs from carrageenan-treated rats that was markedly enhanced in melatonin-deprived rats. Furthermore, melatonin depletion significantly increased peroxynitrite formation as measured by the oxidation of the fluorescent dye dihydrorhoda-mine 123, enhanced DNA damage and the decrease in mitochondrial respiration and reduced the cellular levels of NAD+ in macrophages harvested from the pleural cavity of rats subjected to carrageenan-induced pleurisy. In vivo treatment with exogenous melatonin (15 mg/kg intraperitoneal) significantly reversed the effects of melatonin depletion. Thus, endogenous melatonin plays an important protective role against carrageenan-induced local inflammation.— Cuzzocrea, S., Tan, D.-X., Costantino, G., Mazzon, E., Caputi, A. P., Reiter, R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2017962087,"Nitrogen fixation in symbiotic rhizobia is subject to multiple levels of gene regulation. In Sinorhizobium meliloti, the alfalfa symbiont, the FixLJ two-component regulatory system plays a major role in inducing nitrogen fixation and respiration gene expression in response to the low ambient O2 concentration of the nodule. Here we report on the mode of action of the FixT protein, a recently identified repressor of nitrogen fixation gene expression in S. meliloti. First, we provide evidence that FixT prevents transcription of the intermediate key regulatory genes nifA and fixK by counteracting the activity of the FixLJ two-component system under otherwise inducing microoxic conditions. Second, we demonstrate that FixT acts as an inhibitor of the sensor hemoprotein kinase FixL, preventing the production or the accumulation of its phosphorylated form. FixT is thus a new example of a regulatory protein that blocks signal transduction in two-component systems at the level of the sensor kinase.

First, we provide evidence that FixT prevents transcription of the intermediate key regulatory genes nifA and fixK by counteracting the activity of the FixLJ two-component system under otherwise inducing microoxic conditions. Second, we demonstrate that FixT acts as an inhibitor of the sensor hemoprotein kinase FixL, preventing the production or the accumulation of its phosphorylated form. FixT is thus a new example of a regulatory protein that blocks signal transduction in two-component systems at the level of the sensor kinase. polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In legumes, nitrogen fixation takes place in a specialized organ, the nodule, that rhizobia elicit on the roots of their host plants. Within the nodule, rhizobia acquire the capacity to reduce N2 to ammonia that is assimilated by the plant cells. In the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, as in all nitrogen fixing systems that have been studied so far, nitrogen fixation is tightly regulated, primarily but not uniquely, at the transcriptional level. InSinorhizobium meliloti (formerly Rhizobium meliloti), the alfalfa symbiont, both positive and negative control of nitrogen fixation gene expression have been described, although positive control is by far the best understood. Positive control is exerted by a two-component regulatory system, FixLJ, that senses the microoxic conditions that prevail inside the nodule (1David M. Daveran M.L. Batut J. Dedieu A. Domergue O.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3759-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Indeed, the legume nodule is a microoxic environment whose dissolved O2 concentration is in the 10–30 nm range. Under microoxic (or anoxic) conditions, the sensor hemoprotein kinase FixL autophosphorylates from ATP on a conserved histidine residue (His285) (3Monson E.K. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5243-5250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and subsequently transfers its phosphate to one of the conserved aspartate residues (Asp54) of the regulator protein FixJ (4Reyrat J.M. David M. Batut J. Boistard P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1969-1976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FixJ dramatically enhances its affinity for the promoters of two intermediate regulatory genes, nifA and fixK, that control expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of nitrogenase and of an oxidase complex with high affinity for oxygen, respectively (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C. Boistard P. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fischer H.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 352-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Galinier A. Garnerone A.M. Reyrat J.M. Kahn D. Batut J. Boistard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23784-23789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early observations indicated that expression of nifA orfixK was enhanced in a fixK mutant (8Batut J. Daveran-Mingot M.L. David M. Jacobs J. Garnerone A.M. Kahn D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that repression by fixKactually involved activation of a repressor gene, calledfixT (9Foussard M. Garnerone A.M. Ni F. Soupène E. Boistard P. Batut J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), located downstream of the fixLJ operon (Fig. 1 A). We now provide evidence that the FixT protein prevents transcription of nifA and fixK by counteracting the activity of the master FixLJ two-component system under microoxic conditions. We further demonstrate that FixT behaves as an inhibitor of the FixL sensor kinase, preventing synthesis or accumulation of its phosphorylated form. Biological implications of this finding are discussed with respect to the regulation of symbiotic nitrogen fixation as well as in terms of signal processing by two-component regulatory systems in general. GMI939, -940, and -941 are derivatives of GMI211 (lac Smr), constructed as described in Ref. 9Foussard M. Garnerone A.M. Ni F. Soupène E. Boistard P. Batut J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Briefly, GMI939 was derived from GMI211 by site-directed inactivation of the −10 promoter region of thefixT1 gene. GMI940 carries an ∼5-kilobase pair deletion that removes the fixT2 gene as well as the adjacent fixK and fixNOQP genes. GMI941 is a derivative of GMI940, in which the 5-kilobase pair deletion has been transduced into GMI939, using a phleomycin resistance marker associated with the deletion (9Foussard M. Garnerone A.M. Ni F. Soupène E. Boistard P. Batut J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RNAs were extracted from 30-ml cultures (A600 = 0.4) in M9 medium of cells incubated under microaerobic conditions (2% oxygen) for 4 h (10de Philip P. Batut J. Boistard P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4255-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and incubated for 10 min at 65 °C in 2 ml of prewarmed lysis solution (1.4% SDS, 4 mm EDTA, 75 μg of proteinase K). Proteins were precipitated by adding 1 ml of NaCl 5 m at 4 °C. Nucleic acids were precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol, and the pellet was resuspended in nuclease-free water. DNA was eliminated by the addition of 7.5 units of fast protein liquid chromatography-pure RNase-free DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNAs were further extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and then precipitated with ethanol. The RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in nuclease-free water. RNAs were denaturated for 10 min at 75 °C before loading on a 2.2 mformaldehyde, 1.5% agarose gel. RNAs were electrotransferred to a Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and probed with a32P-labeled BglII–EcoRVfixK internal fragment. Equal loading of the different lanes in Fig. 1 was ensured by hybridization of the membrane with ahemA probe. For the purpose of quantification, a range of appropriate dilutions of the various RNA preparations was transferred to a Nylon membrane, and the hybridization signals were quantified on a phosphorus screen apparatus (Fuji). Microaerobic induction of nifA was achieved using the stoppered tube assay procedure (11Ditta G. Virts E. Palomares A. Kim C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3217-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). RNAs were purified as described above and quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The absence of contaminating DNA in the preparation was ensured by PCR amplification in the absence of reverse transcriptase. The following oligonucleotides were used to evaluate nifAand hemA gene expression: 5′-ATT AGC TTC GCA AAG CA (nifA reverse primer), 5′-CAG CAA GAA CAA CAG AA (nifA sense primer), 5′-GTC GAT CGC GTT CTT (hemAreverse primer), and 5′-TGG ATG GGC TGC ATC A (hemA sense primer). First-strand cDNA synthesis took place in a 17-μl reaction volume. 1 μl of total bacterial RNA (100 ng), 7.1 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O, and 1 μl (50 ng) of thenifA or hemA reverse primer were heated at 70 °C for 10 min and quickly chilled on ice. After a brief centrifugation, 3.4 μl of 5× buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2), 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of a 25 mm dNTP solution were added and incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. After the addition of 1 μl (200 units) of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and thorough mixing by pipetting up and down, the reaction tube was incubated for 50 min at 42 °C. Reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, since we have observed that heating at 70 °C did not fully inactivate the enzyme. For PCR amplification, 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (200 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, 500 mm KCl), 1 μl of 50 mmMgCl2, 1 μl of dNTP mix (25 mm), 1 μl of reverse primer (50 ng), 1 μl of sense primer (50 ng), 0.5 μl (2.5 units) of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to the first strand synthesis reaction mix. After gentle mixing, the reaction mixture was layered with one drop of silicone oil, heated to 94 °C for 3 min, and submitted to 25 cycles of the following sequence (94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min) and one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. Reverse transcriptase-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Biodyne A Transfer membrane; Pall), and probed with a32P-labeled probe internal to nifA orhemA genes. FixT was essentially purified by affinity chromatography of a fusion protein between FixT and MalE, the maltose-binding protein (Biolabs). DNA corresponding to the putativefixT open reading frame was generated by PCR (ExpandTM Long Template PCR System; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the following two oligonucleotides: 5′-CCCAAGCTTGTTGGATGGGAAAACC and 5′-CCGGAATTCACTAAGGGAAATTCA as primers. These primer oligonucleotides carried HindIII and EcoRI sites (underlined) that were used to clone the fragment into a pBluescript KS+ vector (Stratagene) for verification of the sequence generated by PCR. The EcoRI–HindIII fragment was subsequently recloned between the EcoRI and XmnI sites of pMal-c2. The resulting plasmid (pMF116) was transformed into the TB1 strain of Escherichia coli. MalE-FixT purification was done essentially as described by Biolabs Inc. 3 liters of complete LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) were inoculated with 30 ml of an overnight culture of TB1(pMF116). When the A600 of the culture reached about 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (2 mm) was added, and the culture was incubated for an additional 2 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in C buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and finally disrupted by sonication. The crude cell extract (15 ml) was clarified by centrifugation, diluted to 200 ml with C buffer, and loaded on top of a 40-ml amylose-agarose column (Biolabs). After extensive washing (10 volumes) of the column with C buffer, bound MalE-FixT protein was eluted with C buffer supplemented with 10 mm maltose. Fractions containing MalE-FixT were screened by SDS-PAGE using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Phast Gel System apparatus. Fractions containing pure MalE-FixT were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation over Centripep 10 devices (Amicon). Fractions were stored at −80 °C in the presence of 5% glycerol before use. Quantification of the protein was done by Coomassie Blue staining of protein separated on a SDS-acrylamide gel as compared with standards. The purity of the preparation was estimated to be 80%. Part of the above MalE-FixT protein (20 mg) was incubated with Xa factor protease (200 μg, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at room temperature. The protein mix was then sieved twice on a Sephacryl S200-HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions containing pure FixT were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 5% glycerol. The purity of this FixT preparation was estimated to be 90% from inspection of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The FixL protein used in this work, FixL122, is a truncation of the full-length FixL protein that lacks the N-terminal part that normally anchors the protein to the membrane (12de Philip P. Soupène E. Batut J. Boistard P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). FixL122 and FixJ were purified as described previously (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C. Boistard P. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation assays were essentially as described (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C. Boistard P. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that [γ-33P]ATP (0.4 mm) was used as labeling source (final specific activity ∼5000 dpm/pmol). All reactions were at 28 °C. Phosphorylation reactions were loaded on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. When indicated, reactions were performed under an anaerobic hood facility. Dried gels were autoradiographed at room temperature. When required, quantification was obtained by liquid scintillation counting of excised band gels. Transcription assays were essentially as described (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C. Boistard P. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay monitors the production of a 370-nucleotide-long RNA from supercoiled pJMR300 plasmid, a pTE103 derivative that contains the 5′-end of thefixK gene bracketed between two strong terminators of transcription. All reactions were performed at 28 °C. Three tubes containing FixJ (6 μm) and FixL122 (6 μm) proteins were incubated under anoxic conditions in the presence of 0.4 mm ATP for 20 min. In two of the tubes, FixT (9 μm) or buffer (control) was added prior to ATP addition. In the third tube, FixT was added only after 10 min. Formation of closed complexes was allowed for 10 min after the addition of E. coli RNA polymerase-ς70 holoenzyme (600 nm) and 12.5 nm supercoiled DNA template. This step was also performed under anoxic conditions, since closed complexes are unstable and dissociate in the absence of phosphorylated FixJ protein. Isomerization of closed complexes into open complexes and elongation of RNAs was initiated by adding UTP and GTP (0.4 mm) and 0.1 mm [α-32P]CTP (2 Ci/mmol). Heparin was also added, so that the assay was a single-round transcription assay. In Fig. 2 B, FixT was added after phosphorylation of FixJ by acetylphosphate for 1 h at 25 °C (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C. Boistard P. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription assay was then run in the presence of FixT as described above. Alternatively, the FixJ-P preparation was run over a CentriconTM 3000 microconcentrator (Amicon) in order to eliminate acetylphosphate before adding FixT. 600 μl of FixL122 protein (6 μm) were allowed to autophosphorylate for 60 min under standard conditions (see above). The reaction mix was loaded on top of a G25 Sephadex sieving column. Fractions containing phosphorylated (radioactive) FixL122 were individually screened by TLC (polyethyleneimine-cellulose, Schleicher & Schuell) for the presence of contaminating ATP, ADP, and Pi using 0.75 mpotassium dihydrogenophosphate (pH 3.5) as a buffer. Pure fractions were pooled, concentrated at 4 °C, and used immediately. Purified FixL122-phosphate (6 μm; see above) and FixJ (6 μm) were incubated at 28 °C in standard phosphorylation buffer under aerobic conditions. FixT action was tested by preincubating FixT and FixL122-phosphate before the FixJ addition (t = 0). Phosphotransfer was allowed to proceed for 5, 10, or 15 mn before the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The C-terminal part of FixL (from amino acid position 266 to the end of the protein, position 505) was cloned into a pMalc2 vector to obtain a fusion protein between FixLC and MalE. DNA fragment corresponding to FixLC was purified from pDPD147 plasmid (12de Philip P. Soupène E. Batut J. Boistard P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). pDPD147 was first restricted byNheI, treated with Klenow polymerase, and restricted byBamHI. The fragment of interest was purified on the gel and cloned into XmnI- and BamHI-restricted pMalc2 vector. The resulting plasmid (pAM266L) was transformed into the TB1 strain of E. coli, and the fixLC insert was checked by sequencing. MalE-FixLC purification was done as described above for FixT. Fractions containing the MalE-FixLC fusion protein were pooled and treated with Xa factor protease. The cleaved preparation was concentrated and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 5% glycerol. Its purity was estimated to be ∼50%. Purified proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Tarek Mzadek (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Standard phosphorylation assays of these proteins were as described by Dahl et al.(13Dahl M.K. Msadek T. Kunst F. Rapoport G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14509-14514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylation took place at room temperature in a buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2,0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol). Phosphorylation was initiated by adding 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and 2.5 μm ATP. Reactions were stopped in SDS-loading buffer after 5 min of phosphorylation. FixT action was tested after preincubating FixT with KinA, NtrB, or DegS for 5 min prior to ATP addition. Alternatively, KinA, DegS, and NtrB were phosphorylated under the conditions described above for FixL. fixT is a duplicated gene on the pSym-a megaplasmid of S. meliloti. One copy of fixT, that we shall call fixT1, lies between the regulatory fixLJ and fixK genes (Fig.1 A) and is transcribed from afixK-dependent promoter (9Foussard M. Garnerone A.M. Ni F. Soupène E. Boistard P. Batut J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The second copy offixT, fixT2, is located ∼260 kilobase pairs from fixT1 in a reiterated region that includes a second copy of fixK as well as of thefixNOQP operon (14Renalier M.H. Batut J. Ghai J. Terzaghi B. Ghérardi M. David M. Garnerone A.M. Vasse J. Truchet G. Huguet T. Boistard P. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2231-2238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). nifA instead is unlinked tofixT genes. Northern blot analysis of RNAs extracted from fixT S. meliloti mutant strains and congenic controls incubated under microoxic conditions showed that the levels of fixKtranscript were enhanced in fixT mutants (Fig.1 B). Selective inactivation of fixT1 (9Foussard M. Garnerone A.M. Ni F. Soupène E. Boistard P. Batut J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) led to a 10-fold increase in the level of fixK RNA as compared with the wild-type GMI211 strain (lane 4). Similarly, a strain deleted for fixT2 as well as for the adjacent fixK and fixN genes displayed an increase in the level of fixK RNA (lane 2) as compared with GMI211. For a reason that we ignore, this effect was, however, smaller than the one observed with the fixT1 mutant. The combination of the two sets of mutations in the same strain (GMI941, lane 3) resulted in an ∼50–60-fold increase in the level offixK transcript as compared with the wild-type control strain. We examined the effect of fixT on nifA expression by reverse transcriptase-PCR, since we could not obtain consistent Northern blot hybridization patterns with a nifA probe. Wild-type (GMI211) and fixT (GMI941) S. meliloticells were incubated under nearly anoxic conditions in order to maximize nifA expression (11Ditta G. Virts E. Palomares A. Kim C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3217-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Comparison of thenifA-specific amplification products from extracted RNAs showed higher levels of nifA transcript in the doublefixT mutant as compared with the wild-type strain (Fig.1 C, lanes 1 and 2). Expression of the oxygen-insensitive S. meliloti hemA gene (8Batut J. Daveran-Mingot M.L. David M. Jacobs J. Garnerone A.M. Kahn D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was unaffected by mutations in fixT (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 4). These data suggested that fixT affected the synthesis or the stability of fixK and nifA transcripts. We took advantage of the availability of an in vitro transcription assay for these genes to discriminate between these possibilities. Previous genetic evidence indicated that fixTencoded a repressor protein (9Foussard M. Garnerone A.M. Ni F. Soupène E. Boistard P. Batut J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The FixT protein, encoded byfixT1, was overproduced in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with MalE, the maltose-binding protein, and purified by affinity chromatography over an amylose column (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the experiments described below, either the MalE-FixT protein or the cleaved and purified FixT protein has been used and has led to similar results. A transcription assay for fixK was previously set up (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C. Boistard P. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that relies on the ability of phosphorylated FixJ protein to drivefixK transcription in vitro, at the genuine promoter, in the presence of E. coli ς70-RNA polymerase holoenzyme. The assay is designed in such a way that transcription strictly depends upon phosphorylation of FixJ. It consists of three steps (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). 1) Pure FixJ protein is phosphorylated by incubation with pure FixL protein and ATP for 20 min. The FixL protein that is used, FixL122, is a truncated, soluble, oxygen-responsive form of the full-length FixL protein (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C. Boistard P. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12de Philip P. Soupène E. Batut J. Boistard P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 2) Closed complexes are allowed to form for 10 min by the addition of E. coli RNA polymerase-ς70 holoenzyme and a clonedfixK DNA transcription template to phosphorylated FixJ. 3) Isomerization of closed complexes and elongation of transcription is started upon the addition of the three missing nucleotides. The first two steps are performed under anoxic conditions, since they are readily reversible in air. The addition of highly purified MalE-FixT protein at the onset of FixJ phosphorylation (step 1 above) resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of fixK mRNA synthesized (Fig.2 A, lane 3). The effect of MalE-FixT on fixK transcription was specific, since all other transcripts, which originate from transcription of the vector template DNA genes by E. coliholoenzyme, were unaffected. Thus, FixT specifically blocked initiation of transcription of fixK or elongation of the nascentfixK RNA. The inhibitory effect of FixT was also observed when FixT was added 10 min after FixJ phosphorylation was started (Fig.2 A, lane 4; see “Discussion”). Interestingly, no inhibition of fixK transcription was observed when FixJ was phosphorylated from acetylphosphate (Fig.2 B), a low molecular weight phosphodonor (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C. Boistard P. Batut J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), instead of being phosphorylated from FixL-phosphate. Specifically, FixT had no effect on FixJ-driven transcription if FixT was added to FixJ at the end (Fig. 2 B) or at the beginning of FixJ incubation with acetylphosphate (data not shown). Furthermore, FixT did not inhibit the transcriptional activity of a FixJ-phosphate preparation from which acetylphosphate had been eliminated by molecular sieving (data not shown). This demonstrated first that FixT did not directly dephosphorylate FixJ-phosphate (since the transcription assay relies on phosphorylated FixJ) and, second, that FixT did not inhibit FixJ-phosphate transcriptional activity per se. Rather, these data suggested an implication of FixL in inhibition by FixT. When purified FixL is incubated in the presence of γ-labeled [33P]ATP, the amount of (auto)phosphorylated FixL protein rises linearly over at least the first 15 min of the reaction (16Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16293-16297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B). Subsequently, the amount of FixL-phosphate levels off because of the accumulation of both FixL-phosphate and ADP that promotes the reverse reaction, i.e. FixL-P + ADP → FixL + ATP (16Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16293-16297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When purified FixT protein was preincubated with FixL prior to the addition of γ-labeled ATP (400 μm), no FixL-phosphate accumulation could be detected after 10 min (Fig. 3 A) or after 60 min of incubation (data not shown). In a second set of experiments (Fig. 3 B), FixL was incubated with γ-labeled ATP for 5 min prior to the addition of FixT, thus allowing a detectable amount of FixL-phosphate to be synthesized. Upon the addition of FixT, the level of phosphorylated FixL stabilized but did not decrease, thus excluding a prominent phosphatase activity associated with FixT. This was confirmed by purifying FixL-phosphate from ATP (and ADP) nucleotides in order to prevent further FixL phosphorylation. It was then observed that the addition of FixT (Fig. 3 C) or FixT plus ATP (data not shown) did not enhance the rate of FixL-P dephosphorylation. This is evidence that FixT is not a phosphatase. We also ruled out the possibility of an ATPase activity associated with FixT, since no Pi production or depletion of the ATP pool could be detected on TLC plates after extended incubation of FixT with γ-labeled ATP, even in the presence of FixL (data not shown). We were also unable to detect any (reasonably stable) phosphorylation of FixT after it was incubated with either radiolabeled ATP or FixL-phosphate and separated by SDS-PAGE under neutral pH conditions (data not shown). Thus, the model we presently favor is that FixT either blocks autophosphorylation of FixL from ATP (FixL + ATP → FixL-P + ADP) or enhances the rate of the reverse reaction (i.e. FixL-P + ADP→ FixL + ATP). Both explanations are consistent with the further observation that adding FixT to FixL 60 min after the addition of ATP (i.e.when the phosphorylation reaction FixL + ATP ⇌ FixL-P + ADP had reached equilibrium) resulted in the disappearance of most of FixL-phosphate within 15 min (Fig.4). When FixL and FixJ are incubated together in the presence of γ-labeled ATP under anoxic conditions, the phosphate first enters FixL and then readily transfers to FixJ so that only FixJ-phosphate accumulates (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3). The level of phosphorylated FixJ levels off after a 30–40-min incubation in our assay conditions because of the phosphatase activity associated with FixL (3Monson E.K. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5243-5250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Lois A.F. Weinstein M. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4370-4375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When FixT was added after a 60-min incubation, the level of phosphorylated FixJ decreased dramatically within 15 min (Fig. 5). FixT thus promoted dephosphorylation of FixJ-phosphate. As pointed out above (Fig.2 B), this was not due to a direct dephosphorylation of FixJ-phosphate by FixT. Rather, FixJ-phosphate disappearance was a consequence of the block in FixL-phosphate synthesis that prevented replenishing of the FixJ-phosphate pool (see “Discussion”). In addition, we observed that FixT did not affect phosphotransfer between FixL-phosphate and FixJ as monitored with purified (sieved), nucleotide-free, FixL-phosphate (data not shown). Early trials led us to use FixT at a concentration of 9 μm and FixL at 6 μm (monomers) in the experiments reported above. We subsequently investigated how the activity of FixT varied with its concentration. In a first set of experiments, FixL concentration was kept at 6 μm, and FixT was titrated down from 9 to 0.1 μm. Half-maximum inhibition of FixL autophosphorylation was observed when FixT was ∼1.2 μm, i.e. at a 1:5 ratio between FixT and FixL (Fig. 6). Complete inhibition was observed at ∼3 μm FixT, i.e. at a 1:2 ratio. Similar data were obtained at another concentration of FixL (2 μm monomer) (Fig. 6). These data are consistent with the action of FixT on FixL being stoichiometric rather than catalytic. Based on previous observations that FixL is a dimer in solution (5Reyrat J.M. David M. Blonski C.

https://openalex.org/W2024175375,"β2-Adrenergic receptors (β2AR) act to relax airway smooth muscle and can serve to counteract hyperresponsiveness, although the effect may not be ablative even in the presence of exogenous agonist. Within this signaling cascade that ultimately transduces smooth muscle relaxation, a significant “spare receptor” pool has been hypothesized to be present in the airway. In order to modify the relationship between β2AR and downstream effectors, transgenic mice (TG) were created overexpressing β2AR ∼75-fold in airway smooth muscle using a mouse smooth muscle α-actin promoter. While >90% of these receptors were expressed on the smooth muscle cell surface, the percentage of receptors able to form the agonist-promoted high affinity complex was less than that found with nontransgenic (NTG) cells (RH = 18 versus 36%). Nevertheless, β2AR signaling was found to be enhanced. Intact airway smooth muscle cells from TG had basal cAMP levels that were greater than NTG cells. A marked increase in agonist-stimulated cAMP levels was found in the TG (∼200% stimulation over basal) compared with NTG (∼50% over basal) cells. Adenylyl cyclase studies gave similar results and also showed a 10-fold lower EC50for TG cells. Tracheal rings from TG mice that were precontracted with acetylcholine had an enhanced responsiveness (relaxation) to β-agonist, with a 60-fold decrease in the ED50, indicating that the enhanced signaling imposed by overexpression results in an increase in the coordinated function of the intact airway cells. In vivo studies showed a significantly blunted airway resistance response to the inhaled bronchoconstrictor methacholine in the TG mice. Indeed, with β-agonist pretreatment, the TG mice displayed no response whatsoever to methacholine. These results are consistent with β2AR being the limiting factor in the transduction system. Increases in the initial component of this transduction system (the β2AR) are sufficient to markedly alter signaling and airway smooth muscle function to the extent that bronchial hyperresponsiveness is ablated, consistent with an anti-asthma phenotype. β2-Adrenergic receptors (β2AR) act to relax airway smooth muscle and can serve to counteract hyperresponsiveness, although the effect may not be ablative even in the presence of exogenous agonist.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which airflow obstruction occurs due to an active constriction of airway smooth muscle of the bronchi and airway mucous accumulation. Bronchial smooth muscle cells express numerous G protein-coupled receptors that modulate contractility including β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR), 1The abbreviations used are:β2ARβ2-adrenergic receptor(s)Gsstimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding proteinPenhenhanced pauseNTGnontransgenickbkilobaseORFopen reading framePBSphosphate-buffered salineCYPcyanopindolol which act to relax, and muscarinic receptors, which act to contract, the muscle (1Green S.A. Liggett S.B. Liggett S. Meyers D. The Genetics of Asthma. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 67-90Google Scholar). Agonists to the former and antagonists to the latter receptors are utilized clinically for reversal of bronchoconstriction. The propensity for airway smooth muscle to constrict in asthma has been termed airway hyperresponsiveness (2Postma D.S. Kerstjens H.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158 (suppl.): 187-192Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, a hallmark physiological finding in patients with asthma is hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi to inhalation of constrictive agents such as the muscarinic agonist methacholine. This constrictive response in asthmatics is thought to be ultimately due to sensitization of pathways, such as the cholinergic system, that culminate in airway smooth muscle contraction. Typically, nonasthmatics have no detectable airway response to inhalation of methacholine, and thus airway hyperreactivity has become a defining physiologic parameter. β2-adrenergic receptor(s) stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein enhanced pause nontransgenic kilobase open reading frame phosphate-buffered saline cyanopindolol β2AR are cell surface receptors that couple to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs), activating adenylyl cyclase. Increased intracellular cAMP mediates relaxation of airway smooth muscle by activation of protein kinase A. Protein kinase A acts to phosphorylate myosin light chain kinase, cell surface K+ channels, a Na+/K+ATPase, phospholamban, and one or more pumps that lead to sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake of Ca2+ and acts to inhibit the production of inositol phosphates (3Paul R.J. de Lanerolle P. Liggett S. Meyers D. Genetics of Asthma. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 91-117Google Scholar, 4Hakonarson H. Grunstein M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158 (suppl.): 115-122Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The net effect is a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ and phosphorylation of contractile proteins leading to relaxation. The β2AR subtype is the predominant βAR expressed on bronchial smooth muscle in humans (5Carstairs J.R. Nimmo A.J. Barnes P.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar), although there are some conflicting data regarding the role of the β1AR subtype in bronchodilation in various other species (6Henry P.J. Goldie R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Henry P.J. Rigby P.J. Goldie R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8O'Donnell S.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1972; 19: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Toda N. Hayashi S. Hatano Y. Okunishi H. Miyazaki M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1978; 207: 311-319PubMed Google Scholar). Within the airway, luminal epithelial cells also express β2AR, and some evidence suggests that activation of these receptors contributes to smooth muscle relaxation via an unknown mediator (10Barnes P.J. Cuss F.M. Palmer J.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 86: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The hierarchy of signaling pathways that establishes physiologic bronchomotor tone is not well established. The principle endogenous agonist for airway β2AR is epinephrine. Thus, in the absence of significant elevations in circulating epinephrine, adrenergic control of smooth muscle tone may be primarily due to “basal” coupling of receptor to its effector. Chronic exposure to exogenous agonists in the treatment of bronchospasm can result in desensitization of the β2AR response (tachyphylaxis) (11Liggett S.B. Crystal R. West J.B. Weibel E.R. Barnes P.J. The Lung: Scientific Foundations. Raven Press, New York1997: 19-36Google Scholar). Furthermore, the asthmatic inflammatory milieu itself appears to promote a desensitized β2AR (12Bai T.R. Lung. 1995; 170: 125-141Google Scholar). These issues have promoted the concept that maintenance or augmentation of nonagonist (basal), and agonist-promoted, β2AR function in the airway could favorably alter myocyte signaling and airway physiology to effectively block hyperresponsiveness. Due to the dynamic nature of β2AR regulation, such attempts by pharmacologic or genetic means may lead to feedback regulation of the receptor, Gs, or other downstream components of the transduction pathway, thus minimizing the impact at the cellular and physiologic level. Such overexpression has also been shown to cause “promiscuous” coupling of receptors to G proteins that are not natively activated in cells with physiologic levels of receptor (13Kenakin T. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Extensive functional coupling of airway smooth muscle β2AR to Gi could serve to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and possibly promote mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (14Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), adversely affecting cell growth and possibly airway contractility itself (3Paul R.J. de Lanerolle P. Liggett S. Meyers D. Genetics of Asthma. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 91-117Google Scholar). Promiscuous Gq coupling would mimic M3 muscarinic receptor activity and act to bronchoconstrict. Finally, data from some studies suggest that there are significant “spare β2AR” expressed on airway smooth muscle (15Avner B.P. Wilson S. Proc. West. Pharmacol. Soc. 1979; 22: 177-181PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lemoine H. Overlack C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 261: 258-270PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lemoine H. Kaumann A.J. Nauny-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1982; 320: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), such that increasing the number or function of these receptors would have no discernible effect on signaling or physiologic function. Similarly, it may be that other components of the pathway leading to relaxation are limiting factors, such that augmentation of βAR-promoted relaxation by increased receptor expression may not be possible. The current study was undertaken to further understand the relationship between airway smooth muscle β2AR expression and signaling, smooth muscle function, and airway responses within the context of bronchial hyperreactivity and to specifically address the multiple issues regarding augmentation of β2AR function as stated above. We thus created transgenic mice overexpressing the β2AR on smooth muscle using a smooth muscle α-actin promoter. This was carried out in FVB/N mice, a strain that displays a moderate degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the absence of antigenic challenge. Such overexpression had profound effects on cellular signaling, smooth muscle function, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Smooth muscle-specific expression of the human β2AR in transgenic mice was achieved by using the mouse smooth muscle α-actin promoter (18Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S. Sun S. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. A. Strauch). The construct was prepared by cloning the 1.5-kbHindIII/PshAI fragment encoding the human β2AR (1.2 kb of ORF and 0.3 kb of 3′-untranslated region) upstream of the SV40 polyadenylation sequence in the plasmid pNNO3. The 3.6-kb smooth muscle α-actin promoter fragment, termed SMP8 (18Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S. Sun S. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was then subcloned into a BamHI site 5′ to the β2AR ORF. Orientation of each fragment was confirmed by sequence analysis and restriction enzyme digestion. The transgenic construct (∼5.9 kb) was excised from the plasmid by NotI digestion and microinjected into male pronuclei of fertilized zygotes from superovulated FVB/N mice. Surviving zygotes were implanted into pseudopregnant foster mothers who gave birth to founders. Transgene-positive founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA derived from tail clips. Founders expressing the transgene were mated with nontransgenic FVB/N mice. Subsequent screening for the hemizygous transgene-positive progeny was by polymerase chain reaction analysis of the genomic DNA using a forward primer in the β2AR ORF (5′-GGAGCAGAGTGGATATCACG-3′) and a reverse primer in the SV40 polyadenylation region (5′-GTCACACCACAGAAGTAAGG-3′). Hemizygous mice from generations 2–4 between the ages of 10 and 14 weeks were used for all studies. Ribonuclease protection assays were used to quantitate the amount of transgene mRNA in total RNA prepared from whole lung homogenates. A 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe corresponding to the distal 500 base pairs of the human β2AR ORF was prepared. This portion of the human transcript has only ∼75% homology with the mouse β2AR mRNA. A radiolabeled antisense riboprobe for β-actin was also utilized to account for any potential differences in gel loading. Ribonuclease protection assays were carried out as previously reported (19McGraw D.W. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by hybridizing 20 μg of total cellular RNA with both the β2AR and actin riboprobes. To localize transgene expression within the lung, in situ hybridization was performed on lung sections as described previously (20Wang J. Niu W. Nikiforov Y. Naito S. Chernausek S. Witte D. LeRoith D. Strauch A. Fagin J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1425-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, lungs were rapidly dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS, and frozen in OCT. Cryostat sections (7 μm) were then mounted on saline-coated slides. An antisense cRNA probe for the human β2AR was prepared as described above for the ribonuclease protection assay studies except that the probe was labeled with [35S]UTP using a commercially available kit (Stratagene). A sense cRNA probe was generated from the same plasmid template using SP6 polymerase for use as a negative control. Hybridization was performed with 0.5–1.0 × 106 cpm of labeled probe in a final volume of 30 μl/slide. Following overnight incubation at 42 °C, the sections were treated with 50 μg/ml RNase A and 100 units/ml RNase T1 for 30 min at 37 °C and washed to a final stringency of 0.1× standard citrate saline at 50 °C. Slides were dipped in NTB2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) diluted 1:1 with 0.6 m ammonium acetate, and exposed for 2 weeks, after which they were developed with D19 developer (Kodak) and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tracheal smooth muscle cells were cultured from explants of excised tracheas using a modification of previously described methods (21Green S.A. Turki J. Bejarano P. Hall I.P. Liggett S.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The entire trachea between the larynx and main stem bronchi was removed and placed in a sterile Petri dish containing room temperature Hanks' balanced saline solution supplemented with a 2× concentration of antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). After additional surrounding tissue was removed with the aid of a dissecting microscope, the tracheal segment was split longitudinally and dissected into 2–3-mm squares. All of the segments from a single trachea were then placed intima side down in a sterile 60-mm dish. After allowing the explants to adhere, 2.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% FCS and 2× antibiotic-antimycotic was added to cover the explants. The explants were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified environment of 95% air, 5% CO2. After the first 3 days of cell growth, the concentration of FCS was reduced to 10%, and the antibiotic-antimycotic was reduced to 1×. Explanted trachea was removed when the outgrowing cells became locally confluent. Once the 60-mm dish became confluent, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and passed into a single 75-cm2 flask. Tracheal smooth muscle cells were subsequently passaged at a 1:4 ratio. Greater than 90% of these cells from each donor mouse were smooth muscle cells, as determined by immunohistochemistry performed with an antibody raised against smooth muscle α-actin (see below). All experiments were performed on confluent cells at matched passage numbers 3–6. To prepare membranes from lung tissue, lungs from an individual mouse were homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkman) in 10 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA) containing the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, benzamidine, and soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml each). Detached smooth muscle cells from primary cultures were processed similarly. Homogenates were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed and centrifuged two additional times, after which the pellets were suspended in assay buffer (75 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA). For determination of receptor expression, radioligand binding was carried out with 125I-CYP as described (22D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The fraction of receptors in the high affinity binding state was determined by competition experiments performed in the absence of GTP using 40 pm125I-CYP and 16 concentrations of isoproterenol ranging from 10−4 to 10−10m as described previously (23Green S. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competition data were fit to a two-site model when this fit was statistically (p< 0.05) better than a one-site fit by F-test, using Prizm software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Receptor density on the cell surface was assessed using methods previously described (24Liggett S.B. Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. O'Dowd B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 641-646PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in monolayers were detached with 0.25% trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C. After trypsin activity was neutralized by the addition of fetal calf serum, the cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The resuspended cells were incubated in a volume of 500 μl with 400 pm125I-CYP at 37 °C for 60 min in the absence or presence of the hydrophobic antagonist propranolol (1 μm) or the hydrophilic antagonist CGP 12177 (10 μm). Binding to receptors localized throughout the cell was defined as that displaced by propranolol, while cell surface binding was defined as that displaced by CGP12177 (24Liggett S.B. Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. O'Dowd B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 641-646PubMed Google Scholar). Bound radioactivity was separated by filtration and washing over GF/C glass fiber filters. Cyclic AMP content of attached mouse smooth muscle cells in culture exposed to 10 μmisoproterenol or carrier for 10 min was measured by an acetylated radioimmunoassay method as described (19McGraw D.W. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in membranes prepared as above using column chromatography as described previously (25McGraw D.W. Donnelly E.T. Eason M.G. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Studies of mouse tracheal contractility have been reported in detail elsewhere (26Kao J. Fortner C.N. Liu L. Shull G. Paul R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L264-L270PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tracheas were excised and dissected free of surrounding tissues and cut into rings of approximately 5 mm in length. The trachea rings were mounted on stainless steel wires connected to isometric force transducers. The rings were then immersed in a physiologic saline solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.73 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.026 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 25 mm NaH2CO3, and 11 mm glucose) maintained at 37 °C and bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to maintain a pH of 7.4. Each tracheal ring was stretched to a tension of 5 millinewtons, an optimal passive tension for maximizing active force (27Sutliff R.L. Paul R.J. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Cardiovascular Physiology in the Genetically Engineered Mouse. Kluwer Academic, Norwell1998: 247-257Google Scholar). After a 20-min equilibration period, contraction/relaxation cycles with 10 μm acetylcholine were performed until consistent forces were observed. Cumulative concentration-isometric force curves were then generated to acetylcholine (1 nm to 30 μm). After rinsing, tracheas were contracted with 10 μm acetylcholine (approximately the ED80), and cumulative concentration-relaxation curves were generated to isoproterenol (30 pm to 10 μm). Concentration-response relations were fitted to a logistic equation (26Kao J. Fortner C.N. Liu L. Shull G. Paul R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L264-L270PubMed Google Scholar). Airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured noninvasively in conscious, unrestrained mice using a whole body plethysmograph (Buxco Electronics, Troy, NY) (28Hamelmann E. Schwarze J. Takeda K. Oshiba A. Larsen G.L. Irvin C.G. Gelfand E.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Using this system, the volume changes that occur during a normal respiratory cycle are recorded as the pressure difference between the animal-containing chamber and a reference chamber. The resulting signal is used to calculate respiratory frequency, minute volume, tidal volume, and enhanced pause (Penh). Penh is a unitless value that is a function of the peak inspiratory (PIP) and peak expiratory (PEP) pressures and the timing of expiration and is calculated as follows,Penh=Pause×PEPPIP(Eq. 1) where Pause is the ratio of time spent in the last third of expiration relative to early expiration. Penh has been shown to closely correlate with invasive measurements of airway resistance (28Hamelmann E. Schwarze J. Takeda K. Oshiba A. Larsen G.L. Irvin C.G. Gelfand E.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar) and was used as the measure of airway responsiveness in this study. Mice were placed in the chamber and allowed to adjust to their surroundings for 10 min. They were then exposed to aerosolized PBS (to establish baseline), followed by increasing concentrations of methacholine (2.5–80 mg/ml). Aerosolization was for 3 min, and respiratory measurements were recorded and averaged for the subsequent 5 min after each dose. The degree of bronchoconstriction was expressed as the percentage change in Penh relative to the PBS base line. On a separate day, the mice were submitted to the same protocol except that they were first treated with aerosolized albuterol (1.0 mg/ml) for 20 min. The concentration-response data for each individual mouse were fit to a sigmoid curve by an iterative least squares technique, and the dose of methacholine required to double baseline Penh (ED200) was derived. From a total of 40 mice screened, three SMP8-β2AR founder mice were identified. Subsequent matings with nontransgenic mice showed that one of the three founders was mosaic. In lines established from the other two founder mice (denoted as lines 79 and 95), the transgene was inherited in ∼50% of the offspring with equal distribution between male and female mice. Hemizygous mice from these two lines were further characterized with respect to transgene copy number, mRNA expression, receptor density, and histologic analysis. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA prepared from tail clips showed that the transgene copy number was about 1 copy for line 95 and about two copies for line 79 (data not shown). To confirm that the SMP8-β2AR transgene was being expressed in the lungs of the transgenic positive mice, total cellular RNA prepared from whole lung homogenates of transgenic and nontransgenic animals was subjected to ribonuclease protection assays. For these experiments, we used an antisense RNA probe corresponding to the distal 500 base pairs of the human β2AR ORF. Because this region has <75% homology with the mouse sequence, only the human sequence results in a full-length protected fragment. As shown in Fig.1, SMP8-β2AR mRNA was present in lungs from mice that screened positive for the transgene, but was absent in nontransgenic littermates. Quantitation of band density showed that there was no significant difference in transgene expression between lines 79 and 95. In situ hybridization was performed to verify that expression of the transgene was directed to airway smooth muscle. Previous studies have shown that β2AR mRNA is heavily expressed in airway smooth muscle (5Carstairs J.R. Nimmo A.J. Barnes P.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar, 7Henry P.J. Rigby P.J. Goldie R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore used the same species-specific cRNA probe described above for the ribonuclease protection assay analysis so that we could limit detection to that of the transgene only. As shown in Fig. 2, specific hybridization (appearing as white dots) was observed in the SMP8-β2AR mice (A andB) but was absent in nontransgenic mice (C andD). These studies clearly show that expression of the SMP8-β2AR transcript was confined to airway smooth muscle, and to a lesser extent in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, with no signal observed in the bronchial epithelium or alveolar lining cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Additional studies within situ hybridization or radioligand binding showed increased expression in smooth muscle of stomach, colon, and uterus (data not shown). β2AR expression was further quantitated by radioligand binding assays with 125I-CYP. Initial studies with membrane preparations from whole lung homogenates showed no differences in receptor density between transgenic and nontransgenic mice. However, previous studies have shown that >90% of β2ARs in the lung are localized to cells (type I and type II pneumocytes and capillary endothelium) that line the alveoli (5Carstairs J.R. Nimmo A.J. Barnes P.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar, 7Henry P.J. Rigby P.J. Goldie R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, based on the densities of βAR as assessed by autoradiography (5Carstairs J.R. Nimmo A.J. Barnes P.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar, 7Henry P.J. Rigby P.J. Goldie R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the extensive surface area of alveoli (29Weibel E.R. Taylor C.R. Fishman A.P. Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders. McGraw-Hill, New York1988: 20-21Google Scholar), the ratio of total airway smooth muscle versus alveolar βAR is ∼1:1000 or more. Thus, we felt it was unlikely that using a whole lung preparation would detect enhanced smooth muscle expression in the transgenic mice. Since the in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated transgene expression in airway smooth muscle, we measured 125I-CYP binding in smooth muscle cells cultured from tracheal explants. As indicated in Fig. 3, immunohistochemistry studies showed that >90% of these cells had the morphologic characteristics of smooth muscle cells and stained positive for smooth muscle α-actin. Saturation radioligand binding studies showed that the β2AR was significantly overexpressed in tracheal smooth muscle cells from transgenic mice when compared with the level of expression in smooth muscle cells derived from nontransgenic mice (Fig. 4). βAR density in airway smooth muscle cells from transgenic lines 79 and 95 were both ∼75 times greater than that of cells from nontransgenic mice (2510 ± 229 and 2218 ± 167 versus 33 ± 6 fmol/mg protein, respectively, n = 4, p < 0.001). Given that the levels of transgene mRNA and receptor protein were equivalent in the two transgenic lines, the majority of the remaining pharmacological and physiological studies were carried out with mice of line 95.Figure 4β2AR expression in primary cultures of tracheal smooth muscle cells. Primary cultures of tracheal smooth muscle cells were derived from tracheal explants as described under “Experimental Procedures.” βAR density was determined in membranes prepared from NTG and SMP8-β2AR transgenic smooth muscle cells by radioligand binding with125I-CYP. 10 μm propranolol was used to define nonspecific binding.

On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the protein showed a molecular mass of 36 kDa in the reduced state and 66 kDa in the unreduced state. On gel permeation chromatography the apparent molecular mass was 250 kDa. N-terminal sequencing showed homology to the human matrix protein microfibril-associated protein (hMFAP4), and the glycoprotein was designated bovine MFAP4 (bMFAP4). Lung surfactant protein D (SP-D) was also purified from lung washings, and calcium-dependent binding was demonstrated between bMFAP4 and SP-D. hMFAP4 was cloned, and recombinant hMFAP4 showed the same binding pattern to SP-D as bMFAP4. No binding was seen to recombinant SP-D composed of the neck region and carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D, indicating that the interaction between MFAP4 and SP-D is mediated via the collagen region of SP-D. MFAP4 also showed calcium-dependent binding to mannan, which was partially inhibited by maltose. Our findings indicate that MFAP4 has two binding specificities, one for collagen and one for carbohydrate, and we suggest that MFAP4 may fix the collectins in the extracellular compartment during inflammation."

After carrying its cargo into the nucleus, the importin dimer dissociates, and Srp1p (the yeast importin α subunit) is recycled to the cytoplasm in a complex with Cse1p and RanGTP. Nup2p is a yeast FXFG nucleoporin that contains a Ran-binding domain. We find that export of Srp1p from the nucleus is impaired inΔnup2 mutants. Also, Srp1p fusion proteins accumulate at the nuclear rim in wild-type cells but accumulate in the nuclear interior in Δnup2 cells. A deletion of NUP2shows genetic interactions with mutants in SRP1 andPRP20, which encodes the Ran nucleotide exchange factor. Srp1p binds directly to an N-terminal domain of Nup2p. This region of Nup2p is sufficient to allow accumulation of an Srp1p fusion protein at the nuclear rim, but the C-terminal Ran-binding domain of Nup2p is required for efficient Srp1p export. Formation of the Srp1p·Cse1p·RanGTP export complex releases Srp1p from its binding site in Nup2p. We propose that Nup2p may act as a scaffold that facilitates formation of the Srp1p export complex.

Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). The NLS is recognized by importin α/Srp1p, which forms a heterodimeric complex with importin β/Kap95p. By virtue of its interaction with importin β, importin α and its associated NLS-containing protein are carried through the NPC into the nucleus (5Gorlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E.

However, in most cases, the functional significance of these interactions is unclear. We previously showed that Srp1p binds to the yeast nucleoporins Nup1p and Nup2p (26Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nup2p is an FXFG nucleoporin that contains a Ran-binding domain (RanBD) homologous to that of RanBP1 (14Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A.

In this report, we further investigate the interaction of Srp1p with Nup2p and its functional significance. Our results indicate that Nup2p is involved in the nuclear export of Srp1p and that Nup2p may act as a scaffold to facilitate formation of the Srp1p export complex at the NPC. Enzymes for molecular biology were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 5-Fluoroorotic acid was obtained through the Genetics Society of America consortium. pRS vectors (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were furnished by Dr. Phil Hieter. Rabbit-anti-β-galactosidase antibodies were obtained from Organon Technica (West Chester, PA), and anti-Xpress mAb was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Unless otherwise specified, all yeast strains are isogenic with W303 (ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 can1-100(Mat a and Mat α); a gift of Susan Wente). Yeast cell culture, medium preparation, and genetic manipulations were performed essentially as described (30Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast shuttle plasmids and linear fragments were introduced into yeast by lithium acetate transformation (31Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA cloning was performed using standard techniques outlined by Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). NUP2 was disrupted in W303 by transformation with aKAN R cassette (33Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P.

From 28 tetrads dissected, 13 Trp+ spores were obtained that were 5-fluoroorotic acid-sensitive at 37 °C (Δnup2 srp1-31). All of these were also 5-fluoroorotic acid-sensitive at 25 °C. LDY626 (Δnup2::TRP1) was crossed to LDY551 (prp20/mtr1-1, second backcross ofmtr1-1 from T127 (36Kadowaki T. Chen S. Hitomi M. Jacobs E. Kumagai C. Liang S. Schneiter R. Singleton D. Wisniewska J.

A promoterless SRP1gene was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides introducing aBamHI site at the start codon and an SpeI site before the stop codon and was inserted into pLDB349 atXhoI-SpeI to generate an in-frame fusion ofSRP1 with GFP (pLDB520). pLDB520 was linearized with PstI, which cuts in SRP1, and transformed into W303 or LDY680 (Δnup2::KAN R) to integrate at SRP1, generating JBY1 and JBY14, respectively. A fusion of the SRP1 coding region to the Escherichia coli LacZ gene was created as follows. A fragment containing the SRP1 promoter and initiator methionine was amplified by PCR and cloned into YIp368R (41Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene. 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) to produce an in-frame fusion with LacZ. Next, the region ofSRP1 encoding residues 463–542 was amplified and inserted into this plasmid. The resulting plasmid was linearized at a site between the SRP1 promoter and the C-terminal region, and transformed into W303. In vivo gap repair followed by integration of the vector resulted in the formation of full-lengthSRP1-LacZ fusions (transformants screened by Western blotting). The plasmid was rescued from this strain by cutting genomic DNA with PstI, followed by ligation and transformation intoE. coli. The rescued plasmid (pLDB360) was cut withPstI and transformed into W303 or LDY627 (Δnup2::TRP1) to integrate at SRP1, generating LDY970 and LDY969, respectively. A Myc epitope was inserted after amino acid 428 of Nup2p by PCR mutagenesis of pJON76 (NUP2 URA3 CEN, pRS315 carrying a 6.1-kilobase BamHI fragment containingNUP2; gift of Jonathan Loeb) to generate pLDB60. Residues 547 to 720 of NUP2 myc were removed from pLDB60 by deletion PCR (42Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 65Google Scholar) followed by gap repair to generate pLDB427. Plasmids pLDB652 (NUP2(1-174) TRP1, ApaI-EcoRI fragment from pLDB60 in pRS304 atApaI-EcoRI), pLDB683 (NUP2 myc TRP1, EcoRI fragment from pLDB60 in pRS304 at EcoRI), and pLDB690 (NUP2 myc (1–546) TRP1, BamHI fragment from pLDB427 in pRS304 at BamHI) were linearized with BglII and transformed into JBY14 (Δnup2::KAN R SRP1-GFP) to integrate at NUP2, generating JBY11, JBY12, and JBY16, respectively. pLDB291, encoding His6-Srp1p (28–542), was created by subcloning aBamHI/BglII fragment from pSWB17 (26Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) into pTrcHisC (InVitrogen) at BamHI. pLDB424, encoding His6-Srp1p (74–542), was constructed by cloning aSacI-KpnI fragment from pLDB291 into pTrcHisB (Invitrogen) at SacI-KpnI. pLDB426, encoding His6-Srp1p (full-length), was created by PCR amplification of the 5′ end of SRP1, digestion of the PCR product withBamHI and SacI, and subcloning into pLDB291 similarly cut, and then cutting this plasmid with BamHI, filling in, and religating to put SRP1 in frame. pLDB627, encoding His6-Cse1p, was constructed by amplifyingCSE1 from template plasmid p314P3.5 (39Xiao Z. McGrew J.T. Schroeder A.J. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4691-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) withBamHI and XhoI ends and cloning into pTrcHisC atBamHI-XhoI. His6-tagged proteins were expressed in bacterial strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) and purified on Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). Plasmids encoding GST fusions to Nup1p (5–385), Nup1p (432–816), Nup1p (142–385), and Nup1p (778–1076) were described previously (26Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pLDB321, encoding GST-Nup1p(1002–1041), was created by cloning anNsiI-ApaI fragment of NUP1 into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at EcoRI. pLDB318, encoding GST-Nup1p(778–999), was constructed by removing aEcoRI-NsiI fragment of NUP1 from pSWB6 (26Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). pLDB356, encoding GST-Nup1p (1041–1076) was produced by first deleting sequence encoding residues 1004–1040 of Nup1p from pLDB107 (44Bogerd A.M. Hoffman J.A. Amberg D.C. Fink G.R. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) by deletion PCR followed by gap repair. The resulting plasmid was rescued from yeast and digested with NsiI andEcoRI, and the fragment encoding Nup1p residues 1041–1076 was filled in and blunt-end ligated into the pGEX-2TK atEcoRI. pLDB361 (GST-Nup2p), pLDB554 (GST-Nup2p (182–546)), and pLDB405 (GST-Gsp1p) were created by PCR amplification of appropriate sequences with introduction of restriction site ends followed by cloning into pGEX-2TK at BamHI-EcoRI, pGEX-4T1 at BamHI-XhoI, and pGEX-2TK atBamHI, respectively. Expression of GST fusion proteins inE. coli and preparation of cell lysates were performed as described (45Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). pLDB357 encoding maltose-binding protein fused to Kap95p was a gift from Megan Neville. Expression and purification of maltose-binding protein-Kap95p was performed as recommended by New England Biolabs. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Srp1p antibodies were raised by injection with affinity-purified His6-Srp1p (28–542). The antibodies were affinity-purified from serum using His6-Srp1p (28–542) bound to nitrocellulose (46Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 547-551Google Scholar). Cells were treated for immunofluorescence essentially as described by Wente et al.(37Wente S.R. Rout M.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 705-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) except that they were fixed for 12 min in buffer containing 10% formaldehyde and 10% methanol. Primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200 and secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:100. For visualizing Srp1p-GFP or Yap1p-GFP, cells were grown overnight in selective medium and then diluted to OD600 = 0.1 and grown for 6 h in YPD to log phase. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in ice cold 75% ethanol, incubated on ice for 10 min, and then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing DAPI (0.2 mg/ml) for viewing using a Nikon Optiphot microscope. Binding experiments were performed in 0.5-ml siliconized tubes (Sigma) containing 100–200 μl of binding buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm KOAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.1% Tween, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (44Bogerd A.M.

GST-Gsp1p adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads was loaded with GTP by incubating for 30 min at 30°C in 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm GTP, followed by addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. Cleavage of GST-Gsp1p and GST-Nup2p(9–172) with thrombin (Sigma) was performed after precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose as described (47Smith D.B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991: 16.4.9Google Scholar), followed by addition of a 1.5× molar excess of hirudin (Sigma). For analysis of Nup2p protein expression, yeast cell extracts were prepared by vortexing with glass beads in trichloroacetic acid (48Ohashi A. Gibson J. Gregor I. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13042-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed essentially as described (26Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with either mAb 9E10 or mAb 414 ascites fluids, both at a dilution of 1:1000. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were used to precipitate GST-Nup fusion proteins from bacterial lysates. The beads were washed, and bound protein was eluted in SDS sample buffer containing 6m urea and subjected to SDS-PAGE without boiling. Two hundred nanograms of purified GST fusion was loaded in each lane, as determined by Coomassie Blue staining. Blot overlays were performed as described by Lee and Melese (49Lee W.-C. Melese T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8808-8812Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using affinity-purified His6-Srp1p (74–542) as a ligand at a concentration of 125 ng/ml. Overlays were probed with anti-Xpress antibody diluted 1:5000, and bound antibody was detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HSA was coupled to oligopeptides consisting of the SV40 large T antigen NLS Pro-Lys-Lys128-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val or mutant peptides containing a substitution of Thr for Lys128. Bacterial lysates containing GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and washed one time with wash buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20) before further additions. Incubations with His6-Srp1p (28–542) or NLS-HSA were performed in wash buffer plus 1% nonfat dry milk; washes were with wash buffer. The observation that Srp1p binds to Nup2p (26Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 50Gorlich D. Kraft R. Kostka S. Vogel F. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Mattaj I.W. Izaurraide E. Cell. 1996; 87: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) suggested that Nup2p might play a role in Srp1p trafficking. To investigate this possibility, we examined the subcellular localization of Srp1p in yeast mutants carrying a disruption in NUP2 by immunofluorescence using anti-Srp1p antibodies (Fig. 1). In wild-type cells, Srp1p is distributed in a largely uniform manner throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, with some nuclear concentration in some cells (Fig. 1 a). In Δnup2 mutants, however, there is a pronounced nuclear accumulation of Srp1p, indicating a defect in its export from the nucleus (Fig. 1 , panel c). As additional tools for studying Srp1p localization, fusions of Srp1p to either the green fluorescent protein (Srp1p-GFP) or β-galactosidase (Srp1p-LacZ) were constructed. These fusion proteins were expressed in yeast and localized by direct fluorescence (for Srp1p-GFP) or by immunofluorescence with anti-β-galactosidase antibodies (for Srp1p-LacZ). In wild-type cells, localization of either Srp1p-GFP (Fig. 1 e) or Srp1p-LacZ (Fig. 1 i) revealed a punctate fluorescence at the nuclear rim typical of NPC localization. This stands in contrast to the lack of nuclear rim accumulation of endogenous Srp1p (Fig. 1 a). Whatever the reason for the accumulation of the fusion proteins, their localization in Δnup2 cells is markedly different, with both Srp1p-GFP (Fig. 1 g) and Srp1p-LacZ (Fig. 1 k) showing a uniform nuclear localization. Thus, as is seen with Srp1p, a lack of Nup2p causes nuclear accumulation of Srp1p fusion proteins. Furthermore, the lack of fusion protein accumulation at the nuclear rim in Δnup2 mutants suggests that a site critical for Srp1p binding at the NPC has been lost. Srp1p-GFP was able to complement ansrp1::KAN R disruption, showing that this fusion protein is functional; Srp1p-LacZ does not complement. Srp1p-GFP and Srp1p-LacZ were expressed at similar levels in wild-type and Δnup2 cells (data not shown). No nuclear accumulation of Srp1p is seen in Δnup1 mutants (Fig. 2 A),Δnup100 or Δnup116 mutants (data not shown), or numerous other nuclear transport mutants (11Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Bischoff F.R. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of NUP2 does not cause a general defect in nuclear export, as Crm1p-mediated nuclear export proceeds normally in the absence of Nup2p (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the effects of loss of Nup2p on Srp1p export are specific. We previously showed that Srp1p interacts with Nup1p and Nup2p in yeast extracts (26Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether the binding of Srp1p to Nup1p and Nup2p is direct, interactions between bacterially expressed fusion proteins were measured. To this end, regions of Nup1p and Nup2p were fused to GST, whereas amino acids 73–542 of Srp1p were expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag. Binding of His6-Srp1p (73–542) to the GST-Nup fusions was measured by gel overlay. His6-Srp1p (73–542) binds directly to regions in both Nup1p and Nup2p (Fig. 3). Anup1 mutant has previously been shown to have a defect in Srp1p-mediated protein import (44Bogerd A.M. Hoffman J.A. Amberg D.C. Fink G.R. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For Nup1p, the strongest Srp1p-binding region is found at the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 3, lanes 7, 9, and 10). Binding of Srp1p to the C terminus of Nup1p has also been reported by Floer et al.(52Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We note that two nonoverlapping stretches at the C terminus both bind to Srp1p (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10), indicating the presence of multiple Srp1p binding sites. With Nup2p, Srp1p binds directly to the region N-terminal of the FXFG repeats (lane 2). A fusion of GST to the full-length Nup2 protein is highly degraded (lane 1), and Srp1p binds to the degradation products, which presumably represent a series of truncations of GST-Nup2p all containing the N terminus of the protein. Srp1p does not bind to the FXFG repeat-containing regions of Nup1p or Nup2p (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 6). Such repeats have been implicated in binding to importin β family members (7Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 19Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D.

Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We also note that the experiment shown in Fig. 3 was performed with Srp1p protein lacking the N-terminal 72 amino acids of Srp1p, which contain the IBB domain required for binding to Kap95p (5Gorlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,6Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that binding of Srp1p to Nup1p and Nup2p does not require the IBB domain. An identical pattern of binding affinities for the GST-Nup fusions was seen using a His6-tagged full-length Srp1p, although binding to all the Nups was weaker, possibly due to the presence of Srp1p breakdown products in the protein preparation (data not shown). One possible reason for Srp1p binding to Nup1p and Nup2p is that it binds to NLS-like sequences in these nucleoporins. No NLS consensus sequences are found in the Srp1p-binding regions of Nup1p or Nup2p; however, to further address this possibility, we tested whether Srp1p could simultaneously bind to an NLS and to Nup1p or Nup2p by assaying for the ability of Srp1p to precipitate an NLS-HSA conjugate when bound to GST-Nup fusions (Fig. 4). His6-Srp1p (28–542) was incubated with GST-Nup fusions adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose and then washed to remove unbound Srp1p. The Srp1p·Nup complex was then incubated with HSA conjugated to either a wild-type or mutant NLS peptide. Wild-type NLS-HSA was precipitated by each of the GST-Nup fusions when His6-Srp1p was present (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 4) but was not detected in those samples to which His6-Srp1p was not added (lanes 2 and 5). A NLS-HSA conjugate containing a mutant NLS peptide was not precipitated (lanes 3 and6). These data indicate that Srp1p can simultaneously bind to an NLS and to Nup2p or Nup1p. Because Srp1p has been shown to contain two adjacent NLS-binding sites (53Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that these sites could mediate simultaneous binding to NLS-HSA and to an NLS in Nup1p or Nup2p; however, we consider this unlikely due to steric considerations. Thus, these results strongly suggest that binding of Srp1p to the nucleoporins is not via NLS-like sequences. In addition to the N-terminal Srp1p-binding domain and the central FXFG repeat domain, Nup2p contains a C-terminal RanBD (14Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A.

Since that time there has been an exponential growth in the discovery of new [Fe-S] proteins that has exploded recently due to gene sequencing.

Much of what we know about these protein-bound clusters comes from studies of a class of [Fe-S] proteins collectively known as ferredoxins. Ferredoxins are loosely defined as small, soluble, generally acidic [Fe-S] proteins that function to transfer electrons from one protein to another (2Lovenberg W. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. Vols.

Cluster Sci. 1990; 1: 29-73Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the past, it was believed that a single ferredoxin was a relatively nonspecific electron transfer agent that could participate in a number of different cellular processes (26Matsubara H. Saeka K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and it is still common to see the term “bacterial ferredoxin” or “plant ferredoxin” used in this generic sense. However, it is now clear that a single organism can contain numerous different types of ferredoxins, each of which is expected to have a specific function in the cell. Table I shows that the organism of interest in this study, Azotobacter vinelandii, appears to synthesize at least 12 different small, ferredoxin-like proteins. Only a few of these proteins have been purified and characterized to date (28Shethna Y.I. DerVartanian D.V. Beinert H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The general approach has been to construct, purify, and characterize numerous site-directed mutant variants of FdI. In the course of these studies we have observed that some, but not all variants of FdI, appear to copurify with a contaminating pink protein that is not seen during the purification of native FdI. Here we report the purification and characterization of that pink protein and its identification as the product of the fdx gene that is cotranscribed with genes encoding proteins that appear to be involved in the assembly of [Fe-S] clusters. We have chosen to designate the pink protein as FdIV because FdI (28Shethna Y.I. DerVartanian D.V. Beinert H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We suggest that the FdIV gene designation be changed from fdxto fdxD, in keeping with the FdI, fdxAnomenclature, reserving fdxC for the FdIII gene when it becomes available. The A. vinelandii strains used in this study include AvOP that synthesizes native FdI at wild-type levels, LM100 which has a kanamycin resistance cartridge inserted in the fdxA gene and does not synthesize any FdI (33Morgan T.V. Lundell D.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1370-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a number of strains that were designed to overexpress specific site-directed mutant variants of FdI using the previously described pKT230 system (51Vázquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The variants used here are C42D (52Gao-Sheridans H.S.

Engineering Fe-S Cluster Composition and Ligand Coordination in Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Irvine1998Google Scholar). It should be noted that as indicated in the text, all of these proteins accumulate at much lower levels than native FdI such that the levels produced by the overproduction strains are approximately equivalent to, or less than, the levels of native FdI produced by wild-type A. vinelandii. All A. vinelandii cells were grown under N2-fixing conditions in a 200-liter New Brunswick fermentor (48Shen B. Martin L.L. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J. La Mar G.N. Gorst C.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25928-25939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein purification was carried out at room temperature, and fractions were monitored by their absorbance at 405 nm. FdIV was purified from the strain overexpressing the C42D variant of FdI, because, as indicated below, that strain has the greatest accumulation of FdIV. The preparation was carried out anaerobically in the presence of 2 mmNa2S2O4 except the final Mono-Q/FPLC column step. Cell-free extracts were prepared from 1 kg of cells, and the first DEAE-cellulose column was run as described previously for the purification of other FdI variants (51Vázquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From the first DEAE-cellulose column (51Vázquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) the FdI fraction eluted at 70–80% of the linear 0.1–0.5 m NaCl gradient as a very shallow, yet well resolved brown peak. The protein fraction was immediately diluted with 2 or 3 volumes of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a 2.5 × 5-cm DEAE-cellulose column that was preequilibrated with the same buffer. Following loading, the column was washed slowly at the elution rate of 1.5 ml/min for 5 h with 0.12m KCl in the same buffer until a greenish-brown protein (FdIII) (43Gao-Sheridan H.S. Pershad H.R. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5514-5519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) eluted. The pink-colored fraction containing FdIV, which was visible on the column immediately following the greenish-brown protein, was then eluted with 0.3 m KCl. Ammonium sulfate was added slowly to 75% saturation with stirring. After a 30-min incubation the sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 20 min. The pellet was then collected and resuspended in 0.025m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, before loading onto a 1.5 × 110-cm Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column preequilibrated with 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1m NaCl. FdIV and FdI eluted as a single broad peak as observed by monitoring absorbance at 405 nm; however, FdIV actually moved slightly faster than FdI. For that reason the first third of the peak was collected and concentrated using a Centriplus-10 concentrator (Amicon) prior to further purification on a 1-ml Mono-Q/FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a linear gradient of 0.3–0.8 m NaCl in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, over 20 ml. Two fractions were well resolved as follows: the red-colored FdIV fraction that eluted between 0.46 and 0.48m NaCl, and a brown-colored FdI fraction that eluted between 0.54 and 0.58 m NaCl. The pink-colored FdIV fraction became red-colored when it was air-oxidized. Each fraction was collected, buffer-exchanged with 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, concentrated to 0.5 ml, and kept in the −20 °C freezer until use. The yield for FdIV is ∼0.5 mg per kg C42D cell. Overproduction of FdIV inE. coli was accomplished by constructing a fdxDgene cartridge in vitro and cloning this cartridge into the pT7-7 plasmid (53Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) such that fdxD gene expression was controlled by the T7 phage transcriptional and translational regulatory elements. The fdxD gene cartridge was constructed by using an isolated 1.0-kilobase pair DNA fragment that was generated by EcoRI restriction enzyme digestion of an isolated fragment of A. vinelandii strain DJ116 (ΔnifS) chromosomal DNA (32Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment was cloned into pUC119, and the plasmid was designated pDB946. pDB946 was subsequently used as a template for PCR amplification of thefdxD coding sequence. PCR amplification of fdxDwas performed essentially as recommended by the supplier of Amplitaq (Perkin-Elmer). Cycling temperatures were 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR primers used were 5′-CATGCATATGCCGCAGATCGTTTTTC-3′ and 5′-CTACGGATCCCTCAGTGCTGTTCC-3′. The amino acid coding region for FdIV is underlined in the first primer sequence shown above. FollowingfdxD amplification, the gene cartridge was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI and ligated toNdeI- and BamHI-digested pT7-7 DNA. Proper orientation of fdxD within the resulting hybrid plasmid (pDB1024) such that the T7 gene-10 promoter directsfdxD transcription was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of isolated plasmid DNA. For isolation of FdIV overproduced in E. coli, plasmid pDB1024 was transformed into the host strain BL21(DE3), and the transformed cells were maintained on LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown in 500-ml batches in LB media at 30 °C and were induced for FdIV production at approximately 160 Klett units (red filter) by the addition of lactose to 1% (w/v) final concentration. Following addition of lactose, cells were cultured for an additional 2 h, harvested by centrifugation, and frozen at −20 °C until use. The purification of recombinant FdIV was carried out aerobically. E. coli cells containing the overproduced FdIV were ruptured by sonication in 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Extracts were then ultracentrifuged in a Beckman Ty35 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell-free lysate was then loaded onto a 1.5 × 14-cm Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 0.025m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl. After loading, a gradient of 5 column volumes from 0.1 to 0.6 mNaCl was run. The red protein eluted at approximately 0.5 mNaCl, and the peak fractions were loaded onto a 5 × 44-cm Sephacryl S-300HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and run in 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl. Column eluents were monitored at A405 using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UV-1 optical detector and control unit. The NH2-terminal protein sequencing was carried out at the Biotechnology Resource Facility at the University of California, Irvine, and also at the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University. The protein samples used for protein sequencing at the University of California, Irvine, were obtained by excising the predominant protein band of an FdIV sample from a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-12% PAGE and eluting the protein into 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The protein sample was then modified using 2-mercaptoethanol and 4-vinylpyridine so that the modified cysteines could be detected. The sample used for sequencing at Yale University was prepared by excising the protein band from a Coomassie Blue-stained polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore) onto which an FdIV sample resolved in an SDS-12% PAGE was electroblotted.

CIITA has four promoters, which are transcribed in a tissue-specific manner. CIITA promoter III is constitutively active in mature B-lymphocytes. This report now describes the minimal 319-base pair promoter region necessary for maximal transcriptional activity in B-lymphocytes. Ultraviolet light and dimethylsulfate in vivo genomic footprinting analyses reveal five occupied DNA sequence elements present in intact B-lymphocytes. Functional analysis of these elements using promoter deletions and site-specific mutations demonstrates that at least two of the sites occupied in vivo are critical for transcriptional activity. In vitro protein/DNA analysis suggests that one of the sites is a TEF-2-like element and the other is occupied by a novel transcription activator. In addition, nuclear factor-1 associates with the promoter both in vivo and in vitro. In myeloma cell lines, loss of CIITA transcription correlates with a completely unoccupied CIITA promoter III. These findings suggest that CIITA transcription in B-lymphocytes is activated through at least two strong promoter elements, while loss of expression in myeloma cells is mediated through changes in promoter assembly.

Science. 1981; 212: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). These activated CD4+ T cells release stimulatory cytokines that augment the response of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (2Frasca L. Piazza C. Piccolella E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 569-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of MHC class II molecules is restricted to professional antigen-presenting cells, such as B lymphocytes and dendritic cells, and can be induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (3Glimcher L.H. Kara C.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 13-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 4Ting J.P.-Y. Baldwin A.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The MHC class II family of genes are coordinately regulated at the level of transcription through a conserved trimeric promoter motif (3Glimcher L.H. Kara C.J. Annu. Rev.

A major component of this transcription complex was cloned by genetic complementation of anin vitro mutagenized MHC class II negative B cell line, RJ2.2.5. This component was named the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) and restored MHC class II cell surface expression in one subgroup of bare lymphocyte syndrome patient cells (6Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). CIITA has since been shown to be a key regulatory molecule in the expression of all the known genes involved in the MHC class II antigen-presenting pathway (6Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B.

Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and with a few exceptions, such as in respiratory epithelial cells and dendritic cells (11Gao J. De B.P. Banerjee A.K.

Mice in which functional CIITA protein was ablated clearly demonstrated an absolute requirement for CIITA in B cell expression of MHC class II (13Chang C.H. Guerder S. Hong S.C. van Ewijk W. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the CIITA gene has four distinct promoters each transcribing a unique first exon, which are located within approximately 13 kilobases of DNA (10Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The promoters are utilized in a tissue-specific manner. CIITA expression in dendritic cells is primarily from promoter I. Promoter III is predominantly used in B-lymphocytes, while promoter IV is used predominantly in IFN-γ-induced expression. The first exon associated with the B cell and dendritic cell promoters encodes distinct amino-terminal residues of 24 and 101 amino acids, respectively, while mRNA from promoters II and IV initiates translation from within the common exon 2 (10Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Promoter II has yet to be characterized. The IFN-γ-responsive control elements at CIITA promoter IV were recently characterized (14Piskurich J.F. Linhoff M.W. Wang Y. Ting J.P.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Di Berardino W. Otten L.A. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both STAT-1 and IRF-1 are required at the proximal promoter for full response. Binding of the USF-1 transcription factor stabilizes STAT-1 binding (15Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Di Berardino W. Otten L.A. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Initial mapping of the CIITA promoter III revealed that sequences that lie between −545 and −113 base pairs relative to the transcription start site are required for constitutive expression in B-lymphocytes (16Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar). While this region of the promoter is not responsive to IFN-γ, IFN-γ activation of CIITA promoter III can be observed when an additional 4000 base pairs of upstream DNA are present (16Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the specific factors and promoter elements that control constitutive transcription from CIITA promoter III in B-lymphocytes. Tight regulation of the expression of MHC class II genes has been observed during B cell development. MHC class II gene transcription begins in the pre-B cell stage, is maintained until B-lymphocytes attain maturity (17Miki N. Hatano M. Wakita K. Imoto S. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S. Tokuhisa T. J.

Immunol. 1998; 16: 163-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of activation and repression are unknown. CIITA promoter III does not contain any cis-acting sequences with significant homology to B cell activators except a putative octamer binding site. In this report, we now characterize the CIITA promoter III regulatory elements in B-lymphocytes and identify in vivo and in vitro five occupied sites. Importantly, two of the sites are absolutely required for CIITA transcription in B-lymphocytes. One is a TEF-2-like element, while the other represents a binding site for a novel transcription activator. The CIITA promoter III reporter constructs CIITAp3.1140-Luc and CIITAp3.545-Luc contain the human CIITA promoter III sequences from −1140 to +123 or −545 to +123 base pairs, respectively, relative to the transcription initiation site. These two constructs were originally carried in the pGL2-Basic vector and described previously as p1300CIITA.Luc and p668CIITA.Luc (16Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar), but for this study they have been moved into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Each of the other deletion constructs (namely CIITAp3.319-Luc, CIITAp3.195-Luc, CIITAp3.151-Luc, and CIITAp3.113-Luc) were constructed similarly and contain CIITA promoter III sequences from +123 up to the indicated number on the construct name. All of the mutations except as specifically noted were carried in the CIITAp3.545-Luc construct. Mutant constructs were derived by the unique site elimination method (CLONTECH) (23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). In the construct CIITAp3.545mtSiteA, the sequence 5′-TTGGCGGGCTCCCA-3′ was changed to 5′-TTGtCtaGaTCCCA-3′ (mutations in lowercase boldface type). In CIITAp3.545mtSiteB, 5′-TTCTTTGCATGT-3′ was changed to 5′-TTCgTcGacaGT-3′. In the construct CIITAp3.545mtARE-2, 5′-TGATGATCCCT-3′ was changed to 5′-TGATctagaCT-3′. In the construct CIITAp3.545mtARE-1, 5′-TTAAGGGAGTGTGGTAA-3′ was changed to 5′-TTAAGtctagaTGGTAA-3′. In the construct CIITAp3.545mtSiteC, 5′-GGAAGTGAAATT-3′ was changed to 5′-GGAgtcGAcgTT-3′. Three additional constructs with mutations in the activation response element-1 (ARE-1) sequence were developed in the pGL2-Basic vector backbone. The first (pGL2.545mtARE1–2) is in the context of the −545 base pair promoter, while the second (pGL2.151mtARE1–3) and third (pGL2.151mtARE1–4) constructs are in the context of the −151 base pair promoter. The specific base changes are shown in Table I. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The BSAP expression vector was cloned by reverse transcription PCR into pCDNA3.1 (InVitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing.Table IThe ARE-1 sequence element and four mutationsGAGGGCTTAA GGGAGTGTGG TAAAAWild type activityMutant activityRatioMt1———–tctaga——–120 ± 21.416.2 ± 4.60.13Mt2——–cta-a————120 ± 7.936.5 ± 2.30.30Mt3—————ctc——-101 ± 5.688.9 ± 7.40.88Mt4——–tt—————60.9 ± 10.451.9 ± 6.20.85Transcriptional activity is the average luciferase activity per μg of protein lysate from three independent experiments.

Raji is a human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed Burkitt's lymphoma cell line that constitutively expresses MHC class II antigens (5Vilen B.J. Penta J.F. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23728-23734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NCI-H929 and U266 are human plasmacytoma cell lines and were grown in 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. NCI-H929 cells were also supplemented with 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were transfected by electroporation using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II apparatus. Cells (1 × 107) were pulsed with 200 V at a capacitance of 1070 microfarads, and cells were harvested after 42 h for luciferase assay. All cell lysates were normalized to recovered protein concentration with the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). In vivo methylation of cells with dimethylsulfate and DNA preparation were as described previously (24Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In vivo UV irradiation footprinting was done essentially as described by Pfeifer and Tornaletti (25Pfeifer G.P. Tornaletti S. Methods. 1997; 11: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (1 ml) were spread on a 100-mm plastic dish and exposed to 500–2000 J/m2 UV light (UV Crosslinker; Fisher). After exposure (30–120 s), the cells were immediately harvested by the addition of an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (200 mmEDTA, 120 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 0.2% SDS, 1 mg/ml proteinase K). The DNA was isolated and digested withHindIII as described for the dimethylsulfate-treated samples. The DNA (20 μg) was cleaved at cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers as described previously using 20 units T4 endonuclease V (Epicenter Technologies) and 5 μg of Escherichia coli photolyase generously provided by A. Sancar (University of North Carolina). Control in vitro UV-irradiated DNA samples were obtained by first isolating and purifying the genomic DNA from untreated cells, dissolving 20 μg of DNA in 100 μl of buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA) and spotting the DNA as 5-μl aliquots on parafilm. UV treatment and processing was as described for the in vivo treated samples. The ligation-mediated, polymerase chain reaction-amplified in vivo genomic footprinting was as originally described (26Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) and modified by Wright and Ting (27Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7601-7605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The upper strand was revealed by using two different primer sets, C2E and C2F. The sequence of the primers for C2E are primer 1 (5′-TCAGCTTCCCCAAGGATG-3′), primer 2 (5′-AGGATGCCTTCGGATGCCCAGCTC-3′), and primer 3 (5′-TGCCTTCGGATGCCCAGCTCAGAAGCAC-3′). The sequence of the primers for C2F are primer 1 (5′-AAACTCTCCCTGCAAGGT-3′), primer 2 (5′-TCTCCCTGCAAGGTGGCCCCAAGC-3′), and primer 3 (5′-CCTGCAAGGTGGCCCCAAGCGGTCAGATTTC-3′). The lower stand was revealed by two primer sets, C2C and C2G. The sequence of the primers for C2C are primer 1 (5′-AAGAAGTCCCCAGCAGAG-3′), primer 2 (5′-TCTGGGCGGAGGGCTATGATACTGGC-3′), and primer 3 (5′-CGGAGGGCTATGATACTGGCCCCATCCTGC-3′). The sequence of the primers for C2G are primer 1 (5′-CACCAAATTCAGTCCACAG-3′), primer 2 (5′-AGAGGTGTAGGGAGGGCTTAAGGGAG-3′), and primer 3 (5′-AGAGGTGTAGGGAGGGCTTAAGGGAGTGTG-3′). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignamet al. (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Gel shift analysis was performed as described previously (29Wright K.L. Dell'Orco R.T. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2812-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides and 500 ng of the nonspecific competitor poly(dI:dC). The ARE-1 oligonucleotide spans from −151 to −121 base pairs of the promoter and is 5′-GAGGGCTTAAGGGAGTGTGGTAAAATTAGAGG-3′. The mutant ARE-1 oligonucleotide contains the same mutation as in construct CIITAp3.545mtARE-1. The ARE-2 oligonucleotide spans from −66 to −51 of the promoter and is 5′-GATCCTTGATGATCCCTCACTAGATC-3′. The mutant ARE-2 oligonucleotide contains the same mutation as in construct CIITAp3.545mtARE-2. The site A oligonucleotide spans from −34 to +1 base pairs of the promoter and is 5′-GGCTTAGCTTGGCGGGCTCCCAACTGGTGACTGG-3′. The site B oligonucleotide spans from −55 to −24 of the promoter and is 5′-TCACTTGTTTCTTTGCATGTTGGCTTAGCTTG-3′. The mutSiteA and mutSiteB oligonucleotides contain the same mutation as in constructs CIITAp3.545mtSiteA and CIITAp3.545mtSiteB, respectively. The site C oligonucleotide spanned from −190 to −157 base pairs of the promoter relative to the transcription initiation site and is 5′-GTCCACAGTAAGGAAGTGAAATTAATTTCAGAG-3′. The consensus NF-1 oligonucleotide is 5′-TTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA-3′ (30Leegwater P.A. van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C.

Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); the consensus BSAP oligonucleotide (BSAP.CD19) is 5′-CCGCAGACACCCATGGTTGAGTGCCCTCCAGGCCC-3′ (32Kozmik Z.

The consensus TEF-2 oligonucleotide is 5′-GATCCTTAGGGTGTGGACCA-3′ (33Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors were used in a 50–100-fold molar excess. Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from 1–5 × 107 cells using the RNeasy System (Qiagen). RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed using the cDNA Cycle kit (InVitrogen) and resuspended in 20 μl of H2O. The number of PCR cycles that produced a linear phase of amplification for each product was empirically determined. Semiquantitative PCR was performed in the linear phase of amplification using 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μl of the cDNA for each primer pair. Each reaction was done in the presence of 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 1 μmeach primer, 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies), and 2 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP in a total volume of 20 μl. The CIITA promoter III has been shown to be constitutively active in B-lymphocytes (10Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To define the functional regions of the promoter, a series of progressive 5′ deletions of CIITA promoter III fused to the luciferase reporter gene were constructed and transiently transfected into the B cell line Raji. Constructs containing 1140, 545, or 319 base pairs of the promoter including the first 123 base pairs of 5′-untranslated sequences exhibit similar high levels of luciferase activity (Fig.1). Additional upstream sequences spanning 7000 base pairs of promoter III do not further enhance transcriptional activity (16Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the first 319 base pairs of CIITA promoter III are sufficient for transcriptional activation in B-lymphocytes. Deletion of the region from base pair −319 to −195 leads to a 40% decrease in transcriptional activity, which suggests the presence of a positive acting element(s) in this 124-base pair region. Deletion of base pairs −195 to −151 does not alter activity. However, deletion of the region between base pairs −151 and −113 greatly diminishes activity, to only 20% of that observed with the full-length promoter. This suggests the presence of a second positive element in this 38-base pair region. Similar results were obtained by transient transfections into the Namalwa B cell line (data not shown). In vivo genomic footprint analysis of promoters has been invaluable in the visualization of protein/DNA interactions within the physiologically relevant setting of the intact cell. This technique was exploited to directly identify occupied DNA elements present in the CIITA promoter. In Raji B cells both strands of the promoter were analyzed from +69 to −319 base pairs using dimethylsulfate (DMS) as the modifying agent (Fig. 2 A, summarized in Fig.3). Close association of transcription factors in vivo with DNA can inhibit or enhance DMS methylation of guanine residues. The resulting pattern of methylation is resolved and compared with the pattern observed when the proteins are removed prior to DMS treatment. Analysis of the upper strand reveals seven very strong protections clustered between base pairs −142 and −133 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 4 compared with lanes 1 and3). These contacts map within the strong activation domain functionally defined in Fig. 1 between base pairs −151 and −113. For ease of discussion, this element will be defined as ARE-1. ARE-1 does not contain guanine residues on the lower strand; thus, DMS cannot reveal interactions on the lower strand (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). A second region ofin vivo protein/DNA interaction is observed between base pairs −64 and −56, and is designated activation response element-2 (ARE-2). A single strong enhancement and a partial protection are detected on the upper strand (lanes 1 and2), while the lower strand displays three very strong protections (lanes 7 and 8). In addition to these two obvious domains of in vivo binding, three weaker sites of interaction were detectable. A cluster of five contacts designated site A is found between −18 and −27, corresponding to a sequence with homology to the NF-1 transcription factor binding site. Two partial protections are observed on the upper strand (lanes 1 and 2), while the lower strand displays two weak enhancements and a partial protection (lanes 7 and 8). A second cluster of contacts, site B, is located at a putative octamer-binding site homology (base pairs −45 to −38) and is visualized as a single protected residue on the upper strand flanked by a partial protection and weak enhancement on the lower stand. Finally, a single protection is observed at position −181 on the upper strand (lanes 3 and 4) and is designated site C. Protections were not detected on either strand upstream of base pair −195, and only two isolated weak enhancements were observed at base pairs −226 and −291.Figure 3Schematic of the sequence of CIITA promoter III and in vivo protein/DNA interactions in B-lymphocytes.

A, semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR demonstrates that NCI-H929 does not express CIITA or MHC class II mRNA, while U266 expresses low levels of both. B cell lines, Raji and IM9, are shown as positive controls. To ensure the reactions are in the linear range, each group of three lanes represents PCR done with 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 μg of starting cDNA material. GAPDH was also amplified independently to control for the cDNA concentration and quality (data not shown). B, DMS in vivo footprint analysis of CIITA promoter III in myeloma cell lines. This experiment is the same as in Fig. 2 A except lanes 1–4 are of the promoter in the U266 cells, and lanes 5–8 are of the promoter in the NCI-H929 cells. A nearly identical pattern of contacts is observed in the U266 line, while the NCI-H929 line is completely devoid of in vivo contacts. Lane markings are as described for Fig. 2 A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In vivo footprinting with DMS is limited to analysis of guanine residues, which may allow some interactions to escape detection. In order to expand the effective analysis of interactions on CIITA promoter III, we established in vivo genomic footprinting using UV light as the modifying agent in place of DMS. Ultraviolet light induces the formation of pyrimidine dimers that can be subsequently converted into double strand DNA breaks. Studies on thePKG1, JUN, PCNA, and FOSgene promoters have demonstrated suppression or enhancement of UV photoproduct formation associated specifically with known sites ofin vivo protein/DNA interaction (34Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Analysis of CIITA promoter III demonstrates two strong photoproduct enhancements on the lower DNA strand at the ARE-1 element (Fig. 2 B, lane 6 versus lane 4). This is revealed by the more intense signal in vivo at these two pyrimidine pairs compared with the neighboring pyrimidine pairs at similar or lower doses of UV light. This confirms the strong in vivo protections that were detected by DMS on the upper strand and validates the usefulness of the technique. A second cluster of three very strong photoproduct enhancements is located between base pairs −183 and −172, corresponding to the single DMS enhancement detected on the upper strand at site C. This confirms that site C is a site of in vivo protein binding. In summary, the in vivo footprinting analyses identified five sites of protein/DNA interaction within the first 183 base pairs of the promoter (Fig. 3). Differentiation of B-lymphocytes into plasma cells is accompanied by suppression of MHC class II gene expression (36Halper J. Fu S.M. Wang C.-Y. Winchester R. Kunkel H.G. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 1480-1484PubMed Google Scholar). In the single plasmacytoma cell line examined to date, CIITA expression was down-regulated, and introduction of CIITA rescued MHC class II expression (37Silacci P. Mottet A. Steimle V. Reith W. Mach B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, studies of other plasmacytoma cell lines have identified some lines that weakly express MHC class II (38Yi Q. Dabadghao S. Osterborg A. Bergenbrant S. Holm G. Blood. 1997; 90: 1960-1967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due to the state of differentiation of the transformed cell lines. Two different plasmacytoma cell lines were examined to determine the level of CIITA expression and if in vivo protein/DNA interactions at the CIITA promoter were altered. One cell line, NCI-H929, has no detectable MHC class II DRA or CIITA mRNA (Fig.4 A, lanes 7–9). In contrast, the U266 plasmacytoma cell line has low levels of both (lanes 10–12) compared with the B cell lines Raji and IM9 (lanes 1–6). When examined by DMS in vivo genomic footprinting, CIITA promoter III was completely bare of all in vivo protein/DNA interactions in the CIITA-negative NCI-H929 cell line (Fig.4 B). In contrast, in the low CIITA-expressing cell line U266, interactions were detected at the ARE-1, ARE-2, site A, and site B elements, which were"

The mammalian ras protooncogenes, Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras, are expressed in a variety of tissues (1Furth M.E. Aldrich T.H. Cordon Cardo C. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Ha-ras is highly expressed in skin and skeletal muscle; Ki-ras in gut and thymus; and N-ras in testis and thymus. Ras proteins bind guanine nucleotides and possess intrinsic GTPase activity, serving as transducers of diverse physiological signals including those controlling cellular proliferation and differentiation (2Lowy D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Some of the biological activities of Ras proteins are known to be modulated by other proteins, including Krev-1 (3Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and Ha-rev107 (4Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schafer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar). However, physiological functions of Ras proteins and these regulatory proteins in mammalian cells remain largely unknown. Chondrogenesis is a key event in skeletal development in vertebrates. We previously reported that chondrogenesis could be induced in chondroprogenitor-like EC cells, ATDC5, at a high incidence when cultured in the presence of insulin and that ATDC5 cells keep track of the overt chondrogenesis in vitro (5Akiyama H.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) were plated in six-multiwell plates at an initial cell density of 6 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 3 days in α minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. Cultured adherent cells from bone marrow were prepared from 6-week-old ICR mice (SRL, Hamamatsu, Japan) as described previously (18Zipori D. Duksin D. Tamir M. Argaman A. Toledo J. Malik Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, tibiae and femurs were dissected, the ends of the bones were cut, and bone morrow was flushed out with DMEM/Ham's F-12 hybrid medium containing 10% FBS. The pooled marrow cells were dispersed by agitation in the syringe and plated in six-multiwell plastic culture plates (2 × 107 cells/well). After 48 h, nonadherent cells were removed by replacing the medium and the adherent cells were cultured further for five days at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere with medium replacement every other day. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was isolated from C3H10T1/2 cells and ATDC5 cells by a single-step method as described previously (6Akiyama H.

Commun. 1997; 235: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and analyzed by differential display according to the manufacture's instruction (RNAmapTM, GenHunter, Nashville, TN). The DNA fragment of approximately 500-bp expressed only in undifferentiated ATDC5 cells was identified and subcloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and its nucleotide sequence was determined with ALFred DNA Sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library from undifferentiated ATDC5 poly(A)+ RNA was constructed in λZAP Express vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and 1 × 106 plaques were screened with the 500-bp fragment as a probe. Plaques were transferred to the membranes (137-mm nylon membrane, NEN Life Science Products), the PCR fragment was 32P-labeled (BcaBEST labeling kit, Takara, Otsu, Japan), and hybridization was performed in 6 × SSPE, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Ficoll 400, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and the 32P-labeled probe for 16 h at 42 °C. The membranes were washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSPE (3m NaCl, 197 mm, NaH2PO4, 25 mm EDTA) and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. ATDC5 cells and C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in six-multiwell plastic plates and cultured as described above. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern hybridization as described previously (6Akiyama H. Shigeno C. Hiraki Y. Shukunami C. Kohno H. Akagi M. Konishi J. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg) was denatured, separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred on Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). A 3.0-kb cDNA fragment of A-C1 was used for hybridization as a probe. In analysis of tissue distribution in adult mice, a labeled cDNA was hybridized to a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). After hybridization, the membranes were exposed to X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C with Cronex lightening plus intensifying screens (DuPont). The RT-PCR was performed as described previously (6Akiyama H. Shigeno C. Hiraki Y. Shukunami C. Kohno H. Akagi M. Konishi J. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5 μg of total RNA extracted from various cell lines cultured in vitro. The following specific primers were used: 5′-CACACTGGTAAGTGGGGCAAGACCG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GGATTGTGTTGTTTCAGGGTTCGGG-3′ (antisense primer) for mouse A-C1 cDNA. Amplification consisted of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 reaction cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C). Aliquots (8 μl) of each PCR products were resolved on 3% NuSieve 3:1 agarose gels (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) alongside the markers. The amplified PCR products were subcloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, SanDiego, CA), and the nucleotide sequences of all cDNA fragments were verified using ALFred DNA Sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Brains and tibiae of male 5-week-old ICR mice were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C. Tibiae were decalcified for 4 days in 10% EDTA. They were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedding in paraffin. Sections (6 μm thick) were then processed for in situ hybridization as described previously (19Iyama K. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Linsenmayer T.F. Trelstad R.L. Hayashi M. Anat. Rec. 1991; 229: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The 3.0-kb mouse A-C1 cDNA was labeled with [35S]TTP (DuPont Biotechnology Systems, Boston, MA) by nick translation to a specific activity of 3.0–5.0 × 108 cpm/μg. After hybridization, the slides were washed under conditions of high stringency, and the dried tissue sections were dipped into NTB-2 emulsion (Kodak) and exposed for 7 days at 4 °C. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Specificity of this cDNA probe was confirmed by Northern blot analysis with total RNA extracted from ATDC5 cells (Fig. 5). In addition, the sections pretreated with RNase before in situ hybridization with the cDNA probe showed no autographic signals, indicating that the hybridization signals were dependent on the presence of RNA (data not shown). A coupled transcription/translation reaction was performed using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TnT Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems, Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, catalog number AG1094) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 3.0-kb A-C1 cDNA cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was used as a template (pCMV-AC1). The translation product was electrophoresed on a 10–20% polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography with the X-Omat films (Kodak) (8-h exposure at room temperature). Prestained rainbow marker (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was loaded in the adjacent lane to estimate molecular sizes. A DNA fragment encoding the A-C1 protein appended with a FLAG tag at its C terminus was generated by PCR using the 3.0-kb A-C1 cDNA as a template and the primer sequences as follows: sense primer 5′-GCCGCCACCATGGACCCGACACGGTCCC-3′; antisense primer 5′-CTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCATATTTCGTTCTTTGTCTTTTGGGAAAC-3′. The antisense primer contained sequences for a FLAG tag (underlined) and a stop codon. Amplification consisted of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 reaction cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C). The PCR product was gel-purified and cloned into pCRII vector (pCRII/A-C1FLAG), and its nucleotide sequence was verified by ALFred DNA Sequencer. The insert of the pCRII/A-C1FLAG vector was excised withSpeI and XhoI and recloned into theSpeI-XhoI site of pcDNA3.1 vector. The resultant expression vector, pCMV/A-C1FLAG, or pcDNA3.1 as a control were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells cultured on Lab-Tec Chamber Slide (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) by lipofection using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Two days later, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100, and then incubated with diluted normal blocking serum for 20 min at room temperature. Incubation of these cells with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was performed for 30 min at room temperature. The bound antibody was detected using the Vectastain ABC Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, staining was developed for 10 min using the Dako AEC Substrate System (Dako Corp.). Slides were mounted with Crystal Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and examined under a microscope. Lras/NIH cells are a derivative of NIH3T3 containing human Ha-ras 12Voncogene, 2M. Noda and H. Kitayama, unpublished data. and DT is a derivative of NIH3T3 (HGPRT−) containing two copies of Kirsten murine sarcoma virus provirus (20Noda M. Selinger Z. Scolnick E.M. Bassin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5602-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Lras/NIH cells and DT cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.03%l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (growth medium). The transfection protocol we used was a modification of the method described previously (3Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). pCMV-AC1, pcDNA3.1, or pKrev-1 (a Krev-1 expression vector, positive control) (2.5 μg), pSV-BSD (blasticidin-S-resistant vector) (1.5 μg), and sheared calf thymus DNA (1 μg) as a carrier were used. Lras/NIH cells and DT cells (3 × 104) were plated 1 day prior to co-transfection on a collagen-coated 35-mm diameter dish. The DNA-CaPO4 co-precipitates were formed in 100 μl volume and added to the cells covered with 1.5 ml growth medium according to the method of Wigler et al. (21Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 12–16 h in a CO2 incubator, the cells were treated with 1 ml of 25% glycerol in 1 × DMEM for 1 min, rinsed with DMEM, and refed with 2 ml of growth medium. On the following day, the cells were trypsinized and replated onto a 100-mm diameter dish with 15 ml of growth medium supplemented with 8 μg/ml blasticidin-S (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan). The medium was changed on the next day and 4 days later. After 4 days of selection with blasticidin-S, total number of colonies were counted under a phase-contrast microscope. The number of the flat clones was counted on the following day. To determine the growth curve, Lras/NIH cells transfected with pCMV-AC1 or pcDNA3.1 vector were inoculated in 24-multiwell plates and cultured with the growth medium containing 8 μg/ml blasticidin-S. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, treated with trypsin and counted with a hemocytometer at the time points indicated. To find genes specifically expressed in chondrogenic cells, we performed differential display using the total RNA extracted from a chondrogenic EC cell line, ATDC5, and obtained a 500-bp cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3′-untranslated sequence of a novel differentially expressed gene named A-C1. This cDNA fragment was then used as a probe to screen at high stringency a mouse cDNA library generated from ATDC5 cells. Ten cDNA clones were obtained from 1 × 106independent plaques. Eight out of ten clones contained a cDNA of about 3.0 kb. Fig. 1 A shows the nucleotide sequence of A-C1 cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative A-C1 protein. A-C1 cDNA contains a 501-bp open reading frame starting from an ATG codon. The sequence surrounding this ATG well matches the Kozak consensus sequence (22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). Therefore, A-C1 protein is predicted to consist of 167 amino acid residues. The predicted A-C1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 18,809 daltons and an isoelectric point of 6.1. The 3′-end of the sequence contains a poly(A) stretch, preceded by a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA). A hydrophobicity plot using the Kyte-Doolittle algorithms (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) showed the existence of a possible transmembrane domain at its C ternimus (143–159 amino acid) (Fig. 1 B). The amino acid sequence lacks the N-terminal signal peptide. These data suggest that the A-C1 cDNA is likely to encode an intracellular, membrane-bound protein. The amino acid sequence of A-C1 protein showed a significant homology with that of rat Ha-rev107 (4Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schafer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar) (46% amino acid identity at the amino acid level) (Fig.2).Figure 2Comparison of the amino acid sequences of mouse A-C1 and rat Ha-rev107. Asterisksindicate identical residues. The predicted transmembrane domain isunderlined, and the possible sequence motifs for nucleotide interaction are boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the cloned 3.0-kb A-C1 cDNA contained a functional open reading frame, we performed anin vitro transcription/translation using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine. A single protein product of the expected size was detectable. (Fig. 3). No protein product was detectable with the vector control (pcDNA3.1) (data not shown). To analyze the subcellular localization of A-C1 protein (Fig. 4), COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the A-C1 cDNA with a FLAG tag sequence at the C terminus (pCMV/A-C1FLAG). Immunocytochemical staining with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody showed that A-C1 protein was localized in the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region but not within the nucleus. No staining was seen after transient transfection of the vacant pcDNA3.1 vector. We assessed by Northern analysis and RT-PCR the expression of A-C1 mRNA in culture cell lines: ATDC5, C3H10T1/2, MC3T3-E1, NIH3T3, Balb/c 3T3, ST2, and C2C12. A major hybridization band of about 3.2 kb was detected in chondrogenic ATDC5 cells, but not in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig.5 A). The expression of A-C1 mRNA was detectable by RT-PCR in C2C12 as well as ATDC5, but not in MC3T3-E1, NIH3T3, Balb/c 3T3, and ST2 (Fig. 5 B). Northern analysis showed that among the various adult mice tissues, A-C1 mRNA was expressed highly in skeletal muscle and moderately in heart and brain (Fig.6 A). The expression of A-C1 mRNA was detectable also in bone marrow cells by RT-PCR (Fig.6 B). By in situ hybridization, A-C1 mRNA was localized in hippocampus and bone marrow in adult mice (Fig.7).Figure 7Localization of A-C1 gene expression in brain and bone marrow in adult mice. Brains and tibiae of 5-week-old mice were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (6 μm thick) were processed for in situ hybridization as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Silver grains were accumulated in hippocampus in brain and bone marrow in diaphysis of tibiae. Three independent experiments were performed and gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The deduced amino acid sequence of A-C1 showed homology with that of rat Ha-rev107, suggesting that A-C1 may possess the revertant-inducing activity onras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. We assessed such activity by transfecting A-C1 gene into NIH3T3 cell line transformed by Ha-ras 12V or v-Ki-ras oncogene (Lras/NIH and DT, respectively) and observing the morphology. When Lras/NIH cells were transfected with pCMV-AC1, the colonies of these transfectants, observed under a phase-contrast microscope, were relatively smaller in size than those in the control culture transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector. Moreover, some of these colonies consisted of flat cells with increased attachment to the substrate (Fig. 8). The frequency of flat colonies was comparable with that observed after transfection of the control Krev-1 gene (Table I). Total numbers of colonies, however, were similar between the vector-transfected and pCMV-AC1-transfected cultures. In contrast, pCMV-AC1 did not give rise to flat colonies when transfected into DT cells (Fig. 8), while Krev-1 showed a substantial activity to induce flat colonies in this cell line (Table I).Table ITransfection of A-C1 into Lras/NIH cells and DT cellsPhenotypeNumber of coloniespcDNA3.1pCMV-AC1pKrev-1Lras/NIH cells Total131134166 Flat5 (2.3%)39 (7.3%)46 (6.9%)DT cells Total138139197 Flat5 (3.6%)5 (3.6%)43 (21.8%)pcDNA3.1 control vector, pCMV-AC1, or pKrev-1 (2.5 μg) was transfected into 3 × 104 of Lras/NIH cells or DT cells, and the transfectants were selected in growth medium containing 8 μg/ml blasticidin-S. Open table in a new tab pcDNA3.1 control vector, pCMV-AC1, or pKrev-1 (2.5 μg) was transfected into 3 × 104 of Lras/NIH cells or DT cells, and the transfectants were selected in growth medium containing 8 μg/ml blasticidin-S. Overexpression of A-C1 suppressed not only the transformed morphology of Lras/NIH cells but also the growth of these cells (Fig.9). Doubling times of the pooled A-C1-transfected and vector-transfected Lras/NIH cells were ∼20 and ∼34 h, respectively. Saturation densities, however, were similar between the two (∼2.2 × 105cells/cm2). We have isolated by differential display a novel gene, A-C1, encoding a protein of 167 amino acids, which is specifically expressed in skeletal muscles, heart, brain, and bone marrow in vivo. A-C1 protein has a putative transmembrane domain at the C ternimus (143–159 amino acid) and lacks the N-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 1), indicating that A-C1 protein is probably an intracellular, membrane-bound protein. Indeed, a preliminary experiment with tagged protein described here suggested its predominant localization in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region (Fig. 4). Further studies are required, however, to confirm the subcellular localization and membrane-association of the intact, endogenous A-C1 protein under physiological conditions. The amino acid sequence of A-C1 showed 46% homology with that of rat Ha-rev107 (4Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schafer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar). Ha-rev107 is a class II tumor suppressor, as defined by its down-regulation after Ha-ras transformation in fibroblasts, expression in ras-resistant fibroblasts, and growth-inhibiting capacity in Ha-ras-transformed cell lines. The expression of Ha-rev107 was detected in liver, kidney, stomach, and intestine, distinct from that of A-C1, while Ha-rev107 protein appeared to be linked to the nuclear membrane and to membranes in the perinuclear space, similar to the subcellular localization of A-C1. Ras proteins bind guanine nucleotides with high affinity. Three sequence motifs important for nucleotide interaction have been determined, which are conserved between different guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins (12Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar): GXXGXGKS is involved in the binding to the α- and β-phosphates; DXXG is involved in binding to Mg2+ and γ-phosphate when GTP is bound; and NKXD is important for binding to the guanine ring. Both A-C 1 and Ha-rev107 protein have two consensus sequence motifs, DXXG and NKXD (Fig. 2), which were previously unnoticed. The role of these motifs should be elucidated in future studies. Overexpression of A-C1 not only induced reversion of morphology in Ha-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells but also suppressed the growth of these cells, as evidenced by the smaller colony formed (Fig. 8) and the growth curve (Fig. 9). These results support the notion that A-C1 may serve as a negative regulator for the Ha-ras-mediated signaling pathway. How this is achieved is also an important subject for future studies. Our data also indicated that A-C1 is not an effective suppressor against the v-Ki-ras-transformed cell line we used. Whether this reflects some kind of selectivity among Ras family proteins is an interesting question to be clarified. In this study, we identified the A-C1 gene by differential display to screen genes specifically expressed in mouse chondrogenic EC cells, ATDC5. Our observations that A-C1 is expressed in specific tissuesin vivo and certain cell lines in vitro and that A-C1 is a potential inhibitor of Ha-ras-mediated intracellular signaling pathway raise the possibility that A-C1 may play a role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in these specific tissues."

It is not known how UV irradiation induces S-phase arrest and yet permits DNA repair; however, UV-induced inhibition of replication is efficiently reversed by the addition of replication protein A (RPA), suggesting a role for RPA in this regulatory event. Here, we show evidence that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), plays a role in UV-induced replication arrest. DNA synthesis of M059K (DNA-PK catalytic subunit-positive (DNA-PKcs+)), as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, was significantly arrested by 4 h following UV irradiation, whereas M059J (DNA-PKcs−) cells were much less affected. Similar results were obtained with the in vitro replication reactions where immediate replication arrest occurred in DNA-PKcs+ cells following UV irradiation, and only a gradual decrease in replication activity was observed in DNA-PKcs− cells. Reversal of replication arrest was observed at 8 h following UV irradiation in DNA-PKcs+cells but not in DNA-PKcs− cells. Reversal of UV-induced replication arrest was also observed in vitro by the addition of a DNA-PK inhibitor, wortmannin, or by immunodepletion of DNA-PKcs, supporting a positive role for DNA-PK in damage-induced replication arrest. The RPA-containing fraction from UV-irradiated DNA-PKcs+ cells poorly supported DNA replication, whereas the replication activity of the RPA-containing fraction from DNA-PKcs− cells was not affected by UV, suggesting that DNA-PKcs may be involved in UV-induced replication arrest through modulation of RPA activity. Together, our results strongly suggest a role for DNA-PK in S-phase (replication) arrest in response to UV irradiation.

The molecular mechanism of damage-induced S-phase arrest is not known; however, the effects of UV irradiation during S-phase on subsequent cell cycles are magnified in repair-deficient cells (2Orren D.K.

In contrast, in vitro replication experiments with cytosolic extracts from UV-damaged cells strongly indicate that UV-induced inhibition of replication is not due to a blockade of replication by DNA damage itself; rather, irradiation probably induces a mechanism that inhibits DNA replication (3Carty M.P.

The observation that damage-induced RPA phosphorylation interferes with its interaction with p53 and DNA-PK suggests a positive role for RPA in regulating the p53-dependent damage checkpoint pathway (38Abramova N.A.

The recent in vivo finding that human RPA is phosphorylated in ATM cells defective in IR-induced S-phase arrest suggested that damage-induced RPA phosphorylation may not be coupled to the S-phase checkpoint (40Morgan S.E.

Recent observations also suggest a possible role for DNA-PK in controlling apoptosis and the length of telomeric chromosomal ends (43Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem.

DNA-PKcs is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) family and shares amino acid sequence homology in its carboxyl-terminal kinase domain with other family members, including the ATM gene, the ATM-related gene, and p110 PI-3 kinase (54Hartley K.O.

Recent observations indicate that DNA-PK mutant cells exhibit sensitivity to UV irradiation and cisplatin and are associated with lower nucleotide excision repair activity, suggesting a positive role for DNA-PK in DNA repair (59Muller C. Calsou P. Frit P. Cayrol C. Carter T. Salles B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Also, studies with cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cells indicate that higher levels of DNA-PKcs expression promote cell resistance to DNA-damaging drugs, whereas the low DNA-PK activity is associated with cells with a drug-sensitive phenotype (60Shen H. Kauvar L. Tew K.D. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar,61Muller C. Salles B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2343-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results suggest that DNA-PK not only senses DNA damage but also functions as a transmitter of signals that allow repair of damaged DNA and protects cells from apoptosis. Previous studies with UV-irradiated HeLa cells suggested a role for RPA in UV-induced inhibition of replication because this event was reversed by the addition of RPA (3Carty M.P. Zernik-kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated a role for DNA-PK in replication arrest following UV irradiation. We present evidence that DNA-PK plays an essential role in UV-induced replication arrest, such that DNA-PK, upon UV irradiation, acts to induce replication arrest without affecting DNA repair activity. SV40 replication origin-containing plasmid, pSV01ΔEP, and SV40 T-antigen were prepared as described previously (62Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Antipolymerase α monoclonal antibody (SJK237) and anti-RPA (p34 and p70) polyclonal antibodies (from rabbits) were described previously (62Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An anti-DNA-PKcs antibody was a kind gift from Dr. C. Anderson (Brookhaven National Laboratory), and an anti-PCNA antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. DNA-PK holoenzyme was purified from HeLa cells according to the procedure described previously (44Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Two malignant glioblastoma cells, M059K (DNA-PK+) and M059J (DNA-PK-) were obtained from Dr. M. J. Allalunis-Turner (Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Canada), mouse SCID-st cells were from Drs. J. M. Brown and C. Kirchgessner (Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA), and NIH3T3 was from Dr. M. Marshall (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN). Monolayer culture of HeLa cells, M059K, and M059J were grown in tissue culture dishes (150 × 25 mm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and mouse SCID-st and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Culture dishes with 80% confluence were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were exposed to UV-C light (GE, G30T8) in the presence of 5 ml of PBS. After adding fresh medium, UV-irradiated cells were further incubated for the indicated amount of time at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Nonirradiated cells were also prepared the same way without UV irradiation. To study the effect of wortmannin, cells were pretreated with wortmannin (1.0 μm) for 1 h prior to UV irradiation and continued to grow in the presence of wortmannin until time of harvest. Cells (5 × 105/60-mm dish) were incubated with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (75 Ci/mmol) for 1 h prior to UV irradiation at 10 J/m2. At the indicated time points, cell metabolism was stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of 2.3m citric acid. After washing the cells with PBS, DNA was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by acid-insoluble radioactivity measurement. Cytosolic cell extracts were prepared according to the procedure originally described by Li and Kelly (63Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayer cells were washed twice with PBS and hypotonic buffer. After removing the excess amount of buffer, the swollen cells were scraped into a Dounce homogenizer (approximate volume of 0.2 ml/dish) and dounced 5–8 times on ice. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove nuclear pellets and the insoluble materials. Ammonium sulfate (AS) fractionation of cytosolic cell extracts was done as described previously (9Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1834-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (62Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein fractions were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose (Millipore Corp.), and immunoblotted with either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. After incubation with either125I-protein A or 125I-protein G, proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Replication reactions were carried out as described previously (26Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures (40 μl) contained 40 mm creatine phosphate-di-Tris salt (pH 7.7); 1 μg of creatine kinase; 7 mmMgCl2; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; 4 mmATP; 200 μm UTP, GTP, and CTP; 100 μm dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP; 20 μm [α-32P]dATP (specific activity of 30,000 cpm/pmol); 0.8 μg of SV40 T-antigen; 0.3 μg of SV40 origin-containing DNA (pSV01ΔEP); and the indicated amounts of RPA. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and then stopped with 40 μl of stop solution containing 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and Escherichia coli tRNA (0.5 mg/ml). One-tenth of the reaction mixture was used to measure the acid-insoluble radioactivity. Replication products in the remaining reaction mixture were analyzed electrophoretically, separating the isolated DNA in a 1% agarose gel with TBE buffer. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed to x-ray film. Repair of UV-damaged DNA was carried out according to the published procedure (64Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9337-9343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 0.2 μg of UV-irradiated (450 J/m2) pBS (3 kilobase pairs) and nonirradiated p5A (4.5 kilobase pairs); 40 mm creatine phosphate-di-Tris salt (pH 7.7); 1 μg of creatine kinase; 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8); 70 mm KCl; 7.5 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; 0.4 mm EDTA; 2 mm ATP; 20 μm dGTP, dCTP, and TTP; 8 μm [α-32P]dATP (25,000 cpm/pmol), 5 μg of bovine serum albumin; and the indicated amounts of the whole cell extracts. After incubation for 3 h at 30 °C, DNA was isolated from the reaction mixtures, linearized with BamHI, and separated on a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The DNA and repair products were analyzed by both fluorography and autoradiography. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 125 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 30,000 cpm/pmol)), 150 μm substrate peptide (44Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), 0.4 μg of calf-thymus activated DNA, and increasing amounts of cell lysates (1 and 2 μg). After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction mixtures were stopped by the addition of 30% acetic acid. Reaction mixtures (5 μl) were spotted onto a P-81 strip, and after extensive washing radioactivity was measured. DNA-PK activity was shown as pmol of 32P transferred to the substrate peptide. To understand the molecular mechanism of UV-induced replication arrest, we examined whether DNA-PK plays a role in this regulatory event. For this, two malignant glioblastoma human cells (M059K (DNA-PKcs+) and M059J (DNA-PKcs−)) (65Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner M.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) were labeled with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) and examined for in vivo DNA synthesis at various time points following a low dose of UV irradiation (10 J/m2). The amounts of DNA synthesis in asynchronously grown M059K (DNA-PKcs+) and M059J (DNA-PKcs−) cells were similar in the absence of UV irradiation, but DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited following UV irradiation (Fig. 1). Most importantly, much tighter replication arrest was observed with DNA-PKcs+cells compared with that with DNA-PKcs− cells up to 8 h following UV irradiation (Fig. 1), suggesting a possible role for DNA-PKcs (or its holoenzyme) in UV-induced replication arrest. It should be pointed out, however, that the inhibition of replication following UV damage in DNA-PKcs+ cells could be due to the G1 checkpoint arrest that results in fewer cells traversing the G1/S boundary. To further investigate a role for DNA-PKcs in UV-induced replication arrest, we prepared cell extracts from M059K (DNA-PKcs+) and M059J (DNA-PKcs−) cells at various times following UV irradiation (10 J/m2) and examined in vitro DNA replication activity using SV40 origin-containing DNA. Replication activity of DNA-PKcs+ cells sharply declined within 2 h following UV irradiation, whereas DNA-PKcs− cells were only slightly affected by UV irradiation (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–3 versus lanes 6–8). A striking difference between DNA-PKcs+ and DNA-PKcs− was observed 12–24 h after UV irradiation, such that the reversal of inhibition of replication was observed in DNA-PKcs+ cells, but not in DNA-PKcs− cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 5 versus lane 10). Treatment of cells with wortmannin (1.0 μm), an inhibitor of DNA-PK, abolished both rapid replication arrest and the reversal of the arrest in UV-irradiated DNA-PKcs+ cells but showed a gradual decrease in replication activity similar to that observed in DNA-PKcs−cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 11–15). Reversal of replication arrest in DNA-PKcs+ cells occurred in a UV dose-dependent manner, which requires low UV dosage (10 J/m2) (Fig. 2 B). With high dose UV irradiation, DNA-PK+ cells may induce apoptotic signal without DNA replication. In contrast to replication arrest, UV irradiation had no effect on nucleotide excision repair activity regardless of DNA-PKcs presence or absence (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that DNA-PKcs plays a crucial role in UV-induced replication arrest, and that may also be necessary for the reversal of the arrest.Figure 2Replication and repair activities of DNA-PKcs + and DNA-PKcs − cells following UV irradiation. A, extracts were prepared from UV-irradiated (10 J/m2) DNA-PKcs+ (M059K) and DNA-PKcs− (M059J) cells at various time points (0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h) and were examined for their replication activity. Where indicated, cells (DNA-PKcs+) were treated with 1 μm of wortmannin for 1 h prior to UV irradiation. Reaction mixtures contained SV40 origin-containing DNA (pSV01ΔEP), 200 μg of cell extracts, and 0.8 μg of SV40 T-antigen. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, DNA was isolated and analyzed on 1.0% neutral agarose gel electrophoresis.

Where indicated, 150 μg (lanes 1, 3, 5,7, 9, and 11) and 300 μg (lanes 2, 4, 6,8, 10, and 12) of whole cell extracts were added.

To examine this, cell extracts from either nonirradiated or UV-irradiated DNA-PKcs+ cells were preincubated with wortmannin at 37 °C for 30 min and examined for replication activity (Fig.3 A). Replication arrest caused by UV irradiation of DNA-PKcs+ cells was reversed up to 80% by incubating cell extracts with wortmannin (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–7) under conditions where replication activity of nonirradiated DNA-PKcs+ cells was only slightly stimulated (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–4). In contrast, replication activity of cell extracts from DNA-PKcs− cells was unaffected by wortmannin in the presence or absence of UV irradiation (Fig. 3 B). The amount of wortmannin (1.0 μm) used in this experiment was sufficient to inhibit more than 95% of DNA-PK kinase activity present in cell extracts (Fig. 3 C). Reversal of UV-induced replication arrest required preincubation of extracts with wortmannin at 37 °C prior to replication reaction (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that DNA-PK is involved in replication arrest through a modulation of target protein. Together, this in vitro result is consistent with the in vivo observations (Figs. 1 and 2) that DNA-PKcs (or its holoenzyme) plays a crucial role in UV-induced replication arrest. It is sti"
https://openalex.org/W2039820208,"The family of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) protein kinases plays an important role in regulating cellular protein synthesis under stress conditions. The mammalian kinases PKR and HRI and the yeast kinase GCN2 specifically phosphorylate Ser-51 on the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2. By using an in vivo assay in yeast, the substrate specificity of these three eIF2α kinases was examined by substituting Ser-51 in eIF2α with Thr or Tyr. In yeast, phosphorylation of eIF2 inhibits general translation but derepresses translation of the GCN4 mRNA. All three kinases phosphorylated Thr in place of Ser-51 and were able to regulate general and GCN4-specific translation. In addition, both PKR and HRI were found to phosphorylate eIF2α-S51Y and stimulateGCN4 expression. Isoelectric focusing analysis of eIF2α followed by detection using anti-eIF2α and anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies demonstrated that PKR and HRI phosphorylated eIF2α-S51Y on Tyr in vivo. These results provide new insights into the substrate recognition properties of the eIF2α kinases, and they are intriguing considering the potential for alternate substrates for PKR in cellular signaling and growth control pathways. The family of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) protein kinases plays an important role in regulating cellular protein synthesis under stress conditions.

The human interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR, which functions in the cellular antiviral defense mechanism, is a member of a family of structurally related Ser/Thr kinases that specifically phosphorylate Ser-51 on the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 1The abbreviations used are:eIFeukaryotic initiation factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIEFisoelectric focusing3-AT3-aminotriazole (1Clemens M.J.

The binding of double-stranded RNA, thought to be generated during viral infections, is proposed to alter the conformation of PKR and activate the kinase to autophosphorylate (1Clemens M.J.

The active, phosphorylated form of PKR can then phosphorylate eIF2α on Ser-51 and convert eIF2 into an inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, resulting in the inhibition of translation initiation (1Clemens M.J.

The other members of the eIF2α kinase family are the mammalian heme-regulated inhibitor of translation (HRI) that is activated by heme deprivation, the apparently ubiquitous kinase GCN2, first identified in yeast but also found in flies and mammals, which is activated under conditions of amino acid or purine nucleotide deprivation (1Clemens M.J.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, low level phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 alters the pattern of translation reinitiation on the GCN4 mRNA and induces GCN4 expression (2Hinnebusch A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Increased synthesis of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes, enables cells to withstand amino acid starvation conditions. The mammalian eIF2α kinases PKR and HRI can substitute for GCN2 in yeast to phosphorylate eIF2α and stimulate GCN4 translation (7Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F.

In biochemical analyses, PKR has been shown to phosphorylate intact eIF2α or a 12-residue peptide containing the Ser-51 phosphorylation site (17Mellor H. Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As part of our studies aimed to define the in vivo substrate recognition properties of PKR, we chose to examine the ability of PKR, HRI, and GCN2 to phosphorylate Thr or Tyr in place of Ser at residue 51 in eIF2α. In general, protein kinases phosphorylate either Ser/Thr or Tyr residues, and these two classes of protein kinases are mutually exclusive. In fact, when Ser or Thr was substituted for a Tyr autophosphorylation site in the p130gag-fps Tyr kinase of fujinami sarcoma virus, neither hydroxyamino acid was phosphorylated, and the mutant kinases had reduced enzymatic and oncogenic activities (18Weinmaster G. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 328-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, structural analyses of Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases support the view that the active sites of these enzymes are designed to ensure substrate selectivity (19Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 20Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our analyses have revealed that the three eIF2α kinases can phosphorylate Thr in place of Ser-51 in eIF2α and, in addition, that PKR and HRI can phosphorylate Tyr in place of eIF2α-Ser-51. These results suggest that PKR and HRI may have a rather flexible active site that can accommodate Tyr as well as Ser/Thr, and these results have interesting implications regarding the substrate recognition properties of PKR. The SUI2-S51T and SUI2-S51Yalleles encoding, respectively, the yeast eIF2α-S51T and eIF2α-S51Y proteins were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction. The 5′-TCC-3′ (Ser-51) codon of SUI2 was changed to either 5′-ACC-3′ (Thr-51) or 5′-TAC-3′ (Tyr-51). The SUI2 alleles were transferred to a low copy number LEU2/CEN4 vector to create pC105 (Ser-51), pC107 (S51T), and pC110 (S51Y) or to the high copy number LEU2 vector pRS425 (21Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) to create pC136 (S51Y). The wild-type SUI2 (Ser-51) and SUI2-S51A (22Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.D. Hinnebusch A.G.

The low copy number URA3 plasmids carrying wild-typeGCN2 (p722), GCN c -516 (GCN2 c -E532K-E1522K, p1056), orGCN2 c -513 (GCN2 c -M719V-E1537G, p1052) have been described (9Ramirez M. Wek R.C.

The high copy number pEMBLyex4 plasmids that express human PKR (p1420) or PKR-K296R (p1421) and rabbit HRI (p1246) or HRI-K199R (p1247) under the control of a yeast GAL-CYC1 chimeric promoter were described previously (7Dever T.E.

Standard methods were used for culturing and transformation of yeast strains (23Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The strains H1925 (Mat a ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1-Δ63 sui2Δ gcn2Δ, p919[SUI2 URA3], p1108[GCN4-lacZ TRP1] integrated at trp1-Δ63); H2507 (Mat a ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1-Δ63 sui2Δ gcn2Δ, p919[SUI2 URA3]); and J101 (Mat a ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1-Δ63 sui2Δ gcn2Δ gcn3Δ, p919[SUI2 URA3]) were transformed with low or high copy number LEU2 plasmids containing theSUI2 mutant alleles, and then the transformants were transferred to medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to evict theURA3 plasmid carrying wild-type SUI2. The various eIF2α kinase plasmids were introduced into the resultant strains by transformation selecting for Ura prototrophy. Identical cell growth conditions were used forGCN4-lacZ expression and IEF gel electrophoresis assays. For strains expressing HRI or HRI-K199R, pre-cultures were incubated 2 days in SR medium (2% raffinose in place of glucose in SD medium) and then inoculated 1:50 into fresh SR medium and harvested after overnight growth. For strains expressing PKR or PKR-K296R, pre-cultures were grown 2 days in SD medium, and then cells (∼0.1A600 units) were inoculated into SGR medium (10% galactose plus 2% raffinose in place of glucose in SD medium) and harvested after overnight growth. The methods for growing strains expressing GCN2 or GCN2c kinases, cell harvesting and breaking, β-galactosidase assays, and IEF gel electrophoresis have been described previously (22Dever T.E.

To detect phosphotyrosine on immunoblots, the membrane was probed with affinity purified rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibodies (2.3 μg/ml) in 1× TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. R. Friesel, Holland Laboratory, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD. In addition, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were obtained fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). To detect PKR, the membrane was probed with monoclonal anti-PKR antibodies (71/10) in 1× TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk, as described previously (7Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M.

Meurs E. Katze M.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PKR expression from the plasmid pET-PKR was induced in theEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS as described previously (24Barber G.N. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E. Katze M.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted, suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 mmNaF, 35 mm β-glycerol phosphate), and then disrupted by sonication. PKR expression from the plasmid p1420 was induced in a derivative of the gcn2Δ yeast strain H2507 expressing eIF2α-S51A as described above for the IEF analysis. Cells were pelleted, suspended in lysis buffer, and broken with glass beads in a Braun homogenizer as described previously (22Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To induce PKR expression, HeLa cells were treated overnight with interferon and then harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 0.5× RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS) containing inhibitors (see above), and broken by subjecting them to freeze-thaw cycles three times. Following breakage, the lysates from all three cell types were cleared by centrifugation. Whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads or with beads alone in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h with rocking. The beads were washed three times each with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and then boiled 5 min in SDS loading buffer. To initiate an analysis of substrate recognition by the eIF2α kinases, we examined translational regulation in yeast strains in which Thr or Tyr was substituted for Ser-51 in eIF2α. Plasmids that express wild-type or inactive forms of PKR or HRI or containing wild-type GCN2 or hyperactivated GCN2c alleles were introduced intogcn2Δ yeast strains expressing either eIF2α-S51T (Thr-51), eIF2α-S51Y (Tyr-51), eIF2α-S51A (Ala-51), or wild-type eIF2α (Ser-51). Expression of the GCN2c-513 kinase or PKR was toxic in strains expressing either the Ser-51 or Thr-51 forms of eIF2α; however, the toxicity of the GCN2c kinase was slightly reduced in the Thr-51 strain (Fig.1, A and B, GCN3 sectors). In contrast, the eIF2α-S51A and eIF2α-S51Y mutations completely suppressed the toxic effects of the GCN2c and PKR kinases. Translational regulation by the eIF2α kinases is dependent on both phosphorylation of eIF2α and the ability of phosphorylated eIF2 to inhibit its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. The fact that expression of PKR and the other kinases showed no toxicity in the eIF2α-S51Y strain suggests two possibilities as follows: 1) these kinases fail to phosphorylate eIF2α-S51Y, or 2) the phosphorylated form of eIF2α-S51Y is a weaker inhibitor of eIF2B than phosphorylated wild-type eIF2α. This inhibition of eIF2B by phosphorylated eIF2 is dependent on the α subunit of eIF2B, encoded by GCN3 in yeast (2Hinnebusch A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Deletion of GCN3 suppressed the toxicity resulting from expression of GCN2c-513 or PKR in yeast strains expressing either the Ser-51 or Thr-51 forms of eIF2α (Fig. 1, A andB, gcn3Δ sectors). These results suggest that the GCN2c and PKR kinases efficiently phosphorylate eIF2α on Ser or Thr at residue 51 and that the phosphorylated forms of wild-type eIF2α and eIF2α-S51T inhibit translation via the same mechanism. A more sensitive assay of translational regulation in yeast is to monitor GCN4 expression. In wild-type strains phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 stimulates GCN4expression and enables cells to grow on medium containing 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), an inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis. Expression of GCN2 or HRI, but not the catalytically inactive HRI-K199R, conferred resistance to 3-AT in gcn2Δ strains expressing either the Ser-51 or Thr-51 forms of eIF2α but not in strains expressing eIF2α-S51A or eIF2α-S51Y (Fig. 1 C). High level expression of PKR was lethal in strains expressing wild-type eIF2α or eIF2α-S51T, independent of 3-AT (Fig. 1 C, left and right panels). In addition, expression of PKR, but not the catalytically inactive PKR-K296R, in eIF2α-S51Y strains conferred resistance to 3-AT, suggesting that PKR can phosphorylate eIF2α on Tyr at residue 51 and that phosphorylated eIF2α-S51Y can inhibit eIF2B and regulate GCN4 translation. Whereas the eIF2α-S51Y strain expressing HRI failed to grow on SGal (10% galactose) medium containing 3-AT (Fig. 1 C), it was partially resistant to 3-AT when grown on SR (2% raffinose) medium (data not shown). To provide a quantitative measure of the regulation of GCN4expression in the strains expressing the various eIF2α proteins and kinases, expression of a GCN4-lacZ reporter was assayed. For the GCN2 and GCN2c-513 kinases the induction ofGCN4-lacZ expression was similar in strains expressing either the Ser-51 or Thr-51 forms of eIF2α (Fig.2). However, GCN4 expression in the eIF2α-S51Y strain was almost identical to that observed in a strain expressing the non-phosphorylatable Ala-51 form of eIF2α. In strains expressing wild-type eIF2α, eIF2α-S51T, or eIF2α-S51Y, PKR generated 2–5-fold higher GCN4-lacZ expression than inactive PKR-K296R (Fig. 2). In addition, GCN4-lacZexpression was 2-fold higher in eIF2α-S51Y versuseIF2α-S51A strains expressing PKR. These results are consistent with the 3-AT-resistant phenotype noted for eIF2α-S51Y strains expressing PKR (Fig. 1 C) and support the idea that PKR can phosphorylate eIF2α on Tyr at residue 51. When analyzed by IEF-PAGE, eIF2α resolves as a doublet. The lower species of this doublet co-migrates with eIF2α from strains expressing mutant kinases or eIF2α-S51A and represents basal eIF2α, whereas the upper species of eIF2α is phosphorylated on residue 51 (7Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In IEF-PAGE analyses GCN2, GCN2c-516, and more active GCN2c-513 kinases were found to phosphorylate eIF2α on Ser or Thr but not Tyr or Ala at residue 51 (Fig. 3, A andB), consistent with the results of the genetic tests. In addition, phosphorylation of eIF2α was readily detected in strains expressing wild-type eIF2α, eIF2α-S51T, or eIF2α-S51Y and either PKR or HRI but not PKR-K296R or HRI-K199R (Fig. 3 C, upper panel, and data not shown). To confirm that PKR and HRI were phosphorylating eIF2α-S51Y on Tyr, a second IEF-PAGE analysis was performed. In yeast strains lacking the endogenous eIF2α kinase GCN2 and expressing either wild-type eIF2α or eIF2α-S51Y, the expression of wild-type PKR or HRI resulted in eIF2α focusing as a doublet on IEF gels (Fig.4, upper panel, lanes 2, 4, 5, and 7). When the same blot from Fig. 2(upper panel) was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 4, lower panel), cross-reactive bands were only detected in samples from strains expressing eIF2α-S51Y and a wild-type kinase. When the two blots (Fig. 4, upper andlower panels) were overlaid, the anti-phosphotyrosine cross-reactive species aligned perfectly with the upper, hyperphosphorylated form of eIF2α. These results confirmed that PKR and HRI were phosphorylating eIF2α-S51Y on Tyr and demonstrated thatin vivo these proteins possess Tyr kinase activity. Comparison of the ratio of the hyperphosphorylated to the basal form of wild-type eIF2α and eIF2α-S51Y in strains expressing PKR (see Fig.4, lanes 4 and 5; also Fig. 3 C, upper panel, 1st and 5th lanes) may suggest that eIF2α-S51Y is a poorer substrate for PKR than is wild-type eIF2α; however, alternative interpretations of these results are provided below. The inability to detect Tyr phosphorylation by GCN2 may suggest that GCN2 is an inherently less active kinase than HRI or PKR or that the GCN2 active site cannot accommodate a Tyr residue. Alternatively, it is likely that HRI and PKR were expressed at higher levels than GCN2 in these experiments, so it may be possible to detect Tyr kinase activity if we express GCN2 at higher levels in yeast cells. The expression of PKR is subject to negative translational autoregulation in both yeast (7Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian (1Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar) cells such that kinase expression is inversely related to its effects on cellular translational activity. For example, although PKR was expressed at lower levels than PKR-K296R in strains expressing wild-type eIF2α (Fig. 3 C, lower panel, 1st 2 lanes), this autoregulation was relieved in eIF2α-S51T strains and abolished in eIF2α-S51A and eIF2α-S51Y strains (Fig. 3 C, lower panel, last 6 lanes). In addition, whereas the GCN2c-513 kinase appeared to phosphorylate wild-type eIF2α and eIF2α-S51T to the same extent (Fig. 3 B), the eIF2α-S51T strain grew significantly better (Fig. 1). This lack of correlation between eIF2α phosphorylation and growth rate was also observed in eIF2α-S51Y strains expressing PKR as noted previously. These results are consistent with a model in which the phosphorylated forms of eIF2α-S51T and eIF2α-S51Y are weaker inhibitors of eIF2B than phosphorylated wild-type eIF2α. Finally, whereas the eIF2α, eIF2α-S51T, and eIF2α-S51Y proteins were phosphorylated to similar levels, it cannot be concluded that PKR and HRI are equally efficient at phosphorylating these three different amino acids at residue 51, because in vivo phosphorylation levels are dependent on the balance between kinase and phosphatase activities. As we do not know the identity or the efficiency of the phosphatases that dephosphorylate these three eIF2α proteins, we cannot at this time evaluate the relative efficiencies of PKR and HRI to phosphorylate eIF2α in vivo on Ser versus Thr or Tyr at residue 51. Previously it has been reported that mouse PKR, also known as TIK, can be detected in immunoblot assays using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (25Icely P.L. Gros P. Bergeron J.J.M. Devault A. Afar D.E.H. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16073-16077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if human PKR is also immunoreactive with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, wild-type human PKR and the inactive PKR-K296R proteins were expressed in E. coli, and crude protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-PKR or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.5 A (right panel), both wild-type PKR and the PKR-K296R mutant proteins were expressed inE. coli. When the same membrane was probed with affinity purified anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, cross-reactive species were detected in extracts prepared from cells expressing wild-type PKR but not PKR-K296R (Fig. 5 A, left panel). Similar results demonstrating that recombinant wild-type human and mouse PKR (TIK), but not catalytic mutants, cross-react with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were recently published during the course of these experiments (26Abraham N. Jaramillo M. Duncan P. Methot N. Icely P. Stojdl D. Barber G. Bell J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition to the prominent anti-phosphotyrosine antibody cross-reactive species co-migrating with PKR at ≈70 kDa, several larger proteins were detected (Fig. 5 A, left panel). This result suggests that PKR expressed in E. coli may autophosphorylate on Tyr and can also phosphorylate certain bacterial proteins on Tyr. To confirm that PKR was the major species cross-reacting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we performed immunoprecipitation reactions. As shown in Fig. 5 B (lanes 3 and6), recombinant PKR could be immunoprecipitated from both yeast and bacterial cell extracts using affinity purified anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. PKR was not precipitated when the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were omitted from the reactions (Fig.5 B, compare lanes 3 versus 2 and 6 versus 5). In addition, the precipitation was specific for functional PKR because the catalytically inactive PKR-K296R protein expressed in E. coli could not be precipitated using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3 and 4). As shown in Fig. 5 B (lanes 7–9), the endogenous PKR expressed in interferon-treated HeLa cells could also be immunoprecipitated using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Whereas these results suggest that PKR can autophosphorylate on Tyr, phosphoamino acid analyses of PKR isolated from in vivolabeled yeast and bacterial cells revealed phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, but not phosphotyrosine (data not shown). This latter result is consistent with the results of Icely et al. (25Icely P.L. Gros P. Bergeron J.J.M. Devault A. Afar D.E.H. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16073-16077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who could only find phosphoserine and phosphothreonine in mouse PKR despite the fact that mouse PKR also cross-reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Icely et al. (25Icely P.L. Gros P. Bergeron J.J.M. Devault A. Afar D.E.H. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16073-16077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) speculated that the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies may have recognized an unusual epitope on mouse PKR (25Icely P.L. Gros P. Bergeron J.J.M. Devault A. Afar D.E.H. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16073-16077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, negative results in phosphoamino acid analysis may reflect a low phosphorylation stoichiometry or a labile phosphotyrosine residue (27Lindberg R.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies may be over 100-fold more efficient at detecting phosphotyrosine than is phosphoamino acid analysis (28Lindberg R.A. Fischer W.H. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar). Due to these conflicting results and the plausible explanations for failure to detect phosphotyrosine in the phosphoamino acid analyses, we are unable to conclude whether human PKR autophosphorylates on Tyr. We have shown that the kinases PKR, HRI, and GCN2 can phosphorylate eIF2α on Ser or Thr at residue 51. In addition both PKR and HRI can phosphorylate eIF2α on Tyr at residue 51 in vivo. It is generally accepted that Ser and Thr kinases are structurally similar, and many kinases are known to phosphorylate both residues, so the finding that the eIF2α kinases could phosphorylate Thr in place of Ser-51 is not surprising. However, the phosphorylation of Tyr at residue 51 in eIF2α by PKR and HRI is unexpected. Two proposals can account for the Tyr phosphorylation activity by PKR and HRI. In the first proposal PKR and HRI would recognize eIF2α with high affinity and simply phosphorylate any hydroxyl group present at residue 51. Based on a mutational analysis of the vaccinia virus K3L protein, a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKR with homology to eIF2α, we have proposed that PKR utilizes a sequence element over 30 residues from the site of phosphorylation to recognize eIF2α (29Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Silverman J.B. Ung T.L. Dever T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4146-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, the ability of PKR to phosphorylate Tyr in place of Ser-51 in eIF2α simply reflects the strong contribution of this remote sequence for substrate recognition by PKR and the lack of specificity determinants around residue 51. Consistent with this idea, it has ben reported that the PKR and HRI phosphorylation of intact eIF2 is roughly 3 orders of magnitude more efficient than phosphorylation of a 12-residue synthetic peptide containing the Ser-51 phosphorylation site (30Mellor H. Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, regardless of how PKR initially recognizes eIF2α, it is important to note that the kinase active site must be able to accommodate both the alkyl hydroxyl groups of Ser and Thr and the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr. The crystal structures solved to date for both Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases suggest that these enzymes would be unable to phosphorylate substrates on the alternate phospho-accepting residue due principally to steric limitations (20Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has previously been shown that the p130gag-fps Tyr kinase could not phosphorylate Ser or Thr in place of an authentic Tyr phosphorylation site (18Weinmaster G. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 328-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that PKR and HRI possess a unique and more flexible structure as compared with the traditional Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases. The second proposal to account for the Tyr kinase activity of PKR and HRI is that these proteins are members of the class of dual specificity protein kinases. A number of kinases have been proposed to have dual specificity; however, the criteria used in making this assignment has not been standardized (27Lindberg R.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Douville E. Duncan P. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Cancer Metatasis Rev. 1994; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Several kinases autophosphorylate on both Tyr and Ser/Thr residues (27Lindberg R.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Douville E. Duncan P. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Cancer Metatasis Rev. 1994; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase (32Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) phosphorylates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases on both Tyr and Thr. The wee1 kinase, although structurally related to the Ser/Thr class of protein kinases, phosphorylates thecdc2 kinase on Tyr (27Lindberg R.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Myt1 kinase, identified in bothXenopus and humans and a member of the wee1family of kinases, phosphorylates Cdc2 on both Thr and Tyr (33Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar); and recently, Myt1 has also been shown to autophosphorylate in vitro on Ser, Thr, and Tyr (34Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In contrast to these kinases in which phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine or phosphothreonine was readily detected in substrate phosphorylation or autophosphorylation reactions, other proposed dual specificity kinases, including TIK (25Icely P.L. Gros P. Bergeron J.J.M. Devault A. Afar D.E.H. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16073-16077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PYT/ESK/TTK (28Lindberg R.A. Fischer W.H. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar), were identified based primarily on cross-reactivity with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. These kinases structurally resemble Ser/Thr kinases; however, when expressed in bacteria they cross-reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In this report we have demonstrated that human PKR (the TIK homolog) will also cross-react with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Whereas these results may suggest that PKR is a dual specificity kinase, it will be necessary to identify an in vivo substrate that PKR phosphorylates on Tyr to conclude convincingly that PKR is a member of the class of dual specificity protein kinases. The identification of Tyr and Thr kinase activity by PKR is very interesting in regards to alternative substrates and biological roles proposed for PKR. Although eIF2α is the only well characterized PKR substrate, and the regulation of translation is thought to be the primary function of PKR, recent reports suggest additional substrates and roles for PKR. PKR has been reported to phosphorylate IκB (13Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), HIV Tat (14McMillan N.A.J. Chun R.F. Siderovski D.P. Galabru J. Toone W.M. Samuel C.E. Mak T.W. Hovanessian A.G. Jeang K.

In addition, overexpression of catalytically inactive mutants of PKR leads to heightened viral sensitivity (35Der S.D. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). At least some of the effects of PKR on gene regulation do not appear to be mediated by changes in eIF2α phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of other proteins may mediate these effects (36Koromilas A.E.

Finally, mice deficient in PKR are impaired in cell signaling pathways including their interferon-γ and double-stranded RNA-induced antiviral response (11Yang Y.-L. Reis L.F.L. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A.

Our studies on eIF2α phosphorylation by PKR raise the possibility that PKR may have other substrates that it naturally phosphorylates on Thr or Tyr. As Tyr phosphorylation is a common step in cellular signal transduction pathways, it is tempting to speculate that the defects in signal transduction pathways and transcriptional regulation of gene expression associated with reduced PKR function are due to a loss of the PKR Tyr kinase activity. It will be interesting to identify these alternative PKR substrates and to determine if they are phosphorylated on Tyr, and thereby provide a physiological role for this unexpected Tyr kinase activity of PKR.

Although the transit peptide is both necessary and sufficient to direct precursor import into chloroplasts, the mature domain of some precursors has been shown to modulate targeting and translocation efficiency. To test the influence of the mature domain of the small subunit of Rubisco during import in vitro, the precursor (prSSU), the mature domain (mSSU), the transit peptide (SS-tp), and three C-terminal deletion mutants (Δ52, Δ67, and Δ74) of prSSU were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli.

Nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are predominantly synthesized as larger molecular weight precursors containing an N-terminal transit peptide. The transit peptide (tp)1 is a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence that mediates precursor binding and import into the chloroplast via an ATP-dependent mechanism. Following transport of the precursor through the chloroplast envelope, the transit peptide is cleaved by the stroma-processing peptidase to generate the mature protein. Transport of precursors across the chloroplast envelope has been shown to involve distinct protein complexes within the outer membrane (Toc, translocation apparatus of the outer membrane ofchloroplasts) and inner membrane (Tic,translocation apparatus of the inner membrane of chloroplasts) (1Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 2Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne G.v. Soll J.

Blobel G. Keegstra K. Kessler F. Ko K. Soll J. Trend. Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 303-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These two complexes are believed to interact at inter-membrane contact sites, which enables precursor translocation in a single coordinated step (5Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Bruce B.D. Keegstra K. Barber J. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology: Molecular Processes of Photosynthesis. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1994: 389-430Google Scholar). Recently, an inner membrane localized anion channel, PIRAC (Protein ImportRelated Anion Channel), has been shown to be involved in chloroplast protein import. PIRAC is a 50-picoSiemen anion channel that becomes inactivated during chloroplast protein transport via a mechanism that requires both a functional transit peptide and a stromal ATP source (7van den Wijngaard P.W. Vredenberg W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29430-29433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The exact role of PIRAC in protein import into the chloroplast is not defined as yet, however, at least three different mechanisms may explain channel inactivation: (i) PIRAC may function as the protein import channel in the inner membrane of chloroplasts, and inactivation represents a shift from ion conductance to protein conductance; (ii) PIRAC may be intimately associated with translocation components of the inner membrane such that a precursor-induced conformational change results in inactivation of the ion channel; or (iii) the formation of contact sites between Toc and Tic during translocation causes transient inactivation of the ion channel. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the precise role of PIRAC in protein import into the chloroplast. Current models suggest that transit peptides are both necessary and sufficient to direct the targeting and import of precursor proteins into the chloroplast. However, direct experimental evidence is not entirely consistent with these models. For example, the attachment of transit peptides to unrelated precursors confers proper targeting to some but not all proteins (8Wasmann C. Reiss B. Bartlett S. Bohnert H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 446-453Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Ahlquist P. Keegstra K. Plant Mol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13910-13916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, no common motif has been identified among the several hundred transit peptides that have been sequenced (12von Heijne G. Hirai T. Klšsgen R.B. Steppuhn J. Bruce B.D. Keegstra K. Herrmann R. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1991; 9: 104-126Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To explain this apparent enigma, it has been postulated that a common secondary or tertiary structure involving the mature domain might provide both targeting specificity and translocation efficiency (6Bruce B.D. Keegstra K. Barber J. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology: Molecular Processes of Photosynthesis. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1994: 389-430Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, chimeras constructed between the transit peptide and various portions of the mature domain have been shown to improve import efficiency (8Wasmann C. Reiss B. Bartlett S. Bohnert H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 446-453Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Kavanagh T.A. Jefferson R.A. Bevan M.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, deletion of C-terminal sequences from various precursors has been shown to interfere with one or more steps of the translocation pathway, depending on the precursor studied and the extent of the C-terminal deletion (11Ko K. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13910-13916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies collectively suggest that contributions from the mature domain play an important role in facilitating the interaction of transit peptides with the translocation apparatus. However, a more systematic and quantitative study is needed to identify mature domain sequences that directly influence chloroplast import. In this work, we have evaluated the import activity of the precursor to the small subunit of Rubisco (prSSU), the mature domain (mSSU), the full-length transit peptide, (SS-tp), and three prSSU mutants that lack 52, 67, or 74 C-terminal amino acids, respectively. Using these proteins as competitive inhibitors of the radiolabeled precursor during import, we demonstrated that the transit peptide is absolutely required for interaction with the translocation apparatus. However, a specific region within the mature domain strongly influences this interaction. In addition, we demonstrated that sequences within the C terminus of prSSU also influence the interaction between the transit peptide and PIRAC. The findings indicate that the C terminus of prSSU plays an important role in protein translocation. Dwarf pea seedlings (Pisum sativum, Laxton Progress number 9) were grown, and chloroplasts isolated as described by Bruce et al. (13Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Belgium1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). Chloroplasts for electrophysiology measurements were isolated from pea leaves by cutting with a razor blade in 2.5 mm Tes/KOH, pH 7.2, 225 mm sorbitol, 25 mm KCl, and 2 mm CaSO4. This preparation was transferred directly to a 2-ml chamber, which was mounted on a light microscope to allow visual selection of single intact chloroplasts. The full-length precursor was isolated from pET11-prSSU (14Klein R.R. Salvucci M.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using BamHI andNcoI, and subcloned into the same sites of pET23d (Novagen). Exonuclease III digestion was performed using the Erase-a-Base kit (Promega). To determine the extent of the deletions, direct colony polymerase chain reaction was performed using T7 promoter primers. Plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced in both directions using an ABI automated sequencer. Three deletion mutants, prSSΔ52 (Δ52), prSSΔ67 (Δ67), and prSSΔ74 (Δ74) were generated that lacked 52, 67, and 74 amino acids, respectively, at the C terminus. The Δ74 deletion contained an additional 6 amino acids (ATVVRM) at the C terminus due to read through into vector sequences. All other regions of the precursor were unchanged. Recombinant proteins were expressed and isolated from the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli as described by Pinnaduwage and Bruce (15Pinnaduwage P. Bruce B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32907-32915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The final inclusion body pellet was then solubilized in 8 m urea + 50 mm dithiothreitol. SS-tp was expressed and purified from the BL21 strain of E. coli as described by Pinnaduwage and Bruce (14Klein R.R. Salvucci M.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). prSSU and prSSU deletion proteins were in vivo radiolabeled inE. coli. The cells were grown for 8 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) without cysteine and methionine, followed by incubation with Tran35S-Label metabolic labeling reagent (ICN). The inclusion bodies were isolated using BugBusterTM protein extraction reagent (Novagen) and solubilized in 8 m urea + 50 mm dithiothreitol. Specific activity was 1–5 × 106 dpm/μg protein. Kinetic import assays were performed by incubating increasing concentrations of35S-labeled prSSU with freshly prepared chloroplasts (50 μg of chlorophyll) in the presence of 1× Import Buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0) containing 5 mm Mg-ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol. Urea concentration was kept constant at 300 mm and was shown not to affect import (data not shown). Addition of35S-prSSU started the assay. After 10 min at room temperature, the assay was terminated by rapid dilution in ice-cold 1× Import Buffer (5-fold) and immediately placing the samples on ice in the dark. Intact plastids were re-isolated according to Bruce et al. (13Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Belgium1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar) and were prepared for SDS-PAGE. Competition import assays were performed by incubating 100 nm35S-prSSU and increasing concentrations of cold competitor proteins with freshly prepared chloroplasts as described above. Competitions proceeded for 15 min at room temperature. To start the assay, 35S-prSSU and the competitor protein were added in rapid succession (<3 s between additions) (15Pinnaduwage P. Bruce B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32907-32915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Import assays were performed as described above. Time course import assays of 35S-precursors were performed using 300 nm of each precursor as described above. Assays were performed at room temperature in the dark. Addition of the35S-precursor started the assay, and 100-μl samples were removed at timed intervals, diluted 10-fold with ice-cold 1× Import Buffer, and placed on ice in the dark. Intact chloroplasts were re-isolated from each sample as described by Bruce et al. (13Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Belgium1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). These samples represent the re-purified chloroplast sample. Also at each time interval, 50 μl of the import reaction was removed and immediately mixed with 50 μl of 2× SB and boiled for 3 min. These samples represent the total import reaction. Data analysis was performed by electronic, filmless autoradiography (Instant-Imager, Packard Instruments), and quantification of signal by InstantImageranalysis software (Packard Instruments). Signals were reported as counts per minute (cpm) and converted to molecules of mSSU/chloroplast/min using the counting efficiency of the instrument, the specific activity of the precursor, the cysteines and methionines per molecule, the number of chloroplasts per ml of import reaction, and the length import time. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism™ (GraphPad Software, Inc.) computer software for enzyme kinetics and theKm and Vmax determined using nonlinear regression. These calculations were performed unless otherwise noted. For Dixon analysis, competition import reactions were performed as described above with either 60 nm or 180 nm35S-precursor plus increasing concentrations of cold competitor. Rates were calculated in molecules of mSSU/chloroplast/min as described above, and the inverse plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration. Determination ofKi values was performed by linear regression analysis of the plot of 1/V versus [I] at the two fixed prSSU concentrations where the intersection of the lines is given as −Ki. Standard patch clamp technique (16Hamill O. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15118) Google Scholar) was used to measure current across the chloroplast envelope. Electrodes were made from borosilicate glass by a two-step pull and extensively fire-polished. Electrodes were filled with buffer containing 2.5 mm Tes/KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm KCl, and 2 mm CaSO4, leading to a 10-fold KCl gradient. Electrode resistances were typically around 30 MΩ. To clarify the inactivation of PIRAC during protein import, proteins were added to the pipette filling solution (i.e. cytoplasmic equivalent) to a concentration of 50 nm. ATP was added to the bath solution (stroma equivalent) to 0.5 mm for >5 min before electrophysiological experiments were started. Currents were measured with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). The data were filtered at a cut-off frequency of 1 kHz, using an 8-pole Bessel filter (internal filter of the Axopatch 200B). The filtered data were digitized at 10 kHz using a CED 1401+ and analyzed with the Patch and Voltage Clamp software (Cambridge Electronic Design) (16Hamill O. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15118) Google Scholar). Potentials are given with regard to the pipette interior, the bath was kept at ground, using a 250 mm KCl agar bridge. To determine the distributions of open and closed time durations of PIRAC, a module was developed in the matrix-calculating software Matlab (Mathworks, Inc.). This module uses the 50% threshold method to identify transitions of the channel between the open and the closed state. The distributions were fitted with multiexponential probability density functions using the maximum likelihood method (17Colquhoun D. Sigworth F. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1995: 483-587Google Scholar). Purified proteins were quantified by commercial Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Quantification of total chloroplast protein was performed using the BCA protein quantification assay (Pierce). To determine the effect of prSSU C-terminal sequences in chloroplast protein import, serial C-terminal deletions were generated and characterized. Out of the several hundred clones originally generated, only a small subset was characterized further, based on deletion length and ease of purification from inclusion bodies when expressed inE. coli (data not shown). The location and size of these deletions are shown in Fig. 1. Variants of prSSU that lack 52, 67, and 74 amino acids at the C terminus were denoted Δ52, Δ67, and Δ74. We were unable to detect a deletion that yielded an insoluble protein shorter in length than the Δ74 deletion, suggesting that sequences within this region are directly involved in inclusion body formation. The purification of prSSU, mSSU, GST-tp, and SS-tp was reported previously (15Pinnaduwage P. Bruce B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32907-32915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The Δ52, Δ67, and Δ74 deletions were isolated by a similar method and analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The apparent molecular masses of Δ52, Δ67, and Δ74 are 18.9, 16.7, and 9.8 kDa, respectively, which differ from the calculated molecular masses of 15.3, 12.5, and 11.6 kDa, respectively, for the deletions. We have no explanation for these abnormal electrophoretic mobilities.Figure 2Purification of E. coliexpressed prSSU, mSSU, Δ52, Δ67, Δ74, GST-tp, and SS-tp.

The amount of 35S-prSSU substrate was varied from 10 nm to 1.6 μm in a 10-min in vitro import assay (Fig.3 A). This time point was within the linear range of the time course of import (data not shown). Three independent import assays were performed and the amount of mSSU product was directly quantified (Fig. 3 B). The average product formed at each substrate concentration was analyzed by nonlinear regression (Fig. 3 B), which permitted the determination of Km (282 ± 55 nm) and Vmax (∼9,887 ± 735 molecules of mSSU/chloroplasts/min) values. Although the Km did not deviate significantly between separate chloroplast preparations, the Vmax was found to vary between chloroplast preparations by ∼2-fold. To determine which sequences of prSSU are both necessary and sufficient for chloroplast import, purified prSSU, mSSU, GST-tp, and SS-tp were used as competitive inhibitors of35S-prSSU import in vitro. The concentration of35S-prSSU used in the competition assays was 100 nm, which is well below the measured Km. Fig. 4 A illustrates representative import assays for each competitor, and direct quantification of three independent assays for each competitor is shown in Fig. 4 B. Both mSSU and GST-tp failed to inhibit import of35S-prSSU, even at the highest concentrations tested. The inability of GST-tp to compete for the import of prSSU suggests that the transit peptide requires a free N terminus to productively engage the translocation apparatus. Because both prSSU and its full-length transit peptide effectively compete for import (Fig. 4 A), these data clearly indicate that transit peptide is both necessary and sufficient to direct import into chloroplasts in vitro.However, the IC50 for SS-tp (570 ± 111 nm) was higher than the IC50 for unlabeled prSSU (80 ± 15 nm), indicating that the transit peptide alone engages the import machinery less effectively than the full-length precursor. Taken together, these data suggest that sequences in the mature domain of prSSU act in cis to modulate or enhance the import activity of the transit peptide. To identify the regions within the mature domain of prSSU that facilitate import, prSSU C-terminal deletions (Δ52, Δ67, and Δ74) were used as competitive inhibitors in35S-prSSU import assays. All three deletions were tested with the same preparation of chloroplasts to minimize experimental variability. Decreasing levels of mSSU accumulation with increasing competitor concentration indicated that all three precursor mutants were able to compete with 35S-prSSU for import into the chloroplast (Fig. 5 A). However, the longer precursor mutants competed more effectively than the shorter mutants. Quantification of three independent experiments (Fig. 5 B) resulted in IC50 calculations of 33 ± 15.3, 145 ± 26.9, and 305 ± 40.8 nmfor the Δ52, Δ67, and Δ74 mutants, respectively. Plotting these values as a function of mature domain length illustrates the relationship between precursor length and activity as a competitive inhibitor (Fig. 6). Although removal of the last 52 amino acids from the C terminus of prSSU only slightly changes the affinity of the precursor for the translocation apparatus, removal of an additional 15 amino acids increases the IC50from 33 ± 15.3 nm to 145 ± 26.9 nmand removal of an additional seven amino acids increases the IC50 further to 305 ± 40.8 nm. These findings suggest that sequences between the C termini of the Δ52 and Δ74 mutants contribute significantly to the process of chloroplast protein targeting/translocation.Figure 6Relationship of mature domain length and IC50. Plot of IC50 of competitor as a function of length of the mature domain of SS-tp (2 amino acids in mature domain), Δ74 (46 amino acids in mature domain), Δ67 (53 amino acids in mature domain), Δ52 (68 amino acids in mature domain), and prSSU (120 amino acids in mature domain), and their respective IC50 values from Table I.

Data are presented as mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the inhibition constant, Ki, for prSSU and the three C-terminal deletion mutants, Dixon analysis was performed using 35S-prSSU as substrate and unlabeled prSSU, Δ52, Δ67, or Δ74 as competitive inhibitors of import. 35S-prSSU was fixed at 60 and 180 nm, and the inhibitor concentration was varied from 50 nm to 1.2 μm (Fig.7 A). Data were fit by linear regression (Fig. 7 B) and the intersection point of the lines is defined as −Ki. The Ki values for prSSU (105 nm), Δ52 (66 nm), Δ67 (110 nm), and Δ74 (437 nm) are consistent with the IC50 values for each competitor (TableI). Successive deletion of sequences within the prSSU mature domain results in less effective import inhibition, suggesting that an element within the mature domain modulates targeting and/or translocation efficiency.Table IInhibition of import is affected by regions in the mature domainCompetitorIC50KinmControlNot applicableNot applicablemSSUNo inhibitionNo inhibitionprSSU80105.1prSSΔ523366.2prSSΔ67145110.0prSSΔ74305436.5SS-tp570NDaND, not determined.GST-tpNo inhibitionNo inhibitionComparison of precursor length and import competence.

Ki is defined as the concentration of competitor required to bind half the total binding sites on an enzyme at equilibrium in the absence of substrate. Attenuated import competition by the prSSU deletion mutants could result from disrupted binding at the chloroplast surface, impaired translocation through Toc and Tic, or some combination of these processes. To explore a binding-specific effect, binding studies were performed with prSSU and the precursor mutants at low levels of ATP (data not shown). The binding results demonstrated that removal of 52, 67, and 74 amino acids from the C terminus did not significantly affect binding of these precursors to the chloroplast presumably via Toc components. Except for mSSU and GST-tp, all of the proteins tested have been shown to compete for the import of 35S-prSSU. To directly determine whether the C-terminal deletion mutants of prSSU are competent for chloroplast import in vitro, the truncated precursors were metabolically labeled with 35S and used as substrates in import time course experiments. Monitoring the level of35S-labeled protein remaining in both the reaction mixture and within re-isolated chloroplasts permits direct quantification of the substrate remaining at each time point, as well as the amount of imported/processed mature form. In this way, both the import rate and the extent of mSSU accumulation for each precursor may be determined and directly compared. The four autoradiogram panels on the left of Fig.8 A indicate the precursor pool size remaining in each import reaction as a function of import time. Quantification of these data are shown in Fig. 8 B, where the amount of precursor was normalized to the 1 min time point allowing comparison between the different precursors. All four proteins, prSSU, Δ52, Δ67, and Δ74, were imported at a similar rate, as seen in Fig. 8 A and quantified in Fig. 8 B. Re-isolation of the chloroplasts, however, demonstrated that only full-length prSSU and the Δ52 precursor imported and accumulated as mature processed proteins. Although the level of Δ67 and Δ74 precursors clearly decreased as a function of import time, these mutants failed to accumulate to detectable levels as a processed form in the stroma. Taken together, these results indicate that all four precursor proteins import successfully into the chloroplast but that the Δ67 and Δ74 truncated precursors are subject to rapid degradation following import. Neither the identity nor the sub-organellar location of the protease responsible for this degradation is known. Thus far, we have demonstrated that sequences within the mature domain of prSSU enhance the efficiency of transit peptide-mediated import into chloroplasts. These findings implicate an interaction of the precursor with transport complexes, Toc and Tic. However, the anion channel, PIRAC, is also involved in chloroplast protein import since a functional transit peptide and full-length precursor have been shown to inactivate the channel (18van den Wijngaard P. Dabney-Smith C. Bruce B. Vredenberg W. Biophys. J. 1999; PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether precursor interaction with PIRAC is also modulated by sequences in the mature domain, single channel recordings of PIRAC conductance were measured in the presence of prSSU, mSSU, and the prSSU C-terminal deletion mutants. Fig. 9 Ashows the single channel recordings of PIRAC conductance for a control excised patch and for an excised patch after protein addition. Fig.9 B represents the all points amplitude histogram of these recordings. Addition of prSSU to the envelope patch decreases the open probability (PO) of the channel from 0.81 ± 0.04 in the control situation to 0.17 ± 0.08, indicating that prSSU induces channel inactivation. In contrast, addition of mSSU induced no significant change in PIRAC activity, as indicated directly in Fig. 9 A, and in the failure of this protein to decrease the PO measured in the all points amplitude histogram in Fig. 9 B. The deletion mutants of prSSU, however, induced PIRAC inactivation in a manner that was proportional to the length of the mature domain of the precursor. ThePO of PIRAC in the presence of Δ52, Δ67, and Δ74 was 0.45 ± 0.07, 0.53 ± 0.07, and 0.71 ± 0.07, respectively (Table II). These data indicate that the transit peptide is necessary for PIRAC inactivation, as was shown previously (7van den Wijngaard P.W. Vreden"
https://openalex.org/W2141108470,"Alx4 is a paired class homeodomain protein involved in defining anterior/posterior polarity in the developing limb bud. The paired class of homeodomain proteins cooperatively bind palindromic DNA elements as homodimers or as heterodimers with other paired homeodomain proteins. Previous characterization demonstrates that the strength of the cooperativity as well as the preference for targets is dictated largely by the identity of amino acid 50 of the homeodomain. Here we compare and contrast the DNA binding properties of a glutamine 50 paired homeodomain protein, Alx4, and a lysine 50 paired homeodomain protein, Goosecoid. We demonstrate that Alx4 homodimers, Gsc homodimers, and Alx4/Gsc heterodimers each have distinct DNA binding properties, and each can discriminate between highly related palindromic elements. Using reporter gene assays, we show that Alx4 activates transcription in a site-specific manner, and that Gsc is capable of antagonizing Alx4-mediated activation only from promoter elements that support heterodimer formation. These data demonstrate that paired homeodomain proteins with different DNA binding properties are able to form heterodimeric complexes with unique DNA binding and transcriptional activities. Thus, heterodimerization regulates the DNA binding specificity of these transcription factors and may partially explain how paired homeodomain proteins direct specific developmental functions.

Classical developmental studies in avian systems have provided a foundation for understanding this process by defining three major signaling centers within the developing limb bud: 1) the apical ectodermal ridge, a region of specialized epithelial cells at the distal margin of the limb bud; 2) the dorsal ectoderm; and 3) the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA),1 a group of mesenchymal cells in the posterior aspect of the limb bud. These signaling centers are derived from both epithelial and mesenchymal cells and form a series of interdependent feedback loops such that this system also serves as a model for understanding epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Tickle C. Eichele G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 121-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and 2Johnson R.L. Tabin C.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The establishment of anterior-posterior (A/P) polarity in the limb bud is controlled largely by the ZPA. The ZPA was initially defined by studies in which explants of cells from various regions of a donor limb bud were grafted to the anterior margin of a recipient limb bud. When posterior mesenchymal cells of the donor limb bud are grafted onto the anterior margin of the recipient limb bud, the resulting limb displays A/P axis duplications (3Saunders J.W. Gassling M.T. Fleischmajor R. Billingham R.F. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Interactions. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1968Google Scholar). These duplications are marked by the appearance of additional anterior digits with posterior characteristics (preaxial polydactyly). This is a dose-dependent phenomenon; more ZPA cells grafted to the anterior margin result in a greater number of ectopic digits. The ZPA does not contribute tissue to the digits, but instead serves as an organizer that patterns surrounding tissue. Two lines of evidence suggest that the key molecule mediating the polarizing activity of the ZPA is Sonic hedgehog (Shh). 1) Shh expression coincides with cells that have polarizing activity, both in the limb and in other tissues; and 2) direct application of Shh to the anterior margin of a limb bud results in digit duplications in a dose-dependent fashion (4Riddle R.D. Johnson R.L. Laufer E. Tabin C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 5Chang D.T. Lopez A. von Kessler D.P. Chiang C. Simandl B.K. Zhao R. Seldin M.F. Fallon J.F. Beachy P.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3339-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified and characterized a novel homeodomain protein, aristaless-like 4 (Alx4) (6Qu S. Li L. Wisdom R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 203: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Qu S. Niswender K.D. Ji Q. van der Meer R. Keeney D. Magnuson M.A. Wisdom R. Development. 1997; 124: 3999-4008PubMed Google Scholar). In wild-type embryos, Alx4 is expressed in the anterior mesenchyme of the limb bud. Mice that are homozygous for a null Alx4 allele exhibit preaxial polydactyly that is associated with ectopic Shh expression along the anterior margin of the limb bud during development. Genes previously demonstrated to be downstream targets of the Shh signaling pathway in the limb bud, such as patched and HoxD13, are misexpressed in the anterior mesenchyme of the limb bud as well (7Qu S. Niswender K.D. Ji Q. van der Meer R. Keeney D. Magnuson M.A. Wisdom R. Development. 1997; 124: 3999-4008PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that although Alx4 is not required for normal ZPA formation, it is required to prevent an ectopic anterior ZPA from forming. Although several polydactylous mouse mutants have been shown to misexpress Shh at the anterior margin of the limb bud, the genes responsible have been identified in only two cases. Alx4mutations are known to be responsible for the defects inStrong's luxoid, and Gli3 is disrupted in the mutant Extra toes (8Hui C.C. Joyner A.L. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 9Vortkamp A. Gessler M. Grzeschik K.H. Nature. 1991; 352: 539-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism by which Alx4 regulates A/P polarity in the limb, a detailed characterization of its biochemical and molecular properties is required. The most outstanding structural feature of Alx4 is the presence of a homeodomain, an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding motif shared by a large family of eukaryotic transcription factors. Genetic experiments demonstrate that these proteins play fundamental roles rooted in the establishment of cell identity or position. Furthermore, these experiments indicate that, in most cases, the homeodomain is necessary for function and biologic specificity (10Duboule D. Tooze S.A. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 3-10Google Scholar, 11Duncan I. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Miskiewicz P. Morrissey D. Lan Y. Raj L. Kessler S. Fujioka M. Goto T. Weir M. Development. 1996; 122: 2709-2718PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the diverse roles that homeodomain proteins play biologically, early molecular characterizations indicated that most bind a similar 5–6-base pair A-T-rich DNA element (13Hoey T. Levine M. Nature. 1988; 332: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It seems implausible that this mode of DNA binding can accommodate the diverse functional specificity implied by the genetic data (for a review, see Ref. 14Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell III, G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar; for an alternative view, see Ref. 15Biggin M.D. McGinnis W. Development. 1997; 124: 4425-4433PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that several classes of homeodomain proteins are able to generate target site specificity by forming heterodimeric DNA binding complexes with other proteins (16Ryan A.K.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Alx4 belongs to the paired class of homeodomain (prd HD) proteins. One mechanism by which prd HD proteins generate target site specificity is by binding DNA as cooperative homodimers. The target elements consist of palindromic repeats of the sequence 5′-TAAT-3′ (P elements) separated by a variable number of nucleotides. Physical and biochemical experiments have shown that the prd HD is both necessary and sufficient for this activity. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that a major determinant of the DNA binding properties exhibited by prd HD proteins is the identity of residue 50 within the homeodomain (22Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Amino acid 50 resides within the DNA recognition helix of the homeodomain, and crystallographic studies reveal that this residue mediates contacts with the nucleotide bases immediately 3′ to the 5′-TAAT-3′ target site (25Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Members of the prd class of HDs have either a serine (Ser-50), lysine (Lys-50) or glutamine (Gln-50) at position 50, and each subclass has unique DNA binding properties (22Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The Ser-50 subclass of prd HD proteins preferentially dimerizes on P elements in which the palindromic half-sites are separated by two intervening nucleotides (5′-TAAT NN ATTA-3′; P2 sites). Representative members of this subclass are encoded by the paired(prd) gene from Drosophila (26Bopp D. Burri M. Baumgartner S. Frigerio G. Noll M. Cell. 1986; 47: 1033-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and the vertebrate Pax genes (27Gruss P. Walther C. Cell. 1992; 69: 719-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In addition to the homeodomain, this subclass is characterized by the presence of a second DNA binding motif, the paired domain, which expands the repertoire of DNA target elements with which these proteins can interact (28Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The Lys-50 subclass of prd HDs selectively forms dimers on P elements separated by three intervening nucleotides (P3 elements), with a strong preference for cytosines 3′ to each core half-site, i.e. 5′-TAAT CCG ATTA-3′ (P3C). The half-site comprising this element (5′-TAAT CC-3′) is also recognized by Lys-50 homeodomain monomers from other classes, such as bicoid (28Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 29Hanes S.D. Brent R. Science. 1991; 251: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The Gln-50 subclass preferentially binds P3 sites as well, but has a less stringent requirement for particular residues 3′ to each TAAT half-site. In addition to the differences in target site specificity, the Lys-50 and Gln-50 prd HDs differ in one other aspect; the Gln-50 subclass binds approximately 15-fold more cooperatively to palindromic P3 elements than does the Lys-50 subclass. Cooperativity is defined as the extent to which binding to the first half-site enhances binding to the second half-site, and can be represented by the cooperativity coefficient, τ. Previous τ measurements indicate that for the Lys-50 subclass, τ ≈ 20, while for Gln-50 prd HD proteins, τ ≈ 300 (22Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Many of the vertebrate genes encoding prd HD proteins show overlapping expression patterns; in particular, expression of a large number of these genes, including Alx4, Alx3, Cart1, Prx1, Prx2, and Gsc, has been detected in mesenchymal cells of both the limb bud and the first branchial arch (6Qu S.

Given the previously described DNA binding properties of the prd HD, as well as the ability of prd HD proteins to form heterodimeric complexes with one other, functional and genetic redundancy is possible. Consistent with this model, we have previously shown that the Cart1 gene, which encodes the closest identified relative of Alx4, functions as a dose-dependent enhancer of the polydactyly observed in Alx4 mutant mice (36Qu S. Tucker S.C. Zhao Q. deCrombrugghe B. Wisdom R. Development. 1999; 126: 359-369PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of double mutant animals revealed a role for both Alx4 and Cart1 in patterning structures derived from the first branchial arch, a result that is consistent with the high levels of expression of both genes at this site during development (6Qu S. Li L. Wisdom R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 203: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Gaunt S.J. Blum M. De Robertis E.M. Development. 1993; 117: 769-778PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zhao G.Q.

Thus, genetic evidence suggests that an understanding of the molecular basis of Alx4 function will need to account for the activities of other prd HD proteins that are co-expressed during development. Although previous studies demonstrated that the ability to bind palindromic response elements is a property of many, if not all, prd HD proteins, there is also evidence for functional specificity. As described above, the Gln-50 and Lys-50 prd HD proteins have been shown to have similar, yet distinct, DNA binding preferences. The fact that over 30 vertebrate proteins belong to the prd HD family suggests that, in addition to differential expression patterns, other mechanisms for providing functional specificity within the class may exist. One unexplored possibility is that members of separate prd HD subclasses form heterodimeric complexes with distinct DNA binding and transcriptional properties. The presence of both activators and repressors within the prd HD class could add further complexity to such a mechanism. The Lys-50 prd HD protein Goosecoid (Gsc) is expressed in mesenchymal cells of the limb bud and first branchial arch in domains that broadly overlap those of Alx4 (34Gaunt S.J. Blum M. De Robertis E.M. Development. 1993; 117: 769-778PubMed Google Scholar). 2S. C. Tucker and R. Wisdom, unpublished observations.2S. C. Tucker and R. Wisdom, unpublished observations.This protein is of particular interest for two reasons. First, the gsc protein of Drosophila has been shown to function as a transcriptional repressor and antagonist of the Lys-50 activator orthodenticle (otd) (37Mailhos C. Andre S. Mollereau B. Goriely A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Desplan C. Development. 1998; 125: 937-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, mice homozygous for a targeted loss of function allele of Gsc display defects in structures that are also affected by Alx4 mutations, including the skull, mandible, and limb (37Mailhos C. Andre S. Mollereau B. Goriely A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Desplan C. Development. 1998; 125: 937-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rivera-Perez J.A. Mallo M. Gendron-Maguire M. Gridley T. Behringer R.R. Development. 1995; 121: 3005-3012PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present a characterization of the DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory properties of Alx4 and Gsc. We find that Alx4 homodimers, Gsc homodimers, and Alx4/Gsc heterodimers all display unique DNA binding properties. Each of these complexes differentiate between P3 elements based on the nucleotides separating the palindromic half-sites. Thus, the selective homo- and heterodimerization of prd HD proteins converts the generic P3 element into a family of related elements, each capable of providing unique transcriptional responses in the presence of Gln-50 and Lys-50 prd HD proteins. These results have implications for understanding the developmental specificity demonstrated by prd HD proteins. Peptides containing the homeodomains of Alx4 (residues 185–265), Gsc (residues 159–219), Msx1 (residues 163–226), and Cart1 (128–195) were expressed as (His)6-tagged peptides in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified to homogeneity by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described previously (40Qu S.

Unc4 protein was prepared similarly and was a generous gift of David Miller and Kim Liptig. Gel shift reactions contained 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmEDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.8 μg of dI-dC, 4 mmspermidine, 4 mm spermine, 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 7.5% glycerol. Where indicated (Figs. 3 and 4), low dose gel shifts contained 5 nm protein and high dose gel shifts 20 nm protein. After incubation on ice for 10 min, 32P-labeled probe was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before separation on 7% polyacrylamide gels that contained 0.5× TBE. In competition experiments, a 20-fold molar excess of the competing oligonucleotide was added during the preincubation phase. In preliminary experiments, DNA binding was shown to be dependent on protein concentration. The sequence of the gel shift probes is shown (top strand with TAAT repeats in bold): P1/2C, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATCTGAGGACTGTACA-3′; P2C, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATCGATTACTGTACA-3′; P3C, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATCCGATTACTGTACA-3′; P4C, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATCCGGATTACTGTACA-3′; P5C, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATCCTGGATTACTGTACA-3′; P3Cmut, 5′-CCTGAGAATGGTCCGAGGACTGTACA-3′; P3A, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATAGTATTACTGTACA-3′; P3G, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATGGCATTACTGTACA-3′; P3T, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATTGAATTACTGTACA-3′; P3TTC, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATTTCATTACTGTACA-3′; P3TGG, 5′-CCTGAGAATAATTGGATTACTGTACA-3′.Figure 4Gsc preferentially binds P3C.

Dried gels were scanned and the relevant bands quantitated.

Using the PhosphorImager to quantitate bands representing the relevant complexes, τ can be calculated via Equation 1.τ=Kd2/Kd1=4[P2D][D]/[PD]2(Eq. 1) τ measurements were made from lanes in which approximately 50% of the probe was shifted and represent an average from three independent experiments with a deviation of less than 15% (for details, see Ref. 22Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Three copies of the relevant sequences were cloned upstream of a basal promoter (from the adenovirus E1b gene) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the plasmid pE1b-CAT to generate the indicated reporters (P3C-CAT, P3TTC-CAT, etc.). The Alx4 expression plasmid pCMX-Alx4 has previously been described (40Qu S. Tucker S.C. Ehrlich J.S. Levorse J.M. Flaherty L.A. Wisdom R. Vogt T.F. Development. 1998; 125: 2711-2721PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse Gsc cDNA with a hemagglutinin tag was cloned into pCMX (41Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar) to generate the expression plasmid pCMX-Gsc. Transient transfections utilized 0.1 μg (Fig. 2 A) or 0.5 μg of the indicated reporter construct, 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the indicated amounts of expression plasmids; the total amount of expression plasmid DNA was held constant by the addition of empty vector. DNA samples were transfected into 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.); in preliminary experiments, it was shown that 293 cells do not express either Alx4 or Gsc, do not harbor P3 DNA binding activity, and do not efficiently express any of the indicated reporter constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, lysates were made and CAT and β-galactosidase activities were determined by previously described methods and represent an average of at least three independent experiments that deviate by less that 15%. Alx4 is a member of the prd class of homeobox genes. It has been previously demonstrated that prd class HD proteins bind preferentially and with high affinity as cooperative homodimers to palindromic repeats of the sequence 5′-TAAT-3′. The preferred spacing of the palindromes is dictated in large part by residue 50 of the homeodomain, such that prd HDs bearing a glutamine or a lysine at position 50 (Gln-50 or Lys-50) prefer P3 elements (5′-TAAT NNN ATTA-3′), while Ser-50 prd HDs prefer P2 elements (5′-TAAT NN ATTA-3′) (22Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Alx4 contains a Gln-50 HD and therefore is predicted to bind P3 elements. To test this prediction, gel shift assays were performed using probes containing TAAT repeats separated by a variable number of nucleotides (Fig. 1 B). In these experiments, we used a recombinant Alx4 peptide fragment containing the HD that was expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity via nickel agarose chromatography (Fig. 1 A). Alx4 bound all of the indicated probes to some extent (Fig.1 C). Migration of monomeric protein-DNA complexes is defined by binding to P1/2C, which contains a single half-site (Fig.1 C, lanes 2–4), and the more slowly migrating species on other probes represents dimeric binding. The prd HD is known to exist as a monomer in solution and interact with DNA in a stepwise fashion resulting in dimeric protein-DNA complexes (22Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, the overall binding affinity is a function of the affinity of peptide monomers for the first half-site and the enhanced affinity for a monomeric peptide binding the second half-site. The -fold increase for the second binding event is defined as the cooperativity coefficient, τ (see “Experimental Procedures”). Measurements of τ in this and similar experiments indicated that cooperativity is greatest on the P3C site where τ ≈ 300; on P2C and P4C sites, τ ≈ 20; and binding was noncooperative on P5C. These results are consistent with values previously reported for other Gln-50 prd HD proteins (22Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The preference for P3 elements was further demonstrated by a competition experiment in which binding of Alx4 to P3C was competed by a 20-fold excess of cold P3C probe (Fig. 1 D, lane 3), but not P1/2C, P2C, P4C, or P5C (Fig.1 D, lanes 4–7). To ensure that the DNA binding properties observed for the recombinant peptide fragment are shared by full-length Alx4, nuclear extracts were made from 293 cells transiently transfected with either pCMX-Alx4 or empty vector. These extracts were then used in gel shift assays along with the same series of P element probes. An Alx4-specific gel shift was detected only on the P3C probe (Fig. 1 E, lane 9). Because of the decreased mobility of protein-DNA complexes with full-length Alx4, dimeric and monomeric complexes could not be resolved. The P3C-specific binding observed with the full-length protein is in contrast to the previous series of gel shifts in which the recombinant Alx4 peptide bound all sites tested. This difference is most likely due to the fact that lower levels of Alx4 protein are present in the nuclear extracts. Consistent with this idea, gel shifts of the various P element probes at intermediate doses of recombinant peptide indicate that dimeric binding was detected only on the P3C site (Fig. 1 C, compare lane 11 tolanes 3, 7, 15, and19). This suggests that the binding activity detected on sites that lack the P3 spacing require amounts of protein greater than that expressed in transfected 293 cells, and therefore high affinity cooperative dimerization on P3 sites may be the only binding event that occurs in vivo. To test the possibility that the DNA binding activity described in Fig. 1 can result in transactivation, a series of synthetic reporter constructs were utilized. The various P elements used in DNA binding assays (see Fig. 1 B) were cloned in triplicate upstream of a basal E1b promoter driving (CAT expression. Transient cotransfections were performed in 293 cells using the P element reporters with or without pCMX-Alx4. Reporter gene activity was detected only on the P3C reporter (P3C-CAT) (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). This activation was dependent on the dose of pCMX-Alx4 to a maximal activation observed at 100 ng of input plasmid. At higher doses, the level of activation declined, probably due to squelching effects. These results suggest that high affinity, cooperative DNA binding is required for transcriptional activation and that the non-cooperative and weakly cooperative binding detected in vitro are not sufficient to mediate a biologic response. The P3 elements were previously identified as binding sites for prd HD proteins using a polymerase chain reaction-based site selection technique, which over several rounds of selection and enrichment generates a consensus site (48Gehring W.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 135: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, this method may fail to identify potential target elements with a lower binding affinity, or become biased against some high affinity sites. Since the ability of Alx4 to bind different P3 elements as homodimers is determined, in part, by the intrinsic affinity for different half-sites, we defined the half-site preference for Alx4 by varying the nucleotide immediately 3′ to the core TAAT half-site. Using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing P1/2 sites as probes (Fig.3 A, top), we performed gel shifts with two doses of Alx4 peptide. At lower doses (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1, 3,5, and 7), Alx4 bound to P1/2C and P1/2T only. A 4-fold higher concentration of peptide (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and8) resulted in binding to all sites, with binding to P1/2C and P1/2T greater than that of P1/2A and P1/2G. Therefore, the preferred half-site can be represented as 5′-TAAT Py-3′. We went on to compare Alx4 binding to a series of idealized P3 elements in which the nucleotides separa"

The expressed G1-G2 bound to both hyaluronan and link protein indicating that the immunoglobulin-fold motif and proteoglycan tandem repeat loops of the G1 domain were correctly folded. Further analysis of secondary structure by rotary shadowing electron microscopy confirmed a double globe appearance, but revealed that the rG1-G2 was more compact than its native counterpart. The size of rG1-G2 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electorphoresis was unchanged following digestion with keratanase and keratanase II and reduced by only 2–5 kDa following digestion with either O-glycosidase or N-glycosidase F. Recombinant G1-G2 was digested with purified matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), isolated aggrecanase, purified atrolysin C, or proteinases present in conditioned medium from cartilage explant cultures, and the products analyzed on SDS gels by silver stain and immunoblotting. Neoepitope antibodies recognizing the N-terminal F342FGVG or C-terminal DIPEN341 sequences were used to confirm MMP cleavage at the Asn341 ↓ Phe bond, while neoepitope antibodies recognizing the N-terminal A374RGSV or C-terminal ITEGE373 sequences were used to confirm aggrecanase cleavage at the Glu373 ↓ Ala bond. Cleavage at the authentic MMP and aggrecanase sites revealed that these proteinases have the same specificity for rG1-G2 as for native aggrecan. Incubation of rG1-G2 with conditioned medium from porcine cartilage cultures revealed that active soluble aggrecanase but no active MMPs, was released following stimulation with interleukin-1α or retinoic acid. Atrolysin C, which cleaves native bovine aggrecan at both the aggrecanase and MMP sites, efficiently cleaved rG1-G2 at the aggrecanase site but failed to cleave at the MMP site. In contrast, native glycosylated G1-G2 with or without keratanase treatment was cleaved by atrolysin C at both the aggrecanase and MMP sites.

It is present in cartilage as large multimolecular aggregates bound noncovalently to hyaluronan (HA).1 Aggregate formation is mediated via the proteoglycan tandem repeat loops in the N-terminal G1 domain which bind to decasaccharide units within the polymeric HA. This binding is further stabilized by link protein, which binds to form stable trimeric complexes. The formation of large aggregate structures provides a mechanism for trapping aggrecan in the tissue and preventing its loss by diffusion. A major feature of the pathology of arthritis is the gradual loss of aggrecan from the cartilage matrix. This loss involves proteolysis of the core protein and release into culture medium (1Ratcliffe A. Tyler J.A. Hardingham T.E. Biochem.

However, the relative contribution of aggrecanase and MMPs to aggrecan turnover has not been quantitated, nor is it clear whether one activity is more predominant in normal catabolism and the other more so in pathology. Most studies have been done with animal tissue but the relative involvement of MMPs and aggrecanase appears to differ between species (31Hughes C.E. Little C.B. Büttner F.H. Bartnik E. Caterson B.

In this paper we describe production of a human rG1-G2 fragment. The rG1-G2 retains its functional properties of binding to hyaluronan and link protein and exhibits a typical double globe structure. The rG1-G2 is cleavedin vitro by aggrecanase and MMPs at the authentic Glu373 ↓ Ala and Asn341 ↓ Phe bonds, respectively, and therefore represents a valuable substrate for studying the role of these enzymes in cell-mediated aggrecanolysis.

All other reagents were of analytical grade. A cDNA clone pSA005 (4Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the signal peptide sequence, the G1 and G2 globular domains, and the IGD of human aggrecan (nucleotides 61–2090) was modified by polymerase chain reaction to include a polyhistidine tag, a stop codon, and an EcoRI restriction site at the 3′ end. Primers Aggr1 (5′-TCTTCGCCACACGCC-3′) and HisAgg (5′-CGGAATTCCTTAGTGATGATGGTGATGATGTCGGAAGCAGAAGGC-3′) were used to amplify a 312-bp fragment which was digested with restriction endonucleases SacII and EcoRI to generate two bands, 202 and 110 bp. The 202-bp band containing the stop codon, polyhistidine tag, and EcoRI site was purified and used to replace a 174-bp cassette excised from pSA005. The G1-G2 construct was subcloned into the pBacPAK8 transfer vector between the polyhedrin promoter and polyadenylation signal, generating pBacPAK8-G1-G2, then sequenced using Amplitaq Cycle sequencing. In the initial experiments, IPLB-Sf21 (Sf21) cells were maintained in culture at 27 °C in TNM-FH medium (Grace's insect medium supplemented with 0.33% yeastolate and 0.33% lactalbumin hydrolysate) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. In later experiments, Sf21 cells were cultured in Sf900II serum-free medium. Recombinant virus was produced by co-transfecting Sf21 cells with pBacPAK8-G1-G2 transfer vector and non-viable BacPak6 viral DNA. Homologous sequences within the BacPak6 viral expression vector, and the pBacPAK8 transfer vector allow double recombination to occur. The recombination event transfers the aggrecan G1-G2 cDNA, the polyhedrin promoter, and the polyadenylation sequences to the viral genome, which renders only the recombinant virus viable. Polymerase chain reaction using the Aggr 1 and HisAgg primers to amplify a 312-bp fragment confirmed the identity of the recombinant virus. Plaque assays showed that the recombinant virus stock contained 5 × 108 plaque forming units. Subsequently, Sf21 cells (12 × 106/175-cm2 flask) were infected with 2.5 plaque forming units of recombinant virus per cell for 1 h at room temperature. The medium was replaced and the cells incubated for a further 96 h. rG1-G2 secreted into the medium was detected by silver stain and immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 1-C-6 (39Stevens J.W. Oike Y. Handley C.J. Hascall V.C. Hampton A. Caterson B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 26: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recombinant G1-G2 present in the culture medium was purified by a two-step procedure involving affinity chromatography on HA-Sepharose followed by size exclusion chromatography. Up to 60 ml of harvested medium was applied to a 0.6-ml column of HA-Sepharose (with a binding capacity of 2 mg/ml G1 domain) equilibrated in PBS. The sample was allowed to cycle through the column twice at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, followed by washing with 15 column volumes of PBS. Proteins that specifically bound to the HA-Sepharose were then eluted with 2 ml of 4 m GdnHCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. The bulk of the serum proteins were removed by this affinity chromatography step. rG1-G2 eluted from HA-Sepharose was further purified by HPLC size exclusion chromatography using either BioSil SEC-400 or BioSep-SEC S4000 columns eluted in buffer containing 4m GdnHCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, silver stain, and Western blotting. Those fractions containing rG1-G2 were pooled, concentrated by centrifugal filtration, and rechromatographed on the same column to yield a single band of purified protein, as assessed by silver staining. Lyophilized preparations of purified human rG1-G2 and native pig G1-G2 (40Fosang A.J. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were dissolved in 4m GdnHCl at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, then dialyzed overnight against 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Samples were diluted into 70% glycerol and sprayed onto mica for rotary shadowing with platinum, and transmission electron microscopy on a Philips 410LS as described previously (41Morris N.P.

Matrix metalloproteinase and atrolysin C digestions were done at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium chloride, and 10 mm calcium chloride. The digests were stopped by adding EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline to final concentrations of 10 and 2 mm, respectively, or boiling. Aggrecanase was generated in conditioned media from IL-1β-stimulated bovine nasal cartilage cultures as described (42Arner E.C. Pratta M.A. Trzaskos J.M. Decicco C.P. Tortorella M.D. J. Biol.

Digestion was quenched with 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Native and recombinant G1-G2 (10 μg/20 μl) were digested overnight at 37 °C with either 0.01 units of keratanase or 0.001 units of keratanase II in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5. Keratanase-digested samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on Fairbanks gels (43Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar) rather than Laemmli gels (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) since they are better suited to resolving highly glycosylated proteins and the native G1-G2 migrates more true to size (compare Fig.6 a, lane 4, with b, lane 4). For deglycosylation of native G1-G2 prior to digestion with atrolysin C, 20 μg of G1-G2 was digested for 4 h at 37 °C with 0.02 units of keratanase in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 15 μl. For N-glycosidase F treatment, native and recombinant G1-G2 were denatured by boiling in 0.125 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS and 0.6% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. The samples were cooled to room temperature, then digested overnight at 37 °C with 1 unit of N-glycosidase F. For treatment withO-glycosidase, native and recombinant G1-G2 were denatured by boiling in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1% SDS and 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. The cooled samples were digested overnight at 37 °C with 1 milliunit ofO-glycosidase.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16011-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four-month-old female rabbits were primed subcutaneously with 400 μg of conjugate in 500 μl of a 1:3 mixture of peptide conjugate in PBS:Freund's complete adjuvant. Booster injections at days 14, 28, 42, and 99 contained 400 μg of conjugate in 300 μl of a 1:2 mixture of peptide conjugate in PBS:Freund's incomplete adjuvant, and the final bleed was on day 128. Peptides conjugated to bovine serum albumin rather than ovalbumin were used to titrate antisera in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and also in competition assays with truncated and extended peptides to demonstrate specificity. The binding of rG1-G2 to link protein, G1 domain, and hyaluronan was demonstrated by incubation of 125I-labeled rG1-G2 with nitrocellulose membrane containing dots of purified ligands. rG1-G2 was iodinated using the chloramine-T method (46Greenwood E.C.

Dilutions (10–1,000 μg/ml) of link protein in 4 m GdnHCl and G1 domain, both purified from pig laryngeal aggrecan, hyaluronan, bovine serum albumin, and undiluted 4 m GdnHCl were dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a dot-blotting apparatus and washed through with 2 ml of PBS. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk/PBS for 3 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with125I-rG1-G2 (2 × 106 cpm/5 ml) at 4 °C. The membrane was washed in 0.1% Tween/PBS for 45 min, then exposed to a phosphorscreen for 24 h.

CD18 is the β2 subunit of the leukocyte integrins, a family of cell surface proteins that mediate leukocyte adhesion and thereby play a critical role in the inflammatory response (17Anderson D.C.

The importance of the leukocyte integrins in inflammation is illustrated by leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome, a rare inherited disorder caused by mutations in the CD18 gene and associated with severe and recurrent infections (17Anderson D.C.

The products of the p47phoxand gp91phox genes are components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, which by generating superoxide anion serves as a pivotal enzyme in the microbicidal function of phagocytic cells (19Clark R.A.

We previously isolated the p47phox promoter and showed that it contains a consensus PU.1 binding sequence on the non-coding strand from base pair −40 to −45 relative to the transcriptional start site (9Li S.L. Valente A.J. Zhao S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17802-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutation of this sequence abolishes PU.1 binding and promoter activity. Although a p47phox promoter-luciferase reporter construct extending to −46 could dictate tissue-specific expression in myeloid cells, a larger construct (−86) showed maximal promoter activity, implying a significant contribution of upstream sequences to the expression of p47phox. Since in DNase I footprint analysis, a protected region (−37 to −52) was observed to extend beyond the consensus sequence GAGGAA (−40 to −45), the current studies were performed to define the functional role of the flanking residues upstream of the PU.1 site. RPMI 1640 was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, pGL3-Basic luciferase vector, and dual-luciferase reporter assay kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and DNA sequenced by the Advanced DNA Technology Unit, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX. Polyclonal PU.1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Reporter vectors in the pGL3-Basic luciferase plasmid including pGL3-p47–86, pGL3-p47–48, pGL3-p47–46, and pGL3-p47–36 (i.e. the proximal p47phoxpromoter extending to positions −86, −48, −46, and −36, respectively, relative to the TSS) were constructed as described previously (9Li S.L. Valente A.J. Zhao S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17802-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR was carried out using the plasmid construct pGL3-p47–1217 as template, a luciferase antisense oligonucleotide (pGL primer 2; 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC-3′) as the reverse primer and oligonucleotides synthesized with an XhoI restriction site linked to the desired 5′ terminus of thep47phox promoter as the forward primers. For CD18analysis, CD18(0.9)/luc (the generous gift of Dr. A. Rosmarin, Brown University, Providence, RI) (16Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was used as template and the PCR primers were an antisense sequence (5′-CCGAAGCTTTTGCTACCAGTCTGCCC-3′) and forward primers synthesized with an XhoI restriction site as for p47phox. The PCR-amplified products were digested with XhoI and HindIII and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGL3-Basic. To generate mutated constructs, altered oligonucleotides were used as the forward primers. The inserts of the p47phox constructs all extended downstream to +52 relative to the TSS and used the p47phox translation initiation codon ligated in-frame to the luciferase open reading frame. The CD18 promoter constructs extended downstream to +27 and used the translation initiation codon of the luciferase open reading frame. THP-1 cells were maintained at a density of ∼5 × 105 cells/ml and for transfection were then resuspended in medium containing 20 μg of the luciferase reporter constructs and 2 μg of the pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega) as a transfection efficiency control. Electroporation was carried out at 960 μF and 250 V. After 48 h the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer, microcentrifuged for 5 min, and 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant assayed for both luciferase and Renilla activity using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega) and a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer. The mouse PU.1 cDNA (generous gift of Dr. M. Klemsz, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN) (2Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) was excised by digestion with EcoRI and ligated into the pBluescript plasmid. A clone with the desired orientation was transcribed and translated in vitro using T3 RNA polymerase and the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). When the synthesized [35S]methionine-PU.1 was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, a predominant band of approximately 38 kDa was observed, consistent with the molecular mass previously reported (23Himmelmann A. Thevenin C. Harrison K. Kehrl J.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control unprogrammed sample (i.e. no cDNA) gave no corresponding band. THP-1 cells were disrupted by cavitation using a technique described previously for neutrophils (24Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, resuspended in 10 ml of cold relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3), and 3.5 μl diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma) were added. The cells were kept on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of relaxation buffer and pressurized at 350 p.s.i. in N2 for 20 min in a nitrogen bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL) before release into 750 μl of a solution containing 20 mm EGTA, 100 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. The cavitated cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the nucleus-enriched pellet resuspended and further purified on a discontinuous gradient of sucrose (0.3 m/0.88m). The nuclear fraction was extracted in 100 μl of urea extraction buffer (1.1 mm urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) and microcentrifuged. The supernatant was collected and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). EMSA was carried out as described previously (9Li S.L. Valente A.J. Zhao S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17802-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, complementary DNA oligonucleotides were annealed by heating in 1× NET at 95 °C for 5 min and cooling at ambient temperature. Probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. For gel shift assays nuclear extracts (6 μg) were incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature with 5 × 104 cpm of the labeled DNA probe in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.7 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). For supershift assays 2 μg of specific antibody was added and the reaction continued for 15 min. Samples were loaded on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresis carried out at 200 V in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, with 190 mmglycine and 1 mm EDTA. Competition assays were carried out in the same manner, except that the reaction mixtures were preincubated with competitor DNA for 10 min at 4 °C before addition of the labeled probe. The relative binding avidities of various DNA probes to PU.1 were determined by comparisons of band intensities in the presence of a series of dilutions of competing constructs. Our previous work on the p47phox 5′ regulatory region showed that PU.1 is essential for promoter function (9Li S.L. Valente A.J. Zhao S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17802-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Using p47phox-based luciferase reporter gene constructs, we observed that the −46 construct containing the PU.1 binding site produced myeloid-specific expression, but that the −86 construct gave maximum promoter activity. Analysis of thep47phox −86 to −46 promoter region identified consensus sequences for Sp1 between positions −78 and −70 and for PEBP2 between positions −63 and −58 (9Li S.L. Valente A.J. Zhao S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17802-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, gel shift experiments showed no evidence that either Sp1 or PEBP2 binds to these sites (data not shown). To investigate the role of the sequences immediately flanking the PU.1 site, we made a new construct pGL3-p47–48. In transient transfection assays of THP-1 cells (Fig.1), pGL3-p47–48 exhibited twice the promoter activity of pGL3-p47–46, indicating the functional importance of the flanking nucleotides at positions −47 and/or −48 (T and C, respectively). We next used EMSA to investigate the influence of the flanking nucleotides on PU.1 binding. To facilitate the direct correlation of DNA-protein binding with promoter activity, we designed DNA probes containing the PU.1 consensus motif flanked by the same sequences as those present in the corresponding reporter constructs used in transfections, including some vector sequences as required (Fig. 1 A, underlined). We observed several bands formed between the p47-PU.1–48 probe and THP-1 nuclear extracts (Fig.2 A, lane 2) and demonstrated binding specificity by competition with unlabeled DNA probe (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). These bands contained PU.1 protein since the addition of PU.1-specific antibody resulted in major decreases in band intensity as well as the appearance of new supershifted bands (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Comparison with our previous studies (9Li S.L. Valente A.J. Zhao S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17802-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) indicated that the major band contained intact PU.1 protein, whereas the faster-migrating bands were probably formed by PU.1 degradation products. The slower-migrating bands may contain other proteins in addition to PU.1. However, this appears unlikely because interaction of the p47-PU.1–48 DNA probe with in vitro synthesized PU.1 protein showed similar slow-migrating bands (Fig. 2 D, lane 4), raising the possibility that these bands may contain PU.1 multimers. As will be discussed below, complex formation between the p47 DNA probe and in vitro synthesized PU.1 was readily competed by the unlabeled p47 probe, whereas only weak competition was observed with the CD18-PU.1 probe (Fig. 2 D). The p47-PU.1–46 DNA probe exhibited the same general binding patterns, as did p47-PU.1–48, including the slow-migrating bands (Fig.2 C, lane 2). However, based on cross-competition studies, PU.1 bound the p47-PU.1–48 probe twice as avidly as it did the p47-PU.1–46 probe (Fig. 2, B andC). These observations suggest that the nucleotides at positions −47 and/or −48 significantly influence PU.1 binding ability and thereby affect gene expression. To test the influence of the nucleotide at position −48 on PU.1 transactivating activity, we mutated the wild-type nucleotide C to G, T, or A in the pGL3-p47–48 luciferase reporter construct (Fig.3 A). Transient transfection of THP-1 cells demonstrated comparable promoter activities of wild-type and each of the three −48-mutated constructs (Fig. 3 B). Correspondingly altered oligonucleotides were studied by EMSA (Fig.3 C). These base substitutions had no effect on PU.1 binding, since each of the three mutated DNA probes was comparable to wild-type in its ability to compete with the labeled wild-type probe. Thus, the nucleotide at position −48 does not appear to influence either promoter activity or binding of PU.1. Similarly, we mutated the wild-type nucleotide T at position −47 to A, C, or G (refer to Fig. 3 A) and tested the effects on promoter activity and PU.1 binding. The mutant reporter constructs pGL3-p47–48-47A, pGL3-p47–48-47C, and pGL3-p47–48-47G exhibited only minimal promoter activity compared with the wild-type construct containing a T at position −47 (Fig.4 A). When one of these mutations was introduced into the larger construct pGL3-p47–86 to form pGL3-p47–86-47A, we again observed a major decrease in promoter activity (Fig. 4 A). When assessed by EMSA, the oligonucleotides mutated at position −47 all failed to compete with the wild-type probe for PU.1 binding (Fig. 4 B). Cross-competition studies suggested that the avidity of binding of the wild-type probe was about 3–9-fold greater than that of the mutants. At position −46, immediately adjacent to the core PU.1 consensus binding sequence, the wild-type G residue was mutated to each of the other three nucleotides (refer to Fig. 3 A). In transfection studies (Fig. 5 A), promoter activities of the 46C and 46A mutants were decreased by 50% and 85%, respectively, whereas those of the 46T and combined 46T47A mutants were completely eliminated. EMSA showed corresponding changes (Fig.5 B). Compared with the wild-type 46G probe, the 46C mutant showed moderately reduced binding, whereas the 46A, 46T, and 46T47A mutants each exhibited dramatically reduced binding. The cross-competition studies suggested that the avidity of binding of the wild-type probe was about 2–3-fold greater than that of the 46C mutant and more than 9-fold greater than that of the other three mutants tested. We hypothesized that our findings on the important functional roles of the nucleotides flanking the p47phox PU.1 consensus binding site could be extrapolated to other PU.1-regulated myeloid-specific genes. To test this hypothesis, we chose the CD18 promoter as a model. This promoter contains two PU.1 binding motifs: a distal site at position −70 to −75 and a proximal site at position −55 to −50. We focused on the distal site, which has been shown to have functional activity that was dramatically decreased following mutation of the core PU.1 binding sequence (16Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, the flanking residues at positions −76 and −77 are G and T, respectively, exactly as for the comparable positions (−46 and −47) in the p47phox PU.1 flanking region. A luciferase reporter construct, pGL3-CD18–81, containing the first 81 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site was transiently expressed in THP-1 cells and compared with a construct (pGL3-CD18–81-76T77A) in which the flanking wild-type residues 76G and 77T were mutated to T and A, respectively (Fig.6 A). The promoter activity of the mutant construct was decreased by 75% relative to the wild-type (Fig. 6 B). That this decrease was quantitatively similar to that seen with mutations of the PU.1 core sequence of CD18(16Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggests that most of the contribution of the distal PU.1 binding site to the promoter activity of this construct was abrogated by mutation of the flanking residues. Next we investigated the distal PU.1 site of the CD18 promoter by EMSA, including comparisons with the p47phox PU.1 site (Fig. 6 C). DNA probes CD18-PU.1 and p47-PU.1 formed similar patterns of complexes with THP-1 nuclear extracts, but p47-PU.1 was far more active (by about 20–30-fold) than CD18-PU.1 in the cross-competition studies. The mutant probe CD18-PU.1–76T77A exhibited little or no ability to bind PU.1 in THP-1 nuclear extracts (Fig. 6 D). When in vitro synthesized PU.1 protein was used instead of THP-1 nuclear extract, similar bands were observed (see Fig. 2 D), indicating the likelihood that PU.1 is the only nuclear factor included in the complex. This experiment also confirmed the greater ability of the p47-PU.1, compared with the CD18-PU.1 probe to compete for PU.1 binding. Based on functional analyses of wild-type and mutatedp47phox reporter constructs and competition EMSA studies, the relative promoter activities and PU.1 binding avidities (estimated by cross-competition studies) were tabulated (TableI). The Spearman rank correlation test showed a striking relationship between these parameters (r = −0.97, p < 0.0001).Table ICorrelation of promoter activity and PU.1 binding avidity of p47phox promoter constructsConstructPromoter activityaSpearman rank correlation test: r = 0.97; p < 0.0001.

Open table in a new tab We previously showed that the myeloid-specific transcription factor PU.1 is essential for the function of the p47phoxgene promoter. In the present study, we demonstrate that the upstream nucleotides immediately flanking the PU.1 site in thep47phox promoter (3′ to the GAGGAA sequence, since this is on the non-coding strand) are important for full PU.1 binding and functional activity. Mutations at base pair −46 or −47 dramatically reduced the binding avidity and decreased or abolished promoter activity, indicating the critical role of nucleotides G and T, respectively, at these positions. The avidity of binding of these sequences to PU.1 correlated very closely with their capacity to dictate reporter gene transcription. Analogous results were obtained with the functional PU.1 site in the CD18 gene promoter, suggesting a strong relationship between the avidity with which PU.1 binds its cognate sequence on a promoter and the resulting PU.1-mediated enhancer activity. Based on the presence of potential binding sites, we speculated earlier (9Li S.L. Valente A.J. Zhao S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17802-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that the contribution to p47phox promoter activity of the DNA sequence in the −86 to −46 interval might result from the binding of other transcription factors such as Sp1 and PEBP/CBP. Alternatively, increased activity might result from a PU.1-dependent effect of the nucleotides immediately flanking the consensus PU.1-binding site, GAGGAA. Our current work provides evidence for the latter mechanism by demonstrating that the nucleotides G and T at positions −46 and −47, respectively, are required for maximal PU.1 binding and p47phox promoter activity. However, the contribution of other accessory factors cannot be completely excluded, since the transfection studies in THP-1 cells showed that the promoter activity of the pGL3-p47–48 construct was still only about half that of pGL3-p47–86, which we have shown previously to be sufficient for maximal promoter activity. In our previous studies, however, we also showed that mutation of the active PU.1 site from GAGGAA toCACCAA was equally effective in abolishing the promoter activity in −86, −224, and −2151 pGL3-p47 constructs. Therefore, the function of any additional transcription factors regulating p47phox transcription appears to be dependent on PU.1 binding. This study shows that for the p47phox promoter, the nucleotides G and T, which flank the 3′ end of the GAGGAA sequence, are the most active in promoting PU.1 binding and transactivation of the gene. Inspection of a number of functional PU.1 sites from other gene promoters (Table II) showed that these particular nucleotides occur most frequently at the corresponding positions in these other motifs (18G, 7C, 3A, and no T residues at positions analogous to −46 and 18T, 5G, 3C, and 2A residues at positions analogous to −47). The functionally least active combination of bases (TA) was not found. These sequence analyses support our claim that the nucleotides flanking the PU.1 core consensus sequence are critical for full PU.1 binding and transactivating activity.Table IISurvey of nucleotide sequences of functional PU.1 binding sitesPromoter or enhanceraReferences for promoter sequences (9, 10, 16, 29-36).Core and flankingbNucleotides flanking core sequence shown in bold font. nucleotide sequencep47phoxGAGGAAGTgp91phoxGAGGAAATCD18(distal)GAGGAAGTCD18(proximal)GAGGAACACD11bGGAGAAGTCD20CAAGAAGTCD33GAGGAACCM-CSFRGGGGAAGAG-CSFRCAGGAACTGM-CSFRGAGGAAGCFcγRIGAGGAAGGFcγRIIIAGAGGAAGGMannose receptorCAGGAAGGIL-1β(distal)GGGGAAAGIL-1β(proximal)GCAGAAGTIL-4CAGGAACTsIL-1 receptor antagonistGGGGAAATIgκ 3′GAGGAACTIgλ 2–4AAGGAAGTIgμGGGGAAGGIgJGCAGAAGCIg Vκ19AAGGAAGTNeutrophil elastaseGAGGAAGTChicken lysozymeGAGGAACTScavenger receptorAGAGAAGTSV40GAGGAACTEquine infectious anemia virus long terminal repeatCAGGAAGTEpstein-Barr virus latent membrane proteinGGGGAAGTa References for promoter sequences (9Li S.L.

In these studies, the PU.1 ets domain was shown to bind the DNA with novel loop-helix-loop architecture and to form a series of contacts with both the core GGAA sequence and with nucleotides 3′ to this motif. A number of amino acid residues contact the phosphate backbone of the two nucleotides immediately 3′ to the GGAA sequence (corresponding to positions −46 and −47 of the p47phox PU.1 site).

Kodandapani R. Ni C.-Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23329-23337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In agreement with these latter data, we have found that specific nucleotides 5′ to the PU.1 core sequence in thep47phox promoter are also required for full PU.1 binding and transactivation of the gene. 2S.-L. Li, A. J. Valente, and R. A. Clark, unpublished observations. Paxton and colleagues (25Paxton L.L.L. Li L.-J. Secor V. Duff J.L. Naik S.M. Shibagaki N. Caughman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15928-15935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated that specific sequences flanking a site for NF-κB are required for cognate transcription factor binding and tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Mutations of either the 5′- or 3′-flanking regions abrogated tumor necrosis factor-α-induced reporter activity, as did mutations of the core NF-κB site. A specific DNA-protein complex was formed when wild-type flanking sequences were included in the EMSA probe, but no complex was formed when random flanking sequences were used. Whether there was a quantitative correlation between binding affinity and promoter activity was not directly addressed. To our knowledge, the current paper is the first to provide a systematic quantitative correlation between transcription factor binding avidity and promoter activity of specific nucleotide sequences. As shown in Table I, flanking sequences determine the avidity of PU.1 binding and thereby influence p47phoxpromoter activity. Nevertheless, the correlation appears to be promoter-dependent. For example, comparing thep47phox promoter and the CD18 promoter, the wild-type PU.1 binding site of the p47phox gene binds to PU.1 30-fold more strongly than does the wild-type CD18 PU.1 site. If the p47phox PU.1 site is mutated to have such a low binding affinity, it completely loses its contribution to promoter activity. PIP has been reported to bind to the specific flanking nucleotides of PU.1 sites in the presence of bound PU.1 and thereby increase promoter activity (7Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). On the other hand, FEF-1 binds to the adjacent sequences independently of PU.1, but cooperates with PU.1 to enhance gene transcription (8Heydemann A. Boehmler J.H. Simon M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29527-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our current findings that the flanking sequences of PU.1 binding sites influence promoter activity and gene expression by altering the binding avidity of PU.1 provide another model for the mechanism by which the flanking sequences affect transcription. We propose that such a mechanism may also operate in other ciselement-transcription factor interactions. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is an enzyme complex comprised of several protein subunits, principally the membrane components gp91phox and p22phox and the cytosolic components p67phox, p47phox, and Rac1/2 (19Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: S309-S317Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetically determined lack of NADPH oxidase activity results from mutations in the genes for gp91phox or p47phox or, rarely, the genes for p22phox or p67phox, and leads to the clinical disorder CGD (21Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. Rae J. Heyworth P.G. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1996; 22: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. Heyworth P.G. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1996; 22: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Most cases result from mutations in the coding sequence of the affected gene. However, variant forms of gp91phox-deficient CGD have been described in which low levels of the protein are expressed and single base changes are found at positions −52, −53, −55, or −57 of the active PU.1 site of thegp91phox promoter (10Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Newburger P.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The consensus PU.1 motif GAGGAA of the gp91phox gene promoter is located between −50 to −55 relative to the transcription start site. Position −57 corresponds to position −47 of the p47phox promoter, shown in the current work to be critical for PU.1 binding and promoter activity. In vitro mimicking of the CGD sequences by mutation of the PU.1 core motif of the gp91phox promoter from GAGGAA to GAGGAG or the flanking sequence from GAGGAAAT to GAGGAAAG led to major losses in promoter activity (10Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the case of p47phox-deficient CGD patients, a single lesion, a GT deletion at an intron-exon junction is the predominant mutation. The recent identification of a p47phox pseudogene that contains the GT deletion but is otherwise highly homologous to the normal gene suggests that recombination events, for example crossovers with deletions and/or gene conversions, between the p47phoxgene and the pseudogene account for most cases of p47phox deficiency (28Görlach A. Lee P.L. Roesler J. Hopkins P.J. Christensen B. Green E.D. Chanock S.J. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1907-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To date, no CGD patients with mutations in thep47phox promoter have been described. In part, this may be due to the rarity of this genetic disorder. Second, it could be a consequence of activation of the p47phox gene by regulatory elements outside of the promoter region that we have studied. Third, coding regions tend to comprise longer stretches of DNA and therefore are more likely to manifest mutations than are promoter elements, which are usually clustered in small regions upstream of coding segments. Fourth, redundancy of promoter elements may allow for at least partial compensation for mutations of core or flanking sequences of a promoter motif, thereby resulting in subtle phenotypes that could be overlooked clinically. Thus, it remains to be seen whether mutations ofp47phox PU.1 core or flanking binding residues may account for some clinical forms of CGD, as is the case for thegp91phox gene.

DmpR is constitutively expressed, but its transcriptional promoting activity is positively controlled in direct response to the presence of multiple aromatic effectors. Previous work has led to a model in which effector binding by the amino-terminal region of the protein relieves repression of an intrinsic ATPase activity essential for its transcriptional promoting property. Here, we address whether the observed differences in the potencies of the multiple effectors (i) reside at the level of different aromatic binding sites, or (ii) are mediated through differential binding affinities; furthermore, we address whether binding of distinct aromatic effectors has different functional consequences for DmpR activity. These questions were addressed by comparing wild type and an effector specificity mutant of DmpR with respect to effector binding characteristics and the ability of aromatics to elicit ATPase activity and transcription. The results demonstrate that six test aromatics all share a common binding site on DmpR and that binding affinities determine the concentration at which DmpR responds to the presence of the effector, but not the magnitude of the responses. Interestingly, this analysis reveals that the novel abilities of the effector specificity mutant are not primarily due to acquisition of new binding abilities, but rather, they reside in being able to productively couple ATPase activity to transcriptional activation. The mechanistic implications of these findings in terms of aromatic control of DmpR activity are discussed.

The mechanistic implications of these findings in terms of aromatic control of DmpR activity are discussed. DmpR is the specific regulator of the pVI150 plasmid encodeddmp-operon, which encodes the enzymes of the (methyl)phenol catabolic pathway of Pseudomonas sp. CF600 (1Shingler V. Bartilson M. Moore T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway confers the ability to utilize phenol, mono-methylated phenols, and 3,4-dimethylphenol as sole carbon and energy sources (reviewed in Refs. 2Powlowski J. Shingler V. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar and 3Shingler V. Pseudomonas: Molecular Biology and Biotechnology in (Nakazawa, T., ed). 1996; (pp., ASM Press, Washington, DC): 153-164Google Scholar). DmpR tightly regulates transcription from the operon promoter, Po, resulting in expression of the specialized catabolic enzymes only in the presence of pathway substrates or some structural analogs (4Shingler V. Moore T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DmpR belongs to the prokaryotic family of enhancer binding proteins that exert their action on transcription mediated by RNA polymerase utilizing the alternative sigma factor, ς54(ςN) that recognizes −24 GG, −12 GC promoters (reviewed in Ref. 5Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DmpR, like other family members, has a distinct domain structure consisting of an amino-terminal signal reception A-domain linked to a central activation C-domain by a short B-domain, and a carboxyl-terminal D-domain that contains a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. The central C-domains are the hallmark of the family and seven (C1 to C7) highly conserved regions within this domain have been identified (5Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Osuna J. Soberón X. Morett S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 543-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The C-domain contains a nucleotide binding motif and mediates ATP binding and hydrolysis essential for transcriptional activation of, and open complex formation by, ς54-RNA polymerase (7Austin S. Dixon R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Weiss D.S. Batut J. Klose K.E. Keener J. Kustu S. Cell. 1991; 67: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mutational and cross-linking studies have also implicated the conserved C3 region of this domain in direct interaction with the transcriptional apparatus through the β- and ς54-subunits of the holoenzyme (9Lee J.H. Hoover T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9702-9706Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Most ς54-dependent activators are constitutively produced, but their activity is controlled in response to environmental signals. Distinct activation mechanisms are mediated through modulation of the A-domains of the regulators and include phosphorylation cascades, ligand binding, and signal-responsive protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 11Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DmpR belongs to a now extensive subgroup of ligand-responsive regulators that also includes the aromatic-responsive regulators XylR (12Abril M.A. Michan C. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Delgado A. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8059-8062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PhhR (14Ng L.C. Poh C.L.

Ehrt S. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the formate-responsive FhlA (17Hopper S. Bšck A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2798-2803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and the ornithine/citrulline-responsive RocR (18Gardan R. Rapoport G. Débarbouillé M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the cases of DmpR and XylR, effector specificity mutants and hybrid proteins have genetically demonstrated that the effector response is mediated via the A-domain (4Shingler V. Moore T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Delgado A. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8059-8062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most recently, the A-domain of DmpR has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to bind its ligand phenol (20O'Neill E. Ng L.C. Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Binding of effectors to DmpR releases its intrinsic ATPase activity required for transcriptional activation, a process that is mimicked by removal of the A-domain of DmpR, which results in a derivative that has full ATPase and transcriptional promoting activities in the absence of effectors (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These observations, together with genetic and biochemical evidence for specific interactions between the A- and C-domains of DmpR (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20O'Neill E. Ng L.C. Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Ng L.C. O'Neill E. Shingler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17281-17286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), have led to a model in which effector binding to the A-domain alleviates interdomain repression, resulting in release of the C-domain-mediated ATPase activity and thus promotion of transcription. In addition to the specific regulation mechanism described above, the DmpR-mediated regulatory circuit is also subject to physiological regulation leading to silencing of the system in rich media until the exponential to stationary phase transition. Recently, the global signaling molecule (p)ppGpp has been shown to be essential for efficient DmpR-mediated transcription from the operon promoter and to be a molecule that links this specific regulatory circuit to the physiological status of the cell (22Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DmpR is activated by a wide range of phenolic compounds, including substrates of the pathway it controls and some, but not all, structurally related compounds (4Shingler V. Moore T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the magnitude of the DmpR-mediated transcriptional response from the Po promoter varies, depending on the position and nature of substituents on the aromatic ring. Using a DmpR mutant derivative, DmpR-E135K, altered in its ability to respond to pathway effectors, it has been shown that these differences can have a profound effect on the efficiency with which the bacteria can degrade compounds that are poor effectors of DmpR (23Pavel H. Forsman M. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7550-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to novel effector specificity, other amino acid substitutions of residue 135 result in protein derivatives that are still effector-responsive but can mediate varying levels of transcriptional activation even in the absence of effectors (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, residue 135 is located in a position that can influence both effector specificity and the A-domain-mediated repression of C-domain function. Activation of DmpR can be divided into at least two interrelated steps: (i) binding of the effector to a specific site(s) on the A-domain, and (ii) alleviation of repression of the C-domain-mediated activities. Here, we use in vivo and in vitro assays of wild type DmpR and DmpR-E135K to determine how these two processes are coupled for different effectors and whether different aromatic effectors act through a single binding site on DmpR. Plasmids used for in vivo assays, expressing DmpR (pVI401) and DmpR-E135K (pVI428) from the natural promoter of dmpR on a broad host range RSF1010 replicon, have previously been described (23Pavel H. Forsman M. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7550-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plasmid pVI453 expressing the constitutively active ΔA2-DmpR derivative from the Ptacpromoter of the broad host range RSF1010-based vector, has also been previously described (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). T7 promoter plasmids were used for high level expression of DmpR derivatives harboring a carboxyl-terminal fusion of the eight amino acid flag epitope tag (24Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Plasmids for the expression DmpR-flag (pVI456) and ΔA2-DmpR-flag (pVI457) have previously been generated (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Analogous plasmids, pVI538 and pVI539, for expression of DmpR-E135K-flag and DmpR-G268S-flag, respectively, were constructed by replacing the NdeI to StuI fragment of pVI457 (spanning the ATG initiation codon to within the C-domain) with the NdeI to StuI fragments from plasmids expressing these mutant proteins from Ptacpromoter vectors (21Ng L.C. O'Neill E. Shingler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17281-17286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Pavel H. Forsman M. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7550-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were grown into exponential phase in Luria broth (LB) (25Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing appropriate antibiotics for plasmid selection. Because the DmpR-mediated transcriptional response in LB is not observed until the exponential to stationary phase transition (22Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), cultures were diluted and grown to A600 = 2.5 prior to exposure to the indicated concentrations of effectors for 3 h. Luciferase assays of the luxAB gene product were performed on whole cells, using a 1:2000 dilution of decanal substrate, as described previously (26Sze C.C. Moore T. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crude extracts of cytosolic proteins, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose filters, and Western blot analysis with polyclonal rabbit anti-DmpR sera were as described previously (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antibody decorated bands were revealed using the chemiluminescence reagents of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech as directed by the supplier. Differences in expression levels were assessed by comparison of dilution series of the samples and quantification using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Protein expression, crude extract preparation, and immunoprecipitation of flag-tagged proteins using Flag-M2 affinity gel (Sigma) were as described previously (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), except for a modification in the washing procedure. Here, after incubation with the crude extracts, bead-bound proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol) in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl and protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by one wash with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and three washes with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. 2 mmdithiothreitol. Unlike the previously reported washing condition (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), these modified conditions resulted in bead preparations that, when treated with crude extract from bacteria harboring a vector control plasmid, are devoid of detectable ATPase activity. However, the previously reported background level of ATPase activity of DmpR-flag in the absence of effectors still persists. A control preparation of a mutant protein harboring a single amino acid substitution in the Walker A motif (DmpR-G268S-flag) possesses no detectable ATPase activity in the presence or absence of 2-methylphenol (Ref. 21Ng L.C. O'Neill E. Shingler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17281-17286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and data not shown). Hence, the high background ATPase activity (approximately 20% of fully activated levels) is an intrinsic property of DmpR-flag and not due to contaminating ATPase competent proteins. The bead-bound proteins generated as described above were resuspended as a slurry in assay buffer (35 mm Tris-Ac, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgAc, 70 mm KAc, 20 mmNH4Ac, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and kept on ice prior to their use in ATPase or [14C]phenol binding assays. The concentration of bead-bound proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis comparison of a serial dilution of each sample against standards of known concentration and quantification using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. ATPase assays were performed at 30 °C in 60 μl of 1× assay buffer as described previously (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 1 μl of bead-bound protein and the indicated concentrations of aromatic compound(s). Assays were initiated by the addition of radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been diluted (1:9) with unlabeled ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and added to a final concentration of 3 mm. Rates of ATP hydrolysis at each concentration of effector was determined by removing aliquots at 10-min intervals over 1 h, during which the reaction was linear. Samples were adjusted to 0.1% SDS, boiled for 1 min, spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Merck), and dried, and the free phosphate was separated from ATP by ascending chromatography in 0.75 m potassium hydrogen phosphate buffer, pH 3.5. Radioactivity was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The value for phosphate released was calculated as a percentage of the total amount of radioactivity per sample. Effector-stimulated ATPase hydrolysis was calculated by subtraction of a basal ATPase activity. Universally labeled [14C]phenol (5.22 Gbq/mmol) was custom synthesized by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Binding assays were performed with 10 μl of bead-bound affinity-purified flag-tagged protein (0.95 μg of protein per μl) in a total of 200 μl of assay buffer prepared as described above. To determine the [14C]phenol binding capacity of DmpR-flag and DmpR-E135K-flag, proteins were exposed to increasing concentrations of [14C]phenol in the presence or absence of 500 μm unlabeled phenol, essentially as described previously (20O'Neill E. Ng L.C. Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were allowed to reach equilibrium at 30 °C (<5 min under these conditions) prior to separation of protein-bound phenol from free phenol. Separation was achieved by centrifugation through a gradient composed of 200 μl of assay buffer layered onto 300 μl of a 40% sucrose cushion, using a bench microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm. The radioactivity in the upper layer, containing the free phenol, and the lower layer, containing the protein-bound phenol, was independently recovered and analyzed by scintillation counting. Specific binding of phenol was calculated by subtraction of nonspecific binding observed in the presence of 500 μm competing unlabeled phenol. For the [14C]phenol binding competition assays, unlabeled aromatic compounds were incubated with DmpR-flag at room temperature for 5 min prior to addition of [14C]phenol to a final concentration of 16 μm. As a first step to address the question of what mechanism(s) underlies the specific levels of DmpR-mediated transcription from the Po operon promoter in response to different effectors, we made use of a previously constructed in vivo luciferase reporter system consisting of a single copy of Po promoter fused to theluxAB genes on the chromosome of a Pseudomonas putida host (KT2440::Po-luxAB) and a plasmid (pVI401) expressing wild type DmpR from its native promoter (23Pavel H. Forsman M. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7550-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The range of effectors chosen for testing included the two best DmpR effectors (phenol and 2-methylphenol), the two poorest DmpR effectors (4-methyphenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol), and two noneffectors of DmpR to which the mutant DmpR-E135K had gained the ability to respond (2,4-dimethylphenol and 4-ethylphenol). Cultures were grown and assayed for luciferase activity in response to up to a 3 mmconcentration of the different effectors; higher concentrations in all cases resulted in varying degrees of inhibition (data not shown). The results in Fig. 1 (closed symbols) show that activation of DmpR differed both in the minimum concentration of effector required to elicit a detectable response (approximately a 100-fold difference: 3 μm for 2-methylphenol to 300 μm for 3,4-dimethylphenol), and also in the shape of the activation profile. The two best effectors (phenol and 2-methylphenol) (Fig. 1, A and B) showed a biphasic response curve. In the case of the poor effectors, 4-methylphenol (Fig. 1 C) shows a monophasic response curve, whereas for 3,4-dimethylphenol (Fig. 1 D), a plateau was not discernible before inhibitory effects were observed. The responses to 4-methylphenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol and the first phase of the responses to phenol and 2-methylphenol appear to be like typical saturating binding curves, which is consistent with the previousin vitro data of a single affinity binding site for phenol (20O'Neill E. Ng L.C. Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The second phase of the response to high concentrations of phenol and 2-methylphenol could be either due to a second very low affinity binding site or, more likely, due to a cellular response to these high concentrations of the effectors. To directly test the latter possibility, we made use of the A-domain-deleted derivative ΔA2-DmpR. This derivative is constitutively active both in vivo andin vitro and thus bypasses the need for the aromatic activation step (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmid pVI453 carries ΔA2-dmpRdownstream from the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible promoter of the vector. This plasmid was introduced into the reporter strainP. putida KT2440::Po-luxAB and cultured in the presence of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to produce ΔA2-DmpR at approximately the same level as wild type DmpR produced from its native promoter (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The level of transcription achieved in the presence of aromatic compounds was monitored as luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, low levels of 2-methylphenol did not affect the level of transcription mediated by this constitutively active derivative, whereas exposure to higher concentrations (1–3 mm) resulted in higher levels of transcription. The level of transcription mediated by ΔA2-DmpR in the presence of 3 mm concentrations of the six test effectors (and a control compound, 3,4-dimethylbenzoate, that does not elicit a response from wild type DmpR) is shown in Fig. 2 B. The various aromatic compounds had different effects on the transcriptional activity ranging from essentially no effect (4-methylphenol) to a 40% enhancement of luciferase activity (3,4-dimthylphenol). Most importantly, 3 mm concentrations of the two effectors that showed a second phase in the dose-dependent response curves (phenol and 2-methylphenol, Fig. 1, A and B), showed marked enhancement of the ΔA2-DmpR-mediated transcription, whereas a 3 mm concentration of 4-methylphenol that resulted in a monophasic dose-response curve (Fig. 1 C) had little or no effect on ΔA2-DmpR activity (Fig. 2 B). Hence, the effect of the different compounds on global cellular response primarily accounts for the second phase of the response seen with phenol and 2-methylphenol but not 4-methylphenol. Recently, (p)ppGpp has been shown to be required for, and to enhance, maximal levels of DmpR-mediated transcription from Po (22Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, elevation of cellular concentrations of (p)ppGpp in response to high concentrations of phenol and 2-methylphenol is a likely mechanism underlying the data shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2In vivo mediated transcriptional response of Po by ΔA2-DmpR. A,the luciferase transcriptional response of P. putidaKT2440::Po-luxAB harboring pVI453 expressing ΔA2-DmpR in the presence of increasing concentrations of 2-methylphenol. The dashed line shows the profile of wild type DmpR for comparison. B, luciferase activity of P. putida KT2440::Po-luxAB (pVI453) in the presence of 3 mm of the indicated aromatic compound. Conditions were as under Fig. 1, except that 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was included to induce transcription from the plasmid-located Ptacpromoter.

However, the data clearly dissociate sensitivity, as measured by the dose response, and the functional output of binding, as measured by the magnitude of the response. Phenol and 2-methylphenol elicit a maximum plateau level of Po transcription of about 6000–7000 luciferase units/A600 (Fig. 1, A andB). The maximum activation level achieved using the poorest effector (3,4-dimethylphenol, Fig. 1 D) was approximately equal to those of the plateau levels for phenol and 2-methylphenol. Notably, however, the activation profile obtained with 4-methylphenol reached a maximal plateau level of only 3000–4000 luciferase units/A600 (Fig. 1 C), which is approximately 50% of the levels for phenol/2-methylphenol and the maximum response with 3,4-dimethylphenol. This observation suggests that the level of effector activation of DmpR involves more than a simple direct correlation with binding affinity of the effectors, a conclusion further substantiated by in vitro assays shown below. The effector specificity mutant DmpR-E135K was independently isolated during a genetic selection for mutants that respond to either 2,4-dimethylphenol or 4-ethylphenol (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,23Pavel H. Forsman M. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7550-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To shed further light on the mechanism of effector activation of DmpR, the dose-dependent effector profiles of this mutant were compared with those of wild type DmpR using the luciferase reporter described above and a plasmid, pVI428, expressing DmpR-E135K. Western analysis revealed that DmpR-E135K is present at levels that were slightly lower than (approximately 75%) but still comparable to those of wild type DmpR in the cells (Fig. 1 G). At high effector concentrations, DmpR-E135K was similar to wild type DmpR in its activation to phenol and 2-methylphenol, had an enhanced ability to respond to 4-methylphenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol, and had gained the novel ability to respond to 2,4-dimethylphenol and 4-ethylphenol (Fig.1, open symbols). The dose-dependent effector profiles of this mutant show that 2,4-dimethylphenol and 4-ethylphenol are almost as potent activators of DmpR-E135K as 3,4-dimethylphenol is of the wild type protein (Fig. 1, compare D toF). In the case of phenol and 2-methylphenol, although high concentrations of effector elicit a similar response from both the wild type and mutant DmpR, the shift in dose responses at lower concentrations of effector suggests that the E135K mutation may also influence binding affinity of these compounds. To directly test the prediction from the in vivo experiments described above, namely that DmpR-E135K has a lower binding affinity for phenol than the wild type protein, we used flag epitope-tagged derivatives of DmpR. The presence of the eight amino acid carboxyl-terminal flag epitope has previously been shown to have no effect on the protein stability or effector-mediated transcriptional responses of DmpR in vivo (19Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A system employing [14C]phenol and affinity-purified bead-bound DmpR-flag and DmpR-E135K-flag was used to analyze phenol binding (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The data shown in Fig.3 demonstrate specific and saturable binding of phenol by these proteins. Evaluation of the binding data by Scatchard analysis gives a dissociation constant of approximately 16 μm for DmpR-flag (as found previously, Ref. 20O'Neill E. Ng L.C. Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and a dissociation constant of 40–65 μm for DmpR-E135K-flag. Hence, the E135K mutant does indeed have a decreased affinity for phenol in vitro but retains the ability to achieve maximal activation of Po in vivo. Thein vivo experiments outlined in Fig. 1 provide a comparison of the responses of different protein deriv"

In this study, we show that exposure of cultured cortical neurons from mouse to increasing concentrations of Zn2+ (10–300 μm) induces a progressive decrease in global protein synthesis. The potency of Zn2+ was increased by about 2 orders of magnitude in the presence of Na+-pyrithione, a Zn2+ ionophore. The basal rate of protein synthesis was restored 3 h after Zn2+ removal. Zn2+induced a sustained increase in phosphorylation of the α subunit of the translation eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2α), whereas it triggered a transient increase in phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2). Protein synthesis was still depressed 60 min after the onset of Zn2+ exposure while the state of eEF-2 phosphorylation had already returned to its basal level. Moreover, Zn2+ was less effective than glutamate to increase eEF-2 phosphorylation, whereas it induced a more profound inhibition of protein synthesis. These results suggest that Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis mainly correlates with the increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation. Supporting further that Zn2+ acts at the initiation step of protein synthesis, it strongly decreased the amount of polyribosomes.

It is mainly detected in glutamatergic neurons of the neocortex and in nerve terminals of hippocampal mossy fibers (1Frederickson C.J. Moncrieff D.W. Biol. Signals. 1994; 3: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In these latter nerve terminals, Zn2+ appears to be contained in synaptic vesicles and is released with glutamate during neuronal activity (2Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 3Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that Zn2+ may modulate excitatory neurotransmission. Zn2+ inhibits glutamate uptake into glial cells (4Spiridon M. Kamm D. Billups B. Mobbs P. Attwell D. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and synaptosomes (5Gabrielsson B. Robson T. Norris D. Chung S.H. Brain Res. 1986; 384: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and facilitates α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolpropionic acid (AMPA)1 receptor-mediated neuroexcitation (6Rassendren F.A. Lory P. Pin J.P. Nargeot J. Neuron. 1990; 4: 733-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Zn2+ has been shown to inhibit N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function through both voltage-dependent and voltage-independent mechanisms (7Christine C.W. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 108-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ascher P. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Beside its modulatory effects on glutamatergic transmission, Zn2+ has been found to contribute to neuronal loss induced by transient cerebral ischemia (9Koh J.-Y. Suh S.W. Gwag B.J. He Y.Y. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism responsible for the neurotoxic effect of Zn2+ is unknown. However, NMDA receptor antagonists appear to exert a protecting effect against Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity (10Koh J.-Y Choi D.W. Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). At the intracellular level, Zn2+ can interact with a large variety of factors including metallothioneins, reduced glutathione and ion transporter enzymes such as Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase (for review, see Ref. 11Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In neurons, Zn2+ treatment and NMDA receptor stimulation lead to an inhibition of cell respiration and thus of ATP synthesis. However, Zn2+ inhibits the cell respiratory chain by blocking the initial step of respiration, i.e. the electron transfer between ubiquinone and cytochrome b (complex III) (12Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), whereas glutamate induces a loss of the mitochondrial potential by opening the transition pore (13White R.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 15: 5688-5697Crossref Google Scholar, 14Schinder A.F. Olson E.C. Spitzer N.C. Montal M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6125-6133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that glutamate, by stimulating NMDA- and AMPA-gated channels, depresses global protein synthesis in cultured cortical neurons from the mouse (15Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Prémont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect appears to result from the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) by eEF-2 kinase, a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzyme (15Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Prémont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Zn2+ inhibits protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysate by a distinct mechanism, which involves the phosphorylation of the α subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2α) (16Hurst R. Schatz J.R. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15939-15945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine whether Zn2+ depresses protein synthesis in living cortical neurons and to investigate the mechanism involved in this process. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (17Weiss S. Pin J.P. Sebben M. Kemp D.E. Sladeczek F. Gabrion J. Bockaert J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2238-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were removed from 15-day-old Swiss mouse embryos (Iffa Credo, Lyon, France) and cells were seeded on 6- or 12-well culture dishes (3 × 106 and 1 × 106 cells/well containing 3 and 1 ml of culture medium, respectively), coated successively with poly-l-ornithine (15 μg/ml, Mr = 40,000, Sigma) and culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Dutcher, Brumath, France). The culture medium included a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 nutrient (Life Technologies, Inc., Paris, France), supplemented with glucose (33 mm) glutamine (2 mm), NaHCO3 (13 mm), HEPES buffer (5 mm, pH 7.4), penicillin-streptomycin (5 IU/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively), and a mixture of salt and hormones containing insulin (25 μg/ml), transferrin (100 μg/ml), progesterone (20 nm), putrescine (60 μm), and Na2SeO3 (30 nm). Cells were maintained for 6 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 8% CO2 without medium change. In these conditions, the cultures were shown to be highly enriched in neurons by immunocytochemistry using an anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 monoclonal antibody (IgG1, Biomakor, Israel). Less than 7% of the cells exhibited immunoreactivity with a rabbit antibody raised against glial fibrillary acid protein (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) (data not shown). Neurons grown in 12-well culture dishes were washed twice in 1 ml of HEPES buffer (in mm: HEPES, 20; glucose, 5.5; NaCl, 120; KCl, 5.5; MgCl2, 0.9; CaCl2, 1.1; pH 7.4) and then incubated for 30 min in this medium in the presence of drugs and 50 μm either methionine or leucine. [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or [3H]leucine (159 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added (4 μCi/ml each) during the last 10 min of the incubation period. The labeling was stopped by 2 washes in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and addition of 1 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v). Cells were scraped, and suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Amino acid uptake into neurons and incorporation into proteins were estimated by counting the radioactivity in the supernatant and the pellet, respectively. Results are expressed as the ratio between the radioactive amino acid incorporated into proteins (trichloroacetic acid-precipitable fraction) and the radioactive amino acid taken up into the cells (supernatant). Intracellular Zn2+ was detected in neurons grown on glass slides using the Zn2+-selective and membrane-permeant fluorescent dyeN-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-p-toluene sulfonamide (TSQ). Glass slides were placed in a superfusion chamber where cells were superfused with HEPES buffer. Neurons were exposed to drugs including TSQ (0.001%, wt/v, prepared from a stock solution of 0.5% in dimethyl sulfoxide) using a multichannel superfusion device. The superfusion chamber was placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with a 75-watt xenon light and a 40× epifluorescence oil immersion objective. Light was filtered at 360 nm with a 10-nm-wide interferential filter and emission light was passed through a 380-nm dichroic long pass filter (barrier 420 nm). Images were acquired with an intensified CCD camera and digitized using an Argus 50 interface (16 video frames per digitized image, allowing the recording of 1 image/s). The camera and the digitizing system were from Hamamatsu (Japan). The camera dark noise was subtracted from the recorded crude image at the beginning of each experiment. Cortical neurons grown in six-well culture dishes were labeled for 3.5 h with [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi/ml) in 1 ml of HEPES buffer. Drugs were then added to cells for the indicated times. Neurons were lyzed in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mmNa+-vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatant proteins (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated overnight with an antibody recognizing specifically eIF-2α (10 μg of purified immunoglobulin per sample) and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The serum recognizing eIF-2α was obtained by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide derived from the sequence of the protein (LSKRRVSPEEAIKC) and purified on an affinity column. The purified antibody recognized an unique band around 36 kDa in whole homogenates prepared from cultured cortical neurons (data not shown). Immunocomplexes were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, boiled in SDS loading buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Incorporation of 32P into eIF-2α was detected by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager. The amount of immunoprecipitated eIF-2α was estimated in an aliquot of each samples by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody directed against eIF-2α (20Price N.T. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). eIF-2α phosphorylation state was also analyzed by sequential immunoblotting, first with an antibody recognizing specifically the phosphorylated form of eIF-2α (1/250 dilution, Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL) and then with the polyclonal antibody recognizing total eIF-2α (1/2,000 dilution). Neurons, grown in six-well culture dishes, were exposed to drugs in HEPES buffer for the indicated times. Incubations were stopped by replacing the medium by 0.3 ml of boiling SDS (1%, w/v), in order to prevent protein dephosphorylation by phosphatases. Protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid method (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples containing 50 μg of protein were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Renaissance kit from NEN Life Science Products) using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phosphorylation of eEF-2 in living cortical neurons was analyzed by sequential immunoblotting first with an antibody that specifically recognized eEF-2 phosphorylated on Thr56 (1/1,000 dilution) and then with an antibody recognizing eEF-2 independently of its phosphorylation state (1/1,000 dilution) (15Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Prémont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described above. The amount of RNA associated with the polyribosomal fraction was estimated as described previously (21Weiler I.J. Greenough W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7168-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Weiler I.J. Childers W.S. Greenough W.T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons grown for 6 days in 60-mm culture dishes were exposed for 30 min to 100 μm cycloheximide in the absence or presence of 100 μm ZnCl2. Cells were lyzed in a lysing buffer containing 0.25% CHAPS, 125 mm NaCl, 100 mm sucrose, 2 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm cycloheximide, and immediately spun for 30 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was layered over 1 msucrose containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm potassium acetate, and 5 mm MgCl2, and centrifuged for 10 min at 400,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. RNA were extracted from the resultant polyribosomal pellet as described previously (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and resolved on 1% agarose gels. The amount of 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA was estimated by scanning of ethidium bromide fluorescence. The exposure of cultured cortical neurons to Zn2+ for 30 min resulted in a marked decrease in [3H]leucine (Fig. 1) or [35S]methionine (data not shown) incorporation into proteins. This inhibition of neuronal protein synthesis was concentration-dependent (IC50 = 51 ± 7 μm, mean ± S.E. of values obtained in five independent experiments performed in triplicate), and the potency of Zn2+ was increased (1–10 μm range, Fig. 1) in the presence of 20 μm Na+-pyrithione, a Zn2+ ionophore. As detected using the Zn2+-sensitive fluorescent dye TSQ, the Na+-pyrithione treatment strongly increased the staining of neurons exposed to 3 μm Zn2+ (Fig.2). It should be noted that, at this low concentration (3 μm), Zn2+ inhibited by 50% the protein synthesis in the presence of Na+-pyrithione, whereas it was ineffective in its absence. None of these treatments (Zn2+ with or without Na+-pyrithione) significantly altered the uptake of radioactive amino acids into neurons (data not shown).Figure 2Enhancement of Zn2+ entry in cortical neurons by Na+-pyrithione. Cortical neurons grown on glass slides were first superfused with TSQ to assess basal level of Zn2+. They were then exposed for 1 min to 3 μm ZnCl2 in either the absence (a) or the presence (b) of 20 μmNa+-pyrithione and thereafter to TSQ until the fluorescence reaches its maximal level (about 1–2 min). A representative field of three independent experiments performed on different sets of cultured neurons, photographed by fluorescence videomicroscopy, is illustrated. Scale bar = 30 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Zn2+ influx into neurons has been shown to occur through AMPA- or NMDA-gated channels and L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (24Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M.T., Yu, S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.-Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither nifedipine, an antagonist of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, nor (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a, d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801) or 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), antagonists of NMDA and AMPA receptors, respectively, suppressed the inhibition of protein synthesis induced by 100 μm Zn2+ (Fig.3). Additional experiments were performed to determine whether these treatments modify the Zn2+-induced TSQ fluorescence. Since TSQ binds Zn2+ in a saturable process, variations of Zn2+bound to TSQ must be investigated in the presence of Zn2+concentrations that are largely lower than those leading to the saturation of the dye (used at 30 μm). Thus, in order to warrant absence of saturation of the dye, we have investigated the mechanisms of Zn2+ entry in neurons exposed to 3 μm Zn2+ (see Fig. 2). In this experimental condition, the co-application of DNQX and nifedipine with Zn2+ did not decrease TSQ fluorescence (Fig.4). Only MK-801 decreased by 38 ± 7% (n = 33 cells tested) the fluorescence signal of the dye.Figure 4Role of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in Zn2+ influx in cortical neurons. In a first step, cortical neurons were superfused with 3 μmZnCl2 in the absence or presence of either 10 μm nifedipine (Nife), 100 μmDNQX, or 2 μm MK-801, and then with TSQ (until the fluorescence reaches a maximal level).

When neurons were exposed to 100 μm Zn2+ for 30 min only, the marked decrease of protein synthesis already measured at the end of this treatment was followed by an almost complete recovery to control levels 3 h after the removal of Zn2+ (Fig. 5). This recovery was accelerated (less than 1 h) by adding the Zn2+chelator, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridyl-methyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN, 10 μm), immediately after the removal of Zn2+(Fig. 5). TSQ fluorescence following Zn2+ removal declined very slowly (92 ± 7% of initial TSQ fluorescence was still detected 1 h after Zn2+ removal). Addition of TPEN just after Zn2+ removal lead to the almost complete disappearance of TSQ fluorescence in less than 2 min (data not shown). We have previously demonstrated that Ca2+ influx in cortical neurons resulting from the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors inhibits protein synthesis. This effect was correlated with the increase in the phosphorylation of eEF-2 by eEF-2 kinase, a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzyme (15Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Prémont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Ca2+-mediated process is likely not the main mechanism responsible for Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis. Indeed, after a 1-h exposure of cortical neurons to Zn2+, eEF-2 was not phosphorylated, whereas protein synthesis was still depressed (Figs. 5 and6). A significant increase in eEF-2 phosphorylation was detected after a 30-min exposure of neurons to 100 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 6) but this phosphorylation was of lower amplitude than that evoked by a maximally effective concentration of glutamate (100 μm, Fig. 6), which only depressed by 50% the rate of protein synthesis in cortical neurons (15Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Prémont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the exposure of neurons to 100 μmZn2+ resulted in a strong decrease of RNA associated with the polyribosomal fraction (Fig. 7), indicating that the initiation but not the elongation step of protein synthesis is likely involved in Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis.Figure 7Effect of Zn2+ on the amount of polyribosome in cortical neurons.

It has been demonstrated in other cell types that these treatments increase the phosphorylation of eIF-2α (25Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Prostko C.R. Dholakia J.N. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6211-6215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, exposure of neurons to Ca2+-free buffer or to thapsigargin increased the incorporation of 32P into eIF-2α by 2.6-fold (data not shown) and 4.1-fold (Fig. 8, a and c), respectively. As shown in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, heavy metals including Zn2+ increase the phosphorylation level of eIF-2α, a process that could account for their ability to inhibit protein translation (16Hurst R. Schatz J.R. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15939-15945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the incorporation of32P into eIF-2α was enhanced when neurons were exposed to 100 μm Zn2+ for 30 min (Fig. 8, aand c). The enhanced phosphorylation of eIF-2α in neurons exposed to Zn2+ or thapsigargin was also observed in Western blotting experiments using an antibody that recognizes specifically the phosphorylated form of the protein (Fig.8 b). As observed for the Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis, eIF-2α phosphorylation still persisted after a 1-h exposure of cortical neurons to Zn2+ (3.2 ± 0.4-fold increase in 32P incorporation into eIF-2α, as compared with the basal level, n = 4). Arguing in favor of the role of eIF-2α phosphorylation in Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis, the magnitude of inhibition of protein synthesis induced by Zn2+ and thapsigargin was correlated with their ability to increase eIF-2α phosphorylation (Fig. 8, c and d). Moreover, the effects of both treatments were not additive (Fig. 8). Increased eIF-2α phosphorylation in neurons exposed to Zn2+ could result from either enhanced eIF-2α kinase activity or inhibition of phosphatase. Indeed, a 30-min exposure of neurons to 100 nmokadaic acid, a nonselective inhibitor of phosphatase 2A, induced an increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation and an inhibition of protein synthesis similar to those evoked by 100 μmZn2+ (data not shown). In this study, we show for the first time that the transient exposure of living cortical neurons to Zn2+ markedly decreases protein synthesis. This effect was observed with concentrations of Zn2+ (10–300 μm) that are in the range of those reached in the extracellular space under physiopathological conditions such as cerebral ischemia (2Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis probably results from the interaction of this heavy metal with intracellular components, as it was enhanced in the presence of the Zn2+ionophore, Na+-pyrithione. This protein synthesis inhibition appears to be slowly reversible, as a recovery to the basal level of radioactive amino acid incorporation into proteins was observed 3 h after the transient exposure (30 min) of cortical neurons to Zn2+. The time course of this recovery process could reflect the slow dissociation rate of Zn2+ from its intracellular binding sites. Indeed, Zn2+ is known to be tightly bound to several intracellular components such as phospholipids (binding to phosphate head groups) (27Ludwig J.C. Chavapil M. Agents Actions. 1981; 9: 65-68Google Scholar), membrane-bound enzymes such as phospholipases (reaction with sulfhydryl groups leading to the formation of stable mercaptides) (28Warren L. Glick M. Nass M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1966; 68: 269-288Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar), or other thiol-containing molecules such as metallothioneins or reduced glutathione (11Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting further this hypothesis, the Zn2+ chelator TPEN accelerated the recovery of protein synthesis to control levels. As already reported, Zn2+ enters neurons by several routes including NMDA and AMPA receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (24Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M.T., Yu, S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.-Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis in cortical neurons (observed in the absence of glutamatergic agonists and under non-depolarizing conditions) persisted in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists or nifedipine, a blocker of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+channels. Similarly, DNQX and nifedipine did not alter TSQ fluorescence signal, but MK-801 partially decreased the fluorescence of the dye. However, for the aforementioned technical considerations, this set of experiments was done in the presence of a low concentration of Zn2+ as compared with those required to observe an inhibition of protein synthesis. Assuming that MK-801 blocks with the same efficiency Zn2+ entry in neurons exposed to 100 μm Zn2+, one can predict from the dose response for Zn2+ on protein synthesis that such a partial decrease of intracellular Zn2+ concentration does not significantly modify the rate of protein translation. Together, these results suggest that the process of Zn2+ influx into neurons that leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis is different from those previously described. We have previously reported that the global protein synthesis in neurons can be inhibited by a Ca2+-dependent process (15Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Prémont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the elongation factor eEF-2 by eEF-2 kinase, a Ca2+ -calmodulin-dependent kinase, appears to be involved in the glutamate-induced reduction of protein synthesis. This conclusion was based on the close correlation between the magnitude of protein synthesis inhibition and the level of eEF-2 phosphorylation (15Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Prémont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two observations suggest that, although Zn2+ does transiently increase eEF-2 phosphorylation, this process is likely not the main mechanism responsible for Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis. First, a 100 μm Zn2+ treatment, which inhibited protein synthesis to a larger extent than that induced by a maximally effective concentration of glutamate (100 μm), led to an increase in eEF-2 phosphorylation significantly lower than that induced by this excitatory amino acid. Second, protein synthesis was still depressed 60 min after the onset of Zn2+ exposure, whereas the recovery to control levels of the phosphorylation state of eEF-2 was almost complete. The decrease in the amount of polyribosome in neurons exposed to Zn2+ suggests that the metal acts instead at the initiation step of protein synthesis, in which the phosphorylation of eIF-2α constitutes a key mechanism of regulation. Three kinases have been found to phosphorylate eIF-2α: the heme-regulated inhibitor of erythroid cells, the interferon-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and the recently discovered PERK (for PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) (25Srivastava S.P.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum or the resulting depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores induces the phosphorylation of eIF-2α (25Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Prostko C.R. Dholakia J.N. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6211-6215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Harding H.P. Zang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). As initially proposed, PKR could be involved in this phosphorylation (25Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Prostko C.R. Dholakia J.N. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6211-6215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, according to two recent reports, there is strong evidence that the newly discovered eIF-2α kinase PERK is implicated in this cellular stress response (31Harding H.P. Zang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 32Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of this kinase may be responsible for both the increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation and the inhibition of protein synthesis found in neurons exposed to either thapsigargin or a Ca2+-free medium. Zn2+ treatment also induced a prominent inhibition of protein synthesis associated with an increased phosphorylation of eIF-2α in cortical neurons. Due to the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes to Zn2+, it is not yet possible to determine whether Zn2+ treatment also evokes a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and therefore whether Zn2+ acts by a mechanism similar to that of thapsigargin. However, in accordance with the involvement of a common process, the effects of Zn2+ and thapsigargin were not additive on both the increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation and the inhibition of protein synthesis. PERK activation could intervene in the unfolded-protein response, which consists of the attenuation of protein synthesis rate following the accumulation of incorrectly folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (31Harding H.P. Zang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). As Zn2+ may alter the folding of newly synthesized peptides (11Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one can speculate that PERK is responsible for the increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation in response to Zn2+, a process that could prevent further accumulation of incorrectly folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation measured in neurons exposed to Zn2+ may also result from the inhibition of phosphatase activity, as okadaic acid induced a similar increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation. As PERK (or PKR) activation involves an autophosphorylation process, one cannot conclude whether the okadaic acid effect results from the inhibition of the dephosphorylation of the kinase or of the initiation factor. A complex consisting of eIF-2α, GTP, and tRNAMet must be formed during each cycle of translation initiation. This requires the regeneration of active eIF-2α by exchange of an eIF-2α-bound GDP for GTP, a process catalyzed by eIF-2B. The affinity of eIF-2B for the phosphorylated α-subunit of eIF-2 is 150-fold greater than for the unphosphorylated form of the protein (33Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the level of eIF-2α in the brain is 5 times higher than that of eIF-2B (34Alcazar A. Martin M.E. Soria E. Rodriguez S. Fando J.L. Salinas M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, one might expect that if only 20% of the total amount of eIF-2α is phosphorylated, most of eIF-2B should become unavailable to catalyze the guanine nucleotide exchange on the remaining unphosphorylated pool of eIF-2α. If the relative amounts of eIF-2α and eIF-2B are in the same range in the brain and in cortical neurons, a relatively low rate of phosphorylation of eIF-2α, as detected in cortical neurons, could account for the large inhibition of protein synthesis induced by Zn2+ treatment or following mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. One important issue concerns the physiological significance of the Zn2+-induced inhibition of protein synthesis. The transient inhibition of protein translation in neurons exposed to Zn2+ might lead to the expression of a new pattern of proteins that can be involved in specific pathological or physiological processes (35Ryazanov A.G. Spirin A.S. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. Plenum Press, New York1993: 433-455Google Scholar, 36Palfrey H.C. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 191-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Apoptosis, but not necrosis, is an active process requiring protein synthesis, which is thus suppressed by protein synthesis inhibitors. Accordingly, we have demonstrated that the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide or diphtheria toxin treatments (which are not toxic by themselves) protects cortical neurons from the toxicity evoked by low concentrations of NMDA (15Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Prémont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are known to selectively induce an apoptotic process (37Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis did not protect neurons against strong excitotoxicity (37Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of protein synthesis seems to constitute a self-protecting mechanism rather than an active deleterious process. However, due to the marked inhibition of protein synthesis induced by Zn2+, which is in the same range as those evoked by cycloheximide and diphtheria toxin treatments, it was impossible to demonstrate such a protective mechanism in Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity. Translational control in neurons could contribute to long term synaptic plasticity such as long term potentiation (LTP). The application of protein synthesis inhibitors during the induction of LTP in the hippocampus reduces its duration to 3–6 h, indicating that a critical level of protein synthesis is required for long term occurrence of LTP (38Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar). The combined phosphorylation of eIF-2α and eEF-2 following Zn2+ and glutamate release during LTP induction could lead to a transient inhibition of protein synthesis, allowing the establishment of a new pattern of protein expression required for the maintenance of LTP. Therefore, the phosphorylation of eIF-2α by Zn2+ and of eEF-2 by glutamate and their convergent consequences on protein translation open new perspectives for understanding the mechanisms implicated in such an unusual co-transmission process. We thank Dr. Christopher Proud for kindly providing us with the monoclonal eIF-2α antibody."

The NPCs of yeast and higher eukaryotes share the same basic architecture, including a characteristic 8-fold symmetry, and are believed to be functionally similar (1Allen T.D. Bennion G.R.

Constitutive and regulated import or export through NPCs is generally energy-dependent and requires substrate-specific transporters that are targetted to the NPC via repeat-containing nucleoporins (or nuclear pore proteins) (4Mattaj I.W.

Yet their precise role in transport reactions and/or in NPC biogenesis is far from being understood. One of the components of the NPC of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nup145p, is expressed as a 145-kDa precursor that is rapidly processed to yield two moieties, a N-terminal domain of 65 kDa (N-Nup145p) and a C-terminal domain of 80 kDa (C-Nup145p) (8Emtage J.L.T.

Nevertheless, deletion of the corresponding part of the NUP145 gene is lethal in a genetic context where other nucleoporins, such as Nup188p and Nic96p, are mutated (9Teixeira M.T. Siniossoglou S.

Whereas the function of C-Nup145p is not disturbed in mutants of Nup145p where processing is abolished, the function of N-Nup145p is affected as judged from its interaction with Nup188p. In addition, mislocalization of N-Nup145p in the nucleoplasm occurs when it is expressed separately from C-Nup145p (9Teixeira M.T. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov S. Benichou J.C. Mann M. Dujon B.

Thus, the existence of a precursor molecule, followed by its processing, are a requisite for the function of N-Nup145p for reasons that remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, the processing of Nup145p is conserved in evolution.

As in yeast, the correct maturation of the Nup98-Nup96 and Nup98 precursors is essential for the proper localization of the subsequent cleavage products, suggesting that it may be important for NPC assembly (17Fontoura B.M.

In this paper, we demonstrate the self-catalyzed processing of Nup145p and localize the processing activity in the N-terminal moiety. The data presented suggest a mechanism involving an ester intermediate as has been described for other self-processing proteins.

Expression was monitored by Western blotting, and the recombinant plasmid was subsequently transformed (22Chen D.-C. Yang B.-C. Kuo T.-T. Curr.

The vectors pE172–175 expressing the His398NC613HA proteins were constructed as was pE151 except that the polymerase chain reaction product was amplified using oligonucleotides E (which introduces the RRASV site) and any of oligonucleotides F, G, H, and I (which introduce the HA tag preceded by the wild type and S606C, S606T, and S606A mutations, respectively). The inserts of these plasmids were completely sequenced (by the MWG-Biotech). For cloning manipulations E. coli strains TG1 (Transgene) or XL2-blue (Stratagene) were used. Purified tagged proteins or those in total extracts from yeast (9Teixeira M.T. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov S. Benichou J.C. Mann M. Dujon B. Hurt E. Fabre E.

The peroxidase conjugates were revealed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast cells expressing the His396NC891His construct were grown in 1 liter of minimal medium (25Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) lacking uracil to an A600 of 7.8, washed, frozen at −70 °C, and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 8) containing 20 mm imidazole. Cells were broken with a French press at 20,000 p.s.i., and the homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was injected into a 1-ml HiTrap Chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously loaded with NiSO4. The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted with a linear imidazole gradient from 20 to 300 mm in buffer A. The His386N and C891His cleavage products eluted at the highest concentration of imidazole. E. coli cells BJ21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) expressing the His396NC891His construct were induced overnight in 800 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were washed, pelleted, resuspended in buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, 8 m urea, pH 8) containing 20 mm imidazole, and sonicated. The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap Chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in an Àkta purifier system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with buffer B containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 20 to 500 mm in buffer B. The tagged products eluted at 200 mm imidazole. Fractions were pooled, diluted 1:8 in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, 8 m urea, pH 8) containing 20 mm NaCl, injected into a 1-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 20 to 600 mm in buffer C. Two major peaks containing, respectively, the His396N (100 mm NaCl, fraction Ec2; see Fig. 2) and the C891His (350 mm NaCl, fraction Ec1; see Fig. 2) were kept for analysis. N-terminal sequences of the His396N and C891His fractions purified in yeast and E. coli(see Fig. 2) were determined by Edman degradation. In the Ec1 fraction (see Fig. 2), two minor bands migrating just above the major band corresponding to C891His (with an N terminus Ser-Ile-Trp) were also sequenced and revealed N termini Met-Lys-Asp and Met-Arg-Glu, corresponding to internal sequences of Nup145p at positions 564 and 583, respectively. We suggest that these forms correspond to products of internal initiations of translation that could not be processed. For the mass-spectrometry determination, 150 μg of purified His396N from E. coli (fraction Ec2; see Fig. 2) was dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized. An aliquot of the pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of water/methanol/formic acid (50:50:10) and introduced to a API 365 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Thornill, Canada). BL21(DE3)pLysS cells expressing the His398NC613HA(S606C) precursor were grown as above, induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. Cells were washed, and the pellet was frozen at −70 °C and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole supplemented with 1 mg of DNase I and 1 mg of RNase A. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 15 min and injected to a 1-ml HiTrap Chelating column as above. The column was washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole until the A280 of the eluant reach a minimum and then eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 20 to 500 mm in buffer A. A peak at 300–400 mm imidazole contained 500 μg of the mixture His398NC613HA(S606C):His398N in a ratio of approximately 60:40 (see below). To prevent cleavage, it was essential to work rapidly and maintain the temperature during the purification at 4 °C or less. The His398NC613HA construct containing the RRASV site was used for in vitro labeling (26Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Colland F. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Buc H. Kolb A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of freshly purified mixture His398NC613HA(S606C):His398N were incubated for 5 min with 6.3 units of the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 2.8 mm DTT, and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (at >4000 Ci/mmol, ICN) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. The protein was then separated from the nonincorporated nucleotides by gel filtration on Bio-gel P (Bio-Rad). For time course experiments, 32P-labeled proteins were incubated at a concentration of about 100 nmin 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8, with or without 50 mm DTT. Reactions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 13% gel, exposed to PhosphorImager cassettes, and analyzed by ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). ImageQuant graphs corresponding to the radioactivity along the gel lane were further analyzed by Igor (WaveMetrix, Inc.) using a double gaussian curve fitting procedure (a kind gift from A. Jacquier). The double gaussian curve was then resolved into two single gaussians and integrated. Previous results suggested that cleavage of Nup145p (Fig.1) occurs around residues 603–606 (9Teixeira M.T. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov S. Benichou J.C. Mann M. Dujon B. Hurt E. Fabre E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5086-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but the cleavage site was not located precisely. Therefore, as a first step toward characterization of the processing mechanism, we decided to characterize the cleavage products of Nup145p. To do so, a truncated version of Nup145p (10Fabre E. Boelens W.C. Wimmer C. Mattaj I.W. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) containing the expected cleavage region and fused at its N and C termini with several His residues (His396NC891His; Fig. 1) was overexpressed in yeast and purified by affinity chromatography using a Nickel column. A Coomassie Blue staining of the purified products (Fig.2, lane Sc) shows a major band corresponding in size to the His396N (around 30 kDa) and a minor band corresponding in size to the C891His (around 40 kDa), demonstrating that this truncated construct retains the capacity to be cleaved in vivo. The difficult solubilization of C891His under the native conditions used for this experiment might account for the nonstoichiometry of the two cleavage products. Despite its low abundance, the C891His moiety was gel purified and subjected to Edman degradation. The sequence Ser-Ile-Trp was found at the N terminus of C891His. This sequence corresponds to a unique internal sequence of Nup145p at positions 606–609 (Fig. 1) and thus demonstrates cleavage of the peptide bond immediately upstream of the serine 606. Autoproteolysis at internal sites preceding serine, cysteine, or threonine positions is now established for several proteins (28Perler F.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It was therefore tempting to hypothesize that cleavage of Nup145p could proceed by the same mechanism. To test this possibility, we decided to examine the maturation of Nup145p in a heterologous expression system. The same truncated protein His396NC891His was expressed in E. coli and purified under denaturing conditions on a Nickel column followed by an anion exchange chromatography. Analyzed fractions contained mainly the His396N or the C891His form (Fig. 2, lanes Ec2 and Ec1, respectively), confirming that the cleavage of this precursor also takes place inE. coli. Note that the His396N produced inE. coli has a slightly slower electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE than the His396N produced in yeast. This might be due to post-translational modifications in S. cerevisiae(see “Discussion”). N-terminal microsequencing of the C891His gel purified band (Fig. 2, lane Ec1) revealed an N terminus beginning with the sequence Ser-Ile-Trp, showing that the N terminus of C891His generated by in vivo cleavage is the same in yeast and E. coli. Thus, Nup145p cleavage either requires a trans-acting factor that is present in E. coli or is catalyzed by the Nup145p protein itself. The results presented above show that cleavage occurs at the peptidyl bond preceding the serine 606 generating a free amino group. To characterize the C-terminal generated by the proteolytic reaction, we analyzed the purified His396N produced in E. coli (Fig. 2, lane Ec2) by mass spectrometry. One peak at 26,428 ± 83 Da was obtained that corresponds to the theoretical mass expected for the His396N lacking the first methionine (26,427.41 Da). N-terminal microsequencing of the gel purified band (Fig. 2, lane Ec2) indeed confirms that His396N starts with the glycine immediately following the methionine. From these measurements, we conclude that proteolysis occurs between phenylalanine 605 and serine 606 and that the last residue of His396N generated by cleavage is not additionally modified. Cleavage in E. coli is therefore the result of hydrolysis of the 605–606 peptide bond, generating two peptides with free C and N termini. Self-proteolysis reactions preceding serines, cysteines, or threonines involve a nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl or thiol group of the respective amino acids on the preceding peptide bond, resulting in the replacement of the peptide bond by an ester or a thioester bond (28Perler F.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These bonds are more reactive than the peptide bonds and can then be attacked by a second nucleophile and broken. This model implies that any of the three residues serine, cysteine, or threonine is essential for the reaction and can be replaced by one another with only limited effects on catalytic activity (29Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Xu M.Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because Nup145p cleavage takes place before a serine, we tested the importance of the hydroxyl residue in the reaction. Therefore, serine 606 was replaced by a cysteine, a threonine, or an alanine by directed mutagenesis. For experimental purposes, we used an even shorter truncated version of Nup145p (His398NC613HA; Fig. 1), where the C-Nup145p is almost entirely substituted by the HA tag. Each construct was then transformed into E. coli, and expression of the encoded protein was induced. The processing capacity of the different precursors was analyzed at different times after induction (Fig. 3). For the wild type form His398NC613HA(WT), a major band that corresponds in size to the mature N-terminal moiety is revealed by Western blot using the antibody directed against the His tag (Fig. 3, α-His). This band is nearly constant in intensity for all time points analyzed after induction. The antibody directed against the HA tag only detects a faint band migrating about 2 kDa above the mature form as expected for the precursor molecule (Fig. 3, α-HA). This experiment indicates that the truncated version of Nup145p retains the capacity to undergo cleavage in vivo and that the processing is already efficient even at early stages after induction. Thus, deletion of most C-Nup145p does not affect the cleavage capacity. On the contrary, expression of the S606A mutation leads to the formation of a single major band throughout the kinetics experiment corresponding in size to the precursor and reacting with both anti-His (Fig. 3, α-His) and anti-HA (Fig. 3, α-HA) antibodies. Thus, the S606A mutation completely abolishes proteolytic cleavage of the precursor molecule. Expression of the S606C mutant produced two anti-His reacting forms. They correspond respectively to the precursor form, which also reacts with the anti-HA antibody and with the mature N-terminal form (Fig. 3), showing that proteolytic cleavage can take place in this mutant. The precursor form is the major product at early stages after induction (Fig. 3, α-His, 1.5 h and decreases at later stages (Fig. 3, α-His, 6 h. This shows that the cleavage reaction is delayed in this mutant compared with the results obtained for the wild type. The situation is similar for the S606T mutant, with the difference that the ratio of precursor to product observed along the time course is slightly lower, suggesting that this mutation is less deleterious to the cleavage reaction in vivo. Overall, these results suggest that a hydroxyl- or thiol-containing residue at the cleavage junction is required for the reaction. To demonstrate definitively that the cleavage of the Nup145p precursor is a self-catalyzed process, we undertook the purification of a precursor form and tested its ability to undergo self-cleavage in vitro. Precursor purification from the wild type construct would be very difficult because of the high efficiency of the in vivo processing (see above). We therefore made use of the mutants S606C and S606T to define conditions under which the precursor form accumulates. The best yield of uncleaved precursor was obtained using the S606C mutant induced for a short time (45 min) at 30 °C (data not shown). Protein products were then extracted and purified on a nickel column under native conditions. The purification was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.4 A). Two major bands corresponding respectively to the His398NC613HA(S606C) precursor and to the His398N product were obtained, indicating that partial cleavage of the precursor does occur during extraction but that the proportion of precursor molecules is sufficiently high to allow subsequent analysis in in vitro reactions. To quantify the cleavage reactions, we chose to follow radiolabeled products. For this purpose, we introduced the artificial pentapeptide phosphorylation site RRASV (26Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Colland F. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Buc H. Kolb A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) following the His tag in the His398NC613HA construct. Using [γ-32P]ATP as substrate, the purified mixture His398NC613HA(S606C):His398N was labeled by phosphorylation using a commercial bovine kinase. Analysis of proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by gel scanning shows that both His398NC613HA(S606C) and His398N were successfully labeled (Fig. 4 B, 0 min). The next step was to determine adequate conditions for the in vitro cleavage. To do so, we hypothesized that the requirement for a hydroxyl (or thiol) group at the cleavage site of Nup145p precursor reflects the involvement of an ester (or a thioester) intermediate in the mechanism. Because thioesters are particularly susceptible to nucleophiles (31Jencks W.P. Cordes S. Carriulo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3608-3614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to test for the reactivity of His398NC613HA(S606C) in the presence of DTT known to accelerate this type of reaction (30Xu M.Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Porter J.A. von Kessler D.P. Ekker S.C. Young K.E. Lee J.J. Moses K. Beachy P.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 33Chong S. Williams K.S. Wotkowicz C. Xu M.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10567-10577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The in vitro cleavage was then performed with or without 50 mm DTT at 30 °C, and aliquots of the reaction were analyzed at different times (Fig. 4 B). In the presence of DTT, the band corresponding to the precursor decreases concomitantly with the increase of the band corresponding to the mature product. This precursor-product kinetic relationship demonstrates that His398NC613HA(S606C) has the capacity to self-process in vitro into His398N in the presence of DTT. In the absence of DTT, the ratio His398NC613HA(S606C):His398N is maintained during the 2 h of the reaction (Fig. 4 B). Because DTT-induced cleavage could involve the thiol as a nucleophile or as a reductant, we made use of a nonthiol disulfide reductant, the tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (34Burns J.A. Butler J.C. Moran J. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 2648-2650Crossref Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We found that the half-life of the precursor in the presence of 50 mmtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was increased 15 times compared with the reaction in the presence of 50 mm DTT in a 2 h reaction (see below and data not shown). This suggests that the accelerating effect of DTT on the in vitro cleavage reaction is due to its ability to carry out nucleophilic attack. Longer times of incubation were attempted, but results were obscured by unspecific secondary reactions, which might be due to partial denaturation of the precursor. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that reaction is less efficient at higher concentrations of protein, resulting in its precipitation (data not shown). Quantification of the reaction was done from three independent experiments (Fig. 4 C). At time 0 of the experiments, the ratio His398NC613HA(S606C):His398N was ∼60:40. In the presence of DTT, this ratio decreased to about 30:70 in 2 h, whereas in the absence of DTT, it remained unchanged. The points obtained for the incubation in the presence of DTT suggest a (pseudo) first order reaction, and the precursor half-life time is comprised between 8.6 and 11.5 min. Under the conditions used, approximately half of the purified precursor was able to cleave into the mature form. The incomplete character of the reaction might be due to partial denaturation of the molecules as mentioned above. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the independent secondary reactions may become non-negligible at late times of incubation, either because of the purification process or because of other uncharacterized proprieties of the precursor. Post-translational cleavage of the yeast nucleoporin Nup145p generates two functionally distinct proteins. The different lines of evidence presented here support the notion that this reaction is self-catalyzed. First, Nup145p cleavage is observed in heterologous expression systems including E. coli and a mammalianin vitro transcription/translation system (data not shown). Second, a purified precursor form of Nup145p is cleaved in vitro following a (pseudo) first order reaction kinetics (at least for the early times of the reaction) and cleavage occurs in highly diluted samples, free of detectable contaminants. The participation of a hypothetical specific trans-acting factor, conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, is therefore highly improbable. Third, all our results are consistent with the mechanism described for autoproteolysis taking place in peptide bonds preceding hydroxyl- or thiol-containing residues; in particular, the in vitroreaction studied here is dependent upon the presence of DTT. It has been known since the 1960s that peptide bonds involving hydroxyl-containing residues can shift to ester bonds (N>O acyl rearrangement) under laboratory conditions (35Iwai K. Ando T. Methods Enzymol. 1967; XI: 263-282Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There is now formal evidence that these reactions exist in several protein maturation pathways, including protein splicing (36Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), hedgehog protein maturation (32Porter J.A. von Kessler D.P. Ekker S.C. Young K.E. Lee J.J. Moses K. Beachy P.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), pyruvoyl enzymes (37van Poelje P.D. Snell E.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 29-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases (29Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Frommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P.M. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) activations. In these cases, the hydroxyl- or thiol-containing residues, serine, threonine, or cysteine, undergo a N>O or a N>S acyl-shift resulting in an ester or thioester bond much more reactive than the peptide bond. The ester or thioester bond is then resolved by an attack by a second nucleophile that can be for example water (N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases) (39Guan C. Liu Y. Shao Y. Cui T. Liao W. Ewel A. Whitaker R. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9695-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or cholesterol (hedgehog) (40Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Our results do not provide direct evidence for the exact reaction mechanism involved but are consistent with previous mechanisms since they include (i) the cleavage site before a serine, (ii) requirement for a hydroxyl or thiol group at the cleavage position, (iii) the sensitivity of in vitro cleavage of the S606C mutant to DTT, and (iv) the incapacity of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to promote such a cleavage. In addition, cleavage of Nup145p in E. coli results from the hydrolysis of peptide bond 605–606, indicating that water might account for the second nucleophilic attack. We cannot exclude, however, that the proteolysis in yeast may involve other modifications, as suggested by the difference in electrophoretic mobility observed for the His396N produced in yeast and in bacteria. This situation may be reminiscent of hedgehog processing, where the covalent addition of cholesterol during the self-catalyzed processing results in an increased mobility on SDS-PAGE of the mature protein (40Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar,41Porter J.A. Ekker S.C. Park W.J. von Kessler D.P. Young K.E. Chen C.H. Ma Y. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain for the proteolysis of Nup145p must be included between amino acids 398 and 613 because the minimal protein used in this study, His398NC613HA, is still able to undergo self-processing. Taken together with other independent experiments (8Emtage J.L.T. Bucci M. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 911-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the catalytic site can be narrowed down to the regions containing amino acids 398–523 and 593–613. Furthermore, deletion of the region comprised between residues 470 and 551 abolishes cleavage (10Fabre E. Boelens W.C. Wimmer C. Mattaj I.W. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This latter region contains a RNP-I-like octapeptide motif (Fig.1) and was proposed to be responsible for RNA affinity of Nup145pin vitro (10Fabre E. Boelens W.C. Wimmer C. Mattaj I.W. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments show that point mutations in this octapeptide also affect cleavage (data not shown), suggesting that this region may be part of the catalytic site or necessary for its correct folding. Nup145p has a putative homologue in vertebrates, Nup98-Nup96, that is also cleaved in vivo at the serine of the conserved cleavage site (17Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity between Nup98-Nup96 and Nup145p (9Teixeira M.T. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov S. Benichou J.C. Mann M. Dujon B. Hurt E. Fabre E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5086-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) is particularly extensive in the region that we have determined as necessary for the self-processing of Nup145p. It can thus be proposed that the mechanism of processing of the Nup98-Nup96 precursor is also self-catalyzed. Self-processing systems offer the advantage that the specificity is built up into a single molecule (42Little J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4943-4950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and limit the control of the cell over the reaction unless specific interactions may affect the reaction in vivo. Interestingly, maturation of either yeast Nup145p or rat Nup98-Nup96, has a direct role in the localization of the precursor and the subsequent cleavage products (9Teixeira M.T. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov S. Benichou J.C. Mann M. Dujon B. Hurt E. Fabre E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5086-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,17Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, self-cleavage of these nucleoporin precursors may have been conserved in eukaryotes for the specific targeting to the NPC. Another report of self-catalysis of rat Nup98 precursor appeared while this article was in press (Rosenblum, J. S., and Blobel, G. (1999) Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 11370–11375). We thank J.

Here, we report the cloning of an ankyrin repeat-containing protein, termed F1Aα, in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas (CD95/APO-1) as bait. Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that F1Aα has extensive homology to the sex-determining protein FEM-1 of the Caenorhabditis elegans, which is required for the development of all aspects of the male phenotype. F1Aα associates with the cytoplasmic domains of Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, two prototype members of the “death receptor” family. The F1Aα protein also oligomerizes. Overexpression of F1Aα induces apoptosis in mammalian cells, and co-expression of Bcl-XL or the dominant negative mutants of either FADD or caspase-9 blocks this effect. Deletion analysis revealed the center region of F1Aα, including a cluster of five ankyrin repeats to be necessary and sufficient for maximum apoptotic activity, and the N-terminal region appears to regulate negatively this activity. Furthermore, F1Aα is cleaved by a caspase-3-like protease at Asp342, and the cleavage-resistant mutant is unable to induce apoptosis upon overexpression.

Homologues of the key apoptosis genes of C. elegans have been identified in other organisms including mammals, suggesting that the molecular strategies that regulate this important biological process are likely to be conserved across species.

In addition to autoactivation and activation of other caspases, caspases are thought to participate in apoptosis by disabling important cellular processes and breaking down structural components of the cell. Caspases also activate signaling molecules that upon cleavage commit the cells to apoptosis.

In our effort intended to identify additional components of the death receptor signaling pathways, we identified an ankyrin-repeat containing protein, termed F1Aα, in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse Fas receptor (mFas) as bait. The amino acid sequence of F1Aα is highly homologous to the C. elegans protein, FEM-1, which is essential for achieving all aspects of the male phenotype in the nematode (31Spence A.M. Coulson A. Hodgkin J. Cell. 1990; 60: 981-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). F1Aα binds to mFas, TNFR1, and itself. Overexpression of F1Aα induces apoptosis in MCF7 cells that can be blocked by expression of Bcl-XL or the dominant negative mutants of either FADD or caspase-9. F1Aα is therefore a member of a growing family of death receptor-associated proteins (25Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

Mono- and polyclonal antibodies against the Myc epitope (9E10, A14) and polyclonal antibody against the HA epitope (Y11) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope (12CA5) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibody against PARP (C2–10) was from Dr. G. Poirier, CHUL Research Center, Canada. HeLa, 293, and NIH3T3 were originally from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The TNF-sensitive MCF7 (breast carcinoma cells) was provided by Dr. V. Dixit, University of Michigan. Cell lines were grown according to the directions provided by suppliers. All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (100 mg of streptomycin/ml and 100 IU of penicillin/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). The peptide protease inhibitors YVAD-fmk, Z-VAD-fmk and DEVD-fmk were from Enzyme System Products, CA. USA. Recombinant caspase-3, -6, -7, and 8 were purchased from PharMingen. Plasmids containing the cDNA for TNFR1 and NGFR were from M. Chao, Cornell University Medical College and mFas from K. B. Elkon, Cornell University. DNA fragments for plasmid constructs containing mFas-IC-(166–306), mFas-FD5-(166–292), TNFR1-IC-(205–426), TNFR1-ICΔ15-(205–411), and NGFR-IC-(271–427) were obtained by PCR amplification using the ExpandTM high fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with primers incorporated with appropriate restriction sites and epitope tags as needed into the pXJ40 mammalian expression vector driven by the CMV promoter (36Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5366-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). F1Aα expression vector was constructed by PCR amplification of cDNA fragment from the full-length positive clone obtained in the cDNA screen. The PCR primers were incorporated with appropriate restriction sites for insertion of the amplified fragment such that it was in-frame with the sequences encoding the Myc- or HA epitope in the pXJ40 mammalian expression vector driven by the CMV promoter (36Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5366-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The constructs were sequenced to ensure that no PCR error was introduced. Unless otherwise stated all epitope tags are at the N termini. The N-terminal deletion mutants of F1Aα were generated by PCR and re-ligation of appropriate 5′ end fragment to the original F1Aα construct to avoid mutation introduced by PCR error. DNA fragments generated by PCR and the junctions of insertion were confirmed by sequencing. The C-terminal deletion mutants of F1Aα were made by introducing a stop codon mutation at the indicated position, and point mutations were performed using the TransformerTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH). cDNA encoding Bcl-XL, and caspase-9 were obtained from Craig B. Thompson, The University of Chicago, and Peng Li, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, respectively. FADD-DN (FADD-(80–208)) was obtained by PCR and caspase-9-DN (caspase-9-C287A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The methodology and reagents used for the yeast two-hybrid cloning were essentially the same as described in Bai and Elledge (37Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HB12 was cloned from a GAL4 AD-tagged human B cell library kindly provided by Dr. S. Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine. Briefly, the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse Fas antigen and mFas-FD5-(166–292) were obtained by PCR and cloned in-frame, as confirmed by sequencing, into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pAS1-CYH2. Screening was performed according to the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System Protocol (CLONTECH) in the presence of 30 mm 3-aminotrizole. The binding properties of HB12, as well as of the other examined proteins, were assessed in the yeast Y190 reporter strain. Filter lift assays for β-galactosidase activity were performed to detect interaction between fusion proteins. The following heterologous proteins were expressed in GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector to test for possible interaction with the putative positive clones isolated from the primary screen: p53, retinoic acid receptor (hRARα), retinoid X receptor (hRXRα), SNF, lamin, and CDK2. Two cDNA fragments of approximately 400 base pairs from the 5′ and 3′ ends of HB12 were labeled with [32P]dATP and used to screen human pancreas and spleen λgt11 cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) using standard techniques as described (38Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). 106 clones of each libraries were screened. Positive clones were isolated and the cDNA inserts from these clones were subcloned into the pBSK(II) vector (Stratagene) and characterized. The human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a32P-labeled cDNA insert obtained from anXhoI digestion of Gal4ad-HB12 clone, using the ExpressHybTM Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Sequences encoding mFas-IC, mFas-FD5, TNFR1-IC, TNFR1-ICΔ15, FADD, and retinoid X receptor were excised from pAS vector as NdeI-SalI orNcoI-SalI fragments and cloned in-frame into GST fusion protein vector pGEX-TK4E (38Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL 21. GST and GST fusion protein were prepared by standard methods (38Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V.

Labeled F1Aα was prepared by in vitro transcription/translation of pXJ-HA-F1Aα using TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega. The integrity of the 35S-labeled proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE. For in vitro protein interaction, equal amounts of total 35S-labeled lysate (500,000 cpm of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts) were diluted into 1 ml of GST binding buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 5 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 1 h with the various GST fusion proteins immobilized on the beads (approximately 2 μg). Samples were subsequently washed 6 times with binding buffer and boiled for 3 min in loading buffer before fractionation on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum to 80% confluency. Transfection was carried out with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with the LipofectAMINE/DNA mixture for 12 h followed by change of fresh media. The cells were harvested 8 h after change of media and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 350 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). An aliquot (10 μl) of the cell lysates was fractionated on SDS-PAGE for visualization of the expression of proteins. The remaining cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of polyclonal anti-HA antibody for 1 h on ice and then mixed with 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose and incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed once in 1 ml of lysis buffer, 2 times in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and 2 times in 1 ml of lysis buffer before fractionation on SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analyses were performed subsequently with procedure as described previously (39Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. MCF7 cells were maintained in a 35-mm dish in RPMI media supplemented with fetal bovine serum and transfected using LipofectAMINE. Transfections were carried out in 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 6 h after which 1 ml of serum-containing RPMI was added. β-Galactosidase assays were performed on the cells 18 h later which was 24 h post-transfection or 48 h post-transfection as indicated. The cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 1× PBS for 5 min at 4 °C, and stained with a histochemical reaction mixture (5 mmpotassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml X-gal) at 37 °C. After 16 h, cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy. For detection of PARP cleavage, MCF7 cells cultured on 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (39Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The extracts were fractionated on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analyses using PARP-specific antibody (C2–10). The assay was performed with procedure as described previously (40Ronca F. Yee K.S.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18128-18134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and transfected with plasmids expressing F1Aα, its deletion mutants, or vector control. 24 h after transfection, the cells in monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed for 5 min at 4 °C with absolute methanol (−20 °C). The washing step with PBS was then repeated once. To stain the nuclei, the cells were incubated for 10 min with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) and then washed with PBS. The coverslips with the stained cells were mounted in 80% glycerol in PBS containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine and examined with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Cleavage reactions were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C. 5 × 105 cpm of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled F1Aα or mutants were incubated with bacterially expressed active forms of caspase-3 (0.1 μg), caspase-6 (0.2 μg), caspase-7 (0.1 μg), and caspase-8 (0.5 μg) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to isolate clones that may interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse Fas receptor (mFas). The cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 166–292 of mFas (mFasFD5) was cloned in-frame with the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (GBD-mFasFD5) and used to screen a human B cell library. A truncated cytoplasmic domain of Fas (mFasFD5) was used because deletion of a negative regulatory region at the C terminus of Fas markedly enhances its ability to mediate apoptosis (18Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to bind FADD (25Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 million independent transformants were screened, and 17 putative positive clones were identified, of which two failed to show interaction with any of the heterologous proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequence analysis revealed that one of the clones encoded the full-length FADD/MORT1 (18Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), whereas the other clone, HB12, contains a partial complementary DNA with an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 469 amino acids. Although the HB12 clone encoded an N-terminal truncated protein, the 469 amino acid polypeptide may contain the effector domain of the full-length protein. Since HB12 interacted with the death receptors, its ability to modulate apoptosis was evaluated by overexpressing HB12 in MCF7 cells by transient transfection. MCF7 cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase as a marker for transfected cells and expression vector containing clone HB12 or control vector. In the plate transfected with the HB12 clone, a significant percentage of total blue (β-galactosidase-positive) cells displayed the round cell morphology typical of cells that are undergoing apoptosis (Fig.1 A). Chromatin condensation, another hallmark of apoptosis, was evident among the nuclei of the round cells when they were stained with the Hoechst 33342 fluorescent dye (Fig. 1 B). Proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which serves as a marker for the activation of caspases in cells undergoing apoptosis (41Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar), was also observed in cells transfected with HB12 expression vector (Fig. 1 C). HB12-induced cell death was inhibited by the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and DEVD-fmk (Fig. 1 D). The cleavage of PARP to the signature 85-kDa apoptotic fragment in the MCF7 cells transfected with HB12 was completely blocked by treatment of the cells with 20 μm Z-VAD-fmk or DEVD-fmk (Fig. 1 C). By using HB12 cDNA fragment as a probe, we screened a human hypothalamus cDNA library (CLONTECH) and obtained several cross-hybridizing cDNA clones. One of these, clone HH6.15, contained a 3.1-kb cDNA insert with a 1881-nucleotide open reading frame beginning with a translational initiation consensus sequence (42Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar) and predicted a protein of 627 amino acids with a molecular mass of 70 kDa (Fig.2). A corresponding murine cDNA clone was subsequently obtained by screening a mouse testis library. The amino acid sequence deduced from the murine cDNA clone is virtually identical to that of the human clone (Fig. 2 A). Data base searches revealed that the predicted protein shares extensive similarity throughout the entire sequence, including the presence of six tandemly arranged ankyrin-repeats at the N terminus (Fig.2 B), with the sex-determining protein in C. elegans known as FEM-1 (Fig. 2 A). Because of its ability to modulate apoptosis in mammalian cells we named the protein F1A for FEM-1-like protein in theapoptotic pathway. To determine the tissue distribution of F1A mRNA, Northern analysis was performed with the HB12 cDNA as a probe. Two transcripts, 5.5 and 7.5 kb, were found to be ubiquitously distributed, with varying abundance; two additional smaller transcripts, 1.35 and 2.5 kb, were found only in the testis (Fig. 2 C). In the mouse tissues, only the ubiquitously distributed 7.5-kb and the testis-specific 2.4-kb transcripts were detected (data not shown). The different transcripts may be generated by alternate splicing or derived from other related genes. Sequence analysis of several independent partial cDNA clones failed to detect the existence of splice variants or related family members. However, a search in the EST data base from NCBI has revealed several human and murine cDNA clones that share high level of similarity (>30%) in amino acid sequence with F1A, suggesting F1A might be a member of a gene family. During the preparation of this manuscript, the deduced amino acid sequence of two members, Fem1a and Fem1b, of a mouse gene family was reported (43Ventura-Holman T. Seldin M.F. Li W. Maher J.F. Genomics. 1998; 54: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Fem1b is identical to that of mF1A confirming that F1A is indeed a member of a gene family. We therefore refer to our protein as F1Aα. In the two-hybrid assay, clone HB12 (F1Aα-(159–627)) interacted with mFas-FD5-(166–292) and the intracellular domain of TNFR1 (TNFR1-IC-(205–426)). Radiolabeledin vitro translated full-length F1Aα was tested forin vitro binding with various glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (Fig.3 A). F1Aα specifically associated with GST-mFas-FD5 and GST-TNFR1-IC in the assay but not with either GST or GST-FADD. In contrast to the two-hybrid results (data not shown), F1Aα interacted equally well with both GST-mFas-IC-(166–306) and GST-mFas-FD5. Parallel experiments using HB12 clone, F1Aα-(159–627), yielded identical results (data not shown). In vitro self-association of F1Aα was not evaluated because we were unable to obtain a reasonable yield of GST-F1Aα; however,35S-F1Aα was found to associate with GST-F1Aα-(482–627) (data not shown). To demonstrate these interactions in vivo, full-length F1Aα tagged with the HA epitope (HA-F1Aα) was expressed with Myc-tagged mFas-FD5, TNFR1-IC, TNFR1-ICΔ15-(205–411) or F1Aα in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Expression of the cytoplasmic domain of the death receptors resulted in poor yields of the expressed proteins as a result of extensive cell death. To prevent this, Z-VAD-fmk at 20 μm was added to the culture media. HA-F1Aα was immunoprecipitated, and the associated Fas, TNFR1, and F1Aα were detected by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. These Myc-tagged proteins did not form nonspecific immunoprecipitates with the HA antibody (data not shown). The cytoplasmic domains of mFas-FD5, TNFR1-ICΔ15, and TNFR1-IC (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2, 4, and5) associated with F1Aα, whereas FADD, NGFR-IC, the cytoplasmic domain of the p75 NGF receptor that is a closely related member of the TNF receptor superfamily, and mFas-IC did not. The inability of mFas-IC to interact with F1Aα in the mammalian cells and HB12 in yeast suggests that an in vivo mechanism may have restricted its accessibility to the protein. Similar to other signaling components serving members of the TNF/NGF receptor superfamily, F1Aα was able to self-associate in vivo (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). To delineate the functional domain of F1Aα responsible for the apoptotic effect, MCF7 cells were transiently transfected w"

The 5′ end of the ccsB gene, which is involved in the maturation process and resembles the ccs1 gene fromChlamydomonas reinhardtii, was replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance cartridge in the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The resulting Δ(M1-A24) mutant lacking the first 24 ccsB codons grew only under anaerobic conditions. The mutant retained about 20% of the wild-type amount of processed cytochrome f with heme attached, apparently assembled in a functional cytochromeb6 f complex. Moreover, the mutant accumulated unprocessed apocytochrome f in its membrane fraction. A pseudorevertant was isolated that regained the ability to grow under aerobic conditions. The locus of the second-site mutation was mapped to ccsB, and the mutation resulted in the formation of a new potential start codon in the intergenic region, between the chloramphenicol resistance marker and ccsB, in frame with the remaining part of ccsB. In this pseudorevertant the amount of holocyt f increased, whereas that of unprocessed apocytochrome f decreased. We suggest that the original deletion mutant Δ(M1-A24) expresses an N-terminally truncated version of the protein. The stable accumulation of unprocessed apocytochrome f in membranes of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant may be explained by its association with truncated and only partially functional CcsB protein resulting in protection from degradation. Our attempt to delete the first 244 codons ofccsB in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was not successful, suggesting that this would lead to a lack of functional cytochrome b6 f complex.

This posttranslational process involves heme and apocytochrome transport from the cytoplasm into the periplasm in bacteria, into the intermembrane space in mitochondria, or into the thylakoid lumen in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, followed by heme attachment to apocytochrome. Remarkably, three separate pathways of maturation of c-type cytochromes evolved among various organisms (1Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 2Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Fergusson S.J. Trends Biochem.

For Saccharomyces cerevisiae and animal mitochondria only one type of protein, the cyt c lyase, has been shown to be essential for the heme attachment step (6Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Hampsey D.M. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Zollner A. Rodel G. Haid A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The lyase was shown to interact directly with both heme (8Steiner H. Kispal G. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32605-32611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and apocytochrome (9Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12390-12397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and therefore it is assumed to function in the catalysis of thioether bond formation between heme and cysteine residues of apocytochrome. In contrast to yeast mitochondria, mutational analysis of Gram-negative bacteria implicated about ten genes in assembly of both soluble and membrane-associated c-type cytochromes. In Escherichia coli, eight of the genes required for cyt c maturation are organized in an operon (10Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Künzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene products involved can be divided into several subprocesses: (a) heme delivery, (b) transfer of reducing power from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, and (c) proper heme attachment. Bacterialc-type apocytochromes are normally synthesized with an N-terminal signal sequence that is recognized by the Sec system for protein translocation across the membrane and by the signal peptidase for processing (11Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cytochrome c biosynthesis pathway in chloroplasts, cyanobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria is more obscure (5Xie Z. Culler D. Dreyfuss B.W. Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. Girard-Bascou J. Merchant S. Genetics. 1998; 148: 681-692PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hübschmann T. Wilde A. Elanskaya I. Shestakov S.V. Börner T.

Only three genes have been identified thus far to be required for cytc maturation. Functionally, the pathways in chloroplasts and Gram-negative systems are very similar and cyanobacterial cytochromes can be functionally assembled in E. coli (14Diaz A. Navarro F. Hervas M. Navarro J.A. Florencio F.J. de la Rosa F.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, obvious sequence similarities between the components of the two systems are limited to one putative cytochrome binding site (15Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and a protein involved in transfer of reducing power across the membrane (16Page M.D. Saunders N.F.W. Fergusson S.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3111-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). InChlamydomonas reinhardtii, the chloroplast-encodedccsA gene (15Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and a nuclear-encoded ccs1 gene (17Inoue K. Dreyfuss B.W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Merchant S. Sodeinde O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31747-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were identified as indispensable for heme attachment. The CcsA and Ccs1 proteins were suggested to function together in a complex, as inactivation of either of the two genes leads to deficiency in both proteins (1Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 5Xie Z. Culler D. Dreyfuss B.W. Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. Girard-Bascou J. Merchant S. Genetics. 1998; 148: 681-692PubMed Google Scholar). In some systems heme attachment can proceed spontaneously (18Goldman B.S. Kranz R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Sambongi Y. Crooke H. Cole J.A. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This implies that components of the cytc maturation pathways may not be directly involved in the formation of thioether bonds but rather in bringing together both substrates in the right conformation and in the correct redox state so that heme attachment can occur. This paper describes characterization of a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant carrying a 5′ deletion of the open reading frameslr2087 (nomenclature according to CyanoBase), which is similar to ccs1 and which we have named ccsB. Moreover, an attempt is reported to inactivate a much larger portion ofslr2087 as well as sll1513, coding for CcsA. Wild type and mutants ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were grown in liquid BG-11 medium (21Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) at 30 °C at 40 μE/m2·s on a rotary shaker. Strains were grown with 5 mm glucose unless photoautotrophic conditions are indicated. For anaerobic growth, the strains were grown in a 1% CO2, 99% N2atmosphere. Oxygen evolution was measured as described earlier (22Tichy M. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using a Clark-type electrode in the presence of 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 mmdimethyl-p-benzoquinone (DMBQ) for PS II activity, or 10 mm NaHCO3 for whole chain electron transport. Chlorophyll afluorescence induction and decay were detected with a Walz pulse-amplitude-modulation fluorometer and recorded using the program FIP (QA Data, Turku, Finland). Actinic illumination came from a pulse-amplitude-modulation 102 L LED lamp. For fluorescence induction 1 μm2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB) was added where indicated. Fluorescence decay was measured after 3 s of actinic illumination. Cells in late exponential phase were pelleted and were resuspended in thylakoid buffer (1/100 of the original culture volume) containing 50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2, and 10% glycerol (v/v). Cell suspensions (0.7 ml) were transferred to 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes, mixed with an equal volume of glass beads (90-μm diameter), and kept on ice. The cells were broken in a MiniBeadBeater. The homogenate was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant represents the soluble cell fraction; the pelleted thylakoids were resuspended in the original volume of thylakoid buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without urea. A 15% polyacrylamide gel (a 15–20% gradient gel for detection of cyt c553) was used for separation; the stacking gel was 5.5% polyacrylamide. Samples were solubilized in sample buffer at room temperature for 15 min before loading on the gel. A total of 50 μg of protein was loaded per lane. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (MSI, Westboro, MA) using the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot system. Blotted membranes were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against cytf, cyt b6, Rieske, and subunit IV (1:1,000 dilution). Bound primary antibody was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antibodies were gifts from A. Barkan (University of Oregon, Eugene, OR) (raised against maize Rieske and cyt f) and R. Malkin (University of California, Berkeley, CA) (raised against spinach cyt f, cytb6, and subunit IV). Gels were stained for cytochromes using the heme staining procedure with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and H2O2(23Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Lewin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cytochromes were identified on membranes after transfer by a heme staining procedure using enhanced chemiluminescence (17Inoue K. Dreyfuss B.W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Merchant S. Sodeinde O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31747-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this paper a unified nomenclature ofccs (c-type cytochrome synthesis) genes will be used that is appropriate for organisms using the chloroplast/cyanobacterial pathway of cyt c maturation. Accm (cyt c maturation) nomenclature has been proposed for organisms using the pathway of Gram-negative bacteria (10Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Künzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table I the current nomenclature of genes involved in cyt c maturation in chloroplast, cyanobacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria is very different for different organisms. In this paper, ccsA will refer to the cyanobacterial homologue of the ccsA gene ofC. reinhardtii; ccsB will denote theSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 homologue of C. reinhardtii Ccs1, whose product is thought to form a complex with CcsA; last, ccsC will denote the two putative Synechocystissp. PCC 6803 genes homologous to Bacillus subtilis ccdA, which codes for the protein suggested to be involved in the transfer of reducing power across the membrane.Table IGenes coding for components implicated in the cytochrome c maturation in cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp.

Open table in a new tab The Synechocystissp. PCC 6803 ccsB (slr2087) gene was identified by its similarity to Ccs1 from C. reinhardtii(38% identity at the protein sequence level). Two deletion mutants were generated. In the first mutant, a chloramphenicol resistance marker (1.5 kilobases) from pACYC184 was introduced around the translation start site of ccsB, replacing the region between the NaeI site 53-bp upstream from the translation start site and the BglII site 72-bp downstream of the translation start site of the 1,374-bp-long ccsB gene. This mutant will be referred as Δ(M1-A24), the name reflecting the amino acids that have been deleted. In the second mutant, Δ(M1-I244), the deleted region was between the BclI sites 82-bp upstream and 732-bp downstream of the translation start site of the ccsB gene. Interestingly, the phenotypes of both mutants were different. The Δ(M1-A24) transformant did not segregate its wild type and mutant genome copies when grown under ambient aerobic conditions (data not shown), but segregation was obtained easily under anaerobic conditions. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains multiple genome copies per cell, and lack of segregation of wild-type and mutant gene copies in the presence of high concentrations of a selectable marker usually indicates that the presence of the particular gene that is attempted to be deleted is indispensable for cell survival. Segregation of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant was checked by PCR (Fig.1). However, we were unable to segregate the Δ(M1-I244) mutant in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (data not shown). However, the partially segregated Δ(M1-I244) mutant also appeared to be oxygen sensitive. As the Δ(M1-I244) mutant did not segregate, the corresponding transformant was not characterized further. Consistent with the conditions necessary for segregation, the Δ(M1-A24) mutant depended on anaerobic conditions for growth. As shown in TableII, under anaerobic conditions the Δ(M1-A24) mutant grew photoautotrophically at a rate about two-thirds that of wild type. Interestingly, the Δ(M1-A24) mutant grew in air if PS II was deleted or inhibited by atrazine (Table II).Table IIAerobic and anaerobic growth of wild type and the Δ(M1-A24) mutant in the presence or absence of PS IIStrainGrowth conditionsanaerobicaerobicPAPM/PHPAPM/PHWild type12.7 ± 1.89.2 ± 1.513.3 ± 1.59.8 ± 0.8Δ(M1-A24)18.6 ± 3.010.5 ± 2.0∞∞Δ(M1-A24)/PS II-less∞18.2 ± 2.6∞21.5 ± 2.9PS II-less∞17.5 ± 2.3∞16.8 ± 2.1Δ(M1-A24) + atrazine∞NDaND, not determined.∞19.7 ± 2.5Doubling time (h) of the wild type and of mutants lacking PS II and/or intact ccsB grown photoautotrophically (PA) or photomixotrophically/photoheterotrophically (PM/PH) were measured in the presence of 5 mm glucose.

The growth rate of wild-type cells was similar in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Table II). However after several days of exposure to oxygen, the mutant culture started to grow again when it was returned to anaerobic conditions. Therefore, oxygen did not kill the Δ(M1-A24) mutant strain, but it prevented its growth. Inactivation of the ccsB homologue in C. reinhardtii led to a nonphotosynthetic phenotype and to a cytb6 f deficiency (17Inoue K. Dreyfuss B.W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Merchant S. Sodeinde O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31747-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine whether the Δ(M1-A24) mutant ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is also impaired in photosynthetic electron transport through the cytb6 f complex. For this reason, oxygen evolution rates of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant and wild type were measured, and the rate of electron transport through PS II to the artificial electron acceptor DMBQ (which can oxidize the plastoquinone pool) was compared with that of whole-chain electron transport to CO2(Table III). The two rates were similar for wild type, but the rate of whole-chain electron transport in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant was about 5-fold lower than electron transfer involving only PS II. This indicates that photosynthetic electron transport was blocked beyond PS II and is consistent with an inhibition at the level of the cyt b6 fcomplex.Table IIIPhotosynthetic electron transport in wild type and the Δ(M1-A24) mutantStrainOxygen evolution (μmol O2/mg chl · h)PS II (H2O to DMBQ)Whole chain (H2O to CO2)Wild type400380Δ(M1-A24)30065Strains were grown anaerobically before the measurements. Data shown are the average of three experiments and were reproducible within 15% of the average rate. Open table in a new tab Strains were grown anaerobically before the measurements. Data shown are the average of three experiments and were reproducible within 15% of the average rate. A similar conclusion was drawn from chlorophyll fluorescence induction and decay measurements in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant. Chlorophyll fluorescence increases with reduction of QA in PS II, and reduced QA is oxidized by the plastoquinone pool. If photosynthetic electron transport is blocked at or beyond the cytb6 f complex, oxidation of the plastoquinone pool would be expected to be slower and consequently QA− oxidation after illumination should be slower as well. Indeed, after illumination variable fluorescence in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant decayed with a half-time about 4-fold slower than in wild type, suggestive of slower electron flow out of the plastoquinone pool (Fig. 2 A). Fluorescence induction was faster in the mutant than in wild type, indicative of a more rapid net reduction of the plastoquinone pool in the mutant upon illumination (Fig. 2, B and C). In the presence of 1 μm DBMIB (a cytb6 f complex inhibitor), the induction curve of the wild type was very similar to that of the mutant with or without DBMIB, whereas in the mutant, DBMIB barely affected the fluorescence induction curve (Fig. 2, B and C). These data are fully consistent with inhibition at the level of the cytb6 f complex in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant. To determine the accumulation of c-type cytochromes and the cytb6 f complex in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant more directly, the amount of cyt b6 fcomplex subunits in thylakoid membranes was monitored using Western blotting and heme staining. In cyanobacteria, several c-type cytochromes are localized on the luminal side of the thylakoid membrane, including cyt f, cyt c553, which is a soluble electron carrier between cytb6 f complex and PS I, and cytc550, a PS II luminal protein. Unlike inC. reinhardtii, in cyanobacteria the cytb6 f complex appears to be indispensable, possibly because of its role in respiration, making a cyanobacterial mutant completely deficient in this complex unlikely to survive. The Δ(M1-A24) mutant was found to have significantly decreased amounts of cyt f, cyt b6, and cyt c550 in its thylakoids (Fig.3). Surprisingly, in the mutant, a band with decreased mobility was recognized by the cyt f antibody; we assign this band to unprocessed pre-apocyt f. The observed 2–3-kDa difference is consistent with the upper band being the unprocessed protein. This difference in electrophoretic mobility is similar to that betweenC. reinhardtii pre-apocyt f and apocytf (24Howe G. Mets L. Merchant S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Even though the upper band accumulated to high levels in thylakoid membranes of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant (Fig. 3), this band was not visible upon heme staining. Therefore, this band does not covalently bind heme. However, the lower band in the mutant corresponding to processed cyt f (about 20% of the wild-type amount) stained with heme at an intensity corresponding to the amount of processed cyt f in the membrane (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the 5-fold reduction in linear electron flow (TableIII) and suggests that most or all of the processed cyt f in the mutant carries covalently attached heme. The other cyt b6 f complex subunits, including cyt b6, accumulated to about 20% of the amount in wild type (Fig. 4; note that for wild type, 5-fold less thylakoids were loaded than for the Δ(M1-A24) mutant). In the range of protein concentrations used the immunoreaction observed is approximately proportional to the amount of antigen (not shown). Therefore, the amount of cytb6, Rieske, and subunit IV polypeptides is proportional to the amount of processed holocyt f and the amount of functional cyt b6 f complex. This implies that the unprocessed pre-apocyt f is not part of the cyt b6 f complex (Fig. 3). As the Δ(M1-A24) mutant ceased to grow in ambient air conditions, we investigated whether the accumulation of the cytb6 f complex changed upon exposure of the mutant strain to air. The amounts of the cytb6 f subunits remained stable for the first 40 h of the experiment (Fig. 4), long after the cells had ceased to grow. Protein degradation was obvious only after 70 h in aerobic conditions (Fig. 4). As the Δ(M1-A24) mutant accumulated some processed cyt f and cyt c550 with heme bound, it was interesting to determine whether cyt c553 is properly synthesized as well. Cyt c553, together with plastocyanin, shuttles electrons from the cytb6 f complex to PS I inSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Fig. 5 indicates that in our growth conditions the level of holocyt c553 in wild type is very low. However, upon deletion of the plastocyanin gene (petE) the cyt c553 level increased dramatically. Interestingly, after transformation of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant with a petE deletion construct (25Manna P. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) the resultingpetE deletion transformants did not segregate and no holocytc553 was apparent in the partially segregated mutant (Fig. 5). This suggests that, unlike holocyt f (Fig. 3) and cytc550, the Δ(M1-A24) mutant is unable to make holocyt c553. Accumulation of the unprocessed pre-apocyt fthat lacked covalently bound heme raised the possibility that the Δ(M1-A24) mutant may be deficient in heme transport and reduction. This would be similar to the situation in yeast mitochondria, where heme-deficient mutants accumulate pre-apocytc1 in vivo (26Ohashi A. Gibson J. Gregor I. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13042-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and where attachment of the reduced heme was necessary for processing of the cytc1 in vitro (27Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4340-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Nicholson D.W. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10156-10168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the Δ(M1-A24) phenotype could be overcome in part by supplementation of extra heme and/or reductant, Δ(M1-A24) cells were grown on plates with 100 μm hemin and/or in the presence or absence of reductants (up to 1 mm dithiothreitol,l-cysteine, or dithionite). None of these additions led to improved photosynthetic performance, ability to grow at ambient oxygen levels, and changes in accumulation of unprocessed or processed cytf. This suggests that CcsB is not involved in heme transport and/or reduction. Second-site mutants (pseudorevertants) were selected in which the Δ(M1-A24) mutant phenotype was suppressed at least partially. Several pseudorevertants that were able to grow in air were selected. During the initial screening, most of the pseudorevertants were found to be deficient in PS II activity, which is consistent with the data that were presented in Table II. However, one pseudorevertant was photoautotrophic with about 50% of the wild type growth rate under aerobic conditions and with 70% of the whole chain electron transport rate of wild type (data not shown). This pseudorevertant showed an increased accumulation of holocytf (Fig. 6 A) and a decreased but still detectable level of pre-apocyt f (Fig.6 B). Chromosomal DNA from this pseudorevertant complemented the original Δ(M1-A24) strain, using growth at ambient oxygen levels as a selection criterion. Functional complementation was used to localize the second-site mutation. The complementing PCR fragment contained a single point mutation in the noncoding region of the chloramphenicol resistance cassette in between the resistance marker and the remainder of the ccsB gene (Fig.7 A). The mutation (T to G) led to formation of a new putative start codon, CUG, for ccsB, with a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence upstream. Note that in prokaryotes not only AUG and GUG but also UUG and to a lesser extent CUG have been reported to be able to function as start codons (29Sussman J.K. Simons E.L. Simons R.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Even though the first part of this modified gene has a random sequence, translation of the modified ccsB gene using the newly generated start codon in the pseudorevertant is expected to lead to a protein of similar length as the wild type copy (Fig. 7 B). Moreover, in the original Δ(M1-A24) mutant the sequence upstream of ccsBcontains several possible start codons and several possible ribosome binding sites (Fig. 7 A) so that shorter forms of CcsB may be expressed even in this mutant.Figure 7The DNA sequence in the ccsBupstream region and deduced N-terminal regions of the CcsB protein in wild type and the photoautotrophic pseudorevertant. A, DNA sequence of the aerobically photoautotrophic pseudorevertant of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant.

PCC 6803 ccsA (sll1513) gene was interrupted by the kanamycin resistance marker from the pUC4K at the BamHI site at position 813 of the coding region of ccsA, yielding the same construct as has been used previously (12Hübschmann T. Wilde A. Elanskaya I. Shestakov S.V. Börner T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous data (12Hübschmann T. Wilde A. Elanskaya I. Shestakov S.V. Börner T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), this mutant could not be segregated. Unlike for the Δ(M1-A24) mutant, the degree of segregation did not improve in anaerobic conditions. These results suggest that the CcsA protein is indispensable for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We have generated aSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant lacking the part of theccsB gene coding for the first 24 amino acid residues of the corresponding protein. The Δ(M1-A24) mutant grew photoautotrophically in anaerobic conditions, indicating the presence of a functional cytb6 f complex. It exhibited about 20% of the wild-type rate of whole chain electron transport, demonstrating that in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the introducedccsB partial deletion does not lead to a total lack of the cyt b6 f complex. The oxygen evolution and fluorescence induction and decay measurements (Table III, Fig. 2) were consistent with impairment of photosynthetic electron transport beyond the plastoquinone pool in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant. Consistent with a decreased rate of whole chain electron transport, the Δ(M1-A24) mutant accumulated about 20% of holocyt f. In addition, the amount of cyt c550 was very much reduced in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant whereas cytc553 was undetectable (Fig. 5), indicating that the mutant is impaired in a pathway common to c-type cytochromes. The observation that unprocessed pre-apocyt f accumulated to high levels in the thylakoid membrane of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant is unparalleled in other cytc maturation pathways studied. Apocyt c usually is much less stable than its holo-form because of the presence of a periplasmic/luminal degradation system that removes nonfunctional proteins (24Howe G. Mets L. Merchant S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Pearce D.A. Page M.D. Norris H.A. Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The situation observed in theSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Δ(M1-A24) mutant is quite different from that in ccs1/ccsA null mutants ofC. reinhardtii. Although in this alga only theccsA mutant has been characterized thoroughly, the CcsA and CcsB homologues require each other for accumulation in vivo(1Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 5Xie Z. Culler D. Dreyfuss B.W. Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. Girard-Bascou J. Merchant S. Genetics. 1998; 148: 681-692PubMed Google Scholar), and the ccs1 mutant is expected to have the same phenotype as the ccsA mutant. In the ccsA mutant of C. reinhardtii both apocyt f and apocytc553 were processed and very unstable with half-lives of about 10 min, suggesting that processing does not depend on heme attachment in this system (24Howe G. Mets L. Merchant S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Gabbert K.K. Goldman B.S. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5422-5428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the pure Δ(M1-I244) ccsB mutant as well as the ccsAmutant could not be obtained in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 suggests a lethal phenotype of these mutations. This corroborates the view that Δ(M1-A24) is not a null mutant for ccsB. The accumulation of unprocessed pre-apocyt f without heme bound in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 suggests that the mutant is impaired in both processing and heme attachment. The fact that in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant (a) about 20% of the protein was processed, contained heme, and was assembled into a functional cyt b6 fcomplex, and (b) no heme binding to the unprocessed pre-apocyt f was detected, indicate that processing and heme attachment are closely coordinated in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Important insight regarding the function of the CcsB protein and the phenotype of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant was obtained from characterization of the photoautotrophic pseudorevertant, functionally complementing the Δ(M1-A24) mutant. The second-site point mutation was localized in the noncoding region of the chloramphenicol resistance marker upstream of the truncatedccsB gene, and led to the formation of a new putative start codon. This stretch of nucleotides contains several possible start codons and several possible ribosome binding sites in the original Δ(M1-A24) mutant (Fig. 7 A) raising the possibility that a shorter and modified form of CcsB is expressed even in the original Δ(M1-A24) mutant. Therefore, we suggest that in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant described here the shorter version of the CcsB protein may accumulate and that accumulation of modified CcsB leads to the accumulation of pre-apocyt f. This argument is strengthened by the fact that the photoautotrophic pseudorevertant but not wild type still accumulates some pre-apocyt f (Fig. 6 B). This suggestion explains why the phenotype of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant expressing partially functional CcsB protein is so different from that of ccsA null mutant of C. reinhardtii and why the Δ(M1-A24) mutant but not the mutant Δ(M1-I244) or theccsA deletion mutant could be generated inSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Expression of modified CcsB probably is also the reason for unusual stability of pre-apocytf in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant. We hypothesize that the reason for accumulation of pre-apocyt f in thylakoid membranes of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant is protection of the apoprotein from processing, heme attachment as well as degradation by the altered CcsB protein. This suggests that in the wild type CcsB also interacts with pre-apocytc/f polypeptides to aid in processing and heme attachment. In the Δ(M1-A24) mutant the partially active CcsB may still bind the apocytochrome and protect it from degradation; however, in the mutant, processing and heme binding appear to have slowed down considerably. The difference between the Δ(M1-A24) mutant, its photoautotrophic pseudorevertant, and wild type is primarily in the efficiency of processing and heme attachment. This reasoning suggests that pre-apocyt f accumulating in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant is associated with CcsB. This would imply that CcsB accumulates to high levels, at least in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant. Interestingly, the Δ(M1-A24) mutant needed anaerobic conditions to segregate and to grow. Oxygen sensitivity of the Δ(M1-A24) mutant and tolerance of its pseudorevertant suggests that this phenotype is caused by deficiency of CcsB function in the Δ(M1-A24) mutant. This deficiency may indicate that intact CcsB but not truncated CcsB is able to protect apocyt f and/or heme against oxidation. Interestingly, a potential functional analog of CcsB fromRhodobacter capsulatus, Ccl2, accumulates to 20-fold-higher levels when grown aerobically than when under anaerobic conditions (31Gabbert K.K. Goldman B.S. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5422-5428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ccl2 is viewed as a protein reducing apocyt c and protecting it against oxidation, which may explain its accumulation when oxygen is present. A CcsA-CcsB complex is necesssary for cyt c maturation in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. CcsA, which has a putative heme binding site on the luminal side of the thylakoid membrane (15Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), may function as a heme transporter/coordinator. We suggest that CcsB serves as an apocytochrome chaperone, which binds pre-apocyt f and facilitates its processing by signal peptidase and heme attachment by CcsA. Both processing and heme attachment may take place in the CcsA-CcsB complex; both processes must be tightly coordinated as the N-terminal amino acid of the processed cyt f serves as a heme ligand. We propose that the CcsA-CcsB complex is the site of heme attachment, with CcsB binding the apoprotein and with CcsA binding a heme and facilitating its linkage to apocytochrome. We thank Dr. Alice Barkan, University of Oregon, and Dr. Richard Malkin, University of California, Berkeley for providing us with the antibodies used in this study."

Estrogen also promotes the growth, differentiation, and remodeling of the uterus at various physiological states, such as the reproductive cycle and pregnancy (3Jensen E.V. DeSombre E.R. Annu. Rev.

The identity of the majority of estrogen-regulated genes that mediate the uterotropic hormonal responses to estrogen, however, remains largely unknown. In order to understand the role of estrogen in complex physiological processes, such as the changes in the endometrium during the reproductive cycle, uterine receptivity, zygote transport, implantation, stromal cell differentiation, and parturition, it is essential to identify the spectrum of genes that are regulated by estrogen in the reproductive tract. It is known that in the rodents, the preovulatory ovarian estrogen is important for uterine cellular proliferation and differentiation of epithelium during early stages (days 1 and 2 post-fertilization) of pregnancy (22Finn C.A.

This transformation of the uterus in response to estrogen is critical for subsequent uterine preparation for embryonic implantation and successful establishment of pregnancy (22Finn C.A. Wynn R.M.

To identify genes that mediate estrogen action in the uterus during early pregnancy, we employed the mRNA differential display (DD) 1The abbreviations used are:DDdifferential displayZPzona pellucidaPCRpolymerase chain reactionDIGdigoxigeninbpbase pair(s)GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase procedure devised by Liang and Pardee (25Liang P.

Using this approach, we compared mRNAs obtained from uteri of non-pregnant (estrus stage) and pregnant (day 5) rats and isolated several cDNA clones representing genes that are either up- or down-regulated during the preimplantation stage of pregnancy. differential display zona pellucida polymerase chain reaction digoxigenin base pair(s) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase In this study, we report the isolation of a novel gene that is expressed in the uterus in a stage-specific manner during the ovarian cycle and early pregnancy. The expression of this gene is induced in the uteri of ovariectomized or immature rats upon administration of estrogen and is abolished in the presence of antiestrogens. We, therefore, termed this gene as estrogen-regulated gene 1 or ERG1. ERG1 is also highly expressed in the oviduct and this expression is under estrogenic control. ERG1 mRNA is present predominantly in the surface epithelium of the uterus and oviduct. The full-length cDNA of ERG1 codes for a putative protein of 607 amino acids harboring a single transmembrane domain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the ERG1 cDNA clone revealed the presence of several interesting structural features. The amino terminus of the predicted ERG1 protein harbors a tandem repeat of a CUB domain, which exhibits striking homology to the one that exists in the bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) (26Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of ERG1 consists mostly of a highly conserved ZP domain that is also found in the zona pellucida sperm binding proteins and other proteins, such as uromodulin (28Bork P.

Science. 1987; 236: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Progesterone and 17β-estradiol were purchased from Sigma. Mifepristone (RU 38486) and ICI 182,780 were kind gifts of Roussel-Uclaf, France and Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire, United Kingdom. All experiments involving animals were conducted according to National Institutes of Health standards for the care and use of experimental animals. Virgin female rats (Sprague-Dawley, from Charles River, Wilmington, MA; 60–75 days of age) in proestrus were mated with adult males. The different stages of the cycle in the nonpregnant rats were ascertained by examining vaginal smears. The presence of a vaginal plug after mating was designated as day 1 of pregnancy. The animals were killed at various stages of gestation and the uteri collected. In some experiments, animals were ovariectomized and 14 days later were injected subcutaneously with either estradiol (2 μg/kg body weight), progesterone (40 mg/kg body weight), or a combination of both hormones or vehicle (sesame oil) as described under “Results.” The rats were killed 16 h after final injection. For certain experiments immature rats (21 days old, ∼40–45 g) were injected with estrogen (40 μg/kg body weight) in sesame oil. Control rats received an injection of sesame oil only. Total RNAs were extracted from pregnant (day 5) and nonpregnant (estrus) uteri using an RNAgents isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA samples were freed of DNA after treatment with DNase I (Genehunter Corp., Brookline, MA) and subjected to differential display reactions as described previously (25Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 30Utans U. Liang P. Wyner L.R. Karnovsky M.J. Russell M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, 2 μg of DNA-free total RNA were reverse-transcribed with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in the presence of 1 mmT12MA, T12MC, or T12MG primer (Genehunter Corp.), where M is a mixture containing dG, dA, and dC. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1 h. One tenth of this reaction was then used in a PCR amplification reaction containing 2 mm each of dNTPs, 10 mCi of [35S]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and two primers: 1 mmT12 oligonucleotide and 0.2 mm of one of the five arbitrary decamers, AP-1 (5′-AGCCAGCGAA-3′); AP-2 (5′-GACCGCTTGT-3′); AP-3 (5′-AGGTGACCGT-3′); AP-4 (5′-GGTACTCCAC-3′); AP-5 (5′-GTTGCGATCC-3′). These reactions also contained 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The cycling parameters for PCR were: 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles. After PCR amplification samples were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, dried without fixation, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for 72 h. Bands exhibiting differential expression were cut out from the gel, and DNA was eluted by boiling as described before (25Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 30Utans U. Liang P. Wyner L.R. Karnovsky M.J. Russell M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eluted DNA samples were then reamplified by PCR using the corresponding pair of primers under the same conditions as described above, except that neither 25 mm dNTP nor radioisotope was used. The PCR products were cut from 2.5% low melting point agarose gels, subcloned into TA vector (Invitrogen), and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. For Northern analysis 20 μg of total RNA was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to Duralon membrane (Stratagene). Blots were prehybridized in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.5, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 4 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out overnight in the same buffer containing 106 cpm/ml of a32P-labeled ERG1 cDNA fragment. The filters were washed twice for 15 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, then twice for 20 min in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and the filters were exposed to x-ray films for 24–72 h. The intensities of signals on the autoradiogram were estimated by densitometric scanning. To correct for RNA loading, the obtained signals were normalized with respect to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signal in the same blot. For this, the filters were stripped of the radioactive probe by washing for 10 min in 0.5%SDS at 95 °C. The blots were then re-probed with a 32P-labeled GAPDH probe (CLONTECH) as described above. Uterine or oviductal tissues from pregnant animals were collected and frozen. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cryostat sections were cut at 8 μm and attached to 3-aminopropyl triethyl silane (Sigma) coated slides. In situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled sense or antisense RNA probes complimentary to ERG1 cDNA. DIG-labeled RNA probes were synthesized from ERG1 cDNA using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and DIG-labeled nucleotides according to manufacturer's specifications (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prehybridization was carried out in a damp chamber at 55 °C for 60 min in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine). Hybridization was carried out at 55 °C overnight in a damp humidified chamber. To develop the substrate, sections were sequentially washed in 2× SSC, 1× SSC, and 0.1× SSC for 15 min in each buffer at 37 °C. Sections were then incubated with anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. Excess antibody was washed away and the color substrate (nitro blue tetrazolium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) was added. Slides were allowed to develop in the dark, and the color was visualized under light microscopy until maximum levels of staining were achieved. The reaction was stopped and the slides counterstained in Nuclear Fast Red for 5 min. The slides were washed in water, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Control incubations utilized a DIG-labeled RNA sense strand and were performed under identical conditions. To isolate the uterine genes that are regulated by steroid hormones in the preimplantation phase of pregnancy, we employed the messenger RNA differential display method (25Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). We compared RNA samples prepared from uteri of nonpregnant (estrus) and pregnant (day 5 morning prior to implantation) rats. Several differentially displayed bands representing cDNA clones corresponding to genes whose expression in the uterus was up- or down-regulated during the preimplantation phase were isolated. One of these bands, which was present in the uteri of nonpregnant rats but disappeared on day 5 of pregnancy (marked by an arrow in Fig. 1, left lane), was selected for further characterization. The cDNA present in this band was recovered from the gel and amplified by PCR (40 cycles). The cDNA fragment was labeled with 32P and used to probe Northern blots of mRNAs obtained from uteri of nonpregnant (estrus stage) and pregnant (day 5) rats (Fig. 1, right panel). A strong signal corresponding to 2.2 kilobase pairs emerged in the RNA isolated from the nonpregnant uteri, while no detectable signal was observed in the RNA from pregnant uteri. Hybridization of the blot with a control probe (ferritin light chain) indicated that the difference in intensities of the signals in the lanes did not arise due to unequal loading of mRNAs in these lanes. These results indicated that the gene we isolated is indeed down-regulated in the uteri of pregnant rats. Using this cDNA fragment as a probe, we isolated a full-length cDNA from a rat uterus cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the isolated cDNA and comparison with the GenBank™ data base indicated it to be a novel gene (GenBank™ accession no.AF167170). Subsequent characterization of this gene in our laboratory revealed that it is regulated by estrogen. Therefore, it has been designated “estrogen-regulated gene 1” or ERG1. The ERG1 cDNA harbors an open reading frame of 1821 base pairs in length. The conceptual translation of the cDNA predicts a protein of 607 amino acids (Fig. 2 A). A search of GenBank™ protein data bases showed that ERG1 exhibits homology to two kinds of protein families. In the amino-terminal region, it possesses a repeat of a 100-amino acid motif termed CUB domain that exhibits ∼40% amino acid identity to a similar sequence in bone morphogenetic type-1 protein, while its carboxyl-terminal half contains a 250-amino acid ZP domain that displays ∼30% amino acid identity to the zona pellucida region of uromodulin (Fig. 2 B). ERG1 appears to be a membrane protein with a single 16-amino acid transmembrane region and a short 19-amino acid C-terminal area, which is presumably the intracellular part of the protein. As a first step in understanding the biological function of ERG1, we analyzed the expression pattern of this gene in a variety of tissues (Fig. 3 A). Using Northern blot analysis, we observed a band of about 2.2 kilobases corresponding to the ERG1 mRNA in the uterus (estrus stage, lane 10). We failed to detect any ERG1 mRNA in several other tissue such as heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, and testes (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–9). We also studied its expression in other female reproductive tissues such as the ovary and oviduct (Fig.3 B). While no ERG1 mRNA could be detected in the ovary, it was expressed abundantly in the oviduct. By our estimation, the level of ERG1 expression in the oviduct appeared to be at least 2-fold higher than in the uterus. Taken together, these results indicate that ERG1 is expressed predominantly in two reproductive tissues, uterus and oviduct, at a high level. To examine the pattern of ERG1 expression in the uterus and oviduct during estrus cycle, we performed Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from uteri of nonpregnant rats at proestrus, estrus, and diestrus stages. As shown in Fig.4, when the blot was hybridized with a32P-labeled ERG1 cDNA probe, a strong 2.2-kilobase message was seen in the uterine RNA sample at the proestrus stage of the cycle (lane 1). The signal corresponding to ERG1 mRNA declined at estrus (lane 2) and disappeared at the diestrus stage of the cycle (lane 3). The magnitude of the decline at the estrus phase was estimated to be about 40% compared with proestrus stage of the cycle. In the oviduct, the expression of ERG1 was high in both proestrus and estrus but declined significantly at diestrus (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). The expression of the ERG1 message in both uterus and oviduct is therefore modulated in a stage-specific manner during the reproductive cycle. The site of expression of ERG1 mRNA in the uterus and oviduct was investigated by employing in situhybridization (Fig. 5). Uterine and oviductal sections from nonpregnant animals at proestrus stage were hybridized with a 500-base pair digoxigenin-labeled antisense or sense RNA probe containing sequences from ERG1 cDNA. While control uterine sections hybridized with the sense RNA probe did not exhibit any significant signal (Fig. 5 A, panel b), we observed a strong hybridization signal in the luminal epithelial cells of these uterine sections upon hybridization with the antisense probe (panels a and c). A strong hybridization signal in the oviductal epithelial cells was also observed upon hybridization with the antisense probe (Fig.5 B, panels a and c). These results demonstrate that the surface epithelium is the primary site of synthesis of ERG1 mRNA in rat uterus and oviduct. We then investigated the pattern of ERG1 mRNA expression in rat uterus at various stages of early pregnancy. We performed Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from uteri of pregnant animals at days 1–6 of gestation. As shown in Fig.6 A, a high level of ERG1 mRNA was observed in the uterus of day 1 pregnant animals (lane 1). The level of this mRNA declined dramatically on day 2 of pregnancy (lane 2). No ERG1 expression was observed on days 3, 4, 5, and 6 of gestation (lanes 3, 4, 5, and6, respectively). In situ hybridization of uterine sections at different days of gestation further confirmed the down-regulation of ERG1 mRNA expression during early pregnancy (Fig. 6 B). The signal corresponding to ERG1 mRNA was intense at the luminal epithelium of uterus on day 1 (panel A), diminished on day 2 (panel B), and disappeared on days 5 and 6 of pregnancy (panels C and D, respectively). Collectively, these results show that ERG1 is expressed in a highly stage-specific manner in the luminal epithelial cells of the uterus during early pregnancy. We also examined the expression of ERG1 in the oviduct during early pregnancy by Northern blot analysis (Fig.7 A). In pregnant rats, ERG1 mRNA level was high in the oviduct on days 1 and 2 but declined significantly on days 3 and 4. The magnitude of this decline on days 3–4 was estimated to be about 50% compared with either day 1 or 2 of pregnancy (Fig. 7 B). These results indicate that, as in the uterus, the expression of ERG1 in the oviduct is also down-regulated during early pregnancy. To determine whether ERG1 expression in the uterus is regulated by steroid hormones, we administered estrogen (E), progesterone (P), or a combination of both to ovariectomized rats. Uteri were collected from animals 16 h after the injection, and mRNAs were isolated from these tissues for Northern blot analysis. The blot was probed with32P-labeled ERG1 cDNA. As shown in Fig.8 A, the signal representing ERG1 mRNA was barely detectable in the uteri of overiectomized rats (lane 1). While treatment with progesterone (lane 3) failed to induce ERG1 mRNA, estrogen alone (lane 2) markedly increased the level of ERG1 mRNA in the uterus. The level of this mRNA declined (by more than 60%) significantly when progesterone was administered together with estrogen to ovariectomized animals (Fig. 8, Aand B, lane 4). These results demonstrate that estrogen alone can trigger the accumulation of ERG1 mRNAs in the uteri of ovariectomized animals. These results also clearly show that progesterone antagonizes the action of estrogen on induction of ERG1 expression in the uterus. We next examined the time course of ERG1 gene induction by estrogen. Ovariectomized rats were injected with estrogen for 4, 8, 16, and 24 h, and a Northern blot analysis was carried out using mRNAs isolated from the uteri. As shown in Fig.9 A, the amount of ERG1 mRNA increased progressively with the duration of estrogen treatment. A significant increase (10-fold) in the level of ERG1 mRNA was observed after 8 h of estrogen treatment. Estrogen injections up to 16 or 24 h led to a further enhancement in the level of ERG1 mRNA. We also performed in situhybridization analysis of uterine sections from ovariectomized animals treated with estrogen (Fig. 9 B). Consistent with the results of Northern blot analysis, no ERG1 mRNA expression was observed in the luminal epithelial cells of ovariectomized animals (panel A). While ERG1 mRNA was barely visible at the surface epithelial cells 4 h after estrogen treatment (panel B), this mRNA became detectable 8 h after estrogen treatment (panel C). The level of ERG1 mRNA increased further after 16 or 24 h of estrogen treatment (panels D and E, respectively). Taken together, these results show that the level of ERG1 mRNA at the surface epithelial cells of the uterus increases progressively with the duration of estrogen treatment. We further investigated the estrogenic regulation of ERG1 mRNA expression by employing an antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, which is known to severely impair the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptors (32Wakeling A.E. Bowler J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 30: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Animals were ovariectomized and injected with vehicle or estrogen or a combination of estrogen and ICI 182,780. As depicted in Fig. 10 A, ERG1 expression was not observed in vehicle-treated ovariectomized animals (lane 1). As expected, administration of estrogen induced ERG1 in the uterus (lane 2). Treatment of animals with estrogen in combination with ICI 182,780 (lane 3), however, caused a drastic decline in the level of ERG1 mRNA but did not affect the expression of GAPDH mRNA. These results strongly suggest that ICI 182,780 switched off the ERG1 gene expression in the uterus by inhibiting the estrogen receptors. We also studied the effects of ICI 182,780 on ERG1 expression in the uterus of cycling rats by in situ hybridization (Fig.10B). Animals were injected at proestrus stage with either vehicle (control) or ICI 182,780, and the uteri were isolated at estrus stage for in situ hybridization. As shown in Fig.10 B, a high level of ERG1 mRNA was observed in the uterine epithelial cells of animals at estrus stage (panel A). However, a single dose of ICI 182,780 dramatically reduced the level of this mRNA in the uterine epithelial cells (panel B). These studies further confirm the role of estrogen in regulating ERG1 expression in the uterus. We next examined the regulation of ERG1 mRNA by estrogen in the oviduct of cycling animals. Animals were injected at proestrus stage with either vehicle (control) or ICI 182,780. Uteri were isolated and a Northern blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig.11, a single dose of ICI 182,780 reduced the level of ERG1 mRNA in the oviduct. By our estimate, the level of ERG1 mRNA was reduced to about 50% of that of the control within 16 h of treatment. These results indicate that, as in the uterus, estrogen regulates ERG1 expression in the oviduct. Since our results indicated that progesterone antagonizes es"

Both proteins were identified as modified forms of the small heat shock protein, αB-crystallin. The concentration of total αB-crystallin in most of these cataracts was significantly increased. The 22.4-kDa protein was subsequently designated as αBg. Mass spectrometric analyses of tryptic and Asp-N digests showed αBg is αB-crystallin minus the C-terminal lysine. αBg constituted 10–90% of the total αB-crystallin in these cataracts and was preferentially phosphorylated over the typical form of αB-crystallin. Human αBg and αB-crystallin were cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli. The differences in electrophoretic mobility and the large difference in native pI values suggest some structural differences exist. The chaperone-like activity of recombinant human αBg was comparable to that of recombinant human αB-crystallin in preventing the aggregation of lactalbumin induced by dithiothreitol. The mechanism involved in generating αBg is not known, but a premature termination of the αB-crystallin gene was ruled out by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products of the last exon for the αB-crystallin gene from lenses containing αBg.

The two homologous subunits, αA- and αB-crystallin, make up about 30% of the proteins in young human lenses and in the outer cortex of the adult human lens. αB-crystallin is a normal constituent of most mammalian tissues but is present in the highest concentrations in lens (5Dubin R.A.

On the other hand, α-crystallins are members of the family of small heat shock proteins and are thought to provide protection against cellular stresses (10Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In cultured cells, expression of αB-crystallin is induced by heat shock, oxidative stress, osmotic stress, arsenite, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and hormones such as estrogen and dexamethasone (20Dasgupta S.

In the lens, however, it is not known whether the primary function of αB-crystallin is that of a stress protein and related to its chaperone-like function or if its major role is structural. It is possible its role in the lens may change depending on the stage of development and location in the lens. Both α-crystallins undergo post-translational modifications including truncation of both N and C termini, deamidation, racemization, phosphorylation, methionine oxidation, glycation, disulfide formation, addition of O-GlcNAc, and the addition of 72 mass units to the C-terminal lysine of αB-crystallin (4Groenen P.J.

Some of these such as phosphorylation and specific cleavage may be important functionally, others are likely the result of aging and detrimental stresses. Any of these modifications are likely to alter the protein conformation which in turn could alter the aggregate size and/or the function of α- crystallin in the cell. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of tissue proteins is the major technique used to detect post-translationally modified proteins in cell and tissue extracts. We have used this technique extensively in an attempt to identify changes in the concentration or modification of lens proteins that could be unique to developmental, aging, and cataractogenic processes. In this study we report the identification and characterization of two unique polypeptides observed on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of human cataracts. One of the proteins was present in high concentration comparable to the concentration of a crystallin. Both are likely the result of stress-induced processes on the path to cataract formation. Normal human lenses were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange, Philadelphia, PA. Human cataractous material was obtained from intracapsular cataract surgery done in India and from extracapsular extractions done at the National Eye Institute. Tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki for dealing with human samples were strictly followed. The lens capsule epithelia were removed, and the lenses were separated into the lens cortical and nuclear regions as described previously (26Garland D.L. Duglas-Tabor Y. Jimenez-Asensio J. Datiles M.B. Magno B. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A proteinase inhibitor mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin (Sigma) was added to frozen lens cortex samples. The samples were thawed and homogenized in 9m urea, 2 or 4% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmDTT,1 2% Resolyte 3.5–10. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was done according to previously described procedures (27O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Anderson E.I. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1978; 26: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Non-linear, pH 3–10, 18-cm dry strips (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Samples were loaded onto the acidic end and focused for 32,000 V-h. The strips were then frozen at least 1 h and equilibrated twice, first in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 6 m urea, 1% SDS, with 1% DTT and then in the same buffer mix but with 4.5% iodoacetamide. The second dimension was done in the Iso-Dalt Gel Electrophoresis System using 15–18% gradient gels. Molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) and pI markers (carbamylated CPK, BDH Laboratory Supplies) were included. Proteins were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 or with PhastGel BlueR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) when protein spots were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Gels were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer, and protein spots were quantified using ImageQuant software. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the two-dimensional gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Tryptic peptide maps and Edman sequencing were done by Harvard MicroChem. Immunoreactivity was determined using Tropix Western-Light detection kit (PE Applied BioSystems). Proteins were subjected to in-gel digestion with either trypsin (Promega) or Asp-N endoproteinase (Wako) as described previously (29Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification and Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 45-69Google Scholar). Extracted peptides were spotted with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and analyzed using a PE Biosystems Voyager DE STR matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. Data were processed using GRAMS/386 software. RNA was obtained from a 16-year-old human lens. The isolation was done by combining the guanidine isothiocyanate lysis with the silica gel membrane technology using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech T-primed first strand kit. The coding regions of human αB-crystallin and αBg were amplified by PCR using primers containing NcoI or HindIII sites and were inserted into the cloning vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). In the PCR reactions the following primer (forward), which corresponds to the 5′ end of the coding region of human αB-crystallin, was used for both αB-crystallin and αBg: 5′-TAAGAAGGAGATATACCATGGACATCGCCA-3′. The reverse primers used for human αB-crystallin and αBg were 5′-CAAAAGCTTATTACTATTTCTTGGGGGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCAAGCTTTCACTTGGGGGCTG-3′, respectively. The latter will terminate the coding sequence after Lys174. The underlined nucleotides indicate the restriction sites. The clones were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5 αTM (Life Technologies Inc.). The coding region of these constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using the dye terminator cycle sequencing method (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). The coding region of human αB-crystallin and αBg were removed from the cloning vector by double digestion with NcoI andHindIII restriction enzymes and ligated intoNcoI-HindIII-cut pET-21d(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant plasmids were identified byNcoI-HindIII digestion and amplification of human αB-crystallin by PCR using internal primers. Recombinant pET-21d(+)-HαBC and pET-21d(+)-HαBgC expression plasmids were used to transform competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Transformants were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Super Broth to A600 = 0.8. αB-crystallin and αBg expression were then induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-galactospyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and then the culture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, and a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice. The bacterial lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The αB-crystallin and αBg, which were primarily soluble, were purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The sequences of αB-crystallin and αBg were confirmed by sequencing the plasmids used for the expression and by mass spectral fingerprinting of the expressed proteins. The sequences of the recombinant proteins were identical to those of the proteins in the cataractous lenses with the exception that the recombinant proteins were not acetylated on the N termini. Genomic DNAs were isolated from small pieces of lens tissue (5–10 mg) by a rapid desalting process using a DNA purification kit (Epicentre Technologies) and following the recommendations of the manufacturer. These DNAs (200 ng) served as templates for PCR amplification of exon 3 and flanking regions of human αB-crystallin gene (nucleotide identifier (NID) g181075). Primers were 24-mers in length and localized at positions 3722 (upper) and 4172 (lower). PCR cycling conditions were 40 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, using Pfu polymerase (Promega). PCR products were sequenced by the BigDye Terminator method (PE Applied Biosystems) using the same primers. Chaperone-like activity was measured as the ability to protect against the DTT-induced aggregation of lactalbumin (30Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The reaction was done at 23 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, containing 0.1m NaCl and 2 mm EDTA. Lactalbumin was at 1 mg/ml, and crystallin was at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml. Turbidity was measured at 360 nm. Two unique protein spots were striking on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels of the cortical fiber cell protein from some human cataractous lenses (Fig. 1 A). The positions of these proteins are indicated in Fig. 1 A. The spot indicated by the thick black arrow migrated at a position one charge more acidic than αB-crystallin and at aMr of 22,400 which is approximately 600 less than αB-crystallin (Fig. 1 A). The second spot, indicated by the white arrow migrated at a Mrof 16,400. Both of these proteins reacted with antibodies made against recombinant human αB-crystallin (Fig. 1 B) suggesting that the proteins were related to αB-crystallin. Data that will subsequently be presented in this report show that theMr 22,400 protein is a modified form of αB-crystallin. To simplify discussion, this protein will henceforth be referred to as αBg. Neither αBg nor the 16.4-kDa protein has been observed on two-dimensional gels of total fiber cell protein from any normal lens examined (Fig.2 (a—c)) or in all cataracts. The cataracts shown in Fig. 2 (d—f) that contain αBg were not clinically classified before extraction but were determined to be mixed cataracts by visual examination after intracapsular extraction. The concentration of αBg varied from 10 to 90% of the total αB-crystallin (αBg plus αB-crystallin) in those cataracts in which it was present. In addition, the total content of αB-crystallin (αBg plus αB-crystallin) was significantly increased in most of these cataracts. Representative data on three cataracts that contain high concentrations of αBg are shown in Table I. Up to 5 times the normal amount of αB-crystallin was seen. This was determined by calculating the ratio of αB-crystallin to αA-crystallin. The amount of αA-crystallin in these cataracts was present at normal concentrations relative to β-crystallins. To our knowledge, an increase in the concentration of αB-crystallin in lenses has not been previously reported.Figure 2Composite of the αB-crystallin and αBg from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels of cataracts and normal human lenses. Indicated is the position of αB-crystallin and αBg. The Coomassie-stained gels were scanned and these spots quantified to determine the ratios of the species of αB-crystallins present in these cataracts.

Open table in a new tab Cataracts are from donors between 60 and 70 years of age. α-Crystallins are phosphorylated in vivo; however, in the lens the function of the phosphorylation is not known. As can be seen in Fig. 1 A (thin black arrow), αBgwas the only form of αB-crystallin for which a phosphorylated species was obvious; phosphorylated species of the typical form of αB-crystallin were not observed. Three phosphorylation sites have been identified for αB-crystallin, Ser19, Ser45, and Ser59. Mass spectral data indicated the presence of a phosphate in the peptide corresponding to residues 2–24 in αBg. The HPLC chromatograms of the tryptic digests of αBg and αB-crystallin from cataracts of two different individuals are presented in Fig.3. There were no consistent differences between the chromatograms of αBg and αB-crystallin that were common to the respective samples from both individuals. Edman sequencing of several tryptic peptides of αBg was performed. For each peptide sequenced there was 100% agreement with the sequence of human αB-crystallin (data not shown). These results confirm that the protein is an αB-crystallin, albeit, based on the electrophoretic migration, a modified form of αB-crystallin. Direct Edman sequencing of αBg, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride, gave no sequence, suggesting that the N terminus of the protein was blocked. In all αBg samples, a peptide eluting at 40 min corresponded to the C-terminal residues 164–174. Edman sequencing verified the identity of the peptide and the mass of the peptide agreed with its theoretical mass. The presence of C-terminal Lys175 in αBg, however, could not be verified by this experiment because trypsin would cleave between Lys174 and Lys175. Mass fingerprinting was done on trypsin and Asp-N protein digests of αB-crystallin and αBg using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The results are illustrated in Tables II and III. In Table II, the protonated molecular weights for those peptides derived by trypsin digestion of αB-crystallin and αBg, as well as the theoretical protonated molecular weights, are listed. The presence of peptides withm/z values of 1430.7 and 1431.0 in the tryptic digests of αBg from both samples indicate that the N terminus is present and acetylated. In the trypsin digests there were a few masses that could not be assigned, but there were no masses consistently present in αBg that were missing in αB-crystallin or vice versa.Table IIαB-Crystallin tryptic digest products determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometryResiduesTheoreticalm/z aTheoretical monoisotopic m/zvalues are listed for m/z less than 2000, and theoretical average m/z values are listed form/z greater than 2000.Cataract ACataract BαBαBgαBαBg1–11/Ac1430.71430.91430.71431.012–221374.71374.81374.81374.91374.923–564006.54006.757–691496.71496.91496.91497.075–82921.5921.5921.5921.783–921213.71213.81213.61213.81213.993–1162788.12787.82787.82787.92787.0117–120588.3588.3588.3588.3588.4121–149bThe identical mass also corresponds to residues 122–150.3073.53073.23074.23073.63073.9150–157900.5900.6900.6900.7158–1741822.01822.01822.51822.41822.4a Theoretical monoisotopic m/zvalues are listed for m/z less than 2000, and theoretical average m/z values are listed form/z greater than 2000.b The identical mass also corresponds to residues 122–150.

Open table in a new tab In Table III, the masses for the peptides derived by Asp-N endoproteinase digestion are listed. αB-crystallin samples contained peptides with m/z 3842.9 and 3842.0. These molecular weights are consistent with the C-terminal peptide, residues 140–175, that has a theoreticalm/z value of 3842.4. A mass that corresponded to this peptide was absent in both αBg samples, but in both cataracts αBg contained a peptide absent in either αB-crystallin spot, with m/z values of 3715.0 and 3714.4 (Fig. 4). These masses are consistent with the theoretical m/z value of the C-terminal peptide minus Lys175, 3714.3. Asp-N endoproteinase does not remove Lys175; therefore, the digest product of residues 140–174 from αBg confirms that Lys175 is not present on αBg. In the Asp-N digests there were very few masses that could not be assigned, and other than the differences just discussed there were no other peptide masses that were present in αBg that were missing in αB or vice versa. Only one peak corresponding to residues 129–139 (DPLTITSSLSS) was consistently absent in Asp-N spectra, and it was not present in either crystallin. In cataract B, there was evidence for Met68 being present as methionine sulfoxide in both αB-crystallin and αBg. The m/zvalue of 1294.9 is consistent with the expected molecular weight of residues 62–72 plus a mass of 16 mass units. The theoreticalm/z value of the same peptide with Met68 oxidized is 1294.61. Between the two enzymatic digestions spectra were obtained for peptides that covered 100% of the polypeptide sequence. The regions of the polypeptide that could not be accounted for by tryptic peptides were accounted for with the peptides from Asp-N digests and the reverse was also true, making it possible to detect a difference in any residue of αB-crystallin and αBg. There were no unique modifications, amino acid substitutions, or internal deletions detected in αBg. The excellent agreement of the masses obtained on the peptide digests of αBg with the respective theoretical masses of the same peptides in αB-crystallin indicate that there is only one difference between αBg and αB-crystallin. The terminal Lys175 is missing in αBg. The loss of the C-terminal lysine could readily explain the migration of αBg on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis at a position 1 charge more acidic than the typical form of αB-crystallin. However, it did not seem likely that the loss of one lysine (128 mass units) could explain the migration of αBg at the lower molecular weight. The only reasonable explanations were that αBg had region(s) of structure different from αB-crystallin that remained throughout the electrophoresis even in the presence of 9 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40 or 1% SDS and affected its electrophoretic migration, or that an adduct was lost during the subsequent analyses. To test whether the removal of the C-terminal lysine was sufficient to induce the altered migration on electrophoresis as was observed in the second dimension of two-dimensional electrophoresis, both human αB-crystallin and human αB-crystallin minus the C-terminal lysine (αBg) were cloned and expressed in E. coli. Both were expressed as soluble proteins in this system. Neither protein was acetylated on the N-terminal methionine. The recombinant human αB-crystallin and the recombinant human αBg eluted from a Superose 6 gel filtration column as aggregates with apparent molecular weights of 570,000 and 510,000, respectively (Fig.5). Significantly smaller species were also observed for αBg (data not shown). As shown in Fig.6 A, even after boiling in SDS, the recombinant αBg migrated slightly faster than recombinant αB-crystallin on SDS-PAGE. The calculated difference in the molecular weight between the recombinant αB-crystallin and recombinant αBg was approximately 700, similar to the difference observed on two-dimensional gels of lens proteins. These results show that the removal of the C-terminal lysine is sufficient to cause the migration of αBg at a significantly lower molecular weight than αB-crystallin. The pI values determined by isoelectric focusing under non-denaturing conditions for both proteins are shown in Fig. 6 B. The recombinant αB-crystallin had a native pI of 6.8, and recombinant αBg had a native pI of 5.8. The theoretical pI values are 6.76 and 6.50, respectively.Figure 6SDS-PAGE and native isoelectric focusing of recombinant human αB-crystallin and αBg.

Here we report the isolation of a novel NE-dlg/SAP102-associated protein, p51-nedasin. Nedasin has a significant homology with amidohydrolase superfamily proteins and shows identical sequences to a recently identified protein that has guanine aminohydrolase activity. Nedasin has four alternative splice variants (S, V1, V2, and V3) that exhibited different C-terminal structures. NE-dlg/SAP102 is shown to interact with only the S form of nedasin which is predominantly expressed in brain. The expression of nedasin in neuronal cells increases in parallel with the progress of synaptogenesis and is mainly detected in cell bodies where it co-localizes with NE-dlg/SAP102. Furthermore, nedasin interferes with the association between NE-dlg/SAP102 and NMDA receptor 2B in vitro. These findings suggest that alternative splicing of nedasin may play a role in the formation and/or structural change in synapses during neuronal development by modifying clustering of neurotransmitter receptors at the synaptic sites.

For instance, PSD-95/SAP90, which is one of the MAGUK proteins, is predominantly expressed in the brain and localizes at the postsynaptic membrane and presynaptic axon terminals of inhibitory neurons (6Kistner U. Wenzel B.M. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Voss B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4580-4583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kim E.

PSD-95/SAP90 expressed in neuronal cells is therefore thought to contribute to clustering ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors at the synaptic membranes. Mutations of the lethal (1Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)-discs large ( dlg ) gene in Drosophila, which also encodes a MAGUK family protein, was shown to cause postsynaptic structural defects (12Perrimon N. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 392-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Lahey T. Gorczyca M. Jia X.X. Budnik V. Neuron. 1994; 13: 823-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), suggesting that the dlg protein and its associated proteins are involved in the maturation of neuronal cells. These lines of evidence indicate that some MAGUKs play a role in synaptic organization in neuronal cells by linking interacting receptors to downstream signal molecules and regulating the structure of the synaptic junction. We recently identified a novel member of human MAGUK protein, NE-dlg (neuronal and endocrine dlg) (14Makino K. Kuwahara H. Masuko N. Nishiyama Y. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Kuwano A. Nakata M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NE-dlg is considered to be a human homologue of the rat postsynaptic protein SAP102 (10Muller B.M. Kistner U. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Kuhlendahl S. Fenster S.D. Lau L.F. Veh R.W. Huganir R.L. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C.

NE-dlg/SAP102 contains three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain and a GK domain as do PSD-95/SAP90, and is highly expressed in neuronal and endocrine tissues. In the neurons, NE-dlg/SAP102 has been shown to be expressed in axons and dendrites (10Muller B.M. Kistner U. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Kuhlendahl S. Fenster S.D. Lau L.F. Veh R.W. Huganir R.L.

Chung W.J. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21622-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NE-dlg/SAP102 has been found to interact with PSD-95/SAP90 in the presence of calmodulin and Ca2+ and is speculated to regulate the clustering of NMDA receptors to form the synapses at the specific site of membrane (16Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H. Fukunaga K. Sudo T. Araki N. Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5782-5790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the NE-dlg/SAP102 is abundantly expressed also in cytoplasm of the matured neuron, which is not co-localized with NR2B (16Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H. Fukunaga K. Sudo T. Araki N. Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5782-5790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that NE-dlg/SAP102 has some interactive molecules in the cytoplasm of the neuron, and it may modulate the NE-dlg/SAP102-related signaling in neuronal cells. In this study, we tried to identify a cytoplasmic NE-dlg/SAP102-interacting protein using GST-NE-dlg/SAP102 affinity column chromatography. From a bovine brain cytosol, we purified and determined a novel amidohydrolase superfamily protein, termed nedasin, that interacts with the PDZ domains of NE-dlg/SAP102 both in vitro and in vivo. Immunolocalization study shows that nedasin and NE-dlg/SAP102 co-localize at cell bodies of neuronal cells. Nedasin was shown to have four alternative splicing isoforms that have diversity at their C-terminal tails, and one isoform, called nedasin S, specifically binds to NE-dlg/SAP102. We also found that the nedasin S isoform competitively inhibits the binding between the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors and the PDZ domains of NE-dlg/SAP102. These results suggest that nedasin modifies the dlg-related molecular clustering at the synaptic sites during development of neuronal cells and that alternative splicing of the nedasin transcript may affect this interaction. The cDNA fragments coding full-length NE-dlg/SAP102 and six deletion variants ΔGK, PDZ1 + 2 + 3, PDZ1 + 2, PDZ3, PDZ2 and PDZ1, as illustrated in Fig. 4, were amplified by PCR, subcloned into a pCR2 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), digested with only EcoRI or with both EcoRI and HindIII, excised an inserted cDNA, and subcloned into a pGEX-2TH bacterial expression vector. The cDNA fragments coding full-length nedasin S and nedasin V1 were also amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pGEX-2TH vector. The expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were described previously (17Takeshima H. Izawa I. Lee P.S. Safdar N. Levin V.A. Saya H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2135-2144PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosol of bovine brain was prepared as described (18Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, bovine brain gray matter was cut into small pieces and suspended in homogenizing buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 10% sucrose). The suspension was homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon glass homogenizer and filtered through gauze. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 40% saturation. After being stirred for 1 h, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 4 ml of buffer A, dialyzed against buffer A three times, and stored at −80 °C as the 0–40% cytosolic fraction. Subsequently, the supernatant was saturated by adding solid ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 80%. The precipitate was collected, dissolved in buffer A, dialyzed as described above, and stored as the 40–80% cytosol fraction. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cytosol of rat brain was prepared as described (19Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S.

In brief, adult rat brain was homogenized in 5 volumes of buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm pepstatin, 3% aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin with a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was added to Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1%, lysed for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 60 min. The resulting supernatant was used as the crude cytosol of rat brain. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The GST-NE-dlgΔGK fusion protein (400 μg) was immobilized on GSH-agarose, which was packed into a column. The column was equilibrated with buffer B (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Bovine brain cytosolic fraction (800 μl) was first precleared by passing it through a GSH column and then was loaded onto the GST-NE-dlgΔGK affinity column. The column was washed with 2 ml of buffer B, and the protein bound to the column was eluted by the addition of 5 ml of buffer C (buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl), and fractions of 1 ml each were collected. The second and third fractions were mixed and loaded on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). To purify p51, 4 ml of the cytosol fraction of bovine brain was applied to 2 ml of GST-NE-dlgΔGK immobilized to GSH beads at a half-slurry with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Eluates were collected and dialyzed against distilled water. After being concentrated to a 100-μl solution by freeze-drying, the sample was loaded on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Ponceau S, and immobilized p51 was cut out from membrane. After being reduced andS-carboxymethylated, p51 was digested byAchromobacter protease I. After sonication, the supernatant was loaded into a C20 chromatography column. Fractionated samples were subjected to amino acid sequencing using the 492 Procise protein sequencing system (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR-based full-length nedasin cDNA cloning was performed as previously reported (14Makino K. Kuwahara H. Masuko N. Nishiyama Y. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Kuwano A. Nakata M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Primers for cloning (A1, 5′-TGATTTGCACATTCAGAGCCATAT-3′; A2, 5′-CTTATACCCCAGTTATAAAAACTA-3′; A3, 5′-CATCACTGTCTTATTTGTCAAAAG-3′; A4, 5′-CACAGATGTGTAGTTTTT ATAACT-3′) were designed based on the sequence information of the EST clone R34820whose open reading frames contained two peptide sequences of the purified p51 protein. For amplification of the 5′ region, the first PCR was performed using only primer A1 to amplify single-strand cDNA from a HeLa cell cDNA library (Marathon-Ready™ cDNA,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The first PCR product was used as a template in the second run, where the A2 primer and adaptor primer 1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACT CACTATAGGGC-3′), based on the sequence of the Marathon cDNA adaptor, were utilized as primers to amplify the 5′ region cDNA. Amplification of the 3′ region was also performed by the same two-step PCR procedure. A3 primer was used for the first-round PCR to amplify the 3′ region, and A4 and adaptor primer 1 were used for the second-round PCR. The PCR fragments were ligated into a pGEM-T Easy cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. All PCR procedures were performed by using rTth DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), which has proof-reading activity. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing several clones that were generated by independent PCR to avoid errors introduced during the PCR reaction. PCR was performed to detect nedasin sequences in the GeneBridge 4 Radiation Hybrid Screening Panel (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) using a set of primers (B1, 5′-ATTGAAGAGGTTTATGTGGGC-3′, and B2, 5′-CAAGGGAGATGCACAACCACGCTA-3′) that were designed based on a partial genomic sequence of thenedasin gene. PCR was carried out as described previously (14Makino K. Kuwahara H. Masuko N. Nishiyama Y. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Kuwano A. Nakata M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the PCR results were sent to the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research for the mapping of the gene (21Hudson T.J.

A Northern blot derived from various human tissues (CLONTECH) was probed with an 848-bp cDNA fragment of nedasin that had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (14Makino K. Kuwahara H. Masuko N. Nishiyama Y. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Kuwano A. Nakata M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Tissue samples were frozen immediately after surgical resection and stored at −80 °C. Poly(A)+ mRNA was extracted using a Micro Fast Track kit (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from mRNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase and random primers. The cDNA was used for the subsequent RT-PCR reaction. Human fetal brain and HeLa cell cDNA libraries (Marathon-Ready™ cDNA) were purchased from CLONTECH. The sequences of the primers for RT-PCR were P1 (5′-ATTGAAGAGGTTTATGTGGGC-3′) and P2 (5′-CAAGGGAGATGCACAACCACGCTA-3′). The PCR reaction was performed in a volume of 15 μl containing 0.5 μl of cDNA, 10 pm primers, 10× PCR mixture, 1.5 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 1.5 μl of GeneAmp dNTP mixture, and 0.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold™ (Perkin-Elmer) polymerase. The amplification sequence consisted of an initial denaturation at 96 °C/9 min and 40 cycles of 96 °C/30 s, 60 °C/30 s, 72 °C/30 s and a final extension at 72 °C/7 min using the Perkin-Elmer PCR thermocycler 2400. Amplified products (5 μl) were resolved on 2.5% ethidium bromide-stained TBE-agarose gels. An antibody against the C-terminal region of nedasin was raised by the subcutaneous immunization of a rabbit with a synthetic peptide (RNIEEVYVGGKQVVPFSSSV) coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Both the S form and V1 form of nedasin were amplified by PCR from the HeLa cDNA library using rTth DNA polymerase and a set of primers, P3 (5′-TGCGCGAATTCGGATCCATGTGTGCCGCTCAGATGCCG-3′) and P4 (5′-AAATAGGATCCAAGCTTAAGGAAATGGTGGAGGATGGGG-3′), and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. The nedasin S and V1 cDNA were then digested with BamHI and ligated into pBj-Myc to construct pBj-Myc/nedasin S or pBj-Myc/nedasin V1. The S and V1 cDNA were also ligated into pCALNL5 vector, which has a Cre-recombinase mediated activation unit (22Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 181: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), to construct pCALNL5/nedasin S or pCALNL5/nedasin V1. The HA-tagged full-length NE-dlg/SAP102-expressing plasmid, pCGN/full-length NE-dlg, was constructed as described previously (14Makino K. Kuwahara H. Masuko N. Nishiyama Y. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Kuwano A. Nakata M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The pCGN/NE-dlgΔGK construct lacking a guanylate kinase domain was obtained by digesting the pCGN/full-length NE-dlg plasmid with BamHI and then self-ligated. The plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells by the liposome-mediated gene transfer method. Various deletion derivatives of NE-dlg/SAP102 fused to GST or GST immobilized to GSH-agarose beads were incubated with the lysates of COS-7 cells, which were transfected with pBj-Myc/nedasin S or pBj-Myc/nedasin V1, for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with TNN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) 3 times, the precipitates were probed with the anti-Myc antibody. COS-7 cells transfected with pBj-Myc/nedasin S (or pBj-Myc/nedasin V1) and pCGN/NE-dlg ΔGK were lysed in TNN buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm pepstatin, 3% aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin for 45 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc or HA antibody. The precipitates were then probed with the anti-HA or Myc antibody. Crude cytosolic fraction of adult rat brain was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-nedasin antibody, rabbit anti-NE-dlg/SAP102 antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Inc.), or control rabbit IgG. The immunoprecipitates were probed with goat anti-NE-dlg/SAP102 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or rabbit anti-nedasin antibody. COS-7 cells that were transfected by pBj-Myc/nedasin S or pBj-Myc/nedasin V1 were harvested at 48 h after the transfection and boiled in SDS loading dye. The pCALNL5/nedasin (S or V1), which has the Cre-mediated gene activation unit, was transfected into COS-7 cells. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the cells were infected with the Cre recombinase producing recombinant adenovirus (AxCANCre) (23Kanegae Y. Takamori K. Sato Y. Lee G. Nakai M. Saito I. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 181: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and boiled in SDS loading dye at 48 h after the infection. Cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filters were probed with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5), anti-GST monoclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), goat anti-NE-dlg/SAP102 antibody, and rabbit anti-nedasin antibody by using the method previously described (14Makino K.

Neonatal rat neuronal cell cultures were prepared according to the method described previously (24Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at the indicated days in culture and were subjected to Western blot analysis using the rabbit anti-nedasin antibody and125I-labeled protein A (NEN Life Science Products) for detecting the nedasin protein. Normal human neural progenitor cells were purchased from Clonetics. Normal human neural progenitor cells were cultured and induced differentiation according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the immunofluorescence analysis, cells at 21 days in culture were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Fixed cells were stained with rabbit anti-nedasin polyclonal antibody (1:250) and goat anti-NE-dlg/SAP102 antibody (1:100). After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody. After being washed with PBS, samples were mounted in 80% glycerol and visualized with a confocal laser microscope (Fluoview, Olympus) as described previously (16Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H.

The interference of the interaction between NE-dlg/SAP102 and NMDA receptor subunit NR2B by nedasin was evaluated by means of surface plasmon resonance responses in BIAcore instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) based on the basic principles and detection method as described (25Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjoelander S. Sternberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Oestlin H. Malmqvist M.

The biotinylated peptides PEP7154 (biotin-NGHVYEKLSSIESDV-COOH) corresponding to the C terminus of rat NMDA receptor subunit NR2B and PEP7153 (biotin-NGHVYEKLSSIESD-COOH) for a negative control were supplied by Iwaki Glass Co. (Chiba, Japan). These peptides were immobilized on the flow cell of the sensor tip SA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The indicated concentration of GST-NE-dlg PDZ1+2 and GST-nedasin was mixed and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and then added to a final volume of 200 μl with HBS buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P-20, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and injected at a flow rate of 6 μl/min. The sensorgram of the PEP7153 flow cell was subtracted from that of the PEP7154 flow cell. To identify NE-dlg/SAP102 interacting cytosolic molecules, we loaded bovine brain cytosolic fraction onto a GST-NE-dlgΔGK affinity column. The proteins bound to the affinity columns were eluted by 500 mm NaCl. A protein with a mass of about 51 kDa (p51) was detected in the 500 mm NaCl eluate from the GST-NE-dlgΔGK affinity column but not from the GST affinity column (Fig.1). To clarify the molecular identity of p51, the purified protein was subjected to amino acid sequencing, and 10 peptide sequences derived from p51 were determined. These peptide sequences did not match any previously identified molecules, but two peptide sequences (NLYPSYK and NYTSVYD) were found in one of the open reading frames of a human EST clone, R34820. Based on the sequence of this EST clone, we performed a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (14Makino K. Kuwahara H. Masuko N. Nishiyama Y. Morisaki T. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Kuwano A. Nakata M.

(1995) Science 268, 1170-1173). Domain I of the RegA protein contains a four-stranded beta-sheet and two alpha-helices. Domain II contains a four-stranded beta-sheet and an unusual 3/10 helix. Since beta-sheet residues play a role in a number of protein-RNA interactions, one or both of the beta-sheet regions in RegA protein may be involved in RNA binding. To test this possibility, mutagenesis of residues on both beta-sheets was performed, and the effects on the RNA binding affinities of RegA protein were measured. Additional sites for mutagenesis were selected from molecular modeling of RegA protein. The RNA binding affinities of three purified mutant RegA proteins were evaluated by fluorescence quenching equilibrium binding assays. The activities of the remainder of the mutant proteins were evaluated by quantitative RNA gel mobility shift assays using lysed cell supernatants. The results of this mutagenesis study ruled out the participation of beta-sheet residues. Instead, the RNA binding site was found to be a surface pocket formed by residues on two loops and an alpha-helix. Thus, RegA protein appears to use a unique structural motif in binding RNA, which may be related to its unusual RNA recognition properties."
