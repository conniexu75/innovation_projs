https://openalex.org/W2041415161,"The activity of the c-Kit receptor protein-tyrosine kinase is tightly regulated in normal cells, whereas deregulated c-Kit kinase activity is implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancers. The c-Kit juxtamembrane region is known to have an autoinhibitory function; however the precise mechanism by which c-Kit is maintained in an autoinhibited state is not known. We report the 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure of native c-Kit kinase in an autoinhibited conformation and compare it with active c-Kit kinase. Autoinhibited c-Kit is stabilized by the juxtamembrane domain, which inserts into the kinase-active site and disrupts formation of the activated structure. A 1.6-Å crystal structure of c-Kit in complex with STI-571 (Imatinib® or Gleevec®) demonstrates that inhibitor binding disrupts this natural mechanism for maintaining c-Kit in an autoinhibited state. Together, these results provide a structural basis for understanding c-Kit kinase autoinhibition and will facilitate the structure-guided design of specific inhibitors that target the activated and autoinhibited conformations of c-Kit kinase.

The stem cell factor receptor c-Kit is a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK) 1The abbreviations used are: RPTK, receptor protein-tyrosine kinase; KID, kinase insertion domain; MuSK, autoinhibited muscle-specific kinase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PTR, phosphotyrosine; SH, Src homolgy; RMS, root mean square. that initiates cell growth and proliferation signal transduction cascades in response to stem cell factor binding (1Linnekin D. Int. J. of Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Google Scholar). c-Kit, named after its viral homolog v-Kit (2Besmer P. Murphy J.E. George P.C. Qiu F.H. Bergold P.J. Lederman L. Snyder Jr., H.W. Broudeur D. Zuckerman E.E. Hardy W.D. Nature. 1986; 320: 415-421Google Scholar), is a member of the Type III transmembrane RPTK subfamily, which includes the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (3Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D. Chen E. Mitchell R.L. Isacke C.M. Verma I.M. Ullrich A. Nature. 1986; 320: 277-280Google Scholar), also known as the FMS receptor, the related Flt-3 receptor (4Rosnet O. Schiff C. Pebusque M.-J. Marchetto S. Tonnelle C. Toiron Y. Birg F. Birnbaum D. Blood. 1993; 82: 1110-1119Google Scholar), and the platelet-derived growth factor α- and β-receptors (5Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A.

Harkins R.N. Francke U. Fried V.A. Ullrich A. Williams L.T. Nature. 1986; 323: 226-232Google Scholar), as well as c-Kit (7Yarden Y. Kuang W.-J. Yang-Feng T. Coussens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Google Scholar). The Type III RPTK family is characterized by five extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, a single transmembrane helix, an autoinhibitory juxtamembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain that is split by a kinase insertion domain (KID) (see Fig. 1A) (6Yarden Y. Escobedo J.A. Kuang W.-J. Yang-Feng T.L. Daniel T.O. Tremble P.M. Chen E.Y. Ando M.E. Harkins R.N. Francke U. Fried V.A. Ullrich A. Williams L.T. Nature. 1986; 323: 226-232Google Scholar, 8Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar). The binding of a stem cell factor dimer to the extracellular Ig domains of c-Kit causes two c-Kit RPTKs to dimerize and permits the kinase domains to act in trans as a substrate and enzyme for one another. The result of stem cell factor binding is the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues located in c-Kit juxtamembrane regions (9Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar, 10Hubbard S.R.

Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Google Scholar). Tyrosine residue 568 is the primary site of in vivo autophosphorylation (see Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of the tyrosine initiates a cytoplasmic serine/threonine phosphorylation cascade that promotes cell growth and proliferation (12Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Google Scholar). Mutations that cause constitutive activation of c-Kit kinase activity in the absence of stem cell factor binding are implicated in highly malignant human cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (13Hirota S.

Res. 2001; 477: 165-171Google Scholar), and in mastocytosis (17Longley Jr., B.J. Metcalfe D.D. Tharp M. Wang X. Tyrrell L. Lu S.-Z. Heitjan D. Ma Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1609-1614Google Scholar). Moreover, activating c-Kit mutations that occur in the kinase domain are resistant to many kinase inhibitors currently in use as chemotherapy treatments (18Frost M.J. Ferrao P.T. Hughes T.P.

Lortholary O. Arock M. Hermine O. Dubreuil P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 660-664Google Scholar). The kinase activity of c-Kit is tightly regulated throughout its signaling cycle. Binding of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to the phosphorylated c-Kit juxtamembrane region results in dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues and termination of the intracellular signal (22Kozlowski M. Larose L. Lee F. Le D.M. Rottapel R. Siminovitch K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2089-2099Google Scholar). The dual role of the juxtamembrane region as an unphosphorylated autoinhibitory domain and as a phosphorylated intracellular signal has made it difficult to dissect the structural and mechanistic functions of the juxtamembrane region in the signaling cascade. Specific site-directed mutations introduced into the juxtamembrane domains of c-Kit (23Ma Y. Cunningham M.E. Wang X. Ghosh I. Regan L. Longley B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13399-13402Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor (24Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Google Scholar, 25Irusta P.M. Luo Y. Bakht O. Lai C.-C. Smith S.O. DiMaio D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38627-38634Google Scholar) indicate that several residues are necessary to maintain the kinase in an autoinhibited state (see Fig. 1B). Based on amino acid sequence analysis the Type III RPTK juxtamembrane domains are proposed to adopt a conformation similar to WW domains, which are implicated in regulating cellular processes (26Ilsley J.L. Sudol M. Winder S.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 183-189Google Scholar, 27Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Google Scholar, 28Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Google Scholar). Similarly, the c-Kit autoinhibitory juxtamembrane region has been proposed to form a putative α-helix that exerts negative control over uninduced receptor (23Ma Y. Cunningham M.E. Wang X. Ghosh I. Regan L. Longley B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13399-13402Google Scholar). Studies with a synthetic peptide of the c-Kit juxtamembrane region suggest that it folds as an autonomous domain and directly interacts with the amino-terminal lobe of the kinase domain (29Chan P.M. Ilangumaran S. La Rose J. Chakrabartty A. Rottapel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3067-3078Google Scholar). These models for the autoinhibition of Type III RPTKs are derived from autoregulation mechanisms inferred from the crystal structures of other protein-tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Refs. 30Hubbard S.R. Hill J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Google Scholar and 31Hubbard S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-741Google Scholar). Autoinhibition in cis is seen in the crystal structure of the autoinhibited form of the EphB2 receptor tyrosine kinase domain (32Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B. Ong S.H. Tong J. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Cell. 2001; 106: 745-757Google Scholar). This structure contains a truncated juxtamembrane domain with phenylalanine substitution mutations of signaling tyrosine residues similar to those in the juxtamembrane regions of c-Kit and the Type III RPTKs. The visible portion of the EphB2 juxtamembrane domain forms a short α-helix that packs against the amino-terminal lobe of the kinase and disrupts the interactions of the control, or C, helix with residues that form an activated kinase ATP-binding site. Similarly, the crystal structure of the autoinhibited muscle-specific kinase MuSK reveals a small ordered segment of the MuSK juxtamembrane region that forms a short α-helix, which likely impedes the ability of the C-helix to contribute to productive binding of ATP (33Till J.H. Becerra M. Watty A. Lu Y. Ma Y. Neubert T.A. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. Structure. 2002; 10: 1187-1196Google Scholar). An autoinhibitory structural role for a juxtamembrane region tyrosine residue was also inferred from the crystal structure of the insulin receptor in which a similar disruption of the conformation of the C-helix was observed (34Li S. Covino N.D. Stein E.G. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26007-26014Google Scholar). Targeting these distinct inactive kinase conformations for a rational drug design may allow for the design of tight binding and specific compounds. STI-571, also known as Imatinib® or Glivec®/Gleevec®, is one such drug compound that specifically binds to the inactive conformation of the Abl kinase. Abl kinase is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (35O'Dwyer M.E. Mauro M.J Druker B.J. Cancer Investig. 2003; 3: 429-438Google Scholar). Notably, STI-571 does not inhibit many other kinases, but it does inhibit the two closely related Type III RPTKs, platelet-derived growth factor and c-Kit (36Buchdunger E. Cioffi C.L. Law N. Stover D. Ohno-Jones S. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 139-145Google Scholar). Recently we reported (37Mol C.D. Lim K.B. Sridhar V. Zou H. Chien E.Y. Sang B.-C. Nowakowski J. Kassel D.B. Cronin C.N. Mcree D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31461-31464Google Scholar) the 2.9-Å resolution crystal structure of an activated c-Kit kinase domain-product complex bound in trans with juxtamembrane phosphotyrosine residues and ADP and Mg2+. For comparative analysis, we recapitulate that structure here at an improved 2.65-Å resolution. We also present the 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure of unphosphorylated c-Kit kinase containing the entire autoinhibitory juxtamembrane region. The juxtamembrane domain inserts directly into the cleft between the kinase amino- and carboxyl-terminal lobes, disrupting the c-Kit control helix, and physically blocking the conserved kinase Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif from attaining a productive conformation. The kinase activation loop folds back over the substrate-binding groove and interacts with the kinase-active center as a pseudosubstrate. We also present a 1.6-Å resolution co-crystal structure of a c-Kit·STI-571 complex that illustrates that portions of the inhibitor would clash with regions of the juxtamembrane domain that maintain c-Kit in the autoinhibited conformation. These results provide the detailed molecular basis for understanding the mechanism of c-Kit kinase autoinhibition and will facilitate the structure-guided design of specific and potent inhibitors that target the activated and autoinhibited conformations of c-Kit kinase. Protein Expression and Purification—The portion of the human c-Kit gene that comprises the catalytic kinase domains and the entire intact juxtamembrane domain (residues 544–935, GenBank™ accession number NM_000222 (3Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D. Chen E. Mitchell R.L. Isacke C.M. Verma I.M. Ullrich A. Nature. 1986; 320: 277-280Google Scholar)) with the KID residues 694–753 deleted was cloned and expressed as described previously (37Mol C.D. Lim K.B. Sridhar V. Zou H. Chien E.Y. Sang B.-C. Nowakowski J. Kassel D.B. Cronin C.N. Mcree D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31461-31464Google Scholar). Recombinant c-Kit protein was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells in 5L Wave BioReactors with ESF-921 protein-free media (Expression Systems), and the cells were harvested after 2 days. The protein yield was 3.77 mg/liter and the recombinant protein, containing an amino-terminal His6 tag followed by an rTEV protease cleavage site, was purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography, the tag was removed with rTEV protease, and the tag and any uncleaved material were removed by a second passage over a ProBond Ni2+-chelate column. Purified c-Kit protein was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE and was concentrated to 6–12 mg/ml in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Purified and concentrated c-Kit protein was flash-frozen in 50-μl aliquots by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of activated c-Kit kinase domain (∼0.2 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm) are grown at 20 °C as described (37Mol C.D. Lim K.B. Sridhar V. Zou H. Chien E.Y. Sang B.-C. Nowakowski J. Kassel D.B. Cronin C.N. Mcree D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31461-31464Google Scholar) by pre-incubating enzyme samples (6 mg/ml) with ATP and MgCl2 prior to performing sitting-drop crystallization experiments using 5 μl of protein solution and 5 μl of reservoir solution (18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m MES, pH 7.1). Crystals of autoinhibited c-Kit kinase (∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm) are obtained at 20 °C from the same protein preparation (10 mg/ml) using Nanovolume Crystallization® (38Hosfield D. Palan J. Hilgers M. Scheibe D. McRee D.E. Stevens R.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 207-217Google Scholar) techniques with 50 nl of protein solution and 50 nl of reservoir solution containing 13% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0. For crystals of the co-complex with STI-571 (∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm), 50 nl of enzyme-inhibitor solution and 50 nl of reservoir (2 m phosphate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5) were used, and the crystals were grown at 4 °C. Single crystals of all enzyme forms were harvested in reservoir solutions supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol, and flash-frozen by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source Beam Line 5.0.3 equipped with an ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector, and the diffraction intensities were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The activated c-Kit kinase crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions a = 95.3 Å, b = 119.5 Å, and c = 62.6Å and contain two enzyme molecules in the asymmetric unit. The autoinhibited c-Kit kinase crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 44.4 Å, b = 77.2 Å, and c = 94.6 Å and possess one enzyme molecule in the asymmetric unit. The c-Kit·STI-571 complex crystals are in the trigonal space group P3221 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 70.1 Å and c = 127.9 Å and contain one enzyme-inhibitor co-complex in the asymmetric unit. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of activated c-Kit kinase was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (40Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Google Scholar) and refined as described previously (37Mol C.D. Lim K.B. Sridhar V. Zou H. Chien E.Y. Sang B.-C. Nowakowski J. Kassel D.B. Cronin C.N. Mcree D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31461-31464Google Scholar). This structure contains two c-Kit enzyme molecules in the asymmetric unit and clear electron density for residues 567–935 of both enzymes, with the exception of ∼20 amino-terminal amino acid residues as well as ∼10 residues comprising the truncated KID, which are disordered. The structure of autoinhibited c-Kit kinase contains only one enzyme molecule in the asymmetric unit and was also determined by molecular replacement with AMoRe, using the activated c-Kit kinase structure as a search model with the correct solution yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.30 and an initial R-value of 0.50. The initial solutions were refined with REFMAC (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar), and the models were visually inspected and manually built and rebuilt using the XtalView/Xfit program suite (42McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar). The structure of autoinhibited c-Kit kinase is fully ordered with unambiguous electron density for residues 548–935, including the truncated KID residues. For the structure of the c-Kit·STI-571 complex two molecular replacement calculations were performed utilizing the activated structure (correlation coefficient 0.28, R-value 0.47) and the autoinhibited structure (correlation coefficient 0.39, R-value 0.44). The autoinhibited structure was clearly the better model, and a refinement of this model yielded clear unambiguous electron density for the bound inhibitor. The x-ray data collection and crystallographic refinement statistics for these three structures are presented in Table I. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, 1PKG (activated), 1T45 (autoinhibited), and 1T46 (STI-571 co-complex).Table IX-ray data collection and refinement statisticsAutoinhibitedActivatedSTI-571Data collectionResolution (Å)30.0-1.90 (1.97-1.90)30.0-2.65 (2.74-2.65)30.0-1.60 (1.66-1.60)Observations107,29998,443220,014Unique reflections26,26021,24348,006Completeness (%)98.3 (96.5)99.3 (95.1)98.4 (90.0)I/σI12.6 (3.1)15.4 (2.0)19.3 (2.6)RsymaRsym = ΣhΣj|〈I(h)〉 - I(h)j |/ ΣhΣj 〈I(h)〉 where 〈I(h)〉 is the mean intensity of symmetry-related reflections0.058 (0.345)0.046 (0.493)0.028 (0.367)RefinementResolution (Å)20.0-1.9010.0-2.6520.0-1.60Reflections used24,83519,68745,483Number of protein atoms2,6894,6722,381Number of ligand atoms05737Number of solvent atoms20823268RMS bonds (Å)0.0090.0120.007RMS angles (°)1.1121.3351.085Average B-value (Å2)16.954.923.6R-value, RfreebR-value = Σ||Fobs| - |Fcalc||/ Σ |Fobs|; Rfree for 5% of reflections excluded from refinement.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 583-601Google Scholar), which is based on B-factors including the translation, liberation, and screw-rotation contributions (44Schneider T.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 195-208Google Scholar). The coordinate uncertainties for the activated conformation ranged from 0.246 to 0.688 Å with a mean of 0.365 ± 0.076 Å. The coordinate uncertainties for the autoinhibited conformation were significantly smaller reflecting the higher resolution of the diffraction data used to refine the structure, values ranged from 0.080 to 0.313 Å with a mean of 0.138 ± 0.048 Å. Structure of Active c-Kit Kinase—The activated and autoinhibited c-Kit kinase structures were obtained from constructs containing an intact juxtamembrane region (approximately residues from Thr544 to Trp580) followed by the kinase domains. The KID is a region of variable length and unknown function that splits the coding sequence for the C-lobe of many RPTKs, and is truncated in these constructs (see”Experimental Procedures“). Crystals of the active c-Kit kinase are obtained by pre-incubating purified protein samples with ATP and Mg2+ to initiate the trans autophosphorylation reaction. Analysis of the reaction products by mass spectrometry (37Mol C.D. Lim K.B. Sridhar V. Zou H. Chien E.Y. Sang B.-C. Nowakowski J. Kassel D.B. Cronin C.N. Mcree D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31461-31464Google Scholar) shows that the primary sites of phosphorylation are Tyr568 and Tyr570, which are located near the junction of the juxtamembrane domain and the N-lobe of the kinase (Fig. 1B). The x-ray data collection and 2.65-Å resolution refinement statistics for activated c-Kit are presented in Table I. This structure contains two c-Kit enzyme molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, with phosphotyrosine (PTR)-568 from the amino termini of adjacent molecules in the crystal lattice binding in trans at the kinase-active center. In the active c-Kit kinase structure, the ∼20 amino acid residues of the juxtamembrane domain preceding Tyr568 (Fig. 1B) of both enzymes in the crystallographic asymmetric unit are disordered as are the residues of the truncated KID. The structure of active c-Kit kinase domain is consistent with the common protein kinase fold (Fig. 2A). The smaller N-lobe is comprised of mostly β-strands and a single α-helix, the C-helix, that modulates activity via contacts with the nucleotide binding site and DFG motif at the base of the activation loop (A-loop) (Fig. 2, A and B). Residue Glu640 of the C-helix of active c-Kit provides a critical salt link to the buried side chain of Lys623, which bridges the α- and β-phosphates of the bound ADP. The c-Kit DFG motif is also in an active conformation, with Asp810 coordinating the Mg2+ ion bridging the α- and β-phosphates, and Phe811 positioned to allow binding of the adenine moiety of the nucleotide (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3On and off conformations of the c-Kit kinase A-loop DFG motif. A, stereo view of the nucleotide-bound c-Kit kinase-active center. The DFG motif (Asp810, Phe811, Gly812) is in a conformation that allows nucleotide binding with Asp810 ligating the bound Mg2+ ion (pink sphere). In this product complex structure, the P-loop (orange) with Phe600 shields the active center, and the γ-phosphate group of ATP has been transferred to the target tyrosine residue PTR-568. B, stereo view of the autoinhibited c-Kit kinase-active center. The penetration of the autoinhibitory juxtamembrane region (purple) inserts Trp557 into the area that Phe811 occupies in the activated structure. The DFG motif is in the autoinhibited off state with Phe811 flipped over and occluding the nucleotide binding site. In this pseudosubstrate complex, The A-loop (green) is folded back and the P-loop (orange, upper left) is shifted from its nucleotide-bound position.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The active c-Kit kinase enzyme structure is a product complex, with ADP, a Mg2+ ion, and the side chain of PTR-568 bound at the kinase-active site. As PTR-568 is covalently attached to another enzyme molecule in the crystal, substrate peptide binding in trans is restricted by crystal packing interactions. Although the details of phosphotyrosine binding at the active center is identical in both molecules of the asymmetric unit, the global course of the substrate peptide binding differs. We have focused our discussion on substrate peptide binding to molecule A, as in this configuration the peptide packs against and stabilizes the active conformation of the A-loop (37Mol C.D. Lim K.B. Sridhar V. Zou H. Chien E.Y. Sang B.-C. Nowakowski J. Kassel D.B. Cronin C.N. Mcree D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31461-31464Google Scholar). The activation loop is in the active conformation, despite the fact that the target A-loop tyrosine, Tyr823, is not phosphorylated. The side chain of Tyr823 is directed toward a positively charged region formed by the guanidinium groups of Arg815 and Arg791. A PTR residue at this position would further stabilize the kinase A-loop in an active conformation. Structure of Autoinhibited c-Kit Kinase—Many protein kinases are maintained in an inactive state in the absence of activating signals, a fact first determined for the Ser/Thr protein kinases (45Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Google Scholar), and recently observed for the protein-tyrosine kinases (46Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Google Scholar). For many non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the Abl kinase, the inactive state of the kinase is maintained through SH2 and SH3 protein interaction domains that associate with and inhibit the kinase domain (47Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Google Scholar). The RPTKs, such as c-Kit, lack these inhibitory protein interaction domains, and the kinase is activated via ligand-mediated receptor dimerization. In addition to its role as a substrate for trans autophosphorylation in vivo, there is compelling evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the Type III RPTKs also functions as an autoinhibitory domain. Unfortunately, much of this region is disordered in the active structure of c-Kit. The structure of autoinhibited c-Kit kinase, which has an ordered juxtamembrane domain, permits the dual function of the juxtamembrane region to be more clearly understood. The structure of c-Kit in an autoinhibited conformation was determined using the active c-Kit kinase domain structure as a molecular replacement search model. Even at the earliest stages of refinement the electron density maps indicated that a substantial rearrangement and shifting of the structural elements in the kinase N-lobe had occurred (Fig. 2B). The high resolution 1.90-Å data for the autoinhibited structure allowed for the entire polypeptide chain to be fit unambiguously, including the residues for the truncated KID and the aminoterminal residues that were not visible in the activated kinase structure. Contrary to the possibility that the Type III RPTK juxtamembrane regions might adopt a “WW-like” β-sheet domain (24Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Google Scholar) or an α-helical structure (23Ma Y. Cunningham M.E. Wang X. Ghosh I. Regan L. Longley B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13399-13402Google Scholar), the juxtamembrane domain forms a compact hairpin loop that inserts directly into the domain interface between the kinase N- and C-lobes (Fig. 2B). The ∼20 amino-terminal residues of the juxtamembrane domain, from Tyr547 to Gly565, comprise the inner buried half of this hairpin loop and form specific interactions that disrupt the conformation of the kinase DFG motif and A-loop (see below). The subsequent region that contains the target tyrosine residues of the autophosphorylation reaction extends along the exterior solvent-exposed half of the hairpin loop (Fig. 2B). Juxtamembrane region residues identified by site-directed mutagenesis as critical in maintaining the autoinhibited state (Fig. 2) make important interactions in the interface between the amino-terminal autoinhibitory domain and the formal kinase N- and C-lobes (Fig. 3B). The side chains of Val559 and Val560 stabilize a hydrophobic patch formed by Val643, Tyr646, Cys788, and Ile789, whereas Tyr553 penetrates deeply into the interface (Fig. 3B) and forms hydrogen bonds between its side chain–OH group and the side chains of buried and conserved residues Asp810 of the DFG motif and Glu640. In the active c-Kit kinase structure, the conformation of the polypeptide backbone is such that Phe811 of the DFG motif does not block the nucleotide-binding site (Fig. 3A). However, in the autoinhibited kinase conformation, Phe811 is blocked from this position by Trp557 and occludes the active site. (Fig. 3B). The kinase DFG motif flips between the “on” and “off” states by rotating about the ϕ main chain torsion angle of Asp810, which maintains the Asp810 carboxylate side chain in approximately the same p"

FOXOs are negatively regulated by protein kinase B/c-Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Here we show that FOXO factors are also subject to regulation by reversible acetylation. We provide evidence that the acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) binds FOXO resulting in acetylation of FOXO. This acetylation inhibits FOXO transcriptional activity. Binding of CBP and acetylation are induced after treatment of cells with peroxide stress. Deacetylation of FOXOs involves binding of the NAD-dependent deacetylase hSir2SIRT1. Accordingly, hSir2SIRT1-mediated deacetylation precludes FOXO inhibition through acetylation and thereby prolongs FOXO-dependent transcription of stress-regulating genes. These data demonstrate that acetylation functions in a second pathway of negative control for FOXO factors and provides a novel mechanism whereby hSir2SIRT1 can promote cellular survival and increase lifespan.

In C. elegans, overexpression of the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) increases lifespan, which requires DAF-16 (12Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). The Sir2 family of genes is a highly conserved group of genes with seven human homologues, of which the SIRT1 gene encodes the closest homologue of yeast and C. elegans Sir2, hence named hSir2SIRT1 (13Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Recently, deacetylation of p53 by hSir2SIRT1 has been demonstrated, and it has been suggested that this functions in increasing cellular resistance against stress. However, subsequent studies (14Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A.

As DAF-16 is necessary for lifespan extension by Sir2, FOXOs may well function in such an alternative pathway.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the FLAG-M2 epitope, p27kip1, and GAPDH were obtained from Sigma, Transduction Laboratories, and Chemicon, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing acetylated lysine residues (α-AcLys), actin, CBP, Gal4-DBD, MnSOD, and pS473-PKB were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (3×), Stressgen BioReagents, and New England Biolabs, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing FOXO3a were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing FOXO4 (19Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.

Polyclonal antibody recognizing hSir2SIRT1 was raised in a rabbit using an N-terminally 6His-tagged fragment consisting of amino acids 506–747 of hSir2SIRT1. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon). Western blot analysis was performed under standard conditions using the indicated antibodies. FOXO Activity—To determine the expression of endogenous p27kip1 and MnSOD, HEK293T cells were transfected with empty vector or HA-FOXO4 together with pBabe-puro. Either constructs encoding Gal4-DBD-CBP-HA or myc-hSirSIRT1 were cotransfected or cells were treated using hydrogen peroxide or Nam for twenty-four hours. Twenty-four hours before harvest, 1 μg/ml puromycin was added to the cultures to select for transfected cells. Cells were lysed in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis. If indicated, DL23 cells treated for twenty-four hours with 4-OHT and/or Nam were used. For luciferase assays, either A14 cells transiently transfected with a reporter construct bearing six canonical FOXO binding sites (6× DBE-luciferase) or a reporter cell line (A14-p27luc) stably expressing the human p27kip1-promoter linked to luciferase (p27GL-1609) were used. Cells were treated as above. Luciferase counts were normalized using Tk-Renilla-luciferase. Samples were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). To control for effects on basal transcription, the fold induction of luciferase expression was determined by dividing luciferase ratios from samples transfected with FOXO4 by the ratios from parallel samples transfected with empty vector. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Flow cytometric analysis to determine the percentage of cells in the G1-phase or S-phase of the cell cycle was essentially done as described (3Kops G.J. de Ruiter N.D. De Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R.

Cells were either transfected with HA-FOXO3a.A3 and hSir2SIRT1 or treated with 4-OHT (500 nm) and/or Nam (5 mm). Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. For the measurement of reactive oxygen species, DL23 and A14 cells were loaded with 10 μg/ml CM-H2DCFDA probe (Molecular Probes) in HEPES buffered saline for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm bicarbonate, pH 7.2, without phenol red at 37 °C and treated with 150 μm H2O2. Fluorescence was collected with a Leica DMR microscope. Excitation was done with a monochromator (SPEX Industries) at 490 nm (slit = 8 nm), >515 nm dichroic mirror, and a >515 nm emission filter. Ultra-low light conditions were applied only during image collection, under which no photo-activation of the cellular H2DCFDA could be observed. Images were collected by integration of 20 frames at 10-s interval (fixed gain, intensifier/camera/grabber, during all experiments). Off-line analysis was done by quantification of the average pixel intensities of at least five individual cells/image during time in at least two separate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Co-immunoprecipitation—For exogenous proteins, HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. For CBP/FOXO4 coimmunoprecipitations, cells were left untreated or were treated with insulin plus EGF or hydrogen peroxide only for 30 min (see Fig. 4A) or 60 min (see Fig. 4C) or with insulin plus EGF for 30 min before adding hydrogen peroxide for 30 min (see Fig. 4A, as indicated). For hSir2SIRT1/FOXO4 co-immunoprecipitations, cells were treated with Nam (5 mm) or hydrogen peroxide (200 μm) as indicated. Forty hours after transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitation samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis. For endogenous proteins, C2C12 or HEK293T cells were treated using 500 μm H2O2 for 1 h and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described for exogenous proteins. Acetylation—HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. Cells were treated with Nam for 1 h or with hydrogen peroxide for the indicated times. Forty hours after transfection, cells were lysed in acetylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors) or RIPA buffer. FOXO4 immunoprecipitation samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis. In Vitro and in Vivo Deacetylation—For in vitro deacetylation, 2.5 μg GST-FOXO4-DB were incubated with 0.05 μCi [14C]-acetyl-CoA (ICN) and 2.0 μg GST-p300-HAT in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl (21Vries R.G.

Subsequently, deacetylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm trichostatin A plus 1 mm NAD+ if indicated (24Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A.

Samples were incubated for another 90 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated using 5× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. For in vivo deacetylation, HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. Forty hours posttransfection cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and myc-FOXO4 was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates using 9E10 antibody. Immunoprecipitates and total lysates were subjected to Western blotting. Nicotinamide Inhibits FOXO Transcriptional Activity—To investigate the possibility that hSir2SIRT1 controls FOXO function, we analyzed the effect of Nam, an inhibitor of the Sir2 family of deacetylases (25Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), on FOXO4 transcriptional activity. Nam inhibited FOXO4-mediated transcription of a luciferase reporter construct bearing six canonical FOXO DNA-binding sites (Fig. 1A; Ref. 18Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that FOXO transcriptionally regulates the expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27kip1 (19Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). In support of this, expression of FOXO4 in HEK293T cells increased p27kip1 expression (Fig. 1B). Importantly, Nam inhibited the expression of the endogenous p27kip1 gene induced by FOXO4 (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of p27kip1 expression by Nam in these cells was not due to PKB activation, as Nam treatment under these conditions did not change phosphorylation of PKB on Ser-473, which is indicative of PKB activity. Also, in A14 cells stably expressing the luciferase gene driven by the p27kip1 promoter (A14-p27luc), FOXO4-induced luciferase expression was reduced by Nam (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the Sir2-inhibitor Nam inhibits FOXO4 transcriptional activity, possibly via hSir2SIRT1. Next we investigated whether Nam also affects the biological activity of FOXO transcription factors. Previously, we have employed DL23 cells, DLD-1 human colon carcinoma cells expressing an inducible conditionally active version of FOXO3a and lacking functional p53, and demonstrated in these cells transcriptional regulation of p27kip1 expression and induction ofaG1 cell-cycle arrest by FOXO (10Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Treatment of DL23 cells with 4-OHT induced p27kip1 expression (Fig. 1C, left panel). This induction was reduced by treatment of these cells with Nam (Fig. 1C, left panel). Furthermore, FOXO3a activation imposed a cell-cycle arrest, which was partially relieved by treatment with Nam, in keeping with its effect on p27kip1 expression (Fig. 1C, right panel). In addition to imposing a cell-cycle arrest, FOXO activation increases cellular resistance against oxidative stress by transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) (10Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Activation of FOXO in DL23 cells by 4-OHT treatment increased MnSOD expression, and, similar to FOXO-induced p27kip1 expression, MnSOD levels were reduced in cells treated with Nam (Fig. 1C, left panel). In keeping with MnSOD mediating FOXO-induced cellular resistance against oxidative stress, H2O2-induced oxidative stress was reduced in cells treated with 4-OHT, whereas Nam treatment inhibited the effect of FOXO3a (Fig. 1D, upper and lower left panels). In addition, A14 cells expressing active FOXO3a after retroviral transduction displayed increased resistance against H2O2-induced oxidative stress, and this was also reversed by Nam treatment (Fig. 1D, lower right panel). These results show that inhibition of Sir2 function by Nam treatment inhibits FOXO-induced gene expression of p27kip1 and MnSOD and, consequently, FOXO-induced cell-cycle arrest and resistance against oxidative stress. hSir2SIRT1 Stimulates FOXO Transcriptional Activity—Next we determined whether the deacetylase inhibitor Nam indeed exerts its inhibitory effect on FOXO-mediated transcription through hSir2SIRT1. We first tested the effect of hSir2SIRT1 expression on FOXO4 activity. To this end, hSir2SIRT1 and FOXO4 were transfected into HEK293T cells, and the expression of endogenous p27kip1 and MnSOD was determined. Both genes were up-regulated by hSir2SIRT1 in a FOXO-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Also, in A14-p27luc cells, FOXO4-induced luciferase expression was stimulated by co-expression of hSir2SIRT1 (data not shown). To further demonstrate involvement of hSir2SIRT1 in regulating FOXO4 transcriptional activity, we used siRNA to hSir2SIRT1, which resulted in reduced levels of endogenous hSir2SIRT1 (Fig. 2B). In keeping with the inhibitory effect of Nam on FOXO activity, knock-down of hSir2SIRT1 impaired FOXO4-induced p27kip1 expression. Expression of MnSOD, another transcriptional target of FOXOs (10Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), was also reduced by siRNA to hSir2SIRT1. As regulation of p27kip1 is important in mediating a FOXO-induced cell-cycle arrest, we also analyzed the effect of hSir2SIRT1 on FOXO-induced cell-cycle arrest. In keeping with the effect of Nam (see Fig. 1C), hSir2SIRT1 increased the percentage of cells arrested in G1 (Fig. 2C). Thus, these data indicate that hSir2SIRT1 enhances the transcriptional activity of FOXO and thereby modulates its biological activity. CBP Acetylates FOXO and Inhibits FOXO Transcriptional Activity—As Sir2 deacetylases are generally thought to act as repressors of transcription via deacetylating histones (26Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) we hypothesized that hSir2SIRT1 directly deacetylates FOXO transcription factors. Acetylation of proteins is mediated by acetyltransferases such as the related proteins p300 and CBP; binding between p300/CBP and FOXO as well as FOXO acetylation have been reported (27So C.W. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6542-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Nasrin N. Ogg S. Cahill C.M. Biggs W. Nui S. Dore J. Calvo D. Shi Y. Ruvkun G. Alexander-Bridges M.C.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To confirm these findings, HA-CBP and FLAG-FOXO4 were co-expressed in HEK293T cells. Indeed FLAG-FOXO4 was found to bind to HA-CBP (Fig. 3A). More importantly, binding of CBP to FOXO4 induced acetylation of FOXO4 (Fig. 3B). Also, co-expression of CBP and FOXO3a resulted in acetylation of FOXO3a (data not shown), suggesting that CBP is able to mediate acetylation of other FOXO transcription factors. Similarly, co-expression of p300 and FOXO4 induced acetylation of FOXO4 (data not shown), indicating that CBP and p300 are functionally equivalent in FOXO4 acetylation. Because inhibiting hSir2SIRT1 activity by either Nam or siRNA-mediated knockdown of hSir2SIRT1 inhibited transcriptional activity of FOXO, we next determined the effect of CBP-mediated acetylation of FOXO4 on its transcriptional activity. In A14-p27luc cells expressing wt-CBP, FOXO4 activity was considerably impaired as compared with control cells expressing FOXO4 only (Fig. 3D). This repression was due to the acetyltransferase activity of CBP as co-expression of the CBP-mutant F1541A, which possesses reduced but not absent acetyltransferase activity (Fig. 3C; Ref. 30Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), impaired FOXO4 transcriptional activity to a smaller extent. We also analyzed the effect of CBP expression on the endogenous FOXO target gene p27kip1. Consistent with the reporter assays, wt-CBP inhibited the induction of p27kip1 expression by FOXO4, whereas the F1541A mutant displayed a smaller effect because of residual activity (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data indicate that CBP inhibits FOXO4 transcriptional activity by acetylation, in agreement with the observed inhibition of transcriptional activity of FOXO4 by the deacetylase inhibitor Nam. hSir2SIRT1 Deacetylates FOXO4 —As CBP and p300 can acetylate FOXO transcription factors, we tested whether hSir2SIRT1 could deacetylate FOXO4 in vitro. To this end, bacterially expressed FOXO4-DNA-binding domain (GST-FOXO4-DB) was in vitro acetylated by a GST-tagged p300 acetyltransferase domain in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA (21Vries R.G. Prudenziati M. Zwartjes C. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Zantema A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6095-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the reactions were incubated with GST-tagged hSir2SIRT1 in the absence or presence of the essential cofactor NAD+ (24Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). GST-hSir2SIRT1 completely deacetylated GST-FOXO4-DB in an NAD-dependent manner (Fig. 3F). The incomplete inhibition of deacetylase activity by omitting NAD+ was possibly due to traces of NAD+ in the GST-hSir2SIRT1 purification. Next, we tested deacetylation by hSir2SIRT1 in vivo. In HEK293T cells, a clear deacetylation of CBP-acetylated FOXO4 was observed upon cotransfection with hSir2SIRT1 (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these results show that hSir2SIRT1 can directly deacetylate FOXO4 both in vitro and in vivo and thereby stimulate FOXO transcriptional and biological activity. Hydrogen Peroxide Induces Acetylation of FOXO and Inhibits FOXO Activity—To investigate whether extracellular signaling could regulate acetylation/deacetylation of FOXO4, we tested the effects of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1, a known regulator of FOXO function, and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is known to promote acetylation of proteins like p53 and histones (31Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 32Rahman I. Gilmour P.S. Jimenez L.A. MacNee W. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and FOXO transcription factors have been shown to be important in regulating stress responses (10Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). First, we investigated whether hydrogen peroxide could affect binding of CBP to FOXO4. Therefore, HA-CBP was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells co-expressing myc-FOXO4. Increasing amounts of hydrogen peroxide enhanced the interaction between HA-CBP and myc-FOXO4 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that peroxide stress may induce acetylation of FOXO4 by CBP. Furthermore, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB signaling by treating cells with insulin and epidermal growth factor decreased basal binding between HA-CBP and myc-FOXO4. As CBP is localized exclusively within the nucleus, the decreased binding observed is likely due to the fact that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB signaling induces relocalization of myc-FOXO4 to the cytosol. Importantly, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB signaling could not prevent the increase of HA-CBP/myc-FOXO4 complex formation induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment, indicating that the effect of peroxide is dominant over growth factor stimulation in this respect. Next, we determined whether endogenous FOXO and CBP could interact. We detected endogenous interaction between CBP and both FOXO4 and FOXO3a. Similar to the transient expression studies, H2O2 treatment increased the interaction between FOXO and CBP, although the magnitude differed (Fig. 4B). Finally, we tested whether enhanced binding of CBP to FOXO4 after treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide resulted in increased acetylation of FOXO4. Thus, HEK293T cells transfected with a myc-FOXO4 construct were treated with different concentrations of peroxide and followed up for several periods of time. FOXO4 was immunoprecipitated and acetylation was determined by Western blotting. Hydrogen peroxide treatment indeed induced acetylation of FOXO4 (Fig. 4C). Also, treatment of cells cotransfected with FLAG-FOXO4 and HA-CBP with hydrogen peroxide resulted in increased acetylation in the fraction of FLAG-FOXO4 bound to HA-CBP (Fig. 4D). As noted, we detected acetylation by endogenous acetyltransferases only at later timepoints than would be suggested by the binding of CBP to FOXO4 (Fig. 4, A and B). As we used a pan-acetyllysine-antibody, we attribute this result to the low sensitivity of the antibody toward FOXO4, precluding detection of a low stoichiometry. This is further suggested by the observation that upon overexpression of CBP, we detected acetylation at shorter timepoints after peroxide treatment. Therefore, increased binding of FOXO4 to CBP after hydrogen peroxide treatment likely leads to increased acetylation. As hydrogen peroxide induces acetylation of FOXO4, we expected that peroxide would have the same effect as CBP or Nam on FOXO4 transcriptional activity. To study this, FOXO4 was transfected in HEK293T cells, and the expression of endogenous p27kip1 was determined upon treatment of these cells with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for twenty-four hours. Indeed, hydrogen peroxide inhibited p27kip1 expression (Fig. 4E). Inhibition of p27kip1 expression was not due to activation of PKB by hydrogen peroxide, as under these conditions we could not detect any changes in the Ser-473 phosphorylation of PKB. Taken together, these data indicate that hydrogen peroxide inhibits FOXO4 transcriptional activity through induction of FOXO4 acetylation. Hydrogen Peroxide Stimulates Binding of hSir2SIRT1 to FOXO—Finally, because acetylation of FOXO4 occurs in conjunction with binding of the acetyltransferase CBP, we also investigated whether deacetylation by hSir2SIRT1 involves direct binding. Therefore, we expressed myc-hSir2SIRT1, HA-FOXO4, and treated cells with Nam or hydrogen peroxide for one hour to induce acetylation of HA-FOXO4. Complex formation between hSir2SIRT1 and FOXO4 could only be detected after peroxide treatment (Fig. 4F), suggesting that hSir2SIRT1 binds to acetylated FOXO4. On the contrary, Nam was not able to stabilize the interaction of hSir2SIRT1 with FOXO4, indicating that the effect of Nam on FOXO transcriptional activity can not be accounted for by mere binding of hSirSIRT1 to FOXO. We also tested whether FOXO and hSir2SIRT1 interacted endogenously. Antibody quality precluded the detection of a clear interaction between FOXO4 and hSir2SIRT1, but in HEK293T cells, an interaction between endogenous FOXO3a and hSir2SIRT1 was detected, and this interaction was weakly induced by peroxide treatment (Fig. 4G). Taken together, these data show that hSir2SIRT1 directly binds to FOXO, which is induced by peroxide stress. Our results suggest a model in which FOXO transcription factors are subject to regulation by reversible acetylation. Acetylation of FOXOs results in inhibition of their transcriptional and biological activities, which is reversed by the longevity protein hSir2SIRT1. Inhibition through acetylation of FOXO transcription factors is functionally equivalent to the previously described inhibition by PKB-mediated phosphorylation. We show that the acetyltransferase CBP binds to and acetylates FOXO4, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Previous reports on CBP/p300 binding to FOXO (27So C.W. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6542-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Nasrin N. Ogg S. Cahill C.M. Biggs W. Nui S. Dore J. Calvo D. Shi Y. Ruvkun G. Alexander-Bridges M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) suggested that CBP/p300 binding is required for activation of FOXO-dependent transcription. However, there are several important differences between these and our studies that may explain this apparent discrepancy. First, Nasrin et al. (28Nasrin N. Ogg S. Cahill C.M. Biggs W. Nui S. Dore J. Calvo D. Shi Y. Ruvkun G. Alexander-Bridges M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) inferred a role for CBP/p300 in the activation of FOXO because they observed that the viral protein E1A, which can inhibit CBP co-activator function, also inhibits FOXO transcriptional activity on an insulin-like growth factor BP1 promoter. However, E1A is known to have a plethora of targets within the transcriptional machinery and thus, by itself, a block by E1A is not sufficient proof of the involvement of CBP/p300 (for a review, see Ref. 33Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, whereas we have also analyzed the effect of CBP on the regulation of endogenous gene transcription, other studies have relied on transient reporter assays in which a proper chromatin context is likely to be lacking. Third, the role of CBP/p300 can be promoter-context-dependent, and accordingly, different FOXO-responsive genes may respond differently to the presence of CBP/p300. Differential responsiveness could relate to the fact that we have to discriminate between the effect of CBP/p300 as histone acetyltransferase and as acetyltransferase acting on FOXO itself. It could be possible that, with respect to different promoters, these activities of CBP/p300 may synergize or antagonize. Because CBP/p300-mediated histone acetylation is generally considered to contribute to transcriptional activation, and as we observe inhibition of FOXO transcriptional activity, we conclude that in the context of the promoters analyzed here, the direct acetylation of FOXO acts as an inhibitory signal. The binding of CBP to FOXO4 as well as the acetylation of FOXO4 is induced upon treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, hSir2SIRT1 can bind to acetylated FOXO4 and consequently deacetylate FOXO4. Thus, hSir2SIRT1 can counteract the inhibition of FOXO induced by acetylation. Recently, regulation of p53 acetylation by hSir2SIRT1 has been described (16Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A.

Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar), and this has been implicated in mediating cellular protection against genotoxic stresses. However, apoptosis induced by loss of hSir2SIRT1 is only partially rescued by dominant-negative p53 (16Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in cells lacking functional p53, resveratrol, a presumed activator of hSir2SIRT1, can still enhance protection against genotoxic stress (14Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3202) Google Scholar). These observations suggest alternative p53-independent pathways involved in cellular protection by hSir2SIRT1. Recently, we have shown that FOXO activation results in increased resistance against oxidative stress (10Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), and here we show that this is regulated by hSir2SIRT1. We like to propose that FOXOs play an important role in the hSir2SIRT1-mediated, p53-independent protection against stress. Therefore, by preventing negative regulation of FOXO due to acetylation after increased oxidative stress, hSir2SIRT1 can enhance cellular defenses against oxidative stress provided for by FOXO. This may be especially relevant under conditions of endogenous oxidative stress occurring during normal metabolic activities. Oxidative stress is considered to be a prime parameter of aging in all living organisms. Therefore, the results presented in this report provide a rationale for the observed increase in longevity induced by C. elegans Sir2, which is FOXO-dependent.

https://openalex.org/W1990840335,"Obesity is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases that are associated with impaired angiogenesis. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific adipocytokine with anti-atherogenic and anti-diabetic properties, and its plasma levels are reduced in association with obesity-linked diseases. Here, we investigated whether adiponectin regulates angiogenesis in response to tissue ischemia using adiponectin knock-out (KO) mice. Angiogenic repair of ischemic hind limbs was impaired in adiponectin-KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice as evaluated by laser Doppler flow method and capillary density analyses. Adenovirus-mediated supplement of adiponectin accelerated angiogenic repair in both adiponectin-KO and WT mice. Intramuscular injection of an adenovirus encoding dominant-negative AMP-activated kinase diminished the improvement in limb perfusion seen in WT mice and abolished the adiponectin-induced enhancement of perfusion. These data indicate that adiponectin can function to stimulate angiogenesis in response to ischemic stress by promoting AMP-activated kinase signaling. Therefore, adiponectin may be useful in the treatment for obesity-related vascular deficiency diseases."

Recent data lend support to aspects of the “crowbar” model of Hsp104/ClpB action. Hsp104/ClpB contains a coiled-coil or linker domain that is unique to this subfamily of Hsp100 proteins. Structural analysis of Thermus thermophilus ClpB reveals that this domain forms a two-bladed propeller ringing the exterior of the assembled hexamer (15Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Mutants of TtClpB in which motion of the coiled-coil domain was restricted by the introduction of disulfide bridges could not facilitate protein refolding, although they had normal ATPase activity and assembly properties. Deletion of this domain also compromises Escherichia coli ClpB refolding activity in vivo and in vitro (16Mogk A. Schlieker C. Strub C. Rist W. Weibezahn J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17615-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, although potential action of the coiled-coil as a crowbar, unique to Hsp104/ClpB, is appealing, direct interaction of this domain with substrate has not been shown, and involvement of a threading/unfolding mechanism, analogous to that used by other Hsp100 proteins, is not ruled out. Based on the crystal structure of HslU (17Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta H. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy V.S. McKay D.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 18Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the aperture of the Hsp100 protein-conducting channel is thought to be modulated by the position of a flexible loop containing a Gly-Tyr-Val-Gly (GYVG) motif. This loop motif is a conserved feature of Hsp100s with a single AAA+ module (Class 2) and in the second AAA+ module of Hsp104/ClpB and other Hsp100s with two AAA+ modules (Class 1) (see Fig. 1A). The deployment of the GYVG loop within the channel is fine-tuned by the nucleotide-bound status of HslU (19Wang J. Song J.J. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Im Y.J. Rho S.H. Seong I.S. Lee C.S. Chung C.H. Eom S.H. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 177-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A mechanistic model for HslU protein remodeling was proposed whereby the unfolding of a substrate protein by the “I” domains, a structural element that projects toward the substrate entry side of the HslU hexamer, is synchronized with the constriction and dilation of the axial channel determined primarily by the position of the GYVG loop (19Wang J. Song J.J. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Im Y.J. Rho S.H. Seong I.S. Lee C.S. Chung C.H. Eom S.H. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 177-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). During cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis an extended polypeptide in the channel would be transiently arrested and released producing a net motion toward the exit side of the axial channel and into the entry pore of the HslV proteolytic complex. To determine if the axial channel plays a significant role in Hsp104-mediated disaggregation and refolding, we constructed novel Hsp104 mutants with conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions in the Tyr residue of the GYVG motif (Tyr-662). The non-conservative substitutions (Y662A and Y662K) abolish the ability of Hsp104 to refold aggregated protein in vitro and to provide thermotolerance in vivo, although assembly of the hexamer and basal ATPase activity were essentially unimpaired. In contrast, when Tyr-662 was replaced with other aromatic amino acids (Y662W and Y662F) Hsp104 was functional, providing levels of thermotolerance close to that of the wild type protein. Trp-662 then served as a unique fluorescent probe for nucleotide-driven conformational changes within the Hsp104 axial channel. Another substitution in the axial channel, Glu-645 to Lys, also specifically impaired Hsp104 function in refolding and thermotolerance and affected the fluorescence signal obtained from Trp-662. In total, these results strongly support the idea that the functions of Hsp100s in either disaggregation or protein degradation share a common mechanism involving the axial channel. Hsp104 Mutagenesis—To create the E645K mutation, two segments of DNA were amplified from a pBSKII+ cloning vector containing the SalI/SpeI segment of Hsp104b (20Schirmer E.C. Lindquist S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using a T7 promoter primer together with the primer E645K(A) and a T3 promoter primer together with E645K(B) (Table I). The PCR product from the (A) primer pair was digested with SalI and HindIII and from (B) with SpeI and HindIII and were ligated together into SalI/SpeI-digested pBSKII+. The assembled DNA segment was excised from the vector with SalI and SpeI. Y662X (where X = A, K, F, and W) mutants were made by amplifying the same plasmid with the indicated primers together with a T7 promoter primer. PCR products were digested with KpnI and SpeI for subcloning. The Y257A mutation was constructed by the QuikChange (Stratagene) method using the pBSKII+ cloning vector containing the EagI/SacI segment of Hsp104 and primers Y257A(A) and Y257A(B). Mutagenized plasmids were screened for the presence of a StyI site. The expected sequences of all HSP104 segments were confirmed by DNA sequencing and were subcloned into pLA28SX104b (pRS313 backbone (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); CEN/ARS, HIS3, Gal1–10 promoter) for expression in yeast.Table IPrimers used for site-directed mutagenesisMutationPrimersY662W5′-GTTGGGTACCACGGCAGGTTGGGTCGGGTACGATGAAGG-3′aBoldface represents codon 662.Y662F5′-GTTGGGTACCACGGCAGGTTTCGTCGGGTACGATGAAGG-3′aBoldface represents codon 662.Y662A5′-GTTGGGTACCACGGCAGGTGCGGTCGGGTACGATGAAGG-3′aBoldface represents codon 662.Y662K5′-GTTGGGTACCACGGCAGGTAAGGTCGGGTACGATGAAGG-3′aBoldface represents codon 662.E645K(A)5′-CCGCATACTTCTCGCTAAGCTTAGAACAATCGACCC-3′bBoldface represents codon 645.E645K(B)5′-GGGTCGATTGTTCTAAGCTTAGCGAGAAGTATGCGG-3′bBoldface represents codon 645.Y257A(A)5′-GCATTAACCGCAGGTGCCAAGGCCAAAGGTGGATTTCGAAG-3′cBoldface represents codon 257.Y257A(B)5′-CTTCGAAATCACCTTTGGCCTTGGCACCTGCGGTTAATGC-3′cBoldface represents codon 257.a Boldface represents codon 662.b Boldface represents codon 645.c Boldface represents codon 257. Open table in a new tab Protein Purification—DNA segments encoding full-length Hsp104s were subcloned into pPROEX-HT-b (Invitrogen) that adds an N-terminal 6-His tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Proteins were expressed in BL21Codon Plus cells (Stratagene). His-tagged Hsp104 was isolated by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). Pooled peak fractions were digested by TEV protease (Invitrogen) to remove the tag and the protein was re-applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The flow-through fraction was further purified by anion exchange chromatography. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed into buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and frozen at –80 °C. Recombinant human Hsp70 and yeast Ydj1 were purified as described previously (4Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Quantitative Thermotolerance Assays—YPH499Δ104 (MATa, ura3–52, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, hsp104::LEU2), transformed with low copy number vectors for the galactose-inducible expression of Hsp104, were grown to saturation in complete synthetic medium lacking histidine (CSM; Bio101), supplemented with 2% glucose, and diluted into the same medium supplemented with 2% galactose, 0.1% glucose for growth to mid-log phase (∼2 × 106 cells/ml). After a pre-treatment at 37 °C for 1 h, 1 ml of the culture was transferred to pre-warmed sterile glass tubes in a 50 °C water bath. Aliquots of cells were removed at various time points, and the appropriate dilutions were plated onto rich medium (YPD, consisting of 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose) and incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Survival was calculated as the number of colonies formed by 50 °C-treated cultures at each time point compared with those that had received only the pre-treatment. Western Blot Analysis of Hsp104 Expression—1 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Glass beads (0.5 mm; Biospec Products) were added, and the cells were broken on a mixer (Model 5432, Eppendorf) operating at 4 °C for 45 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. After separation by SDS-PAGE on 6–20% gels, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Hsp104 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) recorded on a Versadoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Equal loading of protein was ensured by Coomassie Blue staining of duplicate SDS-PAGE gels. Analytical Gel Filtration—Proteins were analyzed on a 1 × 30 cm Superose 6 column (AP Biotech) in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. The protein content of each 0.4-ml fraction was determined by a dye binding microassay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To determine the elution profile of unassembled Hsp104, a sample of the wild type protein was chromatographed in the same buffer with 200 rather than 20 mm NaCl. Refolding Assays—Firefly luciferase (FFL; Promega) was denatured in refolding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 10 mm DTT) containing 8 m urea for 30 min at 30 °C. The unfolded protein was rapidly dispersed into ice-cold refolding buffer, aliquoted into pre-cooled tubes, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen, aggregated FFL was thawed on ice immediately before use. Refolding reactions contained refolding buffer, 5 mm ATP, an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm phosphocreatine, 0.02 unit of phosphocreatine kinase, and 2.5 μm each of Hsp104, recombinant human Hsp70, and recombinant yeast Ydj1. After 90 min of refolding at 25 °C, duplicate 1-μl aliquots were dispersed into luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and light emission was recorded in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, EG&G Berthold). ATPase Assays—All reaction components were equilibrated at 25 °C for 4 min prior to the initiation of each reaction by the addition of 25 μl of ATP to 2 μg of protein in 25 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT. After 1 min reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of Malachite green followed after 1 min by 12.5 μl of 34% (w/v) citric acid. Absorbance at 620 nm was determined in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). All activities were determined through the linear range of ATP hydrolysis, and all measurements were corrected for phosphate present in reactions containing ATP alone. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Hsp104 fluorescence was analyzed as previously described (23Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2732-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All solutions were filtered (0.22 μm) or centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min) to remove particulate matter, and all titrations were carried out at 4 °C to limit ATP hydrolysis. Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 4 h prior to use. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 276 nm (ϵ = 31 900 m–1 cm–1). Emission was measured at 346 nm at 4 °C using a SPEX Fluorolog-3 (Jobin-Yvon), with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a 5-nm bandpass. Nucleotide was titrated into a 1.5 μm protein solution from a stock solution (20 mm for ATP, 2 mm for ADP). After each addition the mixture was equilibrated with stirring for 5 min before reading. Buffer-subtracted fluorescence was corrected for dilution by nucleotide addition and the inner filter effect. Data were fitted to a single-site Hill equation for cooperative binding using MacCurveFit. Each curve is the average of three independent titrations. Fluorescence Microscopy—For expression of Hsp104, mutant DNA segments were subcloned into a vector based on pLA28SX104b with an N-terminally fused GFP domain. Cells expressing GFP-Hsp104 fusion proteins were cultured as described for thermotolerance experiments. Mid-log phase cultures were shifted from 25 °C to 37 °C for 1 h. Live unfixed cells were examined before and after heat shock with a standard epifluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2, Zeiss) equipped with a 100×, 1.4-numerical objective. Images were recorded with a charge-coupled device camera (Spot Jr., Diagnostic Instruments). Role of Conserved Tyrosine Residues in Diaphragm 1 and 2 in Hsp104 Function in Vivo—Members of the Hsp100 family have either two (Class 1) or a single (Class 2) AAA+ module each of which contains a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and an α-helical small domain. Fig. 1A compares the sequences of NBD1 and NBD2 of Class 1 Hsp100s, S. cerevisiae Hsp104, T. thermophilus ClpB, and E. coli ClpA, as well as the single NBD of Class 2 Hsp100s E. coli ClpX and Helicobacter pylori HslU. In Class 1 Hsp100s, the GYVG loop or Diaphragm 2 (using the nomenclature established for ClpA (24Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)) is located in NBD2. In the sequence of Hsp104 the GYVG Tyr is amino acid residue 662. An analogous region, Diaphragm 1 is located in NBD1 of Class 1 Hsp100s. Notably Diaphragm 1 also contains a conserved Tyr residue (Tyr-257 in Hsp104) that we speculated might have a function analogous to the GYVG Tyr in NBD2. To probe the importance of both Diaphragm 1 and Diaphragm 2 in Hsp104 function we replaced Tyr-257 and Tyr-662 with Ala. Each residue was important for Hsp104 biological function, because neither Hsp104Y257A nor Hsp104Y662A provided wild type levels of thermotolerance (Fig. 1B), although Western blot analysis of cell extracts indicated that Hsp104Y257A and Hsp104Y662A were expressed at the same level as the wild type protein (Fig. 1C). However, the degree of impairment was significantly different. Survival of Hsp104Y662A-expressing cells, in which the replacement modifies the GYVG motif in NBD2, was no better than cells lacking Hsp104 altogether. In contrast, the survival of Hsp104Y257A was reduced only about 10-fold relative to cells expressing the wild-type protein. We therefore focused further analyses on the GYVG motif and axial channel of NBD2. To characterize the functional consequences of further amino acid substitutions at Tyr-662, we replaced Tyr with other aromatic amino acids (Y662W and Y662F) and an additional nonconservative substitution (Y662K). We also constructed an Hsp104 variant (Hsp104E645K) analogous to an AtHsp101 encoded by the hot1-1 allele that profoundly impairs the acquisition of thermotolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana (25Hong S.W. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4392-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Based on the structure of TtClpB (15Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), Glu-645 in Hsp104 is likely situated in the axial channel in the same region as Diaphragm 2. Neither Hsp104E645K nor Hsp104Y662K complemented the thermotolerance defect of YPH449Δ104 cells (Fig. 2A). Survival of cells expressing Hsp104Y662F or Hsp104Y662W was slightly reduced compared with cells expressing Hsp104WT. Western blot analysis indicated that all proteins were expressed at levels comparable to Hsp104WT (Fig. 2B). Diaphragm 2 Mutants Are Specifically Defective in Facilitating Protein Refolding—To correlate the thermotolerance functions with the measurable biochemical characteristics of Hsp104, purified proteins were tested in refolding reactions alone or supplemented with Hsp70/40 chaperones using denatured, aggregated FFL as the refolding substrate. Refolding by Hsp104Y662F and Hsp104Y622W was comparable to that of Hsp104WT, whereas the refolding activities of Hsp104Y662A and Hsp104Y662K were undetectable (Fig. 2C). The refolding activity of Hsp104E645K was severely impaired but not completely eliminated. Thus, the ability of each derivative of Hsp104 to refold aggregated protein in vitro correlated well with its ability to confer thermotolerance in vivo. Many amino acid substitutions in the second AAA+ module of Hsp104 impair the assembly of Hsp104 (26Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because intersubunit contacts between AAA+ modules are critical for the constitution of fully functional ATP binding sites, impaired assembly simultaneously impairs ATPase activity of Hsp104. Two lines of evidence indicated that neither of these biochemical properties was significantly altered by the amino acid substitutions in the axial channel that impair thermotolerance or protein refolding. First, all Hsp104 mutants were assembled into hexamers indistinguishable from Hsp104WT when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2D). Second, although we detected slight differences in the kinetics of basal ATP hydrolysis among the Hsp104 derivatives (Table II), these differences were neither severe nor correlated with their ability to refold protein or to provide thermotolerance. Thus Hsp104E645K, Hsp104Y662A, and Hsp104Y662K represent a novel type of Hsp104 mutant that is specifically impaired in protein refolding. The data with respect to the properties of Hsp104Y662A are consistent with the observation that HslU, in which the GYVG Tyr (Tyr-91) is replaced with Gly, has normal ATPase activity and assembly properties but is specifically impaired in protein degradation (28Song H.K. Hartmann C. Ramachandran R. Bochtler M. Behrendt R. Moroder L. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14103-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In a more recent report, the analogous E. coli ClpX Y153A mutant was reported to be likewise specifically impaired in the degradation of proteins (29Siddiqui S.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Table IIKinetics of ATPase hydrolysis by Hsp104 and mutantsSubstitutionKmVmaxμmpmol/min·μgWT140 ± 60210 ± 20Y662W150 ± 60340 ± 30Y662F170 ± 20222 ± 6Y662A120 ± 20214 ± 18Y662K110 ± 10220 ± 5E645K160 ± 20210 ± 10 Open table in a new tab To ask whether amino acid substitutions in NBD2 that impair protein refolding might also impair the stable interaction of Hsp104 with its targets in living cells, we examined the localization of GFP-Hsp104 fusion proteins in unstressed and heat-shocked yeast (Fig. 3). At the level of light microscopy, we have recently shown that Hsp104 is diffusely distributed in unstressed cells but forms a small number of intense cytosolic foci in mildly heat-shocked cells. 2J. M. Tkach and J. R. Glover, submitted for publication. This observation is consistent with previous immunoelectron microscopy showing that Hsp104 accumulates at the periphery of electron-dense aggregates in heat-shocked cells but remains diffuse in the absence of aggregates (30Fujita K. Kawai R. Iwahashi H. Komatsu Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that derivatives of Hsp104 that do not oligomerize remain diffuse in heat-shocked cells suggesting that hexamer formation is at least one determinant of a stable interaction between Hsp104 and its thermally aggregated targets in cells. 2J. M. Tkach and J. R. Glover, submitted for publication. Therefore, Hsp104-GFP fusion proteins can be used to test for association of Hsp104 with cellular substrates. For all of the axial channel mutants, the Hsp104-GFP fusion proteins displayed the same pattern of subcellular distribution as the wild type fusion protein. Thus, these results suggest that disabling mutations in the NBD2 axial channel impairs the processing of Hsp104 targets for disaggregation and refolding but is not required for substrate recognition and initial binding. Tryptophan Fluorescence Reveals Nucleotide-dependent Diaphragm Movement—Because Hsp104 contains no naturally occurring Trp residues and Hsp104Y662W functions well in thermotolerance and protein refolding, we used Y662W as a fluorescent probe to monitor local changes in the environment of the GYVG loop in response to nucleotide binding. Given the similarity between biochemical and biological properties of Hsp104E645K and Hsp104 with disabling substitutions in the GYVG Tyr residue, we further speculated that impairment of protein refolding in Hsp104E645K might be associated with perturbations in the structure or dynamics of functional elements in the Hsp104 axial channel. We therefore constructed a doubly substituted Hsp104E645K/Y662W to test this possibility. To distinguish nucleotide-induced conformational changes associated specifically with the axial channel from other, more global effects of nucleotide binding on Hsp104 structure, we used as a control a previously characterized mutant, Hsp104Y819W in which the unique Trp is situated in small domain of AAA+ module 2 (SD2) of Hsp104 on the exterior of the hexamer and whose fluorescence is influenced solely by nucleotide binding at NBD2 (23Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2732-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As previously observed (23Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2732-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), nucleotide binding enhanced the fluorescence of Hsp104Y819W (Fig. 4A). Dissociation constants (Kd) derived from ADP and ATP titration curves corroborated the finding (23Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2732-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that the affinity for ADP binding by NBD2 was"
https://openalex.org/W2092303082,"The γ-aminobutyric acid, type B (GABAB) receptor is well recognized as being composed of two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2. Both subunits share structural homology with other class-III G-protein-coupled receptors. They are composed of two main domains: a heptahelical domain (HD) typical of all G-protein-coupled receptors and a large extracellular domain (ECD). Although GABAB1 binds GABA, GABAB2 is required for GABAB1 to reach the cell surface. However, it is still not demonstrated whether the association of these two subunits is always required for function in the brain.

Today only ligands interacting with GABAB1 ECD have been identified. Thus, the compounds acting exclusively on the GABAB2 subunit will be helpful in analyzing the specific role of this subunit in the brain. Here, we explored the mechanism of action of CGP7930, a compound described as a positive allosteric regulator of the GABAB receptor. We showed that it activates the wild type GABAB receptor but with a low efficacy. The GABAB2 HD is necessary for this effect, although one cannot exclude that CGP7930 could also bind to GABAB1. Of interest, CGP7930 could activate GABAB2 expressed alone and is the first described agonistof GABAB2. Finally, we show that CGP7930 retains its agonist activity on a GABAB2 subunit deleted of its ECD. This demonstrates that the HD of GABAB2 behaves similar to a rhodopsin-like receptor, because it can reach the cell surface alone, can couple to G-protein, and be activated by agonists.

This receptor is involved in numerous physiological processes via the regulation of both GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses at either the pre- or post-synaptic level (1Billinton A. Ige A.O. Bolam J.P. White J.H. Marshall F.H. Emson P.C. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 277-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Accordingly, GABAB receptors are involved in various types of epilepsy, nociception and drug addiction, and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (2Couve A. Moss S.J. Pangalos M.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 296-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although it has been described pharmacologically for 20 years, only in 1998 was the first GABAB receptor (GABAB1) cloned (3Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). It belonged to the class-III of the GPCR superfamily together with the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu), the calcium-sensing, and some pheromone and taste receptors (4Pin J.-P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In addition to the typical GPCR heptahelical domain (HD), GABAB1 possesses a large extracellular domain (ECD), similar to most other class-III GPCRs (4Pin J.-P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In contrast to the rhodopsin-like receptors (class-I GPCRs), the ligand binding site of class-III GPCRs is located within their large ECD in the so-called Venus flytrap module. Indeed, agonists bind within a cleft that separates the two lobes of the Venus flytrap module and stabilize a closed active conformation. This has been illustrated recently by the crystal structures of the mGlu1 ECD that have been solved both in the absence and presence of agonist (5Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M.

GABAB receptor then was the first described obligatory heterodimeric receptor. Several studies unraveled some specific roles dedicated to each subunit. First, GABAB2 takes GABAB1 to the cell surface, probably by masking a retention signal located in the GABAB1 C-terminal tail (14Calver A.R. Robbins M.J. Cosio C. Rice S.Q. Babbs A.J. Hirst W.D.

Second, GABAB1 Venus flytrap module, but not that of GABAB2, binds all of the known GABAB agonists and antagonists, whereas GABAB2 HD is critical for G-protein activation (17Margeta-Mitrovic M.

Although the co-expression of both GABAB1 and GABAB2 appears to be required for an efficient activation of G-proteins, some studies (9Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P.

In support of a functional role of GABAB2 in the absence of GABAB1, homodimeric GABAB2 receptors have been observed at the surface of heterologous cells (24Maurel D. Kniazeff J. Mathis G. Trinquet E. Pin J.-P. Ansanay H. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and homodimeric GABAB2 HDs are capable of activating G-proteins (20Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J.

Moreover, localization studies revealed that some neurons in the brain express much more mRNA of one subunit than that of the other, consistent with a possible role of homomeric GABAB receptors (25Calver A.R.

Within the last few years, allosteric modulators of class-III GPCRs have been identified for calcium-sensing and mGlu receptors (29Pin J.-P. Acher F. Curr.

They also are highly selective for one receptor subtype in contrast to most of the ligand acting at the orthosteric site. Urwyler et al. (44Urwyler S. Mosbacher J. Lingenhoehl K. Heid J.

Their site of action was not identified, but according to what was known for the mGlu-specific positive allosteric modulators and to the fact that GABAB2 coupled to G-protein, we hypothesized that these compounds act in the GABAB2 HD (46Pin J.P. Parmentier M.L. Prezeau L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this work, we not only demonstrate that CGP7930 indeed modulates the GABAB receptor by directly acting in the GABAB2 HD but that it also activates the homomeric GABAB2 receptor, indicating that GABAB2 could be functional by itself. Moreover, CGP7930 also activates a truncated version of GABAB2 deleted of the ECD, demonstrating that this HD can behave as a rhodopsin-like receptor. These data bring much information on the mechanism of action of this GABAB-positive modulator and reveal that GABAB2-selective drugs can be identified. Such drugs will be useful to better dissect the specific role of GABAB1 and GABAB2 in the brain. Materials—Aldehyde CGP13501 was synthetized according to the FR2237870 patent and was reduced subsequently with sodium borohydride to afford CGP7930 (melting point 82–84 °C, the melting point described in the U. S. patent 4333868 was 86 °C). CGP54626 was purchased from Tocris (Fisher-Bioblock, Illkrich, France). Fetal bovine serum, culture medium, and other solutions used for cell culture were from Invitrogen. [3H]Myo-inositol (23.4 Ci/mol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All of the other reagents used were of molecular or analytical grade where appropriate. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmids encoding the wild type and chimeric GABAB1a and GABAB2 subunits epitope-tagged at their N-terminal ends (pRK-GABAB1a-HA, pRK-GABAB1a/2-HA, pRK-GABAB2/1-HA, and pRK-GABAB2-HA or –c-Myc) under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter were described previously (16Pagano A.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by electroporation as described elsewhere (47Franek M. Pagano A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Pin J.P. Blahos J. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 48Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Bockaert J. Acher F. Pin J.-P. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, 10 × 106 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA containing the coding sequence of the receptor subunits and the amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 10 μg with the empty plasmid pRK6. For determination of inositol phosphate accumulation, the cells also were transfected with the chimeric Gαqi9 G-protein, which allows the coupling of the recombinant heteromeric GABAB receptor to phospholipase C (47Franek M. Pagano A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Pin J.P. Blahos J. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Measurement of Inositol Phosphate Production—Determination of inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in transfected cells was performed in 96-wells plates (0.2 × 106 cells/well) after overnight labeling with [3H]myo-inositols (0.5 μCi/well) as already described (49Goudet C. Gaven F. Kniazeff J. Vol C. Liu J. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Acher F. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The stimulation was conducted for 30 min in a medium containing 10 mm LiCl and the indicated concentration of agonist or antagonist. The reaction was stopped with a 0.1 m formic acid solution. Supernatants were recovered, and IPs were purified by ion-exchange chromatography using DOWEX AG1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) in 96-well filter plates (reference number MAHVN4550, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Total radioactivity remaining in the membrane fractions was counted after the treatment of cells with a solution containing 10% Triton X-100 and 0.1 n NaOH. Radioactivity was quantified using Wallac 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter. Data were expressed as IP/membrane (i.e. the amount of total IPs produced over the amount of radioactivity remaining in the membranes multiplied by 100). Unless stated otherwise, all of the data are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The dose-response curves were fitted using the Kaleidagraph program and the equation y = [(ymax – ymin)/(1 + (x/EC50)nH)) + ymin, where the EC50 is the concentration of the compound necessary to obtain 50% of the maximal effect and nH is the Hill coefficient. Anti-HA ELISA for Quantification of Cell Surface Expression—24 h after transfection (10 × 106 cells, HA-tagged GABAB1 (2 μg) and c-Myc-tagged GABAB2 (2 μg) subunits), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then blocked with PBS + 5% fetal bovine serum. After a 30-min reaction with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-HA clone 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) at 0.5 μg/ml) in the same buffer, the goat anti-rat antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was applied for 30 min at 1 μg/ml. After intense washes with PBS, secondary antibody was detected and quantified instantaneously by chemiluminescence using Supersignal® ELISA femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and a Wallac Victor2 luminescence counter. [γ-35S]GTP Binding Measurements—Cells were transfected using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) under optimized conditions. The complex was formed using the total amount of 8 μg of plasmid DNA with 60 μl of Polyfect in 300 μl of serum-free antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 10 min and then added to cells at 40–60% confluence. According to the results of expression, the amount of DNA is 2 μg of GABAB1, 1 μg of GABAB2, 2 μ g of Gαo1c, and 3 μg of pRK6 for wild type receptor. 48 h after transfection, cells were scraped in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged twice. The pellet was solubilized in Tris (50 mm), MgCl2 (3 mm) buffer, pH 7.4, using a potter. The [γ-35S]GTP binding was performed in 96-well filtration plates (reference number MAFCN0B50, Millipore) equilibrated with Tris (50 mm), and MgCl2 (5 mm), pH 7.4. 5 μg of membrane preparation/wells were pre-incubated in 20 μl with antagonist (15 min) and afterward and/or with agonist (15 min). 60 μl of incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm GDP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 mm NaCl) and 20 μl of H2O/well were added, and then the plate was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. After vacuum filtration and plate filter drying, the radioactivity was measured using a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter. The dose-response curves were fitted using the Kaleidagraph program and the equation y = [(ymax – ymin)/(1 + (x/EC50)nH)) + ymin, where the EC50 is the concentration of the compound necessary to obtain 50% of the maximal effect and nH is the Hill coefficient. CGP7930 Is a Positive Allosteric Modulator of the GABAB Receptor—As previously described by Urwyler et al. (44Urwyler S. Mosbacher J. Lingenhoehl K. Heid J. Hofstetter K. Froestl W. Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), CGP7930 increased both the affinity and the maximal effect (∼40%) of GABA in stimulating [γ-35S]GTP binding on Gαo-proteins (Fig. 1) (44Urwyler S. Mosbacher J. Lingenhoehl K. Heid J. Hofstetter K. Froestl W. Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Dose-response curves indicate that the EC50 for GABA was increased 3- and 10-fold in the presence of 0.1 and 1 mm CGP7930, respectively (42.0 ± 11.0, 30.0 ± 7.5, and 4.7 ± 1.04 μm in the absence or the presence of 0.1 and 1 mm CGP7930, respectively). A small increase in the binding of [γ-35S]GTP binding also was observed in the absence of GABA, suggesting that CGP7930 also may be able to slightly activate the receptor. However, such an effect of CGP7930 could not be studied in details using this assay according to the high basal [γ-35S]GTP binding, and to the low signal to noise ratio of this assay (2–3-fold increase observed with a saturating GABA concentration). Therefore, the effect of CGP7930 was analyzed further using an IP production assay, which is supposed to give a higher signal to noise ratio. Indeed, the GABAB receptor can activate efficiently phospholipase C when co-expressed with the chimeric G-protein Gqi9 (47Franek M. Pagano A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Pin J.P. Blahos J. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As noticed previously, the IP assay is much more sensitive than the [γ-35S]GTP assay as indicated by the 100-fold lower EC50 value measured for GABA compare with the [γ-35S]GTP assay. This probably results from the large amplification of the signaling cascade between G-protein activation and IP formation. As observed with the [γ-35S]GTP assay, 100 μm CGP7930 increased GABA potency in stimulating IP formation 3-fold (EC50 = 0.32 ± 0.10 μm and 0.11 ± 0.02 μm in the absence and presence of 100 μm CGP7930, respectively) as well as the maximal effect (Figs. 2 and 3A). The EC50 for this effect of CGP7930 as determined by increasing concentrations of this compound in the presence of a fixed concentration of GABA was similar to that determined by Urwyler et al. (44Urwyler S. Mosbacher J. Lingenhoehl K. Heid J. Hofstetter K. Froestl W. Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) when using an IP-induced calcium signal assay (18.9 ± 7.7 and 10 ± 0.1 μm, respectively) (44Urwyler S. Mosbacher J. Lingenhoehl K. Heid J. Hofstetter K. Froestl W. Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, in this assay, CGP7930 also clearly stimulated IP production even in the absence of added GABA, further suggesting that the CGP7930 could be a GABAB partial agonist (Figs. 2 and 3).Fig. 3Effect of the CGP7930 (100 μm) and potentiation of the GABA (1 μm) induced stimulation of IP formation in absence (A) and in presence (B) of 1 μm of the GABAB receptor-specific competitive antagonist CGP54626. C, maximal effects on IP formation obtained with 1 mm GABA or 1 mm CGP7930. The presented data are from one representative experiment among three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CGP7930 Is a Partial Agonist of the GABAB Receptor—Additional experiments were performed to demonstrate that CGP7930 directly activates the GABAB receptor. First, CGP7930 alone did not induce IP formation in pRK6- and Gqi9-transfected control cells or in cells co-expressing mGlu5, demonstrating that IP production did not result from a direct action on either the transfected G-protein or phospholipase C (data not shown). Second, the observed stimulation of IP production by CGP7930 (Fig. 3A) is dose-dependent with an EC50 similar to that observed for the potentiating effect (32.5 ± 7.2 μm; Fig. 4). Because we could not exclude that the observed effect of CGP7930 was attributed to overexpression of the receptors, we decided to examine the effect of CGP7930 at different receptor expression levels. To achieve this goal, the effect of saturating concentrations of GABA or CGP7930 (1 mm) was measured in cells transfected with increasing amounts of GABAB1- and GABAB2-expressing plasmids (Fig. 5). The expression levels of heteromeric GABAB receptor were determined using ELISA performed on intact cells with an anti-HA antibody labeling the N-terminal HA-tagged GABAB1 subunit. As shown in Fig. 5, the maximal agonist activity of CGP7930 was always lower than the maximal GABA activity and, of course, the maximal activity induced by CGP7930 together with GABA, indicating that CGP7930 was only a partial agonist. The Heptahelical Domain of GB2 Is Required for the Action of CGP7930—"
https://openalex.org/W2136117114,"Negative regulation of mitogenic pathways is a fundamental process that remains poorly characterized. The angiotensin II AT2 receptor is a rare example of a 7-transmembrane domain receptor that negatively cross-talks with receptor tyrosine kinases to inhibit cell growth. In the present study, we report the molecular cloning of a novel protein, ATIP1 (AT2-interacting protein), which interacts with the C-terminal tail of the AT2 receptor, but not with those of other receptors such as angiotensin AT1, bradykinin BK2, and adrenergic β2 receptor. ATIP1 defines a family of at least four members that possess the same domain of interaction with the AT2 receptor, contain a large coiled-coil region, and are able to dimerize. Ectopic expression of ATIP1 in eukaryotic cells leads to inhibition of insulin, basic fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor-induced ERK2 activation and DNA synthesis, and attenuates insulin receptor autophosphorylation, in the same way as the AT2 receptor. The inhibitory effect of ATIP1 requires expression, but not ligand activation, of the AT2 receptor and is further increased in the presence of Ang II, indicating that ATIP1 cooperates with AT2 to transinactivate receptor tyrosine kinases. Our findings therefore identify ATIP1 as a novel early component of growth inhibitory signaling cascade. Negative regulation of mitogenic pathways is a fundamental process that remains poorly characterized. The angiotensin II AT2 receptor is a rare example of a 7-transmembrane domain receptor that negatively cross-talks with receptor tyrosine kinases to inhibit cell growth. In the present study, we report the molecular cloning of a novel protein, ATIP1 (AT2-interacting protein), which interacts with the C-terminal tail of the AT2 receptor, but not with those of other receptors such as angiotensin AT1, bradykinin BK2, and adrenergic β2 receptor.

This peptide binds to two main subtypes of receptors (AT1 and AT2) that both belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) but display opposite biological and physiological effects. The AT1 receptor mediates most of the known cardiovascular and central actions of Ang II. This subtype has mitogenic and trophic effects in many tissues and cell types and transduces multiple intracellular signaling cascades typically associated with GPCR activation. In contrast, AT2 behaves like a “natural antagonist” of the AT1 subtype on most physiological functions, and induces anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects in vitro and in vivo (for reviews, see Refs. 1Horiuchi M.

A growing body of evidence indicates that anti-growth effects of the AT2 receptor are associated with activation of tyrosine phosphatases and inhibition of protein kinases, which ultimately lead to inhibition of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK2). In many cell types, AT2 is functionally coupled to the Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (6Bedecs K. Elbaz N. Sutren M. Masson M. Susini C. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C.

In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from AT2-transgenic mice, EGF receptor trans-inactivation induced by AT2 stimulation was found to involve rapid activation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and its increased association with the EGF receptor (10Shibasaki Y.

In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, however, AT2-mediated trans-inactivation of the insulin receptor does not involve protein dephosphorylation by orthovanadate-sensitive tyrosine phosphatases nor coupling to pertussis toxin-sensitive regulatory heterotrimeric Gi/Go proteins (12Elbaz N. Bedecs K. Masson M. Sutren M. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that another yet undefined mechanism may link AT2 receptor stimulation to growth inhibition.A number of recent studies have revealed that GPCRs can mediate their intracellular effects through signaling pathways that are independent of G proteins (14Marinissen M. Gutkind J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 15Brady A. Limbird L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, many groups have identified novel intracellular proteins that directly interact with C-terminal tails of GPCRs and function as scaffolds to regulate receptor trafficking or signaling (16Hall R.

ATRAP is one such example of a novel protein that selectively interacts with the AT1 receptor C terminus and down-regulates its activity (18Daviet L. Lehtonen J. Tamura K. Griese D. Horiuchi M.

Regarding the AT2 receptor, recent studies have documented a direct interaction of its C-terminal tail with ErbB3, a member of the EGF receptor family (20Knowle D. Ahmed S. Pulakat L. Regul.

Saito T. Landon E.J. Watanabe O. Price Jr., E. Roberts R.L. Imboden H. Fitzgerald T.G. Gaffney F.A. Inagami T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6471-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have used the C-terminal part of the AT2 receptor as bait in a two-hybrid system to identify new interacting partners of the receptor. We describe here the molecular cloning and functional characterization of ATIP1, a novel coiled-coil domain containing protein that selectively interacts with the AT2 receptor and mediates inhibition of growth factor-induced ERK2 activation and cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid and cDNA Cloning—The 52 C-terminal residues of the human AT2 receptor were PCR amplified and subcloned into pGBT9 vector in-frame with the Gal4-DNA binding domain. Independent transformants (3 × 106) from a mouse fetal cDNA library containing inserts of 300 to 700 bp in VP16 vector (a kind gift of Dr. A. Vojtek) were screened by the two-hybrid system cloning method in the HF7 strain as described (23Vojtek A. Sm S.H. Cooper J. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) using the 52 C-terminal residues of the AT2 receptor as a bait. A 354-bp cDNA clone designated ATIP was repeatedly isolated from two independent screenings of the library. Specificity of the interaction was verified with pGBT9 vectors containing lamin or RAS (kind gifts of Dr. J. Camonis) as unrelated baits. cDNA fragments corresponding to the 65 C-terminal residues of the human bradykinin B2 receptor (kind gift of Dr. W. Müller-Esterl), the last 86 residues of the human β2-adrenergic receptor (kindly provided by Dr. R. Jockers), or the last 62 residues of the rat AT1 receptor (a kind gift of Dr. K. Bernstein) were PCR amplified and subcloned into pGBT9 to assay for selectivity of the interaction.For isolation of full-length murine mATIP1 cDNA, the 354-bp ATIP insert was used to screen a mouse fetal cDNA library (3.5 × 105 colonies) of large inserts constructed into the pcDNA1 expression vector (24Nahmias C. Cazaubon S. Briend-Sutren M. Lazard D. Villageois P. Strosberg A.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For isolation of the human hATIP1 homolog, the 3′ region (last 755 bp) of mATIP1 cDNA was used to screen 3 × 105 colonies of a human lung cDNA library in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). For isolation of full-length human hATIP2 cDNA, reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification was performed on poly(A+) from human myometrium with specific oligonucleotides: 5′-cgggatccgtatccagggctcatgttcacttg-3′ (sense) and 5′-ccgctcgagtgctgatatacctcttgtgcccac-3′ (antisense). The resulting cDNA fragment (1.37 kb) was subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and entirely sequenced.Cell Lines and Transfections—Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human AT2 receptor (CHO-hAT2 cells) have been described elsewhere (12Elbaz N. Bedecs K. Masson M. Sutren M. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These cells were stably transfected using Dosper liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) with the 354-bp ATIP-ID cDNA fragment subcloned into pcDNA3 (clones C11 and C12), or full-length mATIP1 cDNA in pcDNA3 (clones L11 and L14), or pcDNA3 vector alone (clones V11 and V13). Positive clones resistant to G418 (800 μg/ml) were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-ATIP polyclonal antibodies. AT2 receptor binding sites were analyzed by radioligand binding performed on whole cells (8 × 104 cells/well in 24-well dishes) using 0.25 nm [125I-Sar,Ile]Ang II (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of Ang II (1 μm) or CGP 42112 (1 μm), as described (25Akishita M. Ito M. Lehtonen J. Daviet L. Dzau V. Horiuchi M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All clones were used at passages 5 to 20. COS-hAT2 cells permanently expressing the human AT2 receptor have been previously described (26Lazard D. Briend-Sutren M. Villageois P. Mattei M. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Recept. Channels. 1994; 2: 271-280PubMed Google Scholar) and were used at passages 3 to 16. Adult rat VSMC were previously shown to express both AT1 and AT2 receptors (25Akishita M. Ito M. Lehtonen J. Daviet L. Dzau V. Horiuchi M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These cells were prepared as described (25Akishita M. Ito M. Lehtonen J. Daviet L. Dzau V. Horiuchi M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and used at passages 2 to 8.Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—The entire coding regions of mATIP1, hATIP1, and hATIP2 were fused in-frame with the Myc epitope, or the HA epitope inserted N-terminal into the pcDNA3 expression vector. For dimerization studies, COS-1 cells (1.6 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish) were transfected with 5 μg of appropriate tagged cDNA using 6 μl of FuGENE (Roche) as described by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell lysates (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.5) were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (10 μg) covalently coupled to agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Associated proteins were eluted in urea-SDS sample buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2,5% β-mercaptoethanol, 6 m urea, 20% glycerol, bromphenol blue solution) for 15 min at 60 °C and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Western blotting was carried out as described (6Bedecs K. Elbaz N. Sutren M. Masson M. Susini C. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) using anti-HA polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz). Membranes were stripped and reblotted with rabbit anti-ATIP polyclonal antibodies.For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, CHO-hAT2 cells stably transfected with either pcDNA3 or full-length mATIP1-Myc were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h and treated for 5 min at 37 °C with or without Ang II (100 nm). Cell lysates (500 μg proteins) were immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-AT2 antibody (sc-9040, Santa Cruz) overnight. Western blots were revealed with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with goat anti-AT2 antibodies (sc-7421, Santa Cruz) for internal control.For analyzing expression of endogenous ATIP proteins, whole lysates were prepared as described (27Di Liberto G. Dallot E. Eude-Le-Parco I. Cabrol D. Ferre F. Breuiller-Fouche M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C599-C607Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) from human tissues (kindly provided by Dr. Pascal Pineau, Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Dr. Michelle Breuiller-Fouche, Institut Cochin, Paris) and human cell lines. Proteins (20 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using rabbit anti-ATIP polyclonal antibodies (1:5000).Production of Rabbit Anti-ATIP Polyclonal Antibodies—The 354-bp ATIP-ID cDNA fragment was subcloned into the pRSETA vector (Invitrogen) and the resulting polypeptide: His6-ATIP fused to six histidine residues, was purified from bacterial lysates by passage through a nickel column as described by the manufacturer. Purified His6-ATIP (100 μg) was injected three times intradermally into rabbits at 2-week intervals for production of polyclonal antiserum. Anti-ATIP polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified by passage through glutathione-agarose beads coupled to the glutathione S-transferase-ATIP fusion protein (obtained by subcloning the 354-bp ATIP-ID insert into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) and purification of glutathione S-transferase-ATIP as described by the manufacturer). Specificity of anti-ATIP antibodies was verified by immunoblotting cell lysates from COS cells transfected with each ATIP cDNA. A single polypeptide migrating at the expected molecular weight (18,000, 55,000, 55,000, and 50,000 for ATIP-ID, mATIP1, hATIP1, and hATIP2, respectively) was detected in each case.Measurement of ERK2 Phosphorylation—Stably transfected CHO-hAT2 cells (clones L11, L14, V11, V13, C11, and C12) were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes and treated as described (12Elbaz N. Bedecs K. Masson M. Sutren M. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (Cell Signaling). Blots were reprobed with monoclonal anti-ERK2 antibodies (UBI) as an internal control, and further incubated with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, UBI). Alternatively, total cell lysates were submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted under conditions (6Bedecs K. Elbaz N. Sutren M. Masson M. Susini C. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) that allow to visualize the activated, slower migrating form of endogenous ERK2.Transient Expression and Phosphorylation of Tagged ERK2—For measurement of ERK2 phosphorylation in transient transfections, COS-wt or COS-hAT2 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes and transfected with mATIP1 cDNA or empty vector (1 μg) in 3 μl of FuGENE (Roche) as indicated by the manufacturer. To avoid high background because of stimulation of endogenous ERK2 in non-transfected cells, co-transfections were performed with 0.5 μg of a construct (“ERK2-Myc”) encoding ERK2 fused to six Myc epitopes (a kind gift of Dr. Sabine Traver, Paris). The resulting ERK2-Myc polypeptide migrates at higher molecular weight (60,000) and can thus be easily distinguished from endogenous ERK2 (42,0000) in Western blot. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18 h before appropriate treatment with EGF as indicated (12Elbaz N. Bedecs K. Masson M. Sutren M. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), then lysed in 60 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting (20 μl) with anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (Cell Signaling). Membranes were stripped and reblotted with anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz) to assess expression levels of ERK2-Myc in each lane.Measurement of Thymidine Incorporation—DNA synthesis was assayed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation as described (25Akishita M. Ito M. Lehtonen J. Daviet L. Dzau V. Horiuchi M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Stably transfected CHO-hAT2 cells (clones V11, V13, L11, and L14) were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes (60% density) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. On the following day, cells were set in serum-free medium for 24 h to induce quiescence. For VSMC, cells were seeded at a density of 7 × 104 cells/well in 24-well dishes and transfected with mATIP1 cDNA or empty vector (0.4 μg/well). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells (80–90% confluency) were cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium to induce quiescence. For measurement of DNA synthesis, quiescent cells were treated with the indicated growth factor for 40 h and pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for an additional 24 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated as described previously (25Akishita M. Ito M. Lehtonen J. Daviet L. Dzau V. Horiuchi M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to measure radioactivity of the cell lysate.RESULTSMolecular Cloning of ATIP1 from Mouse and Man—The yeast two-hybrid system cloning method was developed to identify novel interacting partners of the AT2 receptor. The last 52 amino acids of the human AT2 receptor were used as a bait to screen 3 × 106 clones of a mouse fetal cDNA library constructed in the pVP16 cloning vector (23Vojtek A. Sm S.H. Cooper J. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). One positive clone containing an insert of 354 bp was repeatedly isolated from two independent screenings of the library. This insert encoded an open reading frame of 118 amino acids that was designated ATIP-ID, for AT2 receptor-interacting protein-(interacting domain). As shown in Fig. 1A, ATIP-ID interacts with the C-terminal intracellular tail of the AT2 receptor but not with that of the AT1 receptor subtype, nor with C-terminal domains of other GPCR such as β2-adrenergic or bradykinin B2 receptors. The interaction between ATIP-ID and the AT2 C terminus was further confirmed by in vitro binding assays using purified domains of each protein (data not shown).The 354-bp fragment of ATIP-ID was used as a probe to screen a mouse fetal cDNA library constructed in the pcDNA1 expression vector. A full-length cDNA clone of 1803 nucleotides was isolated (GenBank™ accession number AF173380). This clone contains an open reading frame of 1323 bp translating into a 440-amino acid polypeptide that we have designated mouse ATIP1 (mATIP1) (Fig. 1B). Several in-frame stop codons were found upstream of the initiating methionine. The human homolog of mATIP1 was further isolated by screening a human adult lung cDNA library, using as a probe a 755-bp cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3′ end of the mATIP1 coding sequence. Full-length human ATIP1 (hATIP1) cDNA encompasses 1977 nucleotides (GenBank™ accession number AF293357) and encodes a 436-amino acid polypeptide that shares 86% amino acid sequence identity with mATIP1. While this manuscript was in revision, a nucleotide sequence (MTSG1) identical to hATIP1 was published in the data banks (GenBank™ accession number AF121259).Mouse and human ATIP1 proteins are mainly hydrophilic and contain no transmembrane domain. The major part of ATIP1 is composed of a large coiled-coil domain (residues 106 to 375 of mATIP1) including two leucine zippers (Fig. 1B). ATIP1 is also characterized by a high proportion of basic residues (16%) and a stretch of 30 C-terminal residues rich in proline, serine/threonine, and arginine (“PSR” region). A BLAST search for homologous proteins in the data banks indicated that ATIP1 is a novel protein that shares 25% amino acid sequence identity with myosins in the coiled-coil region.Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to investigate whether ATIP1 was also able to interact with the AT2 receptor in a cellular context. Full-length mATIP1 cDNA was fused to the Myc epitope and transfected into CHO cells expressing the AT2 receptor. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1C) revealed constitutive interaction between ATIP1 and AT2, which is not significantly modified upon treatment with Ang II.A Family of Homologous ATIP Proteins—We then analyzed the tissue distribution of ATIP1 mRNA. The 354-bp fragment of ATIP-ID was used as a probe to hybridize a Northern blot of mRNA from various human tissues (Fig. 2A). Expression of a 1.9-kb transcript likely corresponding to hATIP1 mRNA was detected in all tissues examined. Additional hybridizing transcripts were detected at 4.2 and 6.9 kb in spleen, prostate, ovary, small intestine, colon (Fig. 2A), as well as in heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and lung (data not shown), suggesting the existence of additional mRNAs homologous to ATIP1.Fig. 2A family of hATIP proteins.

Four major polypeptides of apparent molecular weights 30,000, 60,000, 120,000, and 180,000, respectively, were expressed at variable levels in different tissues. Further work will be required to unambiguously identify each of these polypeptides, and determine the relationship between the various mRNA transcripts and polypeptides detected with the ATIP-ID probe and specific antibodies, respectively.Nucleotide sequence comparisons with GenBank™ data bases allowed the identification of human cDNA sequences related to hATIP1 in uterus (accession number AL096842), brain (partial sequence, accession number AB033114), and fetal brain (accession number AK125188). All three sequences contained the 354-bp sequence of ATIP-ID and were therefore designated hATIP2 (uterus), hATIP3 (brain), and hATIP4 (fetal brain). Close examination of genomic sequences in the data bases revealed that all four hATIP mRNAs are derived from a single gene by alternative promoter utilization and exon/intron splicing. 2M. Di Benedetto, manuscript in preparation.Translated amino acid sequences of hATIP2, hATIP3, and hATIP4 comprise 415, 1270, and 517 residues, respectively, and are 100% identical to hATIP1 in their last 395 amino acids (Fig. 2B). It is of note that the C-terminal sequence shared by all four hATIP members includes the large coiled-coil domain and leucine zippers as well as the stretch of 118 amino acids (ATIP-ID) that interact with AT2. In the N terminus, hATIP proteins differ both in length and sequence, and exhibit specific motifs that suggest differential intracellular localizations and/or association with distinct cytosolic partners (Fig. 2B). hATIP2 thus exhibits a very short (20 amino acids) N-terminal region that contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and one polyproline-rich region (PPXXP) known to play an important role in protein-protein interactions with WW or Src homology 3 domains (28Macias M. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). hATIP3 has a long N-terminal region (874 residues) containing one nuclear localization signal and four polyproline-rich motifs (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal part of hATIP4 (122 amino acids) contains a stretch of 24 hy"

Replication origins in early frog embryos are located at apparently random sequences, are spaced at close (∼10-kb) intervals, and are activated in clusters that fire at different times throughout a very brief S phase. Using molecular combing of DNA from sperm nuclei replicating in Xenopus egg extracts, we show that the temporal order of origin firing can be modulated by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio and the checkpoint-abrogating agent caffeine in the absence of external challenge. Increasing the concentration of nuclei in the extract increases S phase length. Contrary to a previous interpretation, this does not result from a change in local origin spacing but from a spreading of the time over which distinct origin clusters fire and from a decrease in replication fork velocity. Caffeine addition or ATR inhibition with a specific neutralizing antibody increases origin firing early in S phase, suggesting that a checkpoint controls the time of origin firing during unperturbed S phase. Furthermore, fork progression is impaired when excess forks are assembled after caffeine treatment. We also show that caffeine allows more early origin firing with low levels of aphidicolin treatment but not higher levels. We propose that a caffeine-sensitive, ATR-dependent checkpoint adjusts the frequency of initiation to the supply of replication factors and optimizes fork density for safe and efficient chromosomal replication during normal S phase.

We propose that a caffeine-sensitive, ATR-dependent checkpoint adjusts the frequency of initiation to the supply of replication factors and optimizes fork density for safe and efficient chromosomal replication during normal S phase. A strict control of replication origin density and time of activation is required to ensure that no DNA stretch is left unreplicated at the end of S phase. Replication initiation is governed by a conserved pathway of protein interactions at DNA replication origins (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). During late mitosis and the G1 phase, prereplicative complexes are formed at sites defined by ORC, a six-subunit protein complex that directs the loading of other prereplicative complex components, including Cdc6, Cdt1, and the Mcm2-7 complex (2Romanowski P.

After the G1/S transition, the prereplicative complex is converted to a preinitiation complex. This process is triggered by at least two kinases, Cdc7/Dbf4 and the S-cyclin-dependent kinases, and involves the ordered binding of numerous factors that ultimately unwind origin DNA and recruit DNA polymerases (6Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 7Kubota Y. Takase Y. Komori Y. Hashimoto Y. Arata T. Kamimura Y. Araki H. Takisawa H. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In early Xenopus embryos, S phase is very brief (∼20 min), and replication initiates without sequence specificity and at close intervals (∼10 kb) (8Hyrien O. Méchali M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4511-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Site-specific initiation is only detected after the midblastula transition (MBT), 1The abbreviations used are: MBT, midblastula transition; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. when transcription resumes (9Hyrien O. Maric C. Méchali M. Science. 1995; 270: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Replicon size increases slightly at the MBT and more significantly at later stages (9Hyrien O. Maric C. Méchali M. Science. 1995; 270: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Maric C. Levacher B. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating these changes are unknown, but one clue is that the MBT occurs after a critical number of nuclei accumulate in the embryo (11Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). A completely random distribution of origins would generate some unacceptably large interorigin distances in the early Xenopus embryo (12Laskey R.A. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 89: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms that ensure complete chromosome replication, we and others have studied the distribution of initiation events on single DNA molecules of plasmid and sperm nuclei replicating in egg extracts (13Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Herrick J. Stanislawski P. Hyrien O. Bensimon A. J. Mol.

We found that replication initiates throughout S phase and at broadly distributed rather than strictly regular intervals, that interference between adjacent origins occurs, and that the frequency of initiation increases throughout S phase. We suggested that abundant potential origins may be defined by multiple Mcm complexes spread away from ORC rather than by ORC itself (13Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), so that a choice of which origins actually fire may occur during S phase to ensure an adequate distribution of initiation events (for a review, see Ref. 16Hyrien O. Marheineke K. Goldar A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed, Mcms bind DNA and initiate replication over a large region distant from ORC in egg extracts (18Edwards M.C. Tutter A.V. Cvetic C. Gilbert C.H. Prokhorova T.A. Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33049-33057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Harvey K.J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6769-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control origin firing timing are still unclear. In budding yeast, where specific origins fire at specific times, the temporal program is established during the G1 phase (20Raghuraman M.K. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Science. 1997; 276: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and three kinases, Cdk1-Clb5, Mec1, and Rad53, seem implicated in its execution during S phase. Cdk1-Clb6 only activates early origins, whereas Cdk1-Clb5 activates both early and late origins (21Donaldson A.D. Raghuraman M.K. Friedman K.L. Cross F.R. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A Mec1/Rad53-dependent checkpoint prevents the firing of late origins in the presence of stalled forks or DNA damage (22Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 23Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Mec1/Rad53 pathway may also regulate origin firing time during unperturbed cell growth (23Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 24Sharma K. Weinberger M. Huberman J.A. Genetics. 2001; 159: 35-45PubMed Google Scholar). In animal cells, a correlation between replication timing, gene expression, and chromatin structure has long been observed (25Goren A. Cedar H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26McNairn A.J. Gilbert D.M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The replication timing is established early in G1 phase when chromatin is repositioned in the nucleus after mitosis (27Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and an intra-S checkpoint controls the timely assembly and disassembly of replication factories under conditions of replicational stress (28Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In early Xenopus embryos, the lack of G1 phase, gene expression, and euchromatin/heterochromatin differentiation raises questions regarding the regulation and functional role of origin firing timing. We have previously shown by DNA combing that an intra S checkpoint regulates origin firing when sperm nuclei in egg extracts are challenged with aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor (15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17092-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We suggested that a checkpoint monitors the density of forks and regulates initiation to control the rate of DNA replication independently of the position of initiation events. Walter and Newport (29Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that when the concentration of sperm nuclei in egg extracts exceeds the concentration of cells in a Xenopus MBT embryo, the length of S phase increases, although the rate of replication fork movement appears unchanged. This might be due to an increase in replicon size, possibly by depletion of an initiation factor, or to staggered initiation at individual origins. The latter hypothesis was dismissed because the addition of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 after the start of S phase had little effect on subsequent replication (29Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it has since been clearly established that origins fire at different times through S phase in egg extracts (13Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Herrick J. Stanislawski P. Hyrien O. Bensimon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol.

In this paper, we use molecular combing of DNA from sperm nuclei replicating in Xenopus egg extracts to directly examine the effect of the nucleocytoplasmic ratio and caffeine on the pattern of origin firing. Caffeine is a potent small molecule inhibitor of the kinase activity of the Mec1 homologs ATM and ATR in vitro (30Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) and abrogates checkpoints in vivo (31Cortez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37139-37145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 32Kaufmann W.K. Heffernan T.P. Beaulieu L.M. Doherty S. Frank A.R. Zhou Y. Bryant M.F. Zhou T. Luche D.D. Noikolaishvilli-Feinberg N. Simpson D.A. Cordeiro-Stone M. Mutat Res. 2003; 532: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the longer S phase at high concentrations of nuclei is not due to a change in replicon size but to an expansion of the period of time over which origins fire and to a lower replication fork velocity. Treatment with caffeine increases origin firing but decreases fork velocity. Inhibition of ATR with a specific neutralizing antibody also increases origin firing. These results suggest that an intra-S checkpoint decreases origin firing in response to a limiting factor to ensure optimal fork progression. Replication of Sperm Nuclei in Xenopus Egg Extracts—Replication-competent extracts from unfertilized Xenopus eggs were prepared as described (33Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and used fresh. Sperm nuclei (100–6000 nuclei/μl) were incubated in extracts in the presence of cycloheximide (250 μg/ml), energy mix (7.5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.7, 1 mm MgCl2), 20 μm digoxigenin-dUTP (added at t = 0), and 20 μm biotin-dUTP (added at the indicated times) (Roche Applied Science). Replication was allowed to continue for 2 h. Aphidicolin block-and-release experiments were performed as described previously (15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17092-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Caffeine (or buffer alone as control) was added where indicated to a final concentration of 5 mm from a 100 mm solution freshly dissolved in 10 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 7.4. ATR-neutralizing antibodies (34Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were added where indicated. Molecular Combing and Detection by Fluorescent Antibodies—DNA was extracted and combed as described (14Herrick J. Stanislawski P. Hyrien O. Bensimon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17092-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Biotin was detected with Texas Red-conjugated antibodies (15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17092-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the digoxigenin label, a mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody was used followed by Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for enhancement. Measurements and Data Analysis—Images of the combed DNA molecules were acquired and measured as described (15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17092-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fields of view were chosen at random in the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel and then photographed under the fluorescein isothiocyanate and the Texas Red filter. The size of most photographed molecules was 120 kb. All photographed fibers showed a continuous digoxigenin label, indicating complete replication. Replication eyes, gaps, and forks were defined as described under “Results.” Tracts of biotin-negative DNA needed to be >2 kb to be considered significant and scored as eyes. The replication extent of each fiber (or group of fibers) was defined as the sum of eye lengths divided by the total length of the molecule(s). Fork density is the total number of forks divided by total DNA length (kb) in each sample. The overall mean eye length and gap length were determined by dividing the total replicated or unreplicated length, respectively, by half the number of forks in each sample. Similarly, the overall mean eye-to-eye distance was determined by dividing the total DNA length by half the number of forks. Note that this is just twice the inverse of fork density. These numbers are not affected by the finite size of the analyzed molecules. However, to analyze the distribution of eye lengths, gap lengths, and eye-to-eye distances, incomplete eyes or gaps located on either end of each fiber had to be excluded. This bias resulted in a difference between “local” measurements and “overall” means calculated as above. Therefore, the mean value of “excluded” eye lengths, gap lengths, and eye-to-eye distances were also calculated by dividing the total excluded length of replicated, unreplicated, or total DNA, respectively, by half the number of excluded forks. The average fork velocity (kb/min) between two successive time points was calculated as the difference in replication extent between the two time points divided by the average fork density (number of forks/kb of total DNA) and by the time interval (min). The average fork density is defined as the mean of the fork density at the two time points. Small errors can therefore result if the change in fork density between the two time points is not linear. We also caution that with eyes of <2 kb being excluded from analysis, velocities may be slightly overestimated, but this should not affect comparisons between different concentrations of nuclei at similar replication extents. Alkaline-agarose Gel Electrophoresis—Sperm nuclei were incubated in fresh extracts added with 5 mm caffeine or buffer alone as control and one-fiftieth volume of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol). DNA was purified, separated on 1.1% alkaline-agarose gels, and analyzed as described (15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17092-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Shorter S Phase at Low Nuclei Concentration Is Due to More Synchronous Origin Firing and Faster Fork Progression— When sperm nuclei are incubated in Xenopus egg extracts, there is an initial lag period of ∼25 min during which replication origins are assembled on DNA and replication-competent nuclei are produced. After this lag, S phase starts abruptly. Most nuclei start to replicate within ∼5 min of each other. S phase is very brief (typically < 30 min), but its exact length depends on the concentration of nuclei. In order to visualize origin firing and fork progression at different nuclei concentrations, we used DNA combing, a powerful DNA spreading technique (35Michalet X. Ekong R. Fougerousse F. Rousseaux S. Schurra C. Hornigold N. van Slegtenhorst M. Wolfe J. Povey S. Beckmann J.S. Bensimon A. Science. 1997; 277: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) that has been adapted for single molecule analysis of DNA replication (14Herrick J. Stanislawski P. Hyrien O. Bensimon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17092-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sperm nuclei were incubated at 100 or 2000 nuclei/μl in egg extracts supplemented with digoxigenin-dUTP, so as to label all replicated DNA. Biotin-dUTP was added at different time points after the start of replication to differentially label early and late replicating sequences. After a 2-h incubation, the DNA was purified and combed on silanized coverslips, and the two labels were detected with fluorescent antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A). This double-labeling protocol allows us to ascertain the full replication of the fiber after 2 h and the fiber continuity between successive biotin-labeled tracts. Replication eyes are defined as regions replicated before the addition of biotin-dUTP and appear as tracts of digoxigenin-positive, biotin-negative DNA. Gaps are regions replicated after biotin-dUTP addition. Forks are the transition points between biotin-labeled and unlabeled segments. Eye-to-eye distances are measured between the midpoints of adjacent eyes. Combed DNA molecules are parallel, straight, and homogeneously stretched (1 μm = 2 kb) (Fig. 1A). About 50–80 randomly chosen DNA fibers (5–10 Mb) were analyzed for each time point. The replication extent (at the time of biotin-dUTP addition) of each group of fibers was defined as the sum of eye lengths divided by the total DNA length. The time required for >80% of the DNA to be replicated was shorter at 100 nuclei/μl (∼10 min) than at 2000 nuclei/μl (∼25 min) (Figs. 1D and 2A). This was also observed by measuring the time course of incorporation of α-32P]dATP into sperm DNA (not shown). The synchrony with which individual nuclei entered S phase was only 3–5 min tighter at 100 nuclei/μl than at 2000 nuclei/μl (as estimated by incorporation of rhodamine-dUTP into individual nuclei; not shown), which is insufficient to account for the 15-min difference in replication time. Therefore, S phase was about half as long at 100 nuclei/μl as at 2000 nuclei/μl. This may result from a faster progression of replication forks, a shorter interorigin distance, or a more synchronous firing of origins. It was shown using alkaline gel electrophoresis of nascent strands formed after release from Ara-C arrest that the rate of replication fork movement in Xenopus egg extracts is the same from 125 to 10,000 nuclei/μl (29Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, fork velocity might be perturbed by Ara-C treatment, which is now known to uncouple helicase from polymerase movement (6Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used DNA combing to monitor origin activation, measure interorigin distances, and estimate fork velocity at different stages of unperturbed S phase. Origin synchrony was assessed by determining the replication extent of each DNA fiber (sum of eye lengths divided by fiber length) and by plotting the lengths of individual eyes against the fiber's replication extent (Fig. 1, B and C). Each vertical alignment of dots in Fig. 1, B and C, thus represents the lengths of eyes of a single DNA fiber. A heterogeneous distribution of fiber replication extents and eye lengths was observed at all stages of S phase at 100 (Fig. 1B) and 2000 nuclei/μl (Fig. 1C). Small eyes, which indicate new initiation events, were visible at all time points and all replication extents. Thus, even at 100 nuclei/μl, replication origins fired continuously throughout S phase, as previously reported for plasmid DNA (13Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or sperm nuclei at 2000 nuclei/μl (15Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17092-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Not only did origins within a given fiber fire asynchronously, but different fibers also showed a wide distribution of replication extent at all stages of S phase. To assess whether adjacent origins fire more synchronously than pairs of origins taken at random, the correlation coefficient between the lengths of adjacent eyes was calculated (excluding eyes >8 kb to avoid mergers). A weak but significant correlation of 0.16 was previously reported for a concentration of 3000 nuclei/μl, suggesting that origins are activated in clusters that fire at different times within S phase (17Blow J.J. Gillespie P.J. Francis D. Jackson D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We found similar correlations at all time points for both concentrations of nuclei (0.16–0.22; p < 0.05). We then had a closer look at fibers from the 30-min time point (Fig. 2, A and B). Both samples corresponded to very early S phase (replication extent r = 6.4% at 100 nuclei/μl and 2.2% at 2000 nuclei/μl). The distributions of the number of eyes per fiber (Fig. 2, C and D, black bars) were non-Poissonian (p < 0.001), with an excess of fibers containing either no eye or multiple eyes (compare black and white bars). This confirms that at either concentration of nuclei, origins are not activated independently of each other but as clusters. Fibers with no replication eye were 2.5-fold less frequent at 100 than at 2000 nuclei/μl (Fig. 2, A–D). The higher replication extent at 100 nuclei/μl was not due to a longer eye length (mean of 3.4 versus 3.0 kb) but to a higher fork density (total number of forks divided by total DNA length in each sample; 1/26.7 versus 1/70.2 kb). Extrapolation of the replication versus time plots (Fig. 1B) to 0% replication suggests that S phase started at the same time (t ∼27 min), and fork velocity was similar (∼1.1 kb·min–1; see “Experimental Procedures”) at the two nuclei concentrations. However, 2.6-fold more origins had fired at 100 than at 2000 nuclei/μl at 30 min. This was also observed with nuclei synchronized by aphidicolin block-and-release (see below) and therefore cannot be explained by an asynchrony with which nuclei initiate replication when the concentration of nuclei increases. Although the overall eye-to-eye distance (total DNA length divided by half the number of forks) was smaller at 100 than at 2000 nuclei/μl (53.4 versus 140.4 kb), the local eye-to-eye distances directly measured on individual fibers at 30 min were not markedly different (mean of 20.6 versus 24.7 kb) (Fig. 2A). This apparent discrepancy arises from the cluster organization and the limit in fiber length set by DNA breaks and/or microscope field. Incomplete eyes or gaps (and associated eye-to-eye distances) located on either fiber end are excluded from the individual measurements, and large (intercluster) distances have a greater probability to be excluded, whereas all DNA and forks are taken into account to calculate fork density (or overall eye-to-eye distance, which is twice the inverse of fork density). Importantly, it is possible to calculate the number and mean length of those excluded distances, as explained under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2A). At 30 min, the excluded distances represented an important proportion (32 and 39%, respectively) of all eye-to-eye distances and were significantly shorter at 100 than at 2000 nuclei/μl (130 versus 319 kb). It is this class of distances (i.e. intercluster), not the local (intracluster) distances, that account for the large difference in fork density between the two samples. The analysis of gap lengths was entirely consistent with these conclusions (not further described, but see Fig. 2A). In summary, about 2 times more origin clusters (and 20–30% more origins per cluster) were activated at the start of S phase at 100 than at 2000 nuclei/μl. We next focused on the 37-min time points, which correspond to mid-S phase (r = 52.3% for 100 nuclei/μl and 30.0% for 2000 nuclei/μl). The overall (17.2 versus 18.6 kb), local (12.6 versus 14.2 kb; distributions shown on Fig. 2E), and excluded (42.3 versus 40.4 kb) eye-to-eye distances were now similar at both concentrations of nuclei. The higher replication extent at 100 nuclei/μl was entirely explained by a longer mean eye length (9.0 versus 5.6 kb). The 2.15-fold higher rate of eye growth was due to a higher rate of both fork progression and eye merger. Eyes of >25 kb were ∼10 times more frequent, and eyes of <5 kb were ∼25% less frequent at 100 nuclei/μl than at 2000 nuclei/μl, suggesting more mergers (not shown). Although fork velocity was only 1.3-fold higher at 100 nuclei/μl than at 2000 nuclei/μl (∼850 and ∼650 nt·min–1, respectively), replication from 30 to 37 min was 1.65-fold faster at 100 than at 2000 nuclei/μl (52.3–6.4 = 45.9% versus 30.0–2.2 = 27.8%). This implies that fork density increased faster at the beginning of S phase, although the same plateau was reached at 37 min (∼1 fork/9 kb). From 37 to 42 min, the fork density decreased from ∼1 fork/9 kb to ∼1 fork/14 kb at 100 nuclei/μl, consistent with mergers, but remained stable at ∼1 fork/9 kb at 2000 nuclei/μl (Fig. 2A). Despite the higher average fork density at 2000 than at 100 nuclei/μl, the replication extent increased 3.8-fold less (37.6–30.0 = 7.6% versus 81.3–52.3 = 29.0%). The replication extent at 42 min at 2000 nuclei/μl might have been underestimated, due to some bias in the fiber sample, because the plot in Fig. 1D shows an unexpected inflection at this point. Nevertheless, the fork velocity was ∼610 nt·min–1 at 100 nuclei/μl from 37 to 42 min, but only ∼420 nt·min–1 at 2000 nuclei/μl from 37 to 49 min. These data suggest that the rate of fork progression is more variable than hitherto appreciated (Fig. 2F). When replication reached >75–80%, replicon merge became predominant over new initiation.

https://openalex.org/W2087708640,"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) is a matrix-bound inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases. Mutations in the Timp-3 gene cause Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD), a hereditary macular degenerative disease. The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the disease phenotype are unknown. In an in vivo quest for binding partners of the TIMP-3 protein in the subretina, we identified epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1, also known as fibulin 3) as a strong interacting protein. The COOH-terminal end of TIMP-3 was involved in the interaction. Interestingly, a missense mutation in EFEMP1 is responsible for another hereditary macular degenerative disease, Malattia Leventinese (ML). Both SFD and ML have strong similarities to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of blindness in the elderly population of the Western hemisphere. Our results were supported by significant accumulation and expression overlap of both TIMP-3 and EFEMP1 between the retinal pigment epithelia and Bruch membrane in the eyes of ML and AMD patients. These results provide the first link between two different macular degenerative disease genes and imply the possibility of a common pathogenic mechanism behind different forms of macular degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2105324254,"TRPV5 and TRPV6 are members of the superfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and facilitate Ca2+ influx in a variety of epithelial cells. The activity of these Ca2+ channels is tightly controlled by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in close vicinity to the channel mouth. The molecular mechanism underlying the Ca2+-dependent activity of TRPV5/TRPV6 is, however, still unknown. Here, the putative role of calmodulin (CaM) as the Ca2+ sensor mediating the regulation of channel activity was investigated. Overexpression of Ca2+-insensitive CaM mutants (CaM1234 and CaM34) significantly reduced the Ca2+ as well as the Na+ current of TRPV6- but not that of TRPV5-expressing HEK293 cells. By combining pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitations, we demonstrated that CaM binds to both TRPV5 and TRPV6 in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. The binding of CaM to TRPV6 was localized to the transmembrane domain (TRPV6327–577) and consensus CaM-binding motifs located in the N (1–5-10 motif, TRPV688–97) and C termini (1–8-14 motif, TRPV6643–656), suggesting a mechanism of regulation involving multiple interaction sites. Subsequently, chimeric TRPV6/TRPV5 proteins, in which the N and/or C termini of TRPV6 were substituted by that of TRPV5, were co-expressed with CaM34 in HEK293 cells. Exchanging, the N and/or the C termini of TRPV6 by that of TRPV5 did not affect the CaM34-induced reduction of the Ca2+ and Na+ currents. These results suggest that CaM positively affects TRPV6 activity upon Ca2+ binding to EF-hands 3 and 4, located in the high Ca2+ affinity CaM C terminus, which involves the N and C termini and the transmembrane domain of TRPV6.

Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu N. Zhu M.X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 229-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The submembers TRPV5 (formerly named ECaC1) and TRPV6 (formerly named CaT1) are postulated as gatekeepers facilitating epithelial Ca2+ influx in kidney and small intestine (2Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 3Hoenderop J.G. van Leeuwen J.P. van der Eerden B.C. Kersten F.F. van der Kemp A.W. Merillat A.M.

An initial electrophysiological characterization of these channels revealed that TRPV5 and TRPV6 are homologous channels that display a Ca2+-dependent feedback regulation of channel activity. Differences between these channels concern their divalent cation permeability, the kinetics of Ca2+-dependent inactivation, and subsequent recovery (4Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that TRPV5 and TRPV6 form functional homo- and heterotetrameric channels displaying intermediate phenotypes (5Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). At present, the molecular mechanism underlying these differences in Ca2+-dependent activity is unknown. Ca2+-regulated channel activity is not restricted to TRPV5 and TRPV6 because a diverse range of voltage and non-voltage-dependent ion channels are regulated by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Ca2+-dependent regulation of the L-type and P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cav) is mediated by the ubiquitously expressed Ca2+-sensor calmodulin (CaM) (6Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 7DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). CaM consists of four Ca2+-binding EF-hand structures, which are localized in the N and C termini. Ca2+ binding to CaM is highly cooperative with Ca2+ binding, first to the C-terminal EF-hands, which have the highest affinity for Ca2+, followed by Ca2+ binding to lower affinity sites located in the N terminus (8Wang C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The CaM termini can differentially regulate ion channel activity, as shown by electrophysiological analysis of Ca2+-dependent regulation of P/Q- and L-type Cav channels (6Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 7DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to the high Ca2+-affinity C terminus of CaM selectively induces P/Q-type Cav channel facilitation, whereas Ca2+-sensing by the low Ca2+-affinity N terminus induces channel inactivation. Thus, CaM acts as a Ca2+-sensor translating the local Ca2+ signals that modulate these channels (7DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Consensus CaM binding motifs have been identified in associated proteins (9Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). CaM binding to Cav is localized to an IQ-like motif in the α1C (L-type Cav) and α1A C termini (P/Q-type Cav). Although TRPV5 and TRPV6 lack an IQ-related motif, a previous study (4Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) indicated that CaM binds to the TRPV6 C terminus in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The described mechanism of competitive regulation of TRPV6 by protein kinase C and CaM is, however, restricted to human TRPV6, because this protein kinase C site in the CaM-binding motif is not conserved between different species (10Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, the corresponding region in mouse TRPV6 was shown to bind CaM. Detailed analysis of this region predicted a casein kinase motif, but no significant phosphorylation could be detected in this particular domain (11Hirnet D. Olausson J. Fecher-Trost C. Bodding M. Nastainczyk W. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Also, other members of the TRP family are possibly regulated by CaM. CaM binding to TRPV1 was restricted to a 35 amino acid segment in the C terminus, and deletion of this CaM-binding segment prevented TRPV1 desensitization (12Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Takeuchi K. Murayama N. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8002-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Members of the TRPC family have been shown to bind CaM (13Tang J.

Another study using CaM inhibitors described that TRPC6 can be regulated by CaM (14Boulay G. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CaM acts as a Ca2+ sensor in the Ca2+-dependent feedback inhibition of TRPC1, as demonstrated using Ca2+-insensitive CaM mutants (15Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of CaM in Ca2+-dependent regulation of TRPV5 and TRPV6 activity. To this end, we combined pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitations with electrophysiological analysis of HEK293 cells heterologously expressing TRPV5, TRPV6, or TRPV5/6 chimeras in combination with Ca2+-insensitive CaM mutants. Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors—CaM, CaM1234, CaM12, and CaM34 were mutated (D → A) in the EF-hand structures present in the N and C termini, resulting in (partial) Ca2+-insensitive mutants (16Xia X.M.

In short, TRPV5 and TRPV6 N termini were exchanged in pCINeo/IRES-GFP constructs via an introduced unique BspEI site at amino acid position Ser221-Tyr222, and C termini were exchanged by means of an introduced unique BsiWI site at amino acid position Arg615-Ser616.

Channels. 1996; 4: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar), TRPV5 N and C termini, and truncated forms of the TRPV6 C terminus were cloned into the oocyte-pT7Ts expression vector using PCR. Sense primers contained an EcoRV restriction site, a Kozak sequence, and ATG at the 5′ end, with ATG in-frame with the triplet encoding the first amino acid. Antisense primers contained an SpeI restriction site at the 3′ end, with a stop codon in-frame after the last amino acid. Truncated forms of the TRPV6 N terminus were cloned into the pT7Ts expression vector (using a sense primer as described above). The antisense primer contained a BstEII restriction site at the 3′ end, with a stop codon in-frame after the last amino acid. All pCINeo/IRES-BFP, pGEX6p-2, and pT7Ts constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio Whittaker Europe, Vervier, Belgium) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (PAA, Linz, Austria), 13 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity controlled incubator with 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected with the pCINeo/IRES-GFP and pCINeo/IRES-blue fluorescent protein (BFP) vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Breda, Netherlands), as described previously (17Vennekens R.

Electrode resistances were 3–6 MΩ, and capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously. A ramp protocol, consisting of linear voltage ramps from –100 to +100 mV (within 450 ms) was applied every 2 s from a holding potential of +20 mV. Ca2+-dependent inactivation was studied using a 3-s voltage step to –100 mV from a holding potential of +70 mV. Current densities, expressed in units of membrane capacitance, were calculated from the current at –80 mV during the ramp protocols (21van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J.

Solutions and Experimental Procedures—The standard extracellular solution (Krebs) contained 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, and 10 mm glucose. The concentration of Ca2+ was varied between 1 and 10 mm. Divalent free solutions did not contain added divalent cations, whereas trace amounts of divalent cations were removed with 100 μm EDTA. To inhibit monovalent cation currents, 150 mm NaCl was replaced with an equimolar amount of N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl. The standard internal (pipette) solution contained 20 mm CsCl, 100 mm Cs-aspartate, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm BAPTA, 10 mm HEPES/CsOH, pH 7.2. Cells were kept in a nominal Ca2+-free medium to prevent Ca2+ overload and exposed for a maximum of 5 min to a Krebs solution containing 1.5 mm Ca2+ before sealing the patch pipette to the cell. All experiments were performed at room temperature. CaM-binding Assays—pT7Ts constructs were linearized, and cRNA was synthesized in vitro using T7-RNA polymerase as described previously (21van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J.

Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In case of significance (p < 0.05), individual groups were compared using a Student's t test. Effect of CaM on TRPV5 and TRPV6 Activity—To study the potential role of CaM in modulating TRPV5 and TRPV6, the activity of these channels was determined by whole-cell patch-clamp analysis in HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with Ca2+-insensitive CaM mutants and TRPV5 or TRPV6. The CaM mutant (CaM1234), in which all four EF-hand structures were mutated, significantly reduced the inward Ca2+ current in response to a hyperpolarizing voltage step in TRPV6-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B)(ppeak < 0.05, n > 11 cells), but had no significant effect upon TRPV5-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A)(ppeak > 0.05, n > 11 cells). Likewise, the Na+ current, which was measured with a ramp protocol, was reduced in TRPV6- and CaM1234-expressing cells, whereas in TRPV5-expressing cells, no effect was observed (Fig. 2). Subsequently, partially Ca2+-insensitive CaM mutants were co-transfected with TRPV5 or TRPV6 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2). CaM constructs were mutated (D → A) in either the low Ca2+ affinity site present in the N terminus (CaM12) or the high Ca2+ affinity site present in the C terminus (CaM34). Overexpression of CaM1234 or CaM34 significantly reduced the Ca2+ as well as the Na+ current density in TRPV6-expressing HEK293 cells, but did not affect the currents of TRPV5-expressing cells. In contrast, the expression of CaM12 did not significantly affect the Ca2+ or Na+ currents of TRPV5- or TRPV6-expressing HEK293 cells. Thus, the high affinity EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites contribute primarily to the observed CaM effect upon TRPV6 activity.Fig. 2Effect of CaM mutants upon TRPV5 and TRPV6 activity. Data obtained from linear ramps from +100 to –100 mV; holding potential was +20 mV. Currents were normalized to the density at –80 mV of controls.

Binding was determined by using CaM-coupled agarose beads and in vitro translated full-length TRPV5 or TRPV6. In the presence of Ca2+ (1 mm CaCl2), CaM bound to TRPV6, whereas in the absence of Ca2+ (5 mm EDTA), binding was virtually abolished (Fig. 3A). Likewise, TRPV5 bound CaM as determined for TRPV6, although CaM mutants do not affect currents in TRPV5-expressing HEK293 cells. Binding experiments of in vitro translated full-length TRPV5 and TRPV6 to non-coupled and CaM-coupled agarose beads in the presence of Ca2+ indicated both TRPV5 and TRPV6 specifically bind CaM (Fig. 3B). Subsequently, we tested the association of TRPV6 and CaM by co-immunoprecipitation studies. To this end, CaM and FLAG-TRPV6 were co-expressed in X. laevis oocytes and immunoprecipitated with the CaM or TRPV6 antibodies. Immunoblots containing the precipitated complexes were probed with a peroxidase-coupled FLAG antibody or the CaM antibody, respectively. CaM (17 kDa) co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-TRPV6 and vice versa, confirming the association of CaM and TRPV6 (Fig. 3, C and D). To further identify the CaM-binding site in TRPV5 and TRPV6, the N termini (TRPV51–327, TRPV61–326) and C termini (TRPV5578–730, TRPV6577–727) were in vitro translated, and subsequently CaM binding was determined (Fig. 4A). The described IQ-like CaM-binding motif in the C terminus of α1C (24Qin N. Olcese R. Bransby M. Lin T. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control, whereas TRPV5 transmembrane region TRPV5421–512 was used as a negative control. Besides the positive control, the N and C termini of both TRPV5 and TRPV6 bound CaM in the presence of Ca2+, whereas no binding was observed with the negative control. In addition, it was demonstrated that both TRPV5 and TRPV6 bind to GST-CaM34 in a Ca2+-independent manner (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the TRPV6 transmembrane domain (TRPV6327–577) was in vitro translated, and subsequently CaM binding was determined (Fig. 4C). The TRPV6 transmembrane domain bound CaM only in the presence of Ca2+, although binding seemed weaker than the CaM binding to both TRPV6 tails. Functional Effect of CaM-binding Domains in TRPV6—Subsequently, TRPV5/6 chimeras were used to identify the critical domains in TRPV6 for the inhibition by CaM34. To this end, the effect of CaM34 upon the Ca2+ and Na+ current densities was examined in HEK293 cells expressing the TRPV5/6 chimera, in which the N and/or C termini were exchanged (Fig. 5). Co-transfection of CaM34 and TRPV6-C5, the chimera in which the TRPV6 C terminus was substituted by that of TRPV5, revealed a reduction of both the Ca2+ and Na+ currents, as observed with the co-transfections of CaM34 and wild-type TRPV6. Co-transfection of CaM34 with TRPV6-N5, the chimera in which the N terminus of TRPV6 was substituted by that of TRPV5, resulted in a reduction of the Ca2+ and Na+ currents, as compared with currents in TRPV6-N5-expressing cells. Co-transfection of CaM34 and TRPV6-N5C5, the chimera in which both termini of TRPV6 were substituted by that of TRPV5, resulted in a reduction of the Ca2+ and Na+ currents, as compared with currents measured in TRPV6-N5C5-expressing cells. Elucidation of the CaM-binding Sites in TRPV6 —A series of TRPV6 N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were constructed as depicted in Fig. 6. Truncated forms of TRPV6 were in vitro translated, and binding was determined as described above. The interaction between TRPV6 N terminus and CaM was abolished when the N terminus was truncated at position 93, whereas truncations at positions 103 up to 266 had no effect upon the interaction with CaM (Fig. 6A). This result indicates that CaM binds the TRPV6 N terminus in a region at position 93–103. Detailed analysis according to the structural prediction program GORIV revealed that this putative CaM-binding region consists of an α-helix. 3Available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.org. A 1–5-10 motif with consensus sequence (FILVW)XXX(FAILVW)XXXX(FILVW) is present this particular binding region (Fig. 6B). The interaction ween TRPV6 C terminus and CaM was partially abolished when the C terminus was truncated at position 655, whereas truncations at position 649 and 642 completely abolished binding (Fig. 6C). Truncation at position 667 up to 695 had effect upon the interaction with CaM. These findings suggest that CaM binds the TRPV6 C terminus at position 649 – This putative binding region contains a 1–8-14 motif consensus sequence (FILVW)XXXXXX(FAILVW)XXXXX LVW) and consists of an α-helix (Fig. 6D). CaM Binding to TRPV5 and TRPV6 at Low Ca2+ Concentrations—The Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to TRPV5 TRPV6 was studied in detail using the TRPV5 and TRPV6 termini (TRPV51–327, TRPV61–326) and C termini (TRPV5578–730 TRPV6577–727) in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of Ca2+ (Fig. 7). Both the TRPV5 N and C termini bound CaM aCa2+-concentration of 30 nm or higher, whereas binding is in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7A). Similar observations were for TRPV6 (Fig. 7B); thus, CaM is bound to both TRPV5 TRPV6 at Ca2+-concentrations as low as 30 nm. The present study identified CaM as a Ca2+-sensor specifically regulating TRPV6 activity. This finding is based upon the following observations. First, electrophysiological measurements of HEK293 cells heterologously expressing TRPV5 or TRPV6 and CaM mutants revealed that TRPV6, but not TRPV5, is regulated by CaM, although both channels bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. Second, the effect of CaM is mediated by the high Ca2+-affinity EF-hand structures 3 and 4 present in the C terminus of CaM. Third, binding studies indicated that CaM binds in a Ca2+-dependent fashion to both the TRPV5 and TRPV6 N termini (TRPV51–327, TRPV61–326) and C termini (TRPV5578–730, TRPV6577–727) and to the TRPV6 transmembrane domain (TRPV6327–577). Fourth, co-transfection of CaM34 and various TRPV5/6 chimeras revealed that the effect of CaM is mediated via the identified CaM-binding domains in TRPV6. Previously, it has been shown that TRPV5 and TRPV6 activity are negatively regulated by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and the ubiquitously expressed CaM could potentially play a regulatory role in this process (10Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Hirnet D. Olausson J. Fecher-Trost C. Bodding M. Nastainczyk W.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CaM is involved in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of TRPV6 only, because CaM1234 significantly reduced the Ca2+ and Na+ current densities in TRPV6-expressing HEK293 cells, whereas TRPV5-mediated currents were not significantly altered. This latter finding is remarkable, given the high homology between both channels, similar Ca2+-dependent regulation of channel activity, and binding of CaM to both channels. The effect of CaM1234 was localized to the high Ca2+-affinity EF-hand structures in the CaM C terminus (EF-hand 3 and 4). Overexpression of CaM34, the CaM mutant that lacks high-affinity Ca2+ binding, reduced the TRPV6 current density to the same extent as CaM1234, whereas CaM12 did not effect TRPV6 currents. The effect of CaM34 upon TRPV6 is not restricted to the Ca2+ current because the Na+ current density was also inhibited when CaM34 was co-expressed. Together, these results imply that CaM positively affects TRPV6 activity at basal Ca2+ concentrations by means of either structural changes in TRPV6 (leading to an increased open probability) or accumulation of active channels on the plasma membrane. However, to date, several studies on voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (6Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H.

The association of CaM with TRPV5 was localized to the N terminus (TRPV51–327) and C terminus (TRPV5578–730). The association of CaM with TRPV6 was localized to consensus CaM-binding motifs in α-helical structures present in the N and C termini and to the transmembrane part (TRPV6327–577) of TRPV6, where CaM binds in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. The N-terminal binding is localized to a consensus 1–5-10 motif (position 88–92-97) that is identical among different TRPV6 species. A 1–5-10 motif is a classical region for the binding of Ca2+-CaM, which fits with the Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to the TRPV6 N terminus. The C-terminal binding is localized to a consensus 1–8-14 motif (position 643–650-656) that is identical between mouse and rat TRPV6. However, human TRPV6 does not contain a 1–8-14 motif at this particular position, which might explain the previous observation that CaM binding to human TRPV6 is localized to a different region (10Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When mouse TRPV6 is truncated at the position corresponding to the described human binding region (10Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it still binds CaM, whereas truncations in the identified 1–8-14 motif virtually abolished CaM binding (this study). The mouse TRPV6 peptide, corresponding to the described human binding region, binds CaM (11Hirnet D. Olausson J. Fecher-Trost C. Bodding M. Nastainczyk W. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, these results are not in line with our results. The fact that only the TRPV6 activity was inhibited by CaM34, despite binding of CaMWT and CaM34 to both TRPV5 and TRPV6, suggests that the regulatory effect of CaM is restricted to TRPV6. TRPV5 and TRPV6 chimeras were used to identify the essential domains of TRPV6 for the CaM effect because CaM mutants had no effect upon TRPV5-expressing HEK293 cells, and TRPV5/6 chimeras give functional channels (18Nilius B. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Hoefs S. Weidema A.F. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30852-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The TRPV6 domains that bind CaM all contribute to the CaM34 effect, because chimeras in which the N and/or C termini of TRPV6 were substituted by that of TRPV5, revealed a significant decrease in both the Ca2+ and Na+ current densities when CaM34 was co-expressed. Comparison of current amplitudes of the different chimeras suggests that the TRPV6 N terminus contributes predominantly to the inhibitory effect of CaM34, because the CaM34-induced decrease is maximally diminished when the TRPV6 N terminus is substituted by that of TRPV5. The dominant-negative effect of CaM mutants upon TRPV6 activity suggests a constant tethering of CaM to the channel complex, because overexpression of Ca2+-insensitive CaM would otherwise not interfere appreciably with currents of TRPV6-expressing HEK293 cells containing endogenous wild-type CaM. As described for Cav channels (23Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), we suggest a tight and constitutive interaction between TRPV6 and CaM. The fact that CaM inhibitors do not affect TRPV6 activity (data not shown) supports the tight and constitutive interaction, as described previously for L-type Cav channels (23Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The CaM binding to the TRPV6 N and C termini at a Ca2+ concentration as low as 30 nm suggests that CaM is tethered to TRPV6 at Ca2+-concentrations normally present in resting cells (60–100 nm). Thus, it is likely that CaM is constitutively tethered to the TRPV6 channel complex. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a regulatory role of CaM in TRPV6-mediated Ca2+ influx. The elucidated molecular mechanism possibly involves constitutive tethering of CaM to the TRPV6 channel complex. Upon Ca2+ sensing of the CaM C terminus, TRPV6 activity is positively affected by means of the combined actions at the N and C termini and transmembrane domain of the channel. We thank Dr. J. P. Adelman, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR for kindly providing the CaM mutants (CaM-pBF), and Dr. L.

Phenytoin (PHY), a widely used antiepileptic drug, is a potent inducer of CYP2B6 in primary human hepatocytes, but does not activate human pregnane X receptor (PXR) significantly in cell-based transfection assays at the same concentrations associated with potent induction of CYP2B6. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that PHY may be a selective activator of hCAR. In primary human hepatocytes, expression of CYP2B6 reporter genes containing phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) or PBREM/xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module (XREM) response elements were activated up to 14- and 28-fold, respectively, by 50 μm PHY. By contrast, parallel experiments in HepG2 cell lines co-transfected with an hPXR expression vector did not show increased reporter activity. These results indicated that a PXR-independent pathway, which is retained in primary hepatocytes, is responsible for PHY induction of CYP2B6. Further experiments revealed that PHY effectively translocates hCAR from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in both primary human hepatocytes and CAR–/– mice. Compared with vehicle controls, PHY administration significantly increased CYP2B6 reporter gene expression, when this reporter construct was delivered together with hCAR expression vector into CAR–/– mice. However, PHY did not increase reporter gene expression in CAR–/– mice in the absence of hCAR vector, implying that CAR is essential for mediating PHY induction of CYP2B6 gene expression. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that, in contrast to most of the known CYP2B6 inducers, PHY is a selective activator of CAR in humans.

In contrast to rodent CYP2B genes, mounting evidence suggests that human PXR (hPXR) may be a key receptor in the regulation of human CYP2B6 gene expression (1Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M.

Recently, fourteen commercially available compounds, including weak, moderate, and strong inducers of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, were used to compare the potency and magnitude of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 induction and activation of hPXR in primary cultured hepatocytes and hepatoma cell-based reporter gene assays, respectively. Results from these studies indicate that CYP2B6 induction is highly correlated with the activation of hPXR for most compounds (3Faucette S.R. Wang H. Hamilton G.A. Jolley S.L. Gilbert D. Lindley C. Yan B. Negishi M. LeCluyse E.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Among the efficacious CYP2B6 inducers evaluated, most activate hPXR but not hCAR, such as RIF and CLZ (CLZ was even reported as a hCAR deactivator by Moore et al. (8Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15122-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar)), whereas others can activate both hPXR and hCAR, such as PB. A notable exception is phenytoin (PHY), which exhibits efficacious induction of CYP2B6 protein and mRNA in primary cultured human hepatocytes at 50 μm but relatively weak or nonactivation of hPXR in several human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) at the same concentration (2Wang H. Faucette S.R. Gilbert D. Jolley S.L. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. LeCluyse E.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this would represent the first clinically applied drug that might induce CYP2B6 through a PXR-independent pathway. Our preliminary data demonstrated that PHY could greatly activate CYP2B6 reporter gene expression in human primary hepatocyte cultures transiently transfected with a CYP2B6 luciferase reporter construct without co-transfection of exogenous nuclear receptors. Because primary human hepatocytes cultures but not hepatoma-immortalized cells maintain the expression of most nuclear receptors, these results suggest that transcriptional factors other than hPXR may be responsible for PHY induction of CYP2B6 within the range of tested treatment concentrations. Based on these preliminary observations, we hypothesized that hCAR is the predominant regulator of increased CYP2B6 gene expression by PHY in human hepatocytes. Although CAR plays an important role in the regulation of xenobiotic-inducible CYP genes, this nuclear receptor exhibits a high level of constitutive transcriptional activity in immortalized cells and can accumulate spontaneously in nuclei (9Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Because of the unavailability of a cell system that can effectively sequester CAR in the cytoplasm and decrease its constitutive activation, it is difficult to study the mechanisms of CAR activation. Accordingly, in the current study, we used primary cultured human hepatocytes and CAR knockout mice as alternative systems to evaluate hCAR activation and translocation. Cell line- and primary human hepatocyte-based transfection assays were used to compare the activation profiles of PXR and other nuclear receptors by PHY at the concentrations associated with efficacious induction of CYP2B6 protein and mRNA expression levels in primary human hepatocytes. In vivo, PHY activated hCAR in CAR knockout mice co-transfected with a CYP2B6 reporter gene and an hCAR expression vector. Tail vein injection of a florescence-tagged hCAR plasmid into CAR knockout mice revealed that hCAR is localized in the cytoplasm in untreated mouse livers but translocates to the nucleus after treatment of mice with PHY or other known CAR activators. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that PHY induction of human CYP2B6 is mediated predominantly by CAR rather than PXR.

Human Primary Hepatocyte Cultures and Transfection Assays— Liver tissues were obtained by qualified medical staff following donor consent and prior approval from the Institutional Review Board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Hepatocytes were isolated from human liver specimens by a modification of the two-step collagenase digestion method as previously described (13Hamilton G.A. Jolley S.L. Gilbert D. Coon D.J. Barros S. LeCluyse E.L. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 306: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated at 3.75 × 105 cells/well into Biocoat® 24-well plates in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, insulin, and dexamethasone. After 4 h, cell culture medium was changed to Williams' E medium containing 6.25 μg/ml insulin, 6.25 μg/ml transferrin, and 6.25 ng/ml selenium (ITS+) and 0.1 μm dexamethasone. Transfection experiments were performed 24 h after cell seeding using Effectene® transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the transfection mixes contained 200 ng of CYP2B6 reporter construct (pGL3 basic-CYP2B6 PBREM or pGL3 basic-CYP2B6 PBREM/XREM) and 25 ng of internal control plasmid (pRL-TK Renilla luciferase). Transfected human primary hepatocytes were treated with PHY (10, 20, and 50 μm) or 0.1% Me2SO control for 24 h, respectively. Subsequently, luciferase activities were measured with hepatocyte lysates using the Dual Luciferase Reporter reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). CYP2B6 induction experiments were performed in hepatocytes cultured in collagen-coated 60-mm Permanox® culture dishes (Nalge Nunc International) as described previously (13Hamilton G.A. Jolley S.L. Gilbert D. Coon D.J. Barros S. LeCluyse E.L. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 306: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated for 36–48 h, followed by treatment with PHY (50 μm), RIF (10 μm), PB (1 mm), CLZ (10 μm), and Me2SO (0.1%) for an additional 72 h. At the end of the treatment period, microsomes and total RNA were isolated as described before (2Wang H. Faucette S.R. Gilbert D. Jolley S.L. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. LeCluyse E.L. Drug Metab.

Extraction of Nuclear Proteins—Preparation of nuclear extracts from human primary hepatocytes were carried out as described previously with modifications (14Yoshinari K. Sueyoshi T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Pascussi J.M. Gerbal-Chaloin S. Fabre J.M. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes (1 × 107) were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 0.3% Nonidet P-40. After keeping on ice for 5 min, the cell suspension was homogenized with a Kontes glass homogenizer (7 ml) B pestle, followed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After repeating the resuspension and centrifugation steps, the supernatant was discarded and 60 μl of lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, 3mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml E-46, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added to the pellet for resuspension. The final concentration was adjusted to 0.4 m by addition of the appropriate volume of 5 m NaCl solution, mixed well, and vigorously shake at 4 °C for 1 h. Finally, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred and stored at –80 °C. Western Blot and Real-time RT-PCR—Microsomal or nuclear proteins were separated on a NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride blotting membrane. Subsequently, membranes were probed with specific antibodies against CYP2B6 (Chemicon International) or hCAR (generated as described by Yoshinari et al. (14Yoshinari K. Sueyoshi T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) and were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Protein bands were developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For real-time RT-PCR, the total RNA isolated from treated hepatocytes was reverse transcribed to cDNA by using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). CYP2B6 primers and TaqMan probe were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as reported before (2Wang H. Faucette S.R. Gilbert D. Jolley S.L. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. LeCluyse E.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CYP2B6 forward primer, 5′-AAGCGGATTTGTCTTGGTGAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGGAGGATGGTGGTGAAGAAG-3′; and probe, 6-carboxyfluorescein-CATCGCCCGTGCGGAATTGTTC-6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). For an internal control, β-actin mRNA was measured using Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Reagents for human β-actin (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For quantitative analysis, CYP2B6 mRNA was normalized to β-actin mRNA and expressed as -fold induction and compared with a control mRNA value of one. Amplification and detection were performed using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector system (Applied Biosystems). Transfection Assays in Hepatoma-derived Cell Lines—HepG2 and Huh7 cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 24 h after seeded cells were cotransfected with hPXR (50 ng), CYP2B6 reporter vector (100 ng) and pRL-TK (10 ng) as internal control by using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Transfected cells were treated with PHY (10, 20, and 50 μm), RIF (10 μm), PB (1 mm), CLZ (10 μm), or 0.1% Me2SO as vehicle control, respectively. 24 h later cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured as described above. In Vivo Gene Transfection and Confocal Imaging Analysis—A CAR-null mouse (16Ueda A. Hamadeh H.K. Webb H.K. Yamamoto Y. Sueyoshi T. Afshari C.A. Lehmann J.M. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) was first crossbred with C3H to generate CAR heterozygous offspring. Subsequently, CAR heterozygous offspring were repeatedly backcrossed with C3H mice until the genetic background was over 95% C3H. The obtained heterozygous mice were bred to produce the wild-type and CAR-null C3H mice. Animals weighing 23–25 g were quarantined for 1 week before use in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms with a 12-h light/dark cycle. CYP2B6 reporter construct (pGL3-basic-PBREM/XREM) (4 μg) with or without pCR3-hCAR vector (5 μg) were injected into CAR–/– mice through the tail vein using TransIT in vivo gene delivery system (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Empty pCR3 vector was used to balance the DNA amount in the injection without pCR3-hCAR, and pRL-SV40 (1 μg) was used as internal control. PHY (100 mg/kg), PB (100 mg/kg), CITCO (8 mg/kg), or equal volume of Me2SO as control was administered intraperitoneally 3 h after gene delivery. Three animals for each group were sacrificed 16 h after the treatment. Livers were homogenized in 5 ml of passive lysate buffer (Promega), and 1 μl of the supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 4 °C was utilized for the dual luciferase assay. For hCAR localization analysis, EYFP-hCAR (10 μg) was tail vein-injected into CAR–/– mice using the same technique described above. Two hours after the injection, PHY (100 mg/kg), PB (100 mg/kg), CITCO (8 mg/kg), or Me2SO was intraperitoneally administered. A repeat dosage was given by the same route in 3 h. Mice were sacrificed 7 h after tail vein delivery of hCAR. Mouse liver sections were embedded into Tissue-Tek OTC and immediately frozen. Liver frozen slide microscopic detection was carried out as reported previously (12Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Sueyoshi T. Moore R. Pascussi J.M. Negishi M.

Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). YFP images from liver sections were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Zeiss LSM510 microscopy system. EYFP-hCAR on the slides was excited at 514 nm, and YFP emission was detected at 530 nm. A 100× oil immersion objective (1.4 numeric aperture) was used for scanning with a pixel size of 0.06 μm. More than 100 EYFP-hCAR expressed hepatocytes were counted for CAR localization for each group. CAR subcellular localization was characterized as nuclear (N), cytosolic (C), and both nuclear and cytosol (N+C). PHY Induction of CYP2B6 Gene Expression in Primary Human Hepatocyte Cultures—To compare the extent of CYP2B6 induction by PHY and other prototypical inducers, primary human hepatocytes were treated with PHY, PB, RIF, and CLZ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in two different preparations of human hepatocytes (HLN-131 and HLN-148), 50 μm PHY induced CYP2B6 protein content by 8- and 20-fold, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that CYP2B6 mRNA expression levels were induced 15-, 13-, 18-, and 12-fold over control by PHY, RIF, PB, and CLZ, respectively (Fig. 1C). The extent of induction of CYP2B6 expression in primary hepatocytes after treatment with 50 μm PHY is similar to other prototypical inducers at both the protein and mRNA levels. Activation of hPXR by Different CYP2B6 Inducers in Hepatoma Cell Lines—Transcriptional activation of the CYP2B6 gene is mediated synergistically by the PBREM and the distal XREM present in the CYP2B6 promoter (10Wang H. Faucette S. Sueyoshi T. Moore R. Ferguson S. Negishi M. LeCluyse E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14146-14152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6043-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). To examine a correlation of the CYP2B6 induction in hepatocytes with hPXR activation in hepatoma, CYP2B6 luciferase reporter constructs containing PBREM, (NR1)5, or PBREM/XREM sequences were co-transfected into Huh7 cells with a hPXR expression vector. In agreement with previous reports (1Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wang H. Faucette S.R. Gilbert D. Jolley S.L. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. LeCluyse E.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the expression of PBREM- or (NR1)5-reporter plasmids was effectively induced by PB, RIF, and CLZ through activation of the co-transfected hPXR. In contrast, little or no activation of hPXR was observed after treatment with 50 μm PHY (Fig. 2, A and B). In HepG2 cells stably transfected with hPXR, the expression of a transiently transfected CYP2B6 homologous reporter construct containing both the PBREM and XREM was increased after treatment with PB (1 mm), RIF (10 μm), and CITCO (1 and 3 μm) but not after treatment with PHY (20 and 50 μm) (Fig. 2C). Based on these observations in Huh7 and HepG2 cells, further investigations were performed in primary hepatocytes and whole animals to determine whether human CAR played a role in mediating PHY induction of CYP2B6. PHY Activation of CYP2B6 Reporter Gene Expression in Primary Human Hepatocytes—In contrast to cell lines, cultured primary human hepatocytes maintain the expression of most endogenous transcription factors such as nuclear receptors, including CAR, which sequesters in the cytoplasm under basal conditions and translocates into the nucleus in response to direct or indirect activators (12Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of endogenous transcription factors on CYP2B6 reporter gene expression, different CYP2B6 reporter gene constructs were transfected into two separate preparations of primary human hepatocytes cultured without transfection of exogenous nuclear receptors. As indicated in Fig. 3 (A and B), 20 μm PHY was associated with 14- and 15-fold increases in the expression of pGL3 basic-PBREM and pGL3 basic-PBREM/XREM reporter constructs, respectively, whereas 21- and 28-fold increases were observed with 50 μm PHY. Notably, the extent of PHY-induced expression of CYP2B6 reporter activity was similar to the extent of induction of the endogenous CYP2B6 gene observed in human primary hepatocytes. PHY Translocates hCAR from Cytosol to Nucleus in Primary Human Hepatocytes—Translocation of CAR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is the initial step during its activation by xenobiotics (21Zelko I. Negishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ability to identify efficacious CAR activators using cell-based transfection assays is complicated by the spontaneous nuclear accumulation of CAR in transformed cell lines such as HepG2 and Huh7 (18Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Muangmoonchai R. Smirlis D. Wong S.C. Edwards M. Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of PHY to activate hCAR, nuclear proteins were extracted from human primary hepatocytes treated with Me2SO, PHY (50 μm), RIF (10 μm), or PB (1 mm) and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Results showed that PHY and PB treatment accumulated hCAR in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). In contrast, RIF (a PXR activator) did not induce translocation of CAR to the nucleus. PHY Activates and Translocates hCAR in Vivo in Mouse Liver—A previously described mouse tail vein gene delivery technique was used to determine whether CYP2B6 reporter constructs could be transactivated by hCAR in CAR–/– mice after treatment with PHY (12Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Compared with vehicle treatment, PHY, CITCO, and PB resulted in significant increases in the expression of CYP2B6 reporter gene in CAR–/– mice injected with a CYP2B6 reporter construct and a hCAR expression vector (Fig. 4). In contrast, there were no significant changes in CYP2B6 reporter gene expression after the same treatments in CAR–/– mice injected with the CYP2B6 reporter construct in the absence of hCAR expression vector. These results indicated that PHY activated hCAR in mouse liver, leading to increase CYP2B6 reporter gene expression. In addition, the absence of effect in CAR–/– mice injected with CYP2B6 reporter construct alone indicates that other endogenous nuclear receptors play minor roles in regulating PHY induction of CYP2B6. To determine whether PHY-induced expression of CYP2B6 reporter constructs in vivo involved nuclear translocation of hCAR, fluorescent protein-tagged hCAR (EYFP-hCAR) was tail vein-injected into CAR–/– mice. The expression of fluorescently labeled hCAR in the cytosol and nucleus was visualized under a confocal microscopy. Of the hCAR-expressing cells counted in the liver sections of vehicle-treated mice, 11% exhibited hCAR localization in the nucleus, 83% in the cytoplasm, and 6% in the cytoplasm and nucleus (mixed localization). In PHY- and PB-treated mice, the majority of the EYFP-hCAR expression was translocated into the nuclei of hepatocytes (73 and 70%, respectively), whereas cytoplasmic localization decreased to 16 and 19%, respectively. Approximately 11% of the cells showed mixed localization in mice treated with PHY or PB (Fig. 5). In contrast, a previously reported hCAR activator (23Maglich J.M. Parks D.J. Moore L.B. Collins J.L. Goodwin B. Billin A.N. Stoltz C.A. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17277-17283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), CITCO, showed a relatively lower extent of hCAR nuclear translocation in the current experimental system (33% in the nucleus, 50% in the cytoplasm, and 17% as mixed localization) (Fig. 5). Overall, there was an approximate 70% increase in the nuclear localization of hCAR after PHY or PB treatment in CAR–/– mice. These results indicate that PHY is capable of inducing both the nuclear translocation and activation of hCAR in the mouse livers. CAR regulation of CYP2B genes expression has been well established in rodents (24Wei P. Zhang J. Egan-Hafley M. Liang S. Moore D.D. Nature. 2000; 407: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 25Kakizaki S. Yamamoto Y. Ueda A. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mouse CAR (mCAR) activators such as TCPOBOP and PB can induce Cyp2b10 gene expression in both intact mouse liver and primary cultured mouse hepatocytes. Induction of Cyp2b10 expression can be blocked effectively by the mCAR repressors androstanol and androstenol. However, current knowledge is limited regarding the role of hCAR in the regulation of human CYP2B gene expression. To date, accumulated evidence suggests that the human CYP2B6 gene is regulated in a PXR-dependent manner (1Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

This study provides a novel translational mechanism to account for the association between L1 expression and motile processes involved in metastasis and development. The L1 cell adhesion molecule is a phylogenetically conserved neural recognition molecule that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Structurally, L1 is a transmembrane (type 1) glycoprotein with a complex ectodomain consisting of multiple immunoglobulin and fibronectin-like repeats (1Brummendorf T. Rathjen F.G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). L1 was first described as a neural cell adhesion molecule based upon a restricted distribution that included post-mitotic neurons (3Lindner J. Rathjen F.G. Schachner M.

However, both murine and human L1 homologues have now also been described for other cell types of diverse origin, including endothelial cells, epithelial cells, reticular fibroblasts, and cells of lymphoid and myelomonocytic origin (4Thor G.

Although L1 serves to promote cell-cell interactions, the functional outcome of such interactions is rarely static cell-cell adhesion. In the central nervous system, for example, L1 has been shown to initiate a variety of dynamic motile processes that include cerebellar cell migration and neurite extension (3Lindner J. Rathjen F.G.

However, L1 is also now known to have a significant impact upon cell-matrix interactions required for haptotaxis and matrix remodeling (9Di Sciullo G. Donahue T. Schachner M. Bogen S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1953-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4918-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that ectopic L1 expression strongly potentiates α5β1-mediated haptotaxis. In both of these studies, initiation of haptotaxis is proposed to involve direct L1-integrin interaction via an Arg-Gly-Asp integrin-recognition motif in the L1 ectodomain. Such an association may depend upon a transient cis-association at the cell surface (22Thelen K. Keder V. Panicker A.K. Schmid R.-S. Midkiff B.R. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4918-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or involve L1-shedding and autocrinal binding via αvβ5 (21Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In both studies, it is suggested that direct L1-integrin ligation potentiates haptotaxis via non-translational mechanisms that involve the induction of integrin-mediated signaling events (21Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Thelen K. Keder V.

In this report, we present evidence for a translational mechanism that can further account for the association between L1 expression and cell motility and invasion. Ectopic L1 expression in two different cell lines is shown to induce sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; 4HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; RBM, reconstituted basement membrane. pathway and the concomitant induction of ERK-regulated gene products intimately associated with cell motility and invasion. Several of these gene products are shown to contribute directly to L1-mediated migration and matrix invasion. Such a mechanism may allow L1 to induce and maintain a motile cellular phenotype that facilitates both normal developmental repositioning and metastasis. Reagents—Anti-mouse integrin antibodies to β1 (Ha2/5), α1 (Ha31/8), α2 (HMa2), α5 (5H10–27), α6 (GoH3), β3 (2C9.G2), and αv (H9.2b8) were purchased from BD Biosciences. A goat polyclonal antibody (pAb) to α5β1 (FNR) was obtained from Chemicon, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-phospho-ERK monoclonal antibody (mAb) (E10) and anti-ERK-2 pAb (C-14) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Anti-L1 mAb (UJ127) was from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA) and an anti-L1 pAb (L1-ECD) was kindly provided by Dr. William Stallcup (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). Anti-thrombospondin-2 mAb Cl.4 and anti-Rac1 mAb (Cl.102) and anti-S100A4 pAb were obtained from BD Transduction Labs and DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark), respectively. The mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Purified vitronectin was obtained from Chemicon; laminin from BD Biosciences; purified type I collagen from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); and human type IV collagen from Sigma. Cell Models and Transfections—NIH-3T3 cells used for stable and transient transfections were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). 3T3 cells stably expressing L1 were provided by Dr. V. Lemmon (University of Miami) and were generated by using LipofectAMINE and a pcDNA3 vector containing full-length L1 cDNA (23Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mock-transfected 3T3 cells were generated using LipofectAMINE and an empty pcDNA3.1/neo/lacZ vector. Drug-resistant L1- and mock-transfected 3T3 cell populations were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing G418 (800 μg/ml) and 10% fetal calf serum and were routinely passaged to avoid overgrowth. The clonal melanoma cell line K1735-C11 was provided by Dr. Avi Raz (Wayne State University). To produce stable transfectants, the cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and PvuI-linearized pcDNA3.1(zeo) vector encoding full-length human L1. Transfected cells were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Zeocin (800 μg/ml) and 10% fetal calf serum. L1-expressing cells were sorted by repeated fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis with an anti-L1 pAb. Transfected, non-expressing mock control cells were maintained under identical culture conditions and were used after an equal number of passages. For the transient transfection of L1, subconfluent 3T3 cells were incubated with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent and a pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) incorporating a Zeocin selection marker and the full-length L1 complementary DNA sequence. Empty vector was used for mock transfection. After 5 h, the cells were washed twice and replenished with fresh serum-containing media. Cells were lysed for Western blot analysis after an additional 72 h. L1-transfected 3T3 cells were also transiently transfected with a dominant-negative hemagglutinin-tagged Rac1 expression construct containing an asparagine mutation of Thr17 (Rac-N17) (24Minden A. Lin A. Claret F. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Control cells received empty vector, and all cells were cotransfected with a β-galactosidase reporter vector (pEF4-lacZ). Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as described above. After 48 h, cells were harvested and assessed for migration; 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining was used to identify transfected cells. Protein production by the RacN17 construct was verified by immunoblotting with an anti-hemagglutinin mAb (HA-7, Sigma). Migration Assays—Migration assays were performed with 24-well Transwell migration plates (Costar). The undersides of the insert membranes (8.0-μm pore size) were precoated overnight at 4 °C with matrix components diluted into phosphate-buffered saline including vitronectin (8 μg/ml), laminin-1 (40 μg/ml), native type I collagen (40 μg/ml), or denatured collagen, types I and IV (40 μg/ml). The collagens were denatured by heating at 100 °C for 30 min. Cells were harvested from cultures at 70–80% confluence using versene (1:5000, Invitrogen) and were added at 5 × 104 cells per upper chamber in fibroblast basal media (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.4 mm MnCl2 (pH 7.4). Cells that had migrated to the undersides of the insert membranes were stained with 1% Toluidine blue and were counted based upon the number of cells per 20× field using an inverted stereomicroscope. Eight fields per insert were scored, and treatments were performed in duplicate. For inhibition studies, anti-integrin antibodies were added to the upper and lower chambers at 40 μg/ml. Invasion Assays—Matrigel invasion assays were performed using BD BioCoat growth factor reduced Matrigel invasion chambers as recommended by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). Cells were added at 5 × 104 cells per upper chamber in fibroblast basal media supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.4 mm MnCl2. These cells were given fresh culture media 18 h prior to use and were harvested from cultures at 70–80% confluence using versene. Invasion of cells from upper to lower chambers was determined after 22–42 h and quantified by counting cells on the undersides of the insert membranes as described for migration assays. PDGF (50 ng/ml) was added to lower chambers as a chemoattractant. The contribution of cathepsins to invasion was assessed using peptides CA-064 Me (selective inhibitor of procathepsin-B) and E-64-d (inhibitor of cathepsins-L and -B) (Peptide International Inc, Louisville, KY). These peptides were added to upper and lower chambers at concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 25 μm. To optimize cathepsin activity, the invasion fibroblast basal medium was adjusted to pH 6.8. Flow Cytometry—Surface integrin expression was assessed by FACS analysis. Sub-confluent cultures were harvested using versene and stained with the following anti-integrin antibodies: anti-β1 (CD29,Ha2/5), anti-α1 (CD49a, Ha31/8), anti-α2 (CD49b, HMa2), anti-α6 (CD49f, GoH3), anti-β3 (CD61, 2C9.G2), and anti-αv (CD51, H9.2b8). Anti-α2, α6, and β3 antibodies were all conjugated directly to phycoerythrin. Phycoerythrin-conjugated non-binding isotype-matched antibodies were used as controls. Unlabelled anti-integrin antibodies to β1, α1, and αv were detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-Armenian hamster IgG secondary. Cells were stained in 70 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% azide) and were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Conjugated and unconjugated anti-integrin antibodies were used at 10 μg/ml. Some L1-transfected 3T3 cells were treated with pharmacological inhibitors of ERK-1/2 (U0126, 25 μm), as indicated in the text. Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Phosphorylation—Levels of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation were determined using lysates from mock- or L1-transfected 3T3 or K1735-C11 cells. To assess the effect of serum starvation, transfected 3T3 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 or 1 × 106 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells seeded at 1 × 106/well were cultured in 0.5% serum for 48 h followed by 1 h without serum. Cells at 5 × 105/well were maintained in 10% serum. Cells were extracted with a lysis buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) as well as 10 mm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm sodium fluoride to prevent phosphatase activity. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and equal quantities of protein were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and detected with an anti-phospho-ERK mAb (E10, 1:2000). Membranes were then stripped and re-probed to confirm equal loading using an anti-ERK2 pAb (C14, 1:100). Cathepsin Assays—Intracellular cathepsin activity was assessed using Magic Red™ cathepsin detection kits for cathepsin-L and -B (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC). Mock- or L1-transfected 3T3 cells were grown to 90% confluence, harvested, and then incubated with Magic Red fluorogenic substrates specific for each cathepsin. The cells were incubated for 60 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC). Because of the high levels of intracellular cathepsin-B activity in 3T3 cells, the fluorogenic substrate for cathepsin-B was diluted 1:780, which is below the manufacturer's recommendation of 1:260. Red fluorescence, generated as a result of intracellular enzymatic cleavage, was assessed by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To assess the contribution of the ERK-pathway to intracellular cathepsin activity, L1-transfected 3T3 cells were treated with U0126 (25 μm) or Me2SO vehicle alone for 72 h prior to harvesting. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis for Integrin β3 Expression— Mock- or L1-transfected 3T3 cells were grown to 90% confluence, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Ten percent of the cDNA synthesized from 5 μg of total cellular RNA was utilized for PCR of both the integrin-β3 and β-actin gene products. For analysis of mouse integrin β3 expression, the following primer set was used: forward, 5′-GTGCTGACGCTAACCGACCAG-3′, reverse, 5-CATGGTAGTGGAGGCAGAGTAGTGG-3′. Actin primers were purchased from Stratagene. Amplification was performed for 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 60 °C using the HotStarTaq Mastermix Kit (Qiagen). Equal volumes of products were separated by agarose electrophoresis and documented with a Bio-Rad imaging system. Gene Array Analysis—Total RNA was harvested from sub-confluent cultures of stable mock- and L1-expressing 3T3 or K1735-C11 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions for TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Biotinylated probes were then synthesized according to the manufacturer's instructions for the SuperArray mouse tumor metastasis Q10 kit (SuperArray, Inc., Bethesda, MD). Briefly, equal quantities (5 μg) of total RNA were hybridized with kit-specific primers, and reverse transcription was performed in the presence of biotin-16-dUTP. Labeled probe was denatured and then hybridized to the prehybridized membranes overnight at 60 °C. The next day, the membranes were washed and incubated with a SuperArray blocking solution. Membranes were blocked for 45 min prior to application of an horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-biotin mAb (BN34, Sigma) in SuperArray wash buffer. The membranes were incubated for 30 min and washed vigorously with SuperArray wash buffer prior to rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline and chemiluminescent detection of bound probe with the horseradish peroxidase substrate PS-3 (Lumigen, Inc., Southfield, MI). Densitometric quantification of images was performed using both ScanAlyze and NIH Image software with similar results. L1 Co-operates with Serum or Serum-growth Factors to Induce Sustained ERK Activation—Levels of constitutive ERK activation were assessed in 3T3 or K1735-C11 cells stably transfected with full-length human L1. L1 levels achieved in these cell lines are shown in Fig. 1A and are within the range of endogenous L1 expression displayed by a variety of cell lines (6Montgomery A.M.P. Becker J.C. Siu C.-H.

Levels of ERK activation were determined in mock- or L1-transfected cells cultured in growth media and harvested at equivalent cell densities. Significantly higher levels of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation were observed as a result of stable ectopic L1 expression in both 3T3 and K1735-C11 cells (Fig. 1B). To ensure that the differences in ERK activation observed are due to L1 expression, rather than a drift in phenotype between mock- and L1-transfected populations, it was further confirmed that transient transfection of full-length L1 cDNA into wild-type 3T3 cells also induces higher levels of ERK activation (Fig. 1C). The L1-mediated ERK activation observed was found to be critically dependent upon cell density. Thus, no evidence of L1-mediated ERK activation was observed when transfected 3T3 cells were seeded at a low cell density and were harvested as a dispersed or a sparse population (Fig. 1, D and E; 0.6 × 105/well). Differences in ERK activation were only evident at higher seeding densities (e.g. 2.5 × 105/well), which allowed for more contiguous monolayer formation and cell-cell contact (Fig. 1, D and E). After seeding at an optimal cell density, L1-dependent ERK activation was maintained for at least 24 h (Fig. 1F). After this time, the 3T3 cell cultures became excessively overgrown and ERK activation declined. The ability of L1 to support sustained elevated ERK activation was also found to be critically dependent upon the presence of serum. Accordingly, no difference in ERK activation was found when the mock- or L1-transfected 3T3 cells were maintained in the absence of serum (Fig. 2A). One explanation for this finding is that sustained L1-dependent ERK activation requires co-operation with one or more serum growth factors. Because platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a major mitogenic factor in serum, it was further determined whether L1 specifically co-operates with this growth factor to induce heightened levels of ERK activation. Importantly, levels of ERK activation resulting from stimulation with PDGF were significantly higher in 3T3 cells expressing L1 (Fig. 2, B and C). Together these data indicate that L1 can support sustained ERK activation; such a sustained response seems to require both cell-cell interaction and growth factor co-operation. Ectopic L1 Expression and Sustained ERK Activation Induce Expression of Integrin αvβ3—A prior report (28Woods D. Cherwinski H. Venetsanakos E. Bhat A. Gysin S. Humbert M. Bray P.F. Saylor V.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3192-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) has shown that sustained activation of the ERK pathway induces the expression of select integrins, including α5β1 and αvβ3. To determine whether L1 induces changes in integrin expression, we compared the integrin profiles of mock- or L1-transfected 3T3 cells. Cells were stained with antibodies to αv, β3, β1, α6, α5, α2, and α1 and were then analyzed by FACS analysis. A comparison of FACS histograms confirmed that stable expression of L1 in 3T3 cells is associated with a significant increase in the surface expression of αvβ3 (Fig. 3B). No change in the levels of the αv-subunit, α1β1, α2β1, or α6β1 was observed (Fig. 3, C–F), and only a modest increase in the expression of α5β1 and the β1-subunit was found (Fig. 3, G and H). Induction of αvβ3 expression was also confirmed in L1-transfected K1735 cells (Fig. 3I), and reverse transcription-PCR analysis, using primers specific for the murine β3-subunit, established that the increased surface expression of αvβ3 in the 3T3 cells is associated with a significant increase in message for the β3-subunit (Fig. 3J). Increased expression of the αvβ3-heterodimer (Fig. 3B), without a change in the overall levels of the αv-subunit (Fig. 3C), has been reported (28Woods D. Cherwinski H. Venetsanakos E. Bhat A. Gysin S. Humbert M. Bray P.F. Saylor V.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3192-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and is believed to occur at the expense of other αv-heterodimers such as αvβ5 (29Koistinen P. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24835-24841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To confirm that induction of β3 expression in our models is due to activation of the ERK pathway, L1-transfected 3T3 cells were treated with the inhibitor U0126 prior to FACS analysis. Consistent with a role for ERK, this inhibitor significantly decreased levels of β3 expression after 72 h (Fig. 3K). Long-term treatment with U0126 was not observed to impact cell viability (data not shown). The association between ERK activation and induction of β3 expression was further tested in 3T3 cells infected to express a ΔB-RAF:ER fusion protein (30McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchrad C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes and Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of this fusion protein is selectively and conditionally activated by the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) resulting in the selective and sustained activation of the ERK pathway within 10–15 min (30McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchrad C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes and Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Samuels M.A. Weber M.J. Bishop M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Treatment with 4HT and concomitant ERK activation in these 3T3 cells resulted in a marked increase in β3 expression (Fig. 3L), and this induction could be blocked using the ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 3M). The increased αvβ3 expression in this model was only evident after 12–18 h of treatment with 4HT (Fig. 3N). Based on these results, we propose that L1 induces αvβ3 expression by virtue of inducing a sustained ERK response. L1 Induces the Expression of Multiple ERK-regulated Gene Products—A cDNA microarray that allows the simultaneous detection of 96 genes intimately associated with motility and invasion (Mouse metastasis GE array Q series, SuperArray Inc.) was utilized to determine whether ectopic L1 expression induces more global changes in the expression of pro-invasive or pro-migratory gene products. A full listing of the genes on this array are available on the company web site. 2Available on the World Wide Web at www.superarray.com/cancer.php. L1-dependent gene expression was assessed by comparing mRNA samples derived from mock- or L1-transfected 3T3 or K1735-C11 cells cultured under identical conditions. Based upon the observation that L1 can induce sustained ERK activation, it was further determined if L1-induced genes are also expressed as a result of conditional ERK activation. ERK-regulated genes were identified by comparing mRNA samples derived from 3T3ΔRAF:ER cells treated with 4HT or vehicle alone. Fig. 4 lists multiple gene products that were significantly induced in 3T3 and K1735 cells both as a result of L1 expression and conditional ERK activation. Only those genes that were consistently induced in repeat experiments are listed. Notable examples include the cysteine proteases cathepsin-L and -B, the small GTPases RhoC and Rac-1, the matrix component osteopontin, and the adhesion receptor CD44 (Fig. 4). Despite the distinct histological origin of 3T3 and K1735 cell lines, six of the nine genes identified in the 3T3 model were also confirmed in the K1735 model (Fig. 4). Although"
https://openalex.org/W1992444604,"An octapeptide was previously described that protects neurons against a wide variety of insults directly and indirectly as a result of interactions (at femtomolar concentrations) with supporting glial cells. The current study set out to identify the octapeptide binding molecules so as to understand the high affinity mechanisms of cellular protection. Studies utilizing affinity chromatography of brain extracts identified tubulin, the brain major protein, as the octapeptide-binding ligand. Dot blot analysis with pure tubulin and the biotinylated octapeptide verified this finding. When added to cerebral cortical astrocytes, the octapeptide (10-15–10-10m) induced a rapid microtubule reorganization into distinct microtubular structures that were stained by monoclonal tubulin antibodies and visualized by confocal microscopy. Fluorescein-labeled octapeptide induced a similar change and was detected in the intracellular milieu, even when cells were incubated at 4 °C or at low pH. In a cell-free system, the octapeptide stimulated tubulin assembly into microtubules. Furthermore, treatment of astrocytes with zinc chloride resulted in microtubule disassembly and cell death that was protected by the octapeptide. In conclusion, the results suggest that the octapeptide crosses the plasma membrane and interacts directly with tubulin, the microtubule subunit, to induce microtubule reorganization and improved survival. Because microtubules are the key component of the neuronal and glial cytoskeleton that regulates cell division, differentiation, and protection, this finding may explain the breadth and efficiency of the cellular protective capacities of the octapeptide.

NAP, an eight-amino acid peptide derived from ADNP that was identified by peptide activity scanning, was shown to be neuroprotective in a wide variety of systems and against multiple neurotoxins (6Gozes I.

NAP provided neuroprotection at remarkably low concentrations against the Alzheimer's disease toxin (β-amyloid peptide) (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H.

Brain Res. 2000; 854: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), in vitro. Further studies indicated an exceptionally broad range of neuroprotective concentrations against excitotoxicity (N-methyl-d-aspartate; 10-16–10-8m) (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Treatment of mixed neuroglial populations identified two peaks of activity at femtomolar and at nanomolar concentrations; in contrast, treatment of enriched neuronal populations indicated only one peak of activity, at nanomolar concentrations of NAP. These results suggest a direct and an indirect mode of action for NAP, with the latter involving glial cells (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C.

Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and in a rat model of cholinotoxicity (11Gozes I. Giladi E. Pinhasov A. Bardea A. Brenneman D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1091-1098PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid carrier, apolipoprotein E, has been implicated as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease, and because the knock-out mice exhibit short-term memory deficits that are ameliorated by chronic peptide treatment, NAP holds promise for future treatment against disease-related short-term memory deficits. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease is associated with death of cholinergic neurons. Rats treated with the cholinotoxin ethylcholine, aziridium, provide a model of cholinotoxicity. A week following a single intracerebroventricular injection of the cholinotoxin, NAP administration ensued using daily intranasal application. Significant improvements in short-term spatial memory in NAP-treated animals were observed (11Gozes I. Giladi E. Pinhasov A. Bardea A. Brenneman D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1091-1098PubMed Google Scholar). Cognition enhancement was also found in the Morris water maze paradigm in middle-aged rats treated daily (by intranasal administration) with NAP (12Gozes I. Alcalay R. Giladi E. Pinhasov A. Furman S. Brenneman D.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In acute in vivo models of neuronal damage, a single NAP subcutaneous injection after closed head injury dramatically reduced mortality and facilitated clinical recovery (motor ability, balancing, and alertness) in mice (13Beni-Adani L. Gozes I. Cohen Y. Assaf Y. Steingart R.A. Brenneman D.E. Eizenberg O. Trembolver V. Shohami E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 57-63PubMed Google Scholar). Water accumulation (edema) was reduced by 70% in the NAP-treated mice. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated significant brain tissue recovery in NAP-treated animals. Pretreatment with NAP by daily subcutaneous injections for the first 3 months of life followed by head trauma at the age of 4 months resulted in faster recovery and enhanced performance in a learning and memory paradigm (14Zaltzman R. Beni S.M. Giladi E. Pinhasov A. Steingart R.A. Romano J. Shohami E. Gozes I. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats is manifested in stroke-like symptoms, including infarct formation, neuronal cell death, motor disabilities, and sensory impairments. A single intravenous NAP injection up to 4 h following artery occlusion resulted in a significant reduction in infarct size, marked protection against neuronal death (apoptosis), and defense against motor and sensory disabilities (15Leker R.R. Teichner A. Grigoriadis N. Ovadia H. Brenneman D.E. Fridkin M. Giladi E. Romano J. Gozes I. Stroke. 2002; 33: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both closed head injury and middle cerebral artery occlusion can be considered as acute brain damage with severe secondary outcome that could be prevented, in part, by neuroprotection. In both cases, oxidative stress that is a result of the initial insult may exacerbate the damage. In this respect, fetal demise and growth restriction caused by overexposure of pregnant mice to alcohol are thought to be because of severe oxidative damage. In pregnant mice exposed to one intraperitoneal injection of alcohol, fetal demise was inhibited by a single injection of NAP (16Spong C.Y. Abebe D.T. Gozes I. Brenneman D.E. Hill J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 774-779PubMed Google Scholar). Given the breadth of the protective activities of NAP, its mechanism of action is of great interest. Potential signal transduction pathways include cGMP production (17Ashur-Fabian O. Giladi E. Furman S. Steingart R.A. Wollman Y. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 307: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and interference with inflammatory mechanisms, tumor necrosis factor α, and MAC1-related changes (13Beni-Adani L. Gozes I. Cohen Y.

The current study identifies the tubulin subunit of microtubules as the primary target of NAP, disclosing that indeed NAP interacts with a key component of the cell and facilitates survival. Affi-Gel 10 NAP Affinity Chromatography—A protein lysate was prepared from 1-day-old rat brains in a buffer containing the following ingredients: 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 4.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). DNA was fragmented by sonication. Cell debris was discarded following 30 min of centrifugation at 30,000 × g. An affinity column containing NAP was prepared using elongated NAP (KKKGGNAPVSIPQC, synthesized as before) (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 11Gozes I. Giladi E. Pinhasov A. Bardea A. Brenneman D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1091-1098PubMed Google Scholar) and Affi-Gel 10 in 0.2 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5. Further column preparation was according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The brain extract prepared as above was loaded (2 mg/ml) on the column at 20 °C and incubated for an hour; the column was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline until all unbound protein eluted (as confirmed by protein assay (Bradford; BioRad). NAP-binding proteins were eluted in 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.0), and the eluted protein fractions were adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris-HCl buffer. Electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide SDS-containing gel was then performed (2Zamostiano R. Pinhasov A. Gelber E. Steingart R.A. Seroussi E. Giladi E. Bassan M. Wollman Y. Eyre H.J. Mulley J.C. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 708-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Sulfolink Coupling Gel NAP Affinity Chromatography—The second isolation efforts utilized a different affinity column, sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce). Binding of CKKKGGNAPVSIPQ was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brain extract was prepared as above. Binding was performed at 4 °C for 20 h, washing was as above, and elution was performed with NAP (NAPVSIPQ) in 2 mg/ml phosphate-buffered saline (2 ml/2-ml column) at 4 °C for 20 h. Sequence Analysis—To further identify the NAP-binding protein, the polyacrylamide gel portion containing the major purified protein band was subjected to in-gel proteolysis with trypsin and mass spectrometry analysis by the Smoler Protein Center, Department of Biology, The Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. Direct NAP Binding to Protein, Dot Blot Analysis—The protein (1–4 μg/1 μl) was applied to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), 1 μl/spot, and dried (45 min, 20 °C). The membrane was incubated in a blocking solution (10 mm Tris, 6 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 10% low-fat milk) for 16 h at 4 °C. Detection was with biotin-labeled NAP (w/w, NAP/tubulin; Sigma) (19Gottlieb P. Beretz A. Fridkin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and ECL+ (Western blotting detection system; Amersham Biosciences). Cell Cultures—Rat cerebral cortical cells from newborn pups were prepared as before (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In short, cerebral cortical tissue was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), and trypsin. Dissociated cerebral cortical cells were added to the culture dish with 5% horse serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were plated in a ratio of 1 cortex/two 75-cm2 cell culture flasks (polystyrene; Corning Glass). The medium was changed 1 day after plating. Cells were split after 10 days of incubation, plated in 24-well plates (each flask into 60 wells containing 250 μl of medium), and incubated for an additional 2 weeks. In some experiments, ZnCl2 (150 μm; Sigma) (20Chen C.-J. Liao S.-L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was added for an additional incubation of 16 h. NAP (10-15–10-10m) was added either together with ZnCl2 or 3 h after the addition of the ZnCl2 solution. Metabolic Activity Measurements—Metabolic activity of viable cells in culture was measured by a calorimetric method using a tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl–5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, MTS) and an electron-coupling reagent, phenazine methosulfate. MTS is bioreduced by the living cells to the formazan form that is detected at 490 nm (Promega, Madison, WI). Confocal Microscopy—Synthetic NAP (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) or fluorescein-labeled NAP (19Gottlieb P. Beretz A. Fridkin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was added to tissue culture cells in ascending concentrations and incubated for 15 min to 24 h. After incubation, cells were extensively washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, Triton X-100 (0.2%) was added to allow antibody cellular penetration using mouse monoclonal tubulin antibodies (TUB2.5) (21Gozes I. Barnstable C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and rhodamine-labeled secondary goat antimouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Fluorescently stained cells were analyzed using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope. The Zeiss LSM 410 inverted (Oberkochen, Germany) is equipped with a 25-milliwatt krypton-argon laser (488 and 568 maximum lines) and 10-milliwatt helium-neon laser (633 maximum lines). A ×40 numeric aperture/1.2 C Apochromat water-immersion lens (Axiovert 135 M; Zeiss) was used for all imaging. Microtubule Assembly—CytoDYNAMIX Screen 01 (CDS01), a microtubule assembly kit, was obtained from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO) (www.cytoskeleton.com). Bovine microtubule-associated protein-rich tubulin (HTS01) was resuspended in G-PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm GTP) and subjected to polymerization at 37 °C. The reaction was performed in a 96-well plate. Assembly was monitored with a spectrophotometer, SPECTRAmax 190 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), employing continuous recordings at 350 nm. Statistical Analysis—All values are given as means ± S.E. from a number of independent experiments as indicated in the figure legends. Results were analyzed for statistical significance by Student's t test and analysis of variance followed by Dunnet's multiple comparisons test. Isolation of NAP-binding Proteins by Affinity Chromatography—Brain homogenates were chosen as a putative enriched source for NAP-interacting molecules. Extracts were subjected to affinity chromatography comprising NAP bound to two different solid supports, Affi-Gel 10 and sulfolink coupling gel. Elution of the NAP-interacting molecules was obtained by either reducing the pH or by competing the binding to the insoluble NAP with excess free soluble NAP. Electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide SDS-containing gel revealed a major purified protein band at about 50,000 daltons (Fig. 1); this protein was subjected to further characterization. Tubulin Is a NAP-binding Protein—When the gel portion containing the purified ∼50,000-dalton protein band was submitted to in-gel proteolysis with trypsin and mass spectrometry analysis, this NAP-binding protein was identified as rat-α tubulin (molecular mass 50,242), gi223556 (Fig. 2A). The identification of tubulin included the characterization of 6 different tryptic peptides (Fig. 2A, bold). A dot blot assay performed with spotted tubulin indicated NAP binding to tubulin (Fig. 2B). NAP Interaction with Tubulin/Microtubules: Confocal Microscopy—To establish an association between tubulin (22Gozes I. Littauer U.Z. Nature. 1978; 276: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 23Gozes I. Sweadner K.J. Nature. 1981; 294: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and NAP in the living cell, we initiated confocal microscopy analysis of fluorescent NAP and immunodetection of tubulin (21Gozes I. Barnstable C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To visualize the microtubule structure, monoclonal β-tubulin antibodies (TUB2.5) (21Gozes I. Barnstable C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were used to stain primary astrocyte cultures. Either fluorescein-labeled NAP or native NAP was added to 2-week-old astrocyte cultures. Astrocytes were used as a model because previous results have indicated that, although nanomolar concentrations of NAP protected neuronal enriched cultures against β-amyloid toxicity (7Zemlyak I. Furman S. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. Regul. Pept. 2000; 96: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a more potent protection at femtomolar concentrations of NAP was observed when neurons were plated on a bed of astrocytes (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A time course experiment suggested that the microtubule reorganization was apparent in astrocytes 2 h after NAP application, with an additional condensation 4 h after application, and returned to the original morphology 24 h after NAP application (Fig. 3A). Mitotic spindles were not noticeable. Similar microtubule reorganizations were observed with NAP at concentrations ranging from 10-15 to 10-10m with fluorescein-labeled and with native NAP. Evaluation of the number of cells undergoing microtubule reorganization following NAP treatment showed maximal organization at 2–4 h with a decline at 24 h (Fig. 3B). A control peptide, C2 (VLGGGSALL), that does not protect cells in vitro (24Brenneman D.E. Hauser J. Neale E. Rubinraut S. Fridkin M. Davidson A. Gozes I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 619-627PubMed Google Scholar) did not induce a microtubule-associated morphological change (Fig. 3A). Detection of Fluorescein-labeled NAP—After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, fluorescein-labeled NAP was detected inside the cell (Fig. 4A). A critical question is whether NAP induces microtubule reorganization through interaction with a surface receptor or whether it is a pore-forming peptide that interacts with the lipid bilayer and is then internalized into cells. To evaluate potential surface labeling, the initial incubation was carried out at 4 °C and in a parallel experiment at pH 3.0. When NAP (10-15m) was incubated with astrocytes at pH 3.0 for 15 min (Fig. 4B), microtubule reorganization was apparent and fluorescein-labeled NAP was visualized inside the cells. At 4 °C, although microtubule reorganization did not take place because microtubules undergo disassembly at 4 °C (25Gozes I. Neurochem. Int. 1982; 4: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a dose-dependent intracellular accumulation of NAP was apparent (Fig. 4B). NAP Promotes Tubulin Assembly—Using a high through-put analysis kit containing bovine tubulin (Cytoskeleton), tubulin assembly was determined in the presence of increasing NAP concentrations. Measurements included absorbance determinations at 350 nm. Although 10-18m NAP did not influence microtubule assembly in the test tube (data not shown), 10-15m NAP stimulated microtubule assembly in a similar way to paclitaxel (Fig. 5). Paclitaxel, a known tubulin stabilizing agent also suggested as a neuroprotective agent (26Li G. Faibushevich A. Turunen B.J. Yoon S.O. Georg G. Michaelis M.L. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 347-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. NAP at 10-10m promoted tubulin assembly to the same degree as at a concentration of 10-15m (data not shown). C2, a peptide that was utilized as a negative control in the cellular assay (Fig. 3A), did not affect microtubule assembly as well. NAP Protects against Zinc Intoxication—When 2-week-old astrocyte cultures were exposed to ZnCl2 (16 h of incubation), there was an 88 ± 0.008% reduction in cellular metabolic activity (Fig. 6). This marked reduction in metabolic activity (associated with cellular viability) was coupled to changes in microtubule organization observed 4 h after the addition of ZnCl2 (Fig. 7). NAP added together with ZnCl2 at concentrations ranging from 10-15 to 10-10m protected completely against ZnCl2 intoxication (Fig. 6, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the cellular microtubule network assumed the same organization when NAP was added in the presence or in the absence of ZnCl2 (Fig. 7). Cell counts 4 h after the addition of NAP or ZnCl2, or both, showed that of 100 astrocytes treated with ZnCl2, 73 showed condensed tubulin structures as depicted in Fig. 7. In contrast, all the NAP-treated cells showed organized microtubular structures, and of 101 cells treated with ZnCl2 and NAP, 72 cells showed organized microtubular structures as depicted in Fig. 7.Fig. 7NAP protects astrocytes against zinc-associated microtubule rearrangement. Two-week-old astrocyte cultures were co-treated with ZnCl2 (150 μM) and NAP (10-15m) for 4 h. Cells were then subjected to microtubule staining as in Fig. 3. In short, tubulin was detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies (TUB2.5) (21Gozes I. Barnstable C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and secondary rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Bars, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The present report outlines a mechanism of action for the short protective peptide, NAP. Affinity chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry identified tubulin, the subunit protein of microtubules, as a major NAP-binding protein. NAP internalization into astrocytes was observed at low pH and low temperatures, suggesting cellular penetration without a classical peptide receptor. Incubation of astrocytes with NAP resulted in time-dependent microtubule reorganization. Furthermore, NAP accelerated microtubule assembly in vitro. Finally, NAP protected astrocytes against ZnCl2 toxicity, a protection that was paralleled with microtubule reorganization. Generally speaking, cellular membranes are composed of lipid-protein bilayers that are freely permeable to small, nonionic lipophilic compounds and are inherently impermeable to polar compounds, macromolecules, and therapeutic or diagnostic agents. However, protein and peptide sequences have been described that have the ability to translocate other polypeptides that are fused to them across a cell membrane. Examples include the VP22 translocation domain from herpes simplex virus and signal peptides such as the Kaposi fibroblast growth factor h region. Furthermore, toxin molecules also have the ability to transport polypeptides across cell membranes. Often, such polypeptides are composed of at least two parts (called “binary toxins”): a translocation or binding domain and a separate toxin domain. Typically, the translocation domain binds to a cellular receptor, and then the toxin is transported into the cell. Several bacterial toxins, including Clostridium perfringens ι toxin, diphtheria toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, pertussis toxin, Bacillus anthracis toxin, and pertussis adenylate cyclase, have been used in attempts to deliver peptides to the cell cytosol as internal or amino-terminal fusions (27Elliott G.

Sequence comparisons (Table I) suggest that NAP shares a remarkable structural similarity with the above mentioned variety of translocation proteins, although not necessarily with the precise translocation domain (Table I). Typically, these toxins, like NAP, act at very low concentrations (33Maxwell I.H. Glode L.M. Maxwell F. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1992; 7: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In both cases the mechanism of action may involve a nucleation process that does not require equimolar concentrations (38Ashur-Fabian O. Segal-Ruder Y. Skutelsky E. Brenneman D.E. Steingart R.

Spong C.Y. Hauser H.M. Abebe D. Pinhasov A. Golian T. Gozes I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 2004; 309: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A number of the previous studies of non-chiral effects of peptides implied membrane interaction through the formation of pores, as in the case of the antibiotics, magainin and cecropin A (35Wade D. Boman A. Wahlin B. Drain C.M. Andreu D. Boman H.G. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Another example of peptides that produced biological actions in the d- or l-form is the amyloidogenic peptide Aβ-(1–42) that is associated with Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration (36Cribbs D.H. Pike C.J. Weinstein S.L. Velazquez P. Cotman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7431-7436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Aβ-(1–40) forms cation channels in model membranes (37Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). NAP was recently shown to bind to and inhibit toxic Aβ aggregation, suggesting structural interaction between these two peptides and a chaperone action for NAP that will support the microtubule association described above (38Ashur-Fabian O. Segal-Ruder Y. Skutelsky E. Brenneman D.E. Steingart R. Giladi E. Gozes I. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct interaction between the Aβ peptide and tubulin has been suggested (39Islam K. Levy E. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 265-271PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have identified binding of antimitotic peptides to tubulin (40Hamel E. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 142-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, VP22, which can transverse membranes and which exhibits structural similarity with NAP (Table I), was shown to enhance microtubule bundling. However, VP22 is a 38,000-dalton protein, and the microtubule rearrangement domain in VP22 seems to require a big portion of this protein (41Martin A. O'Hare P. McLauchlan J. Elliott G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our findings are of importance because it has been known since the earliest electron microscopic studies of Alzheimer's disease that microtubules are decreased in number in the diseased brain as compared with the healthy brain (42Terry R.D. J. Neural. Transm. 1998; 53: 141-145Google Scholar). In the present study, we have seen an interaction with α tubulin (Fig. 2A), and acetylated α tubulin immunoreactivity has been inferred as a marker of stable microtubules (43Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Authelet M. Dayanandan R. Leroy K. Lovestone S. Octave J.N. Pradier L. Touchet N. Tremp G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 67: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Astrocytes constitute a major cell population in the brain and have been associated with neuronal survival; they function mainly as supporting cells (e.g. Refs. 1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A.

Gupta N. Kunwar S. Lawton M.T. McDermott M.W. Parsa A.T. Manuel-Garcia Verdugo J. Berger M.S. Alvarez-Buylla A.

Thus, astrocyte maintenance may constitute an importance aspect when designing therapeutic interventions against neuronal trauma and neurodegenerative diseases (48Gozes I. Divinsky I. Pilzer I. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. Spier A.D. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2003; 20: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 49Petrova P.S. Raibekas A. Pevsner J. Vigo N. Anafi M. Moore M.K. Peaire A. Shridhar V. Smith D.I. Kelly J. Durocher Y. Commissiong J.W. Prog. Brain Res. 2004; 146: 168-183PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report (50Loring J.F. Wen X. Lee J.M. Seilhamer J. Somogyi R. Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 683-695Google Scholar) suggests that Alzheimer's disease is associated with down-regulation of cytoskeletal protein synthesis and up-regulation of inflammatory response proteins. These findings are in agreement with our results suggesting a down-regulation of the macrophage/microglial marker MAC1 (18Romano J. Beni-Adani L. Nissenbaum O.L. Brenneman D.E. Shohami E. Gozes I. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2002; 18: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) after NAP treatment. In conclusion, NAP, which provides protection at femtomolar concentrations, seems to interact with the glial tubulin cytoskeleton after cellular internalization, a process which does not seem to require a conventional peptide-receptor interaction. The NAP doses required for tubulin polymerization concurred with the doses required for cellular protection against ZnCl2 intoxication that was associated with microtubule reorganization. NAP mimicked the effects observed with paclitaxel, which is also suggested as a cytoprotective agent (26Li G. Faibushevich A. Turunen B.J. Yoon S.O. Georg G. Michaelis M.L. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 347-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 51Moscarello M.A. Mak B. Nguyen T.A. Wood D.D. Mastronardi F. Ludwin S.K. Mult. Scler. 2002; 8: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neurosteroids (pregnenolone) are suggested to offer cytoprotection through interaction with the neural microtubule-associated protein type 2 and to increase both the rate and extent of tubulin polymerization (44Plassart-Schiess E. Baulieu E.E. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 37: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because the tubulin cytoskeleton is a key component of the maintenance and stability of the nervous tissue, the results presented above explain in part the breadth and potency of the protective effect of NAP.

AD is associated with cortical neuronal loss with gliosis, synaptic dysfunction, and widespread senile plaques consisting of amyloid β and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Substantial evidence has demonstrated that cortical neurons and glial cells undergo apoptotic cell death in AD (1Kitamura Y. Shimohama S. Kamoshima W. Matsuoka Y. Nomura Y. Taniguchi T. Biochem.

The wild type WOX1 (46 kDa) possesses two NH2-terminal WW domains (containing conserved tryptophan residues), a nuclear localization sequence, and a COOH-terminal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (ADH/SDR) domain. The WW domain sequence is conserved. A mitochondria-targeting region has been identified in the ADH/SDR domain of WOX1, and a portion of cytosolic WOX1 is present in the mitochondria (7Chang N.-S.

Human WWOX gene, encoding the WWOX/FOR/WOX1 family proteins, has been mapped to a fragile site on chromosome 16q23.2 (for reviews, see Refs. 8Richards R.I.

Approximately 50% of loss of heterozygosity of this gene is found in breast, prostate, lung, and esophageal squamous carcinomas.

Nonetheless the protein level of WOX1 is significantly increased in several cancers, raising the question whether WOX1 can act as a tumor suppressor (15Watanabe A. Hippo Y. Taniguchi H. Iwanari H. Yashiro M. Hirakawa K. Kodama T. Aburatani H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8629-8633PubMed Google Scholar). The role of WOX1 in regulating the development and function of neural cells is largely unknown. Our recent study demonstrated that WOX1 is likely to play a role in the developing nervous system (16Chen S.T. Chuang J.I. Wang J.P. Tsai M.S. Li H. Chang N.-S. Neuroscience. 2004; 124: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). WOX1 is differentially expressed during various stages of brain development in mice. Most interestingly, high levels of WOX1 expression are observed in the neural crest-derived structures such as cranial and spinal ganglia, skin pigment cells, and mesenchyme in the head, indicating a potential role of WOX1 in promoting neuronal differentiation and maturation. Compared with cognitive normal age-matched controls, we demonstrated here that the protein levels of WOX1, its isoform WOX2 (17Ried K. Finnis M. Hobson L. Mangelsdorf M. Dayan S. Nancarrow J.K.

To examine whether down-regulation of WOX1 is essential for Tau phosphorylation in AD, we determined that suppression of WOX1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) spontaneously induced phosphorylation of Tau at Thr212/Thr231 and Ser515/Ser516, phosphorylation of GSK-3β and ERK, and NFT formation in neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and L929 fibroblasts. Anisomycin, an activator of JNK1, also induced Tau phosphorylation at Thr212/Thr231 and Ser515/Ser516. SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) and PD-98059 (an MEK1/2 inhibitor) blocked the Tau phosphorylation and NFT formation, indicating that JNK1 and ERK induce Tau phosphorylation and NFT formation in the WOX1 knock-down cells. To further establish the underlying mechanism, we showed that WOX1 colocalized with JNK1, GSK-3β, and Tau in the hippocampal neurons. 17β-Estradiol (E2), an estrogen, enhanced the binding of WOX1 with phosphorylated Tau.

Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is a pan antibody that interacts with the wild type murine, rat, and human WOX1 and other WOX family proteins possessing an intact NH2-terminal WW domain. Antibodies were also generated against the unique COOH termini of human WOX1 (amino acids 397–414, NH2-LWALSERLIQERLGSQSG-COOH) and human WOX2 (also known as FOR1, amino acids 353–363, NH2-VSDCLVEGGHF-COOH). Additionally antibody production against a synthetic peptide, NH-CKDGWVYPYANHTEEKT-COOH (where PY is phosphotyrosine), was performed as described previously (10Chang N.-S. Doherty J. Ensign A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9195-9202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Additional antibodies used were against the following: 1) human p53, JNK1, Tau, phosphorylated Tau (Ser515/Ser516), GSK-3β, and phosphorylated GSK-3β (Tyr216) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies); 2) human PHF-Tau with Alzheimer-specific epitope of AT100 (Thr212/Ser214) (Pierce); 3) β-tubulin (used in the Sze laboratory, Roche Applied Science); 4) β-actin (used in the Pugazhenthi laboratory, Roche Applied Science); and 4) α-tubulin (used in the Chang laboratory, Accurate Chemicals). A sampler pack of antibodies against Tau was from BIOSOURCE that included a Tau pan antibody, an NFT antibody, and 11 antibodies for site-specific phosphorylation in the human Tau (Thr(P)181, Ser(P)202, Thr(P)205, Thr(P)212, Ser(P)214, Thr(P)231, Ser(P)262, Ser(P)396, Ser(P)404, Ser(P)409, and Ser(P)422). Autopsy Brain Samples—Eight frozen hippocampi of postmortem brains were from clinically and pathologically confirmed AD patients (mean age, 79 years; postmortem delay: range, 6–16 h; mean, 11 h). Control samples were eight age-matched subjects (mean age, 74 years; postmortem delay: range, 3–16 h; mean, 8 h) without evidence of clinical or brain pathology. These materials were from the Brain Bank at the Department of Pathology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. The diagnoses of AD were formulated based on the criteria from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (30Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Brownlee L.M. Vogel F.S. Hughes J.P. Van Belle G. Berg L. Neurology. 1991; 41: 479-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—The above mentioned hippocampal tissues were formalin-fixed and paraffin-imbedded. The blocks were sectioned (5 μm) and mounted on plus slides. The tissues were deparaffinized and hydrated through serial ethanol solutions and finally in distilled water. The hydrated tissue sections were steamed in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 30 min for antigen retrieval followed by treatment with 1% hydrogen peroxide (10 min) and blocking with 5% horse serum (1 h) at room temperature. The tissue sections were incubated with aliquots of antibodies (1:200 final dilution) against WOX1, WOX2, and p-WOX1, respectively, in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight. Aliquots of biotinylated secondary antibodies were then added. Color development was performed using a labeled streptavidin biotin plus horseradish peroxidase kit (Dako). In negative controls, tissue sections were stained with aliquots of prebled rabbit sera. Where indicated, synthetic peptides (100 μm) were premixed with the above mentioned antisera (5 min at room temperature) prior to immunostaining. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—In some experiments, the hippocampal tissues were stained with antibodies against JNK1 (rabbit antibody) and/or Tau (goat antibody) followed by addition of secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red-conjugated anti-goat IgG (7Chang N.-S.

The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Calbiochem). The slides were examined by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (7Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L.

Where indicated, other antibodies were used in dual immunostaining. Western Blotting—A 2- or 4-mm Acu-Punch (Acuderm) was used to obtain hippocampal tissues (100–200 mg) from frozen postmortem brain slabs. The tissues had been stored at -80 °C and then warmed to -20 °C overnight prior to sampling. These samples were Dounce-extracted in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove debris as described previously (31Pugazhenthi S. Nesterova A. Sables C. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Heasley L.E. Reusch J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10761-10766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The samples (50 μg/lane) were quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotting, and Western blotting as described previously (31Pugazhenthi S. Nesterova A.

Scanning and quantification were performed using BioRad Fluor-S™ MultiImager and Quantity One software. The extent of protein expression was expressed as relative OD as determined by comparing the density and area of an immunoreactive band in each lane with those of control lanes in the same blot. The data were assessed by Student's t test and Spearman correlation procedure. Co-immunoprecipitation—Where indicated, L929 or other cells treated with or without E2 were extracted using a cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction kit (Pierce) (7Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J.

Mammalian Expression Constructs—Murine GFP-WOX1 (in pEGFP-C1, Clontech) was made as described previously (7Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol.

The coding sequence of the ADH/SDR domain in WOX1, designated GFP-WOX1adh, was also constructed in pEGFP-C1. COS7 or the indicated cells were electroporated with these cDNA constructs or the “empty” pEGFP-C1 vector as controls. Protein expression was examined by fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting (7Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol.

Alternatively liposome-based Fu-GENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or GeneFector (Venn Nova) was used for transferring cDNA constructs into cells (7Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Chang N.-S. Doherty J. Ensign A. J. Biol.

Cytoplasmic Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Ras rescue-based yeast two-hybrid analysis (CytoTrap, Stratagene) was performed as described previously (7Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Chang N.-S. Doherty J. Ensign A. J. Biol.

Briefly binding of a cytosolic Sos-tagged bait protein to a cell membrane-anchored target protein (tagged with a myristoylation signal) activates the Ras signaling pathway in yeast. This activation allows mutant yeast cdc25H to grow in 37 °C using a selective agarose plate containing galactose. Without binding, yeast cells fail to grow at 37 °C. Constructs (in pSos vector) used as baits were as follows: 1) a murine full-length WOX1, 2) an NH2-terminal WW domain area of WOX1, 3) a COOH-terminal ADH/SDR domain area of WOX1, and 4) a Y33R mutant in the WW domain area (for the above constructs as baits) (7Chang N.-S.

For target, a construct for human Tau, with three repeats of a microtubule-binding domain (GenBank™ accession number BC000558), was made in pMyr vector. Additional constructs for the binding experiments were human p53 (in pMyr) and MafB (in both pMyr and pSos) (7Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). siRNA-targeting WOX1—A retroviral siRNA expression construct for targeting human WOX1 was made (in pSupressorRetro) using a Gene-Suppressor construction kit from Imgenex. The synthetic primers (MWG Biotech) for making the expression construct were as follows: 1) forward, 5′-TCGAGCCAAGTCCATGCAACAGGGGAGTACTGCCCTGTTGCATGGACTTT, and 2) reverse, 5′-CTAGAAAAACCAAGTCCATGCACAGGGCAGTACTCCCCTGTTGCATGGACTTGGC. The resulting siRNA targets a sequence at the 3′ end of WOX1 mRNA. An empty vector was used as a control. Production of retrovirus and transfection to target cells were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A similar construct was made using a mammalian expression plasmid, pSuppressorNeo, from Imgenex. Also, a negative control vector with a scrambled sequence was from Imgenex. In addition, we selected a conserved sequence region at the WW domain of WOX1 for siRNA targeting. This sequence is identical in human, mouse, and zebrafish. Synthetic primers for making the WOX1si construct (in pSuppressorNeo) were as follows: forward, 5′-TCGAGCCAAGTCCATGCACAGGGGAGTACTGCCCTGTTGCATGGACTTGGTTTTT, and reverse, 5′-CTAGAAAAACCAAGTCCATGCACAGGGCAGTACTCCCCTGTTGCATGGACTTGGC. Where indicated, L929 and SK-N-SH cells were transfected with these constructs by electroporation. Stable transfectants were selected using G418 (300 μg/ml) during 2–3 weeks in culture (7Chang N.-S.

Down-regulation of WOX1, p-WOX1, and WOX2 in the Hippocampal Neurons and Extracts of AD Brains—As determined by immunohistochemistry, WOX1 is present mainly in the perinuclear areas of both healthy and degenerative neurons from an AD hippocampus (Fig. 1A). Degenerative neurons possess cytoplasmic NFTs and/or granulovacuolar degeneration (Fig. 1A). Compared with healthy neurons, these degenerative neurons have reduced levels of WOX1. Similarly dystrophic neuritic plaques, an important diagnostic feature for AD, were weakly immunoreactive to WOX1 antibodies (Fig. 1A). Compared with normal controls, down-regulation of WOX1 was observed in the hippocampal neurons in AD (Fig. 1B). The results were observed using antibodies against the unique COOH terminus of human WOX1 (Fig. 1B). The full-length WOX1 (46 kDa) is the major species found in tissues and cultured cells compared with other members of the WWOX/FOR/WOX1 protein family (7Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L.

https://openalex.org/W2117136455,"Cross-communication between the Met receptor tyrosine kinase and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been proposed to involve direct association of both receptors and EGFR kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that in human hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma cells the Met receptor becomes tyrosine phosphorylated not only upon EGF stimulation but also in response to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists. Whereas specific inhibition of the EGFR kinase activity blocked EGF- but not GPCR agonist-induced Met receptor transactivation, it was abrogated in the presence of a reducing agent or treatment of cells with a NADPH oxidase inhibitor. Both GPCR ligands and EGF are further shown to increase the level of reactive oxygen species within the cell. Interestingly, stimulation of the Met receptor by either GPCR agonists, EGF or its cognate ligand HGF, resulted in release of Met-associated β-catenin and in its Met-dependent translocation into the nucleus, as analyzed by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the Met receptor. Our results provide a new molecular explanation for cell surface receptor cross-talk involving the Met receptor and thereby link the wide diversity of GPCRs and the EGFR to the oncogenic potential of Met signaling in human carcinoma cells.

Ponzetto C. Di Renzo M.F. Cooper C.S. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It has been originally discovered as the product of a human oncogene, tpr-met (2Cooper C.S. Park M. Blair D.G. Tainsky M.A. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1984; 311: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 3Park M. Dean M. Kaul K. Braun M.J. Gonda M.A. Vande Woude G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6379-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and since then has been recognized as a key mediator of invasive growth in both physiological but also pathophysiological signaling. Stimulation by its cognate ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor induces various biological responses such as cell dissociation, migration, cell scattering, and invasion, but also stimulates cell proliferation or survival depending on the cellular context (4Trusolino L. Comoglio P.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 5Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Whereas Met exerts essential developmental functions (6Birchmeier C. Gherardi E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), deregulated Met receptor signaling because of overexpression, mutation, or autocrine growth factor loops has been frequently implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis (4Trusolino L. Comoglio P.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) of tumor cells. The Met RTK consists of a single membrane spanning β-subunit of 145 kDa, which is linked by disulfide bridges to an extracellular α-chain of 50 kDa (1Giordano S. Ponzetto C. Di Renzo M.F. Cooper C.S. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Upon HGF stimulation two receptor molecules dimerize and cross-phosphorylate each other, thereby creating binding sites for signaling molecules within the cell. By recruiting adaptor proteins such as Gab1 and Grb2 the Met receptor induces activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, phospholipase-γ, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription factors. Moreover, receptor-associated β-catenin was identified as a signaling partner of the Met receptor (7Monga S.P. Mars W.M. Pediaditakis P. Bell A. Mule K. Bowen W.C. Wang X. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2064-2071PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hiscox S. Jiang W.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the cell, β-catenin exerts a dual function: it allows tight intercellular adhesion, as a member of cell adherence junctions, linking E-cadherin to the cytoskeleton (9Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and it translocates into the nucleus to induce gene expression in complex with the transcription factor TCF upon activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway. Independent of Wnt signaling HGF is able to induce β-catenin phosphorylation (10Hiscox S. Jiang W.G. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 509-517PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), leading to dissociation of the Met-β-catenin complex, nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and concomitant induction of TCF target genes (7Monga S.P.

Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between cell surface receptors can occur in several different ways. The most direct mechanism is receptor heterodimerization that is well described for members of the EGFR family (13Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar) or for Met and its relative RON (14Follenzi A. Bakovic S. Gual P. Stella M.C. Longati P. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Also less related receptors have been shown to be able to associate such as EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (15Saito Y. Haendeler J. Hojo Y. Yamamoto K. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6387-6394Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or Met and semaphorin receptors (16Giordano S. Corso S. Conrotto P. Artigiani S. Gilestro G. Barberis D. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In the case of EGFR and Met receptor cross-communication has been reported to occur on different levels: EGFR signal transactivation induces metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding of Met (17Nath D. Williamson N.J. Jarvis R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and aberrant EGFR activation elevates Met expression and phosphorylation in thyroid carcinoma cells (18Bergstrom J.D. Westermark B. Heldin N.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, EGFR function has been implicated in HGF-induced hepatocyte proliferation (19Scheving L.A. Stevenson M.C. Taylormoore J.M. Traxler P. Russell W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a possible heterodimer formation of both receptors has been suggested (20Jo M. Stolz D.B. Esplen J.E. Dorko K.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1640-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to RTK cross-talk, also completely unrelated cell surface receptors are able to communicate and influence each other. The prototype for such a pathway is the GPCR-induced EGFR signal transactivation (22Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with GPCR agonists induces phosphorylation of the EGFR by metalloprotease-dependent release of EGF-like ligands (23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), thereby coupling GPCRs to EGFR characteristic downstream signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinases or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (24Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6329-6336PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the EGFR other RTKs have been shown to be activated in response to GPCR stimulation, comprising the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (25Rao G.N. Delafontaine P. Runge M.S. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2028-2032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Receptor cross-talk can also occur in a ligand-independent manner involving for instance, non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-Src (26Lee F.S. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ROS-mediated inhibition of phosphatases results in an equilibrium shift from the non-phosphorylated to the phosphorylated state of the RTK. An increase in ROS levels has been reported not only after RTK but also in response to GPCR stimulation in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (36Patterson C. Ruef J. Madamanchi N.R.

Interestingly, elevated ROS levels have been associated with the malignant phenotype (38Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar). Although various cellular sources for ROS have been described (39Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), plasma membrane-associated NADPH oxidases are considered as the main source of ROS acutely produced upon growth factor or cytokine stimulation (34.Rhee, S.

Overexpression of the murine homologue of the NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit was able to induce transformation of NIH-3T3 cells (42Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of NADPH oxidase 1 induced tumor formation in mice (43Arnold R.S. Shi J. Murad E. Whalen A.M. Sun C.Q. Polavarapu R. Parthasarathy S. Petros J.A. Lambeth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, we investigated whether and how GPCRs and EGFR could transactivate the proto-oncogenic Met RTK. Our results provide evidence that the Met receptor is transactivated by both GPCRs and EGFR in pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. This transactivation process involves the acute production of ROS by membrane-bound NADPH oxidases. Interestingly, β-catenin dissociates from transactivated Met receptor and subsequently translocates into the nucleus, an event previously shown to be associated with increased TCF target gene expression and cell motility. Reagents—Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), bradykinin, thrombin, and carbachol were purchased from Sigma. The inhibitors tyrphostin AG1478, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and diphenyleneiodonium chloride were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. Toxin B and HGF were from Calbiochem. The fluorescent dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture—All cell lines were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The pancreatic carcinoma cell line DAN-G was cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and l-glutamine, HepG2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and l-glutamine, and HuH7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), sodium pyruvate, and l-glutamine. Cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and serum-starved for 24 h prior to stimulation. Protein Analysis—Prior to lysis, cells grown to 80% confluence were treated with inhibitors and agonists as indicated in the figure legends and then lysed for 10 min on ice in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated using the respective antibodies and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with 0.5 ml of HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Na4P2O7), suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blots were performed according to standard methods. The antibody against human EGFR (108.1) has been characterized before (23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Met was precipitated using the polyclonal C-28 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphotyrosine was detected with the 4G10 monoclonal antibody (Ubi). β-Catenin was detected with a monoclonal antibody purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Data shown are representative for three independent experiments. Quantification was done using the Fuji LAS1000 imaging system. Detection of ROS by Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and grown for 48 h. Prior to stimulation cells were preincubated with 20 μm DCF-DA for 30 min and subsequently stimulated as indicated for 15 min. After trypsinization, cells were centrifuged at 800 × g and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with propidium iodide. Cells were immediately analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACS-calibur flow cytometer. Differential Detergent Fractionation—Differential detergent fractionation was carried out as described before (60Ramsby M.L. Makowski G.S. Khairallah E.A. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. Following stimulation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and a cytosolicenriched fraction was obtained using a digitonin buffer (0.01% digitonin, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA) and centrifugation at 480 × g. The supernatant was carefully removed as the cytosolic-enriched fraction. The membrane-enriched fraction was obtained by resuspending the pellet in Triton X-100 buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3mm EDTA), centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, and careful removal of the supernatant. The pellet obtained was resuspended in Tween 40/DOC buffer (1% Tween 40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2). To break up nuclei, 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer were applied followed by ultrasonication and centrifugation at 6780 × g. The supernatant was collected as the nuclei-enriched fraction. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were subjected to gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. MET Modulation—MET expression was down-modulated by siRNA using the oligo ACUCUAGAUGCUCAGACUUTT cloned in a lentiviral vector under the control of the H1 promoter. Infections were performed as described (61De Palma M. Naldini L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 346: 514-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a negative control, cells were infected with a lentivirus containing the same oligo mutated in three bases (AGUCUACAUGCUCACACUU) or an oligo specific for GFP sequences. After infection, cells were kept in culture for 72 h and then extracted with boiling Laemmli buffer. Equal amounts of proteins (evaluated by BCA; Pierce) were loaded in each lane. Blots were probed with antibodies to human MET (C12, Santa Cruz). Statistical Analysis—For statistical analysis, Student's t test was used to compare data between two groups. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. GPCR and EGFR Stimulation Induce Met Receptor Phosphorylation—Because we were interested in investigating whether the Met receptor can function as a downstream signaling partner of different membrane receptors, therefore acting as a point of convergence for heterogeneous signaling pathways, we used immunoblot analysis to assess the phosphorylation state of this receptor in response to treatment with different GPCR agonists. As shown in Fig. 1, Met receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was rapidly induced in response to different GPCR ligands in the pancreatic carcinoma cell line DAN-G as well as in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2 and HuH7 (Fig. 1A). This activation occurred within 3 min and declined after 7–15 min as shown for DAN-G and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B), demonstrating a rapid and transient transactivation of the Met receptor. Interestingly, not only GPCR ligands but also EGF induced stimulation of the Met receptor (Fig. 1A). Met phosphorylation observed in these conditions was similar in terms of intensity and timing to that elicited on stimulation with 4 ng/ml HGF (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2GPCR-induced Met transactivation is independent of EGFR kinase activity. A and B, DAN-G and HepG2 cells were pretreated with AG1478 (250 nm) or an equal volume of empty vehicle (Me2SO) for 20 min and subsequently stimulated with LPA (10 μm), Thr (2 units/ml), EGF (4 ng/ml), or HGF (4 ng/ml) as positive controls for 3 min. Following immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with anti-Met antibody, proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and reprobed with anti-Met antibody. EGFR phosphorylation content was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with anti-EGFR antibody and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. The same filters were reprobed with anti-EGFR antibody. Quantification of DAN-G immunoblots was carried out using the Fuji LAS1000 imaging system. *, p < 0.01 for stimulation versus control; **, p < 0.05 for inhibition versus stimulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GPCR-induced Met Transactivation Is Independent from EGFR Kinase Activity—The so far best characterized receptor cross-talk mechanism is GPCR-induced EGFR signal transactivation. The mechanism was shown to involve the protease-dependent shedding of an EGF-like ligand precursor. As previous reports have described the association between Met and EGFR and the phosphorylation of Met by the EGFR (20Jo M. Stolz D.B. Esplen J.E. Dorko K. Michalopoulos G.K. Strom S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8806-8811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 21Pai R. Nakamura T. Moon W.S. Tarnawski A.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1640-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we addressed the question whether GPCR-Met transactivation requires EGFR kinase activity. If so, the Met receptor would behave as a direct signaling partner of the EGFR. To address this question we used the EGFR kinase-specific inhibitor AG1478 to block EGFR-dependent phosphorylation events. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, pretreatment of cells with AG1478 blocked GPCR-induced EGFR signal transactivation (22Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) but did not affect GPCR agonist-induced phosphorylation of the Met receptor. This finding implicates that EGFR activity is dispensable for GPCR-induced Met receptor transactivation (Fig. 2, A and B). As expected, Met transactivation by EGF was abrogated by preincubation with AG1478 (Fig. 2, A and B), as the EGFR kinase is mandatory to transmit the EGF-stimulated signal, regardless of direct association or an indirect communication with the Met receptor. In contrast to the report by Jo and colleagues (20Jo M. Stolz D.B. Esplen J.E. Dorko K. Michalopoulos G.K. Strom S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8806-8811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) we were unable to detect direct binding between Met and EGFR in hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma cells (data not shown). GPCR- and EGF-stimulated ROS Production in Carcinoma Cell Lines—Inactivation of tyrosine phosphatases by growth factor-induced production of ROS has been suggested to account for the activation of RTKs (31Bae Y.S.

Because Met receptor transactivation occurred rapidly and transiently, we asked whether Met receptor activation is mediated by a transient increase of ROS levels. We used the fluorescence dye DCF-DA to detect ROS production. DCF-DA is a membranepermeable non-fluorescent compound, which is de-esterified inside the cell. Subsequent oxidation of dichlorofluorescein generates the fluorescent dye itself. Flow cytometric analysis of cells treated with DCF-DA and subsequent stimulation with EGF or the GPCR ligands LPA and thrombin clearly demonstrated an increase of reactive oxygen species within the cell (Fig. 3, A and B). Further preincubation of DAN-G and HepG2 cells with the reducing agent EGCG interfered with EGF- and GPCR-induced Met receptor phosphorylation, underlining the involvement of ROS in this signaling pathway. On the other hand, EGCG treatment did not affect EGFR signal transactivation (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that ROS are critically involved in Met receptor transactivation. Met Receptor Transactivation Requires NADPH Oxidase Activity—Recent lines of research implicated membrane-bound NADPH oxidases in the growth factor stimulated production of ROS (reviewed in Refs. 34.Rhee, S. G., Bae, Y. S., Lee, S. R., and Kwon, J. (2000)http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/53/PE1,Google Scholar, 41Finkel T. Curr. Opin.

To investigate whether these NADPH oxidase enzymes are involved in Met receptor transactivation, we used the NADPH oxidase-specific inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride to interfere with NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production and analyzed Met receptor phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, block-ade of NADPH oxidase function interfered with both GPCR- and EGF-induced Met phosphorylation in HepG2 and DAN-G cells, whereas EGFR signal transactivation by GPCRs was not affected by diphenyleneiodonium chloride treatment (Fig. 5, A and B). The small GTPase Rac has been demonstrated to be one of the cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex and has been implicated in the regulation of NADPH oxidases activity (46Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rac has been shown as a downstream signaling target of both GPCRs and RTKs. Therefore we used the bacterial Toxin B, which specifically blocks GTPases of the Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 families, to interfere with Rac function (47Schiavo G. van der Goot F.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Indeed, preincubation with Toxin B abrogated both GPCR- and EGF-induced Met transactivation (Fig. 5, C and D, upper panel), whereas EGFR signal transactivation was not influenced (Fig. 5, C and D, lower panel). Together, these data suggest that NADPH oxidase activity is indeed required for Met transactivation. Met Transactivation Induces Dissociation of the β-Catenin-Met Receptor Complex in HuH7 and DAN-G Cells—β-Catenin has been shown to be constitutively associated with the Met receptor in hepatoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (8Hiscox S. Jiang W.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 48Herynk M.H. Tsan R. Radinsky R. Gallick G.E. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2003; 20: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Met from untreated HuH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells co-precipitated constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated β-catenin (Fig. 6A). Stimulation of Met transactivation by both GPCR ligands and EGF induced the dissociation of this β-catenin-Met receptor complex ("

Three and five novel first exons were identified in human and mouse ACHE genes, respectively. Reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization validated most of the predicted transcripts, and sequence analyses of the corresponding genomic DNA regions suggest evolutionarily conserved promoters for each of the novel exons identified. Distinct tissue specificity and stress-related expression patterns of these exons predict combinatorial complexity with known 3′ alternative AChE mRNA transcripts. Unexpectedly one of the 5′ exons encodes an extended N terminus in-frame with the known AChE sequence, extending the increased complexity to the protein level. The resultant membrane variant(s), designated N-AChE, is developmentally regulated in human brain neurons and blood mononuclear cells. Alternative promoter usage combined with alternative splicing may thus lead to stress-dependent combinatorial complexity of AChE mRNA transcripts and their protein products.

Alternative promoter usage combined with alternative splicing may thus lead to stress-dependent combinatorial complexity of AChE mRNA transcripts and their protein products. Alternative splicing and alternate promoter usage both expand the complexity of gene products. While the massive contribution of alternative splicing to such expansion is widely recognized (1Graveley B.R. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), less is known about the scope and significance of alternate promoter usage. Moreover the directionality of transcription processes raises the yet unresolved possibility that these two phenomena are inter-related, namely that the choice of the first exon determines downstream splice choices (2Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The recent accumulation of genomic and gene expression data bases together with the development of sophisticated bioinformatic tools makes these questions amenable for experimental analysis as multiple gene products display both alternate promoter usage and alternative splicing variations.

Resch A. Grasso C. Lee C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2850-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 4Xie H. Zhu W.Y. Wasserman A. Grebinskiy V. Olson A. Mintz L. Genomics. 2002; 80: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, EST data bases are biased toward the 3′ end of mRNAs and occasionally contain genomic contaminations that may cause misinterpretation of the genomic information (5Sorek R. Safer H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To correctly evaluate the inter-relationship between alternate promoter usage and alternative splicing, it is therefore necessary to characterize the identified variants using traditional molecular biology tools at the RNA level and, if applicable, at the protein level as well. The acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) provides an adequate example for such a study. AChE pre-mRNA is subject to stimulus-induced 3′ alternative splicing (6Meshorer E. Erb C. Gazit R. Pavlovsky L. Kaufer D. Friedman A. Glick D. Ben-Arie N. Soreq H. Science. 2002; 295: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and previous evidence has suggested that it is also subject to alternate promoter usage (7Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Atanasova E. Chiappa S. Wieben E. Brimijoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We analyzed the genomic regions flanking the human and mouse ACHE genes and found an unexpected, evolutionarily conserved diversity of alternate exons at their 5′ end. The newly identified exons are stress- and glucocorticoid-regulated and show no apparent connection to the 3′ splice variations. One of these new exons was further found to initiate an N-terminal extension to the canonic AChE protein, enabling a combinatorial complexity of developmentally controlled human membrane AChE protein variant(s). Our findings highlight independent yet inter-related expansions of ACHE gene products by 5′ and 3′ variations in AChE mRNA. Human Tissues—The use of human embryos, cord blood, and adult tissues in this study was approved by the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Ethics Committee according to the regulations of the Helsinki accords. Tissue samples from spontaneously aborted human fetuses at different ages (16, 25, and 34 gestational weeks) were transferred immediately to 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sliced (7 μm). Fresh samples of umbilical cord blood cells were obtained following normal deliveries. Adult human brain samples were collected within 4 h postmortem from a 70-year-old patient with cardiac arrhythmia. Tissues were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Brain homogenates (in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 1% Triton X-100) were immunoblotted using standard procedures. Animals—Central nervous system-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mutants (GRNesCre), control littermates (GRLoxP/LoxP) (9Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schutz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), and FVB/N male mice were kept under a 12-h dark/12-h light diurnal schedule with food and water ad libitum. Stress experiments included a 30-min immobilization in 50-ml conical tubes. Mice were sacrificed by decapitation 2 h after immobilization, and brains were dissected on ice, frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, sliced to 5-7-μm sections, and collected by adhesion to Superfrost®-Plus slides (Menzel-Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany). For all experiments, naïve age-matched males served as controls. These experiments were approved by the animal committee in the Hebrew University. Computational Resources—The human (GenBank™ accession number AF002993) and mouse (GenBank™ accession number AF312033) ACHE loci were analyzed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information for access to the GenBank™ as well as to Blast, Entrez, Locus Link, Structure, Protein, and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) data base resources. Expert Protein Analysis System at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics was used for access to a variety of data manipulation programs and protein data bases. The Baylor College of Medicine Search Launcher 2See searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu. served for data manipulation and to derive display programs. The MatInspector program at Genomatix or the Cister software 3See zlab.bu.edu/~mfrith/cister.shtml. was used to find transcription factor binding sites. RNA Extraction and cDNA Preparation—Total RNA was extracted from animal and human tissues using the EZ-RNA total RNA isolation kit (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) as instructed, diluted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a concentration of 100 ng/μl, and stored at -70 °C until use. Human RNA from leukemic T-lymphocytes, liver, and testis was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Super-Script reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used with either poly(dT) or random hexamers. Gene-specific primers (see below) were used for one-step RT-PCR (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)—Paraffin-embedded sections (mouse horizontal whole brain sections or human sagittal sections from whole embryos or human adult prefrontal cortex) were subjected to deparaffination with xylene (two 5-min washes) followed by decreasing ethanol washes (100, 75, 50, and 25%) and then a wash in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 and incubation with 10 mg/ml proteinase K (8 min at room temperature). Hybridization in a humidified chamber involved 10 mg/ml probe (in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 10 mg/ml tRNA, 10 mg/ml heparin for 90 min at 52 °C). Sections were then washed twice at 60 °C with 50% formamide, 5× SSC, and 0.5% SDS; twice in 50% formamide, 2× SSC at 60 °C; and twice in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature and then blocked in 1% skim milk (Bio-Rad) for 30 min. Biotin-labeled probes (see Supplemental Table I) were detected by incubating sections with streptavidin-Cy3 conjugates (CyDye™, Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min followed by three washes in TBST. Sections were mounted with IMMU-MOUNT (Shandon Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Polymerase Chain Reaction—PCR was used for detecting different transcripts in various tissues and to confirm sequences. The PCR mixture contained 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma), deoxynucleotide mixture (0.2 mm each) (Sigma), forward/reverse primers (see Supplemental Table II, 0.5 μm each), and 300 ng of template (cDNA or genomic DNA). Each of the 35 cycles included denaturation (1 min at 95 °C), annealing (1 min at 60 °C), and elongation (72 °C at 1 min). Antibodies—High affinity polyclonal rabbit IgG antibodies against the human hE1d-encoded N-terminal domain were custom-made (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Two 16-amino acid residue peptides from the coding sequence of human exon hE1d (hN-AChE) were synthesized (KVRSHPSGNQHRPTRG and GSRSFHCRRGVRPRPA), mixed, and injected together into two rabbits. Additional boost injections were given at 2, 4, and 8 weeks thereafter. Final bleeding was carried out after week 16. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening with the synthetic peptides served to identify successful antibody production. The synthetic peptides were further used for affinity purification of the antibodies. Dilutions of 1:500 of the affinity-purified antiserum were used for Western blotting. Flow Cytometry—Mononuclear fractions of cord blood cells were separated by FACS lysing solution (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:100 in double-distilled water, 12-min incubation). Cells were either stained directly with phycoerythrin-conjugated CD34 (BD Biosciences), allophycocyanine-conjugated CD3 (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), allophycocyanine-conjugated CD19 (BD Biosciences), peridinin chlorophyll protein-conjugated CD45 (BD Biosciences), and phycoerythrin-conjugated interleukin 7 (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) antibodies or first permeabilized and fixed (Fix and Perm kit, Caltag; 7 min) and then stained. Isotype controls served to distinguish unspecific labeling. Rabbit anti-hN-AChE antibodies were detected on these cells using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fab antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., Westgrove, PA). Multiparameter flow cytometry was performed using the FACScalibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences) equipped with Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). hN-AChE expression was assessed in fresh CD45+ cells by analyzing 50,000 gated events. 5′ Diversity of Murine AChE mRNAs—EST data base searches using the 5′ region of the mouse (m) ACHE gene revealed the existence of five putative alternative first exons (Table I and Fig. 1A). The most proximal exon was termed mE1a. The EST clone containing this sequence (GenBank™ accession number BB606349, mouse eyeball) extends from position -787 to -680 (relative to the translational ATG start present in the mouse exon 2) and continues with exon 2 (Fig. 1, A and B), skipping over a 657-nucleotide (nt) intron (termed mouse mI1a) that possesses consensus GT-AG splice sites. RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed the existence of this transcript in the mouse cortex (GenBank™ deposit, accession number AY389982).Table IAlternative 5′ exons of mouse acetylcholinesteraseExonNumber of ESTsRepresentative EST evidencePositionaFor convenience, the - in front of all position numbers was eliminated.

Open table in a new tab A second first exon, named mE1b, was found by RT-PCR using a forward primer located in the -945 to -923 region with a reverse primer on exon 2 (see Supplemental Table II). The resulting product extends from this primer to position -733 and skips over a 710-nt intron (mI1b), which includes consensus GT-AG splice sites (Fig. 1, A and B). This exon as well was confirmed in the mouse cortex by RT-PCR and sequencing (GenBank™ deposit, accession number AY389981). Upstream to mE1b, at -1762 to -1671, we found the “classical” exon 1 (10Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), renamed here mE1c, in 18 different reported homologous EST clones (GenBank™ accession number BB639234, Table I). When this first exon is fused to exon 2, a 1648-nt intron (mI1c) that contains consensus GT-AG splice sites is spliced out. Sequencing of an RT-PCR-amplified DNA fragment confirmed the existence of mE1c in the mouse cortex. An additional mRNA transcript that contains mE1c but proceeds through the genomic sequence was named mE1c-long. Two longer ESTs indeed initiated at mE1c (GenBank™ accession numbers BB629342, adult bone, and CA327701, whole brain embryo) and extend through the entire genomic sequence to exon 2 (GenBank™ accession number AK036443, adult male bone). In these ESTs, exon 2 is fused to exon 3. Splicing of intron 2 rules out the possibility of genomic DNA contamination as the source of this mE1c-long variant. Further upstream, an alternative first exon (8Atanasova E. Chiappa S. Wieben E. Brimijoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) had previously been found at position -2271 to -1980 followed by a 1957-nt intron (mI1d). This first exon was found to be fused with exon 2. We confirmed the expression of the corresponding transcript in the prefrontal cortex by RT-PCR and sequencing. This exon was named mE1d. Two alternative splice donors that differ by 29 nucleotides were observed in the mouse cortex. We named the shorter form mE1d′ (GenBank™ deposit, accession number AY389980). Upstream from mE1d, three different putative ORFs (positions -2518 to -2402, -2925 to -2522, and -3129 to -2933) were found in a continuous reading frame with that of the classical protein. These could add 46, 142, or 73 amino acids (respectively) to the common ORF beginning at exon 2. Of these, the mE1e ORF shares 79% sequence similarity with the corresponding region in the human ACHE gene and its translated sequence (see below) and was thus regarded as a candidate. Fig. 1, A and B, depicts the different mouse 5′ exons. 5′ Diversity of Human AChE mRNAs—EST data base searches using the 5′ region of the human (h) ACHE gene revealed the existence of at least four alternative first exons (Table II). The previously identified mouse EST clone (mE1a GenBank™ accession number BB606349, see above) suggests the existence of the alternative first exon named hE1a.Table IIAlternative 5′ exons of human acetylcholinesteraseExonNumber of ESTsRepresentative EST evidencePositionaFor convenience, the - in front of all position numbers was eliminated.

Open table in a new tab The known first exon at -1681 to -1576 (relative to the translational start site ATG present in the human exon 2) (11Ben Aziz-Aloya R. Sternfeld M. Soreq H. Prog. Brain Res. 1993; 98: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) is named here hE1b (represented by EST clone GenBank™ accession number BG707892, human brain hypothalamus). A 1543-nt intron (hI1b) separates hE1b from exon 2 (position -23). We confirmed the existence of hE1b by RT-PCR and sequencing. An additional EST clone contained the genomic sequence located at position -1859 to -1824 (GenBank™ accession number BI667712, human brain hypothalamus). This putative first exon, fused to exon 2 at position -20 (ACG), was named hE1c. The corresponding 1803-nt intron (hI1c) includes donor and acceptor splice sites (GT-AG). Exon 2 starts with two optional acceptor splice sites located 3 nucleotides apart (both AG dinucleotide; Fig. 1, C and D). Therefore, when fused to hE1c, exon 2 starts at a different position than the one described previously. Our attempts to confirm the existence of this transcript failed. An additional EST clone (GenBank™ accession number BX420294, human fetal brain) contained a putative first exon located further upstream at position -2720 to -2318 (exon hE1d) fused to exon 2 at position -20. This implies the existence of a 2294-nt intron (hI1d). The existence of this mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing (GenBank™ deposit, accession number AY389977; Fig. 1, C and D). Intriguingly hE1d harbors a translation start codon (ATG, position -2495) creating a continuous reading frame with that of the classical ATG in exon 2 (12Soreq H. Ben-Aziz R. Prody C.A. Seidman S. Gnatt A. Neville L. Lieman-Hurwitz J. Lev-Lehman E. Ginzberg D. Lipidot-Lifson Y. Zakut H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9688-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), thus potentially adding 66 amino acids to the AChE protein. An additional ATG (position -2478) in the same ORF may yield a shorter 61-amino acid domain. Sequence homology with mE1e, which lacks the first ATG, suggests that the second ATG is more likely to serve as the translational start site. Putative Promoters for the Novel Exons—Using luciferase assays, Atanasova et al. (8Atanasova E. Chiappa S. Wieben E. Brimijoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated the functionality of the promoter located upstream to mE1d (referred to in their work as exon E1a). In our study, the Cister and Chip2Promoter programs enabled promoter predictions, which are shown in Fig. 2A for the murine and human ACHE genes. These programs search for regions with motif conservation predicting high probability of being transcriptionally active promoters. These are based primarily on the density of putative transcription factor binding sites. Several regions with such high probability were revealed by this search. Promoter prediction analyses of the region containing the novel alternative first exons revealed a plausible promoter for each of the newly identified exons of both the mouse and human genes (Fig. 2, A and B). The probability score of the alternative promoters was found to be similar to that of the previously described promoter (upstream to mE1b in mouse and hE1b in human), supporting the notion that they might be functionally active. A particularly high probability to function as a promoter was observed for the mouse region upstream to exon mE1a. In the human gene, we identified hE1a based on homology to the mouse mE1a. Exon hE1a is a weak candidate for being a true exon because it lacks consensus splice sites and because no ESTs were found in the entire region between exon 2 and exon hE1b in the human sequence. Intriguingly the region located upstream from hE1a displays the highest probability of functioning as a promoter (Fig. 2A), perhaps suggesting a change in function for this sequence during evolution. The Cister and the Chip2Promoter program, which does not apply to murine sequences, yielded similar predictions for human promoters. A closer look at the distribution of the transcription factor binding sites revealed that most sites are common to several of the putative alternative promoters and evolutionarily conserved in both human and mouse. Several putative DNA targets, however, were unique to one of the identified promoters. For example, a conserved binding site for the transcription factor Dlx, highly expressed during organ development (13Panganiban G. Rubenstein J.L. Development. 2002; 129: 4371-4386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was found in mP1 and hP1, and a putative binding site for transforming growth intestinal factor was found in mP2 and hP2. Of interest, three putative glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) were identified in the upstream region of the human ACHE gene (one in hP3 and one adjacent to hE1a, Fig. 2A), and one was identified in the mouse gene (mP2, Fig. 2A). It was therefore tempting to test the glucocorticoid and/or stress response of these newly identified transcripts. Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) and Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) Separate 5′ Alternative Exons from the Distal Human ACHE Promoter—On average, one might expect one SINE and one LINE for approximately every 2-3.5 kb except within the transcription unit itself (14Batzer M.A. Deininger P.L. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). A totally different outcome emerged for the currently available GenBank™ ACHE sequences (20 kb of the human, GenBank™ accession number AF002993, and 9.5 kb of mouse, GenBank™ accession number AF312033) upstream to the translation start sites of exon 2. The SINE and LINE distributions were analyzed using the Eldorado software (Genomatix) and the RepeatMasker algorithm (Baylor College of Medicine Search Launcher). The density was found to be 6-fold higher than the expected average for SINEs and almost 2-fold higher than the expected average for LINEs (Fig. 2, C and D). This leaves little room for any functional DNA in this area. In contrast, exceptionally few repeats (one and three, respectively) were found within the human and mouse 3.5-kb regions where the alternative first exons were identified, supporting a functional role for these DNA fragments in human and mouse. The closest gene upstream to ACHE is located ∼180 kb away (15Wilson M.D. Riemer C. Martindale D.W. Schnupf P. Boright A.P. Cheung T.L. Hardy D.M. Schwartz S. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Miller W. Koop B.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tissue Distribution of the Novel Exons in Mouse—Tissue distribution in mouse of the mRNAs containing the different alternative first exons was studied by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). Exon mE1a was found to be expressed in every examined brain region, including hippocampus, cortex, PFC, brainstem, and basal nuclei. Exon mE1a was also expressed in the thymus, heart, liver, intestine, and spleen but not in kidney, testis, muscle, or spinal cord. Exon mE1b was detected in most of the tissues examined with the exception of liver, intestine, and muscle. Exon mE1c was the most widely expressed. It was, however, absent from intestine. Exon mE1d was detected in the brain (hippocampus, PFC, brainstem, and basal nuclei) and heart but not spleen, thymus, intestine, or liver. While it is difficult to compare the expression levels between different RT-PCR products due to differences in primer and target efficiency, a tissue distribution analysis, as was conducted, gives a good hint of the relative expression levels of each variant in each tissue. We conclude that mE1c is the most abundant transcript due to its almost ubiquitous expression and due to its over-representation by ESTs (Table I). For comparison, we investigated in the same tissues the expression profiles of the different AChE 3′ variants. “Synaptic” AChE-S was strongly expressed in all tissues examined except for thymus, liver, and the small intestine where only weak expression was observed, similar to the expression pattern of mE1c. “Read-through” AChE-R was strongly expressed in all of the brain regions tested and in spleen. It was moderately expressed in heart, muscle, kidney, spinal cord, and liver and very poorly expressed in the testis, thymus, and intestine. “Erythrocytic” AChE-E was expressed in all of the examined brain regions as well as in heart, kidney, spinal cord, liver, spleen, and muscle. It was absent from testis, thymus, and the small intestine. Thus, none of the 5′ variants shared the same expression pattern with a single 3′ variant, suggesting that 5′ splicing patterns do not always dictate 3′ splicing in the mature mRNA. The four different 5′ and three different 3′ splice options may thus potentially yield 12 distinct transcripts. Distinct Neuronal Distributions of the 5′ Murine Exons—To achieve cellular resolution levels for the expression patterns of the novel exons, we designed 40-50-mer 5′-biotinylated fully 2′-O-methylated riboprobes for FISH (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 3B presents representative FISH profiles for mE1a, mE1b, and mE1d. These three exons all appeared to be expressed in neurons. They displayed, however, distinct cell type specificities and subcellular distributions. For example, essentially all of the deep layer neurons in the PFC displayed pronounced mE1a levels and considerably lower mE1b labeling. Exon mE1d mRNA was particularly concentrated in the uppermost layer of PFC neurons (Fig. 3B, I), suggesting distinct levels for AChE mRNA transcripts in specific subsets of PFC neurons. Whereas these differences potentially reflect probe efficiencies, they also highlight distinct expression patterns for the various alternative AChE mRNAs. Thus, hippocampal CA2 neurons within the same or adjacent sections displayed consistently low levels of all three exons (Fig. 3B, II), whereas cerebellar neurons showed differential expression of the various 5′ exons (Fig. 3B, III). Exon mE1a accumulated in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cell perikarya but was only faintly detected in other cerebellar neurons. mE1b was poorly expressed in the cerebellum, and mE1d was strongly expressed in Purkinje cells in which it was labeled in both cell bodies and axonal processes (Fig. 3B, IV and V). In addition, mE1d was transcribed in other neurons of the cerebellum, including the cells interspersed in the molecular layer. In these neurons, it displayed an asymmetric labeling pattern accompanied by neurite labeling. Granular neurons were poorly labeled with the probe for mE1d. Human hE1d AChE mRNA Expression—The tissue distribution of transcribed hE1d mRNA in several developmental stages was explored in paraffin sections from human embryos aged 16, 25, and 34 weeks. At week 16, hE1d mRNA was only weakly detected in the nervous system and was absent in the thymus. As development proceeded, hE1d expression became more pronounced with increased density of positive cells and increased labeling intensity in both the nervous system and the thymus. At week 34, up to 50 ± 10% of the neurons were positive (Fig. 4A). In contrast, as low as 2 ± 1.5% of the thymus cells were hE1d mRNA-positive at week 25, but by week 34, over 8 ± 1.5% of the cells were positive (p < 0.0005, two-tailed Student's t test). Since hE1d demonstrated a developmentally regulated expression pattern, we performed RT-PCR analysis on RNA extracted from human embryonic stem cells (16Drukker M. Katz G. Urbach A. Schuldiner M.

PKD2, the protein product of pkd2, belongs to the transient receptor potential superfamily of cation channels, and it can function as a mechanosensitive channel in the primary cilium of kidney cells, an intracellular Ca2+ release channel in the endoplasmic reticulum, and/or a nonselective cation channel in the plasma membrane. We have identified mDia1/Drf1 (mammalian Diaphanous or Diaphanous-related formin 1 protein) as a PKD2-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screen. mDia1 is a member of the RhoA GTPase-binding formin homology protein family that participates in cytoskeletal organization, cytokinesis, and signal transduction. We show that mDia1 and PKD2 interact in native and in transfected cells, and binding is mediated by the cytoplasmic C terminus of PKD2 binding to the mDia1 N terminus. The interaction is more prevalent in dividing cells in which endogenous PKD2 and mDia1 co-localize to the mitotic spindles. RNA interference experiments reveal that endogenous mDia1 knockdown in HeLa cells results in the loss of PKD2 from mitotic spindles and alters intracellular Ca2+ release. Our results suggest that mDia1 facilitates the movement of PKD2 to a centralized position during cell division and has a positive effect on intracellular Ca2+ release during mitosis. This may be important to ensure equal segregation of PKD2 to the daughter cell to maintain a necessary level of channel activity.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease affects 1 in 1,000 individuals primarily by the development of large, fluid-filled renal cysts that ultimately may lead to renal failure. Extrarenal manifestations such as cyst formation in the liver, pancreas, and spleen may also occur with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease as well as cranial aneurysms and secondary hypertension (1Martinez J.R.

The apparent function of nonmotile cilia is to act as a sensor of the extracellular environment and transmit this information to the cell body. Consistent with this idea, PKD2 has been shown to have an essential role in mediating Ca2+ entry in response to flow rate changes, suggesting that it may be part of the mechanosensing machinery residing in the primary cilium of terminally differentiated epithelial cells (10Nauli S.M.

The pool of PKD2 expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum is believed to function as an intracellular Ca2+ release channel, whereas plasma membrane-anchored PKD2 functions as a nonselective cation channel. Whereas all of these functions are likely to represent physiological functions, its role as a mechanosensor is more likely to be associated with the cystic phenotype seen in pathogenic mutants of PKD2.

Alternatively, PKD2 may have a role in cell division during development regulating the differentiation process of kidney tubular cells. Loss of PKD2 in pathogenic mutants may account for the less differentiated phenotype of cystic epithelial cells, thus indirectly affecting ciliary function. Ciliary function of PKD2 in terminally differentiated cells may be more closely related to disease progression (18Lubarsky B. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 19Boletta A. Germino G.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 484-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These findings highlight the fact that PKD2 is a multifunctional protein with several possible roles in cell physiology and kidney development; the exact mechanisms regulating these apparently divergent cellular functions and subcellular localizations are largely unknown.mDia1 (mammalian diaphanous 1) was originally identified as a RhoA-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen using activated RhoA as bait (20Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), and it was later shown to function as a downstream effector of RhoA in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization (21Nakano K.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). mDia1 is also referred to as Drf1 (diaphanous-related formin 1) because it has homology to formin, the limb deformity (ld) gene product. Formin has a proline-rich domain and a 130-amino acid region that have been named FH1 and FH2 domains, respectively (24Castrillon D.H. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3367-3377PubMed Google Scholar). A third region, the FH3 domain, is an amino-terminal domain that is the least conserved FH domain among formin family members (25Petersen J. Nielsen O. Egel R. Hagan I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Diaphanous-related formin homology proteins such as mDia1, mDia2, and yeast Bni1p contain all three FH (24Castrillon D.H. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3367-3377PubMed Google Scholar) as well as an amino terminus GTPase binding domain (RhoA binding domain) (20Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) and a carboxyl terminus interaction domain termed Dia autoregulatory domain (DAD domain) (26Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The DAD domain loops around to bind the N terminus of mDia in the RhoA GTPase binding domain to hold mDia1 in a closed and inactive state. When Rho protein binds mDia1, the DAD domain releases the N terminus to form an active mDia1 to expose its internal domains for interactions with effector molecules (27Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 26Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The FH1 domain binds profilin, an actin-binding protein (20Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), and Src homology 3 domains containing proteins such as Src (28Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and IRSp53/BAIAP2 (29Fujiwara T. Mammoto A. Kim Y. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The FH2 domain has been reported to be involved in coordinating microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton during cell movement (30Ishizaki T. Morishima Y. Okamoto M. Furuyashiki T. Kato T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). mDia1 contains a 173-amino acid region in the C terminus of its FH3 domain that is necessary for mDia1 localization to mitotic spindles in HeLa cells (31Kato T. Watanabe N. Morishima Y. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 775-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar FH3 domain function has been seen in Schizosaccharomyces pombe when FH3 domains from Fus1 or Cdc12 formin-related proteins were fused to GFP, and GFP was subsequently localized to the projection tip of mating cells. These results suggest that FH3 domains may serve to specifically localize formin-related proteins to specific subcellular sites (25Petersen J. Nielsen O. Egel R. Hagan I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The diaphanous subfamily appears to primarily function in cytokinesis and in cytoskeletal rearrangement and stabilization. Consistent with its role in actin polymerization in hair cells of the ear, naturally occurring mutations in mDia1 cause nonsyndromic deafness in humans (32Lynch E.D. Lee M.K. Morrow J.E. Welcsh P.L. Leon P.E. King M.C. Science. 1997; 278: 1315-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). mDia1 was also recently found to be essential for mechanotransduction in response to integrin activation in SV-80 human fibroblast cells (33Riveline D. Zamir E. Balaban N.Q. Schwarz U.S. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Kam Z. Geiger B. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) but is not involved in the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion in Jurkat cells (34Vicente-Manzanares M. Rey M. Perez-Martinez M. Yanez-Mo M. Sancho D. Cabrero J.R. Barreiro O. de la Fuente H. Itoh K. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Immunol. 2003; 2: 1023-1034Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In conclusion, mDia1 appears to serve several basic cellular functions ranging from mechanosensation to cytokinesis through a possible effect on cytoskeletal organization.In the present study, we identified and characterized an interaction of PKD2 and mDia1 using a yeast two-hybrid screen and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The interaction was further supported by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of the endogenous proteins in mitotic cells. RNAi experiments in mitotic HeLa cells have shown a concomitant loss of PKD2 from the mitotic spindle in cells lacking mDia1, and we have demonstrated diminished intracellular Ca2+ release in these cells. Our results suggest that a novel function of mDia1 is to bind the PKD2 channel protein possibly contained in an ER vesicle, facilitate its movement to mitotic spindles during cell division, and modulate intracellular Ca2+ release during mitosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Constructs HA-PKD2, HA-PKD2-(1-643), sIg.7, sIg.7-PKD2/Ile679-Val968, and sIg.7-PKD2/Gln743-Glu871 were previously described in Ref. 6Tsiokas L. Arnould T. Zhu C. Kim E. Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar. GFP-mDia1 and GFP-ΔN3mDia1 were obtained from Dr. Shu Narumiya. GFP-ΔC52 mDia1 was made by converting amino acid residue Gln1203 to a stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange™ (Stratagene). PKD2-myc was constructed by replacing the stop codon of human PKD2 with the sequence corresponding to a Myc epitope.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The L40 yeast strain containing both his and lacZ reporters under the control of LexA binding sites was sequentially transformed with a bait plasmid in pLexA containing a portion of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of human PKD2 (Ser851-Val968; accession number NM_00297) and a whole mouse day 9.5 embryonic library in pVP16. From 4 × 106 independent clones screened, several clones were identified that contained inserts interacting with PKD2 Ser851-Val968. All inserts were in-frame with the DNA binding domain of LexA, and their interaction with PKD2 was further verified by reintroducing the rescued plasmids back to the L40 yeast strain that was originally used in the screen.Cell Culture—LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in M199 medium, HeLa cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Madin-Darby canine kidney and IMCD cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum except LLC-PK1, which required 3% fetal bovine serum. All cell culture media were from Invitrogen. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells used for confocal microscopy were plated onto 12-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates and maintained as above. HeLa cell coverslips were coated with CellTak (BD Biosciences) per manufacturer's instructions for some confocal microscopy experiments. Cells grown for cilia staining were allowed to grow until confluent.Antibody Production and Characterization—Antibodies to PKD2 were made by generating a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein expressing amino acids Ile679-Arg742 of human PKD2 (GSTPKD2(Ile679-Arg742)). GST-PKD2(Ile679-Arg742) was injected into rabbits or chickens to generate polyclonal antisera to human PKD2. Serum antibody titers were initially determined by ELISA using a purified fragment of PKD2(Ile679-Arg742) fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) (MBP-PKD2(Ile679-Arg742)). Rabbit or chicken PKD2 antibody was affinity-purified using MBP-PKD2(Ile679-Arg742) by the Amino-Link method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Purified antibody titers were determined by ELISA using purified MBP-PKD2(Ile679-Arg742). The specificity of the antibodies was evaluated by immunoblotting lysates of transfected HEK293T cells with an expression plasmid for HA-tagged wild type PKD2 (HA-PKD2) or a truncation mutant lacking the antigenic region (HA-PKD2-(1-643)).Transient Transfection Procedures—HEK293T cells were transfected by a standard calcium transfection protocol as described previously (6Tsiokas L. Arnould T. Zhu C. Kim E. Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with Myc-PKD2 or GFP-mDia1 by Effectene (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Mitotic Spindle Preparations—Mitotic spindles from HeLa cells transfected with Myc-PKD2 or GFP mDia1 were isolated as previously reported (31Kato T. Watanabe N. Morishima Y. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 775-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated microtubules from each 15-cm dish were resuspended in 200 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and 30 μl was run on SDS-PAGE, subjected to Western blot, and probed with a polyclonal α-Myc antibody at 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal antibody to GFP at 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody at 1:5,000 (Sigma; Clone 2.1). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:10,000 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce Supersignal).Immunoprecipitation, in Vitro Binding, and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 1 ml/10-cm dish of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and protein assay (BCA; Pierce) was done on the supernatants. Co-immunoprecipitation of PKD2 and mDia1 (Transduction Laboratories) was performed in the HEK293T cleared lysate from a 15-cm dish, whereas all other co-immunoprecipitations were from a volume less than or equal to a single 10-cm dish of cleared cell lysate. GST isotype control antibody was from Santa Cruz. After an 8-h incubation with primary antibody, 30 μl of 50% slurry of Protein A- or G-agarose beads was added for 2 h to capture immune complexes. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and then mixed with Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, mDia1 antibody and rabbit affinity-purified PKD2 antibody were both used at 1:500. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:10,000 followed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection after Western blotting. Immunoprecipitations using IgG-tagged constructs (sIg.7, sIg.7-PKD2/Gln743-Glu871, or sIg.7-PKD2/Ile679-Val968) were done as described earlier (6Tsiokas L. Arnould T. Zhu C. Kim E. Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 33Riveline D. Zamir E. Balaban N.Q. Schwarz U.S. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Kam Z. Geiger B. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged mDia1 fusion proteins were detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP at 1:500.RNA Interference—To inactivate pig PKD2 in LLC-PK1 cells, we designed two PKD2-specific constructs, PKD2KD2-2 and PKD2KD2-3. PKD2KD2-2 targeted specifically porcine PKD2, whereas PKD2KD2-3 targeted both porcine and human PKD2. These constructs were made in our previously described RNAi vector, pUB/H1RNAi vector (36Ma R. Rundle D. Jacks J. Koch M. Downs T. Tsiokas L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52763-52772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Porcine PKD2 cDNA sequences were determined based on a partial pig expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank™ number BI338275). The PKD2KD2-2 sequence was 5′-gatcccccctgttctgtgtgatcaggttcaagagacctgtcacacagaacaggtttttggaaa-3′, whereas the PKD2KD2-3 sequence was 5′-gatccccccgcttggatctacacaagttcaagagacttgtgtagatccaagcggtttggaa-3′. Both sequences represent the sense strand of the double-stranded DNA cloned into pUB/H1RNAi. LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with 1.9 μg of either silencing construct, along with 0.1 μg of GFP-tubulin to indicate cells that had taken up the DNA complex and to also identify dividing cells. After 48 h, these cells were replated to coverslips for confocal microscopy.To silence human mDia1, we generated two inactivating constructs, pSUPER retro-mDia1KD1 and pSUPER-retro-mDia1KD2, in the pSUPER-retro vector (Oligoengine, Inc.). The pSUPER-retro-mDia1KD1 construct was designed to silence specifically human mDia1, whereas pSUPER-retro-mDia1KD2 was designed to silence both human and mouse mDia1. Neither of these constructs would silence mDia2 or homologous genes. The mDia1KD1 forward primer was 5′-atccccgcatgagatcattcgctgcttcaagagagcagcgaatgatctcatgctttttggaaa-3′, whereas the mDia1KD2 forward primer was 5′-gatccccaggcagagccacacttcctttcaagagaaggaagtgtggctctgccttttttggaaa-3′. Specific oligomers were cloned into pSUPER-retro plasmid to generate recombinant retroviruses directing the expression of short hairpin RNAs. Vesicular stomatitis virus-G pseudotyped retroviruses were made in the HEK293T cell line following transient co-transfection with vesicular stomatitis virus-G, gag-pol, and pSUPER-retro-mDia1KD1 or pSUPER-retro-mDia1KD2 plasmids. After 48 h, retroviral supernatants of transfected HEK293T cells were diluted 1:1 with fresh media and incubated with HeLa cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene. After 12 h, fresh medium was added, and cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. Pools of infected cells were selected in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin. A control vector for nonspecific silencing effects was constructed in the pSUPER-retro vector directing the expression of a mouse I-mfa-specific short hairpin RNA (5′-gatccccgttgcagacgcatccatctttcaagagaagatggatgcgtctgcaactttttggaaa-3′). Recombinant virus containing this short hairpin RNA was generated and used to infect HeLa cells as described above.Confocal Microscopy—Prior to fixation, cells plated on coverslips were washed in 37 °C cytoskeletal stabilizing buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 6.9 with KOH) followed by fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde in cytoskeletal stabilizing buffer (PHEM buffer). Fixation was at room temperature for 15 min followed by three rinses in PHEM buffer. The cells were extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer for 90 s. Blocking was overnight at 4 °C or room temperature for 1 h in PHEM buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum. Primary antibodies were diluted in PHEM containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum for overnight incubation. Rabbit affinity-purified antibody to PKD2 was used at 1:100, mouse antibody to α-tubulin (DM1A; Sigma) was used at 1:2,000, mouse antibody to mDia1 (Transduction Laboratories) was used at 1:100, and mouse anti-acetylated tubulin (6-11B-1; Sigma) was used at 1:1,000 for cilia staining. The fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488, goat anti-mouse Alexa 568, and goat anti-chicken Alexa 488; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were applied for 1 h at 1:2,000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum, followed by five washes in phosphate-buffered saline. ToPro3 (Molecular Probes) was included in the next to the last wash at 2 μm for 5 min to visualize DNA. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong (Molecular Probes). ToPro3 was excited with a HeNe633 laser, and antibody staining was visualized with laser excitation from argon-488 and krypton-568 lasers and viewed on a Leica TCS NT Microscope. Images were processed with Leica Lite software.Ca2+ Fluorescence Spectroscopy—HeLa cells in 10-cm dishes were treated with 40 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h prior to mitotic shake off. Mitotic cells were harvested and washed twice in Ca2+ loading buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 15 mm HEPES, 0.023% pluronic acid) containing 40 ng/ml nocodazole. Cells were loaded with 2 μm Indo AM (Molecular Probes) in Ca2+ buffer with nocodazole for 60 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were again washed twice in Ca2+ buffer without nocodazole and then resuspended in 2 ml of Ca2+ loading buffer for spectroscopy. Normal HeLa cells were handled as above, except that nocodazole was omitted in every step, and they were harvested with 1× trypsin (Invitrogen). Ca2+ spectroscopy measurements for HeLa cells done in the absence of extracellular [Ca2+]o were performed on cells washed and assayed in the loading buffer described above except that CaCl2 was omitted and 0.5 m EGTA was added.Ca2+ release was assayed by adding 10 μm histamine to each 2-ml cell suspension and recording fluorescence ratios with a Photon Technology International fluorescence spectrophotometer. Excitation was at 350 nm, and emission data were collected at 405 and 485 nm and analyzed with Felix software.RESULTSIdentification of mDia1 as an Interacting Partner of PKD2—To better understand the function and regulation of PKD2 we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen using human PKD2 C-terminal residues Ser851 to Val968 as bait. This region of PKD2 was chosen because it would enable us to identify interacting proteins with the region of PKD2 that is mostly deleted in the longest truncation pathogenic mutant described to date, PKD2(871X) (37Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Xiangbin Z. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). PKD2(Ser851-Val968) was cloned into the pLexA vector and used to screen a mouse embryonic day 9.5 library fused to the activation domain of VP16. Several clones that contained inserts interacting with PKD2(Ser851-Val968) were identified from the 4 × 106 independent clones screened. All inserts were in-frame with the DNA binding domain of LexA, and their interaction with PKD2 was further verified by reintroducing the rescued plasmids back to the L40 yeast strain originally used in the screen. One of the clones matched amino acids Leu143 to Leu260 of mouse p140 Diaphanous (p140mDia, mDia1, accession number NM_007858). The PKD2-interacting region of mDia1 lies in the C-terminal portion of an already described functional domain of mDia1 that is called the RhoA binding d"
https://openalex.org/W2048258807,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B) is a newly identified member of the LDL receptor family that shares high homology with the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). LRP1B was originally described as a putative tumor suppressor in lung cancer cells; however, its expression profile in several regions of adult human brain suggests it may have additional functions in the central nervous system. Since LRP1B has overlapping ligand binding properties with LRP, we investigated whether LRP1B, like LRP, could interact with the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and modulate its processing to amyloid-β peptides (Aβs). Using an LRP1B minireceptor (mLRP1B4) generated to study the trafficking of LRP1B, we found that mLRP1B4 and APP form an immunoprecipitable complex. Furthermore mLRP1B4 bound and facilitated the degradation of a soluble isoform of APP containing a Kunitz proteinase inhibitor domain but not soluble APP lacking a Kunitz proteinase inhibitor domain. A functional consequence of mLRP1B4 expression was a significant accumulation of APP at the cell surface, which is likely related to the slow endocytosis rate of LRP1B. More importantly, mLRP1B4-expressing cells that accumulated cell surface APP produced less Aβ and secreted more soluble APP. These findings reveal that LRP1B is a novel binding partner of APP that functions to decrease APP processing to Aβ. Consequently LRP1B expression could function to protect against the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

A major component of plaques is fibrillar aggregates of amyloid-β peptides (Aβs), which are derived from the processing of a ∼120-kDa transmembrane protein known as β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4244) Google Scholar). APP, which exists in three main isoforms (APP695, APP751, and APP770), can undergo two post-translational processing pathways. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved first at a β-secretase site by the enzyme, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme, and subsequently by a γ-secretase within its intramembrane region to release the Aβ peptide (2Selkoe D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is processed by an α-secretase that clips within the Aβ region, resulting in the release of a soluble APP fragment (sAPPα), which may function in blood coagulation and neurite outgrowth (3Jin L.W. Ninomiya H. Roch J.M. Schubert D. Masliah E. Otero D.A. Saitoh T. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5461-5470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Oltersdorf T. Fritz L.C. Schenk D.B. Lieberburg I. Johnson-Wood K.L.

Several studies have shown that reducing APP endocytosis, either by biochemical methods or mutation of residues within its tail, results in a marked increase in sAPPα secretion and decrease in Aβ production, suggesting that these pathways are mutually exclusive (5Koo E.H.

In addition to modification by secretases, APP trafficking and processing are also regulated by other proteins, one of which is the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP). LRP is a multifunctional endocytic receptor that is highly expressed in the brain (7Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Nerbonne J.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18521-18528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LRP can internalize APP from the cell surface via extracellular interactions mediated by the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain present in longer isoforms of APP (8Knauer M.F. Orlando R.A. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1996; 740: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additionally LRP may regulate cell surface APP through intracellular interactions mediated by the cytoplasmic adaptor protein FE65 (9Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Smith C.J. Mikhailenko I. Rebeck G.W.

Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and Aβ production with a consequent decrease in the secretion of sAPPα (11Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S.

Consistent with these in vitro studies, overexpression of a minireceptor of LRP in the PDAPP amyloid mouse model also results in an increase in soluble brain Aβ (13Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H. Bales K.R. Zhuo M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Bu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The very rapid endocytosis of LRP (14Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) could be responsible for these changes in APP processing. Through its extracellular and intracellular interactions with APP (15Rebeck G.W. Moir R.D. Mui S. Strickland D.K. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 87: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), LRP may facilitate the trafficking of APP through the endocytic pathway so that its availability to β- and γ-secretases is favored over its accessibility to α-secretases at the cell surface. The LDL receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B) is a newly discovered member of the LDL receptor family (16Li Y. Cam J. Bu G. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 23: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Herz J. Bock H.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 405-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LRP1B and LRP have several common features. Along with megalin (LRP2), they are the largest known members of the LDL receptor family at ∼600 kDa in size. Furthermore both have four putative extracellular ligand binding domains that are separated by clusters of epidermal growth factor precursor repeats and (F/Y)WXD propeller regions. The number and arrangement of these repeats are similar in both LRP and LRP1B. Our laboratory has previously shown that several ligands known to bind LRP also bind LRP1B, including complexes of urokinase plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1, and receptor-associated protein (RAP) (18Liu C.X.

Like LRP, LRP1B is also expressed in the brain (18Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently may exhibit a vital biological function within the central nervous system. Two major structural features differ between LRP1B and LRP. LRP1B contains one additional ligand binding repeat found in ligand binding domain IV and also an additional 33-amino acid sequence within in its cytoplasmic tail that are not found within LRP (18Liu C.X.

Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). Functional differences between LRP1B and LRP have also been reported. LRP1B exhibits a much slower rate of endocytosis (t½ > 10 min) compared with LRP (t½ < 0.5 min) (18Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that may influence the cellular distribution and catabolism of ligands (18Liu C.X. Li Y.

Since LRP1B shares several ligands with LRP, we sought to determine whether LRP1B could also interact with APP. If the fast endocytosis rate of LRP is responsible for facilitating APP processing to Aβ (11Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7410-7415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that an interaction between APP and LRP1B, which has a much slower rate of endocytosis, will lead to decreased Aβ production. In this study, we demonstrated a novel interaction between LRP1B and APP. We found that significantly more APP was detected at the surface of cells overexpressing a minireceptor of LRP1B compared with cells overexpressing an analogous LRP minireceptor. Expression of LRP1B also decreased the steady state level of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 while increasing the levels of sAPPα. Our results suggest that LRP1B can alter susceptibility to AD by modulating APP processing and Aβ levels in a manner opposite to that of LRP. Antibodies and Reagents—The polyclonal anti-APP antibody 6AC20, raised against amino acids 676-695 of the APP carboxyl terminus, was kindly provided by Alison Goate (Washington University). The polyclonal rabbit anti-APP-β carboxyl-terminal antibody CT695, raised against a synthetic 22-amino acid region conserved in human and mouse was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The monoclonal APP antibody 6E10 raised against residues 1-17 of Aβ was purchased from Signet. Anti-Myc antibody 9E10 was obtained from Roche Applied Science. A previously described monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was used for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of LRP1B and LRP minireceptors (14Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from BD Biosciences. The anti-transferrin receptor antibody was the kind gift of Alan Schwartz (Washington University). For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), antibodies 266 (recognizes Aβ-(13-28)), 21F12 (recognizes Aβ-(1-42)), and 2G3 (recognizes Aβ-(1-40)) were the kind gifts of Kelly Bales (Eli Lilly). The polyclonal LRP1B antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide, PKKIEIGIRETVA (corresponding to the last 13 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of LRP1B). Total IgG was purified over a protein A-agarose column and then affinity-purified using streptavidin beads coated with biotin-conjugated immunogenic peptide. The eluates were analyzed by Western blot of CHO-mLRP1B4 cell lysates. Soluble APP770α (sAPP770α) was purified from the media of human embryonic kidney cells stably overexpressing APP770 as described previously (21Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Soluble APP695α (sAPP695α) and holotransferrin were purchased from Sigma. Carrier-free Na125I was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Proteins were iodinated using the IODO-GEN method as described previously for RAP (14Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged APP695 and APP770 constructs were generated by inserting the myc sequence into the 5′ region of the APP gene. C99 (C99 + 6MT) and APP695 (APP695 + 6MT) six-Myc-tagged constructs were generated using pCS2 + 6MT vector as described previously (22Hecimovic S. Wang J. Dolios G. Martinez M. Wang R. Goate A.M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Cell Culture—LRP-null CHO cells stably transfected with HA-tagged mLRP4 and mLRP1B4 have been described previously (18Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mLRP4 and mLRP1B4 minireceptors contain extracellular domain IV and the full transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of their full-length receptors. Stably transfected cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 350 μg/ml G418. Transient transfection of cells was performed with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) or Gene Juice (Merck Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% Triton X-100. Cell extracts (400 μg of protein) were precleared for at least 2 h with protein A-agarose beads and then incubated overnight with antibody at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads for 45 min, washed three times with lysis buffer, and boiled in SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on 7.5% or 4-15% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) under denaturing, reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk. For detection of APP, antibodies to the extracellular (6E10) or intracellular (CT695) domain were used. For detection of mLRP1B4, membranes were probed with anti-HA antibodies. Secondary antibodies or protein A linked to horseradish peroxidase were visualized by ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Ligand Binding and Degradation—To deplete endogenous ligands, cells were incubated in prewarmed ligand binding medium (Ham's F-12 medium, 1.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, and 350 μg/ml G418) for 1 h prior to incubation with radiolabeled ligand. For 125I-holotransferrin binding assays, cells were placed on ice and washed three times with cold ligand binding medium. Cells were then incubated with 1 nm125I-holotransferrin with or without 1 μm unlabeled holotransferrin at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After 4 h, unbound ligand was removed by washing cell monolayers three times with PBS. Cells were lysed in 1 n NaOH, transferred to γ tubes, and counted. Protein content in lysates was assessed using Bio-Rad protein assay. For degradation assays, cells were incubated in prewarmed ligand binding medium with 1 nm125I-sAPPα with or without 1 μm RAP for 6 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the overlying medium was removed and subjected to precipitation with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20% trichloroacetic acid. Degradation of radioligand was defined as the presence of radioactive fragments in the supernatant that were soluble in 20% trichloroacetic acid. Nonreceptor-mediated degradation was determined in the presence of excess RAP. To obtain specific degradation values, nonreceptor-mediated degradation was subtracted from the total degradation. Counts were normalized to the amount of protein in cell lysates of a parallel plate. Experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition and repeated two to three times. FACS Analysis of Cell Surface Proteins—For cell surface APP analysis, living cells were used. CHO cells were detached by incubation with non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma). To permeabilize cell membranes for total APP measurement, cells were treated with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 30 min prior to incubation with antibody and also during antibody incubation periods. Successive incubations with anti-APP antibody 6E10 (50 μg/ml) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were carried out at 4 °C for 1-2 h. As a control, background fluorescence intensity was assessed in the absence of primary antibody. All measurements were performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences) equipped with an argon ion laser. Laser excitation of 488 nm for fluorescein isothiocyanate was used. 10,000 cells were analyzed from each sample. Histograms were generated with CellQuest software, and the control-subtracted median values were compared between samples using Sigma Stat software. To determine the number of cell surface receptors, antibody binding capacities were compared with a standardized Quantum Simply Cellular microbead calibration plot (23Zagursky R.J. Sharp D. Solomon K.A. Schwartz A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 504-509PubMed Google Scholar). Bead standards (Bangs Laboratories, Inc.) were stained and measured in the same manner as CHO cells. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with PBS containing 3% normal goat serum and incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Final washes were carried out with PBS. Cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Stained cells were viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview 500, Olympus) using a 60× objective oil immersion lens. Aβ ELISA of Conditioned Media—Cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The next day cells were either washed two times with serum-free media and incubated in low serum media (containing 1% FBS) for endogenous Aβ studies or co-transfected with APP695, APP770, or C99 + 6MT along with pSEAP2 (a kind gift from Raphael Kopan, Washington University) for human Aβ studies. 24 h post-transfection, cell monolayers were washed, and low serum media were added. In both endogenous and human Aβ experiments, media were collected after 24-48 h after conditioning with the addition of proteinase inhibitors and then centrifuged at 20,200 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. The ELISA method was adapted from previous studies (24Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Aβ in the conditioned media was captured with antibody 2G3 or 21F12 for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively, and subsequently detected with biotinylated 266 or 3D6 antibody. Endogenous Aβ values were normalized to the amount of total protein in cell lysates. Human Aβ values were normalized to the amount of APP expression determined by Western blot or to the levels of secreted engineered alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) in the media. SEAP levels were assayed by the Phospholight luminescence assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA). sAPPα and APP Carboxyl-terminal Fragment (CTF) Measurement—Cells were plated into 6-well plates and co-transfected with APP695, APP770, or APP695 + 6MT vector along with pSEAP2 to normalize for transfection efficiency. Media were replaced by low serum media 24 h post-transfection and allowed to condition for 24 h. Upon media collection, proteinase inhibitors were added to conditioned media and then centrifuged at 20,200 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. Media were bound to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a dot blot apparatus and probed with anti-APP antibody. Blots were developed with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and imaged on a Typhoon 9410 variable imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Pixel volume of APP signal was calculated within the linear range of fluorescence using Image Quant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of sAPPα signal was normalized to the amount of APP expression as determined by SEAP in the media. Lysates from transfected cells were also applied to 12% Tris-HCl Criterion gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-APP or anti-Myc antibody. Blots were developed in the same manner as sAPPα dot blots. Signals from APP β-CTFs were divided by the signal of full-length APP detected in each lane. Brain Tissue—Adult C57Bl/6 mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Brain regions were dissected and Dounce-homogenized in 10 volumes of PBS containing 1 mm Mg2+, 0.5 mm Ca2+, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. 50 μg of protein from fresh tissue lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-LRP carboxyl-terminal, anti-LRP1B carboxyl-terminal, or anti-actin (Sigma) antibody followed by detection with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). APP Co-immunoprecipitates with LRP1B Minireceptor—Our laboratory has previously utilized minireceptors of LRP and LRP1B to analyze individual domains of the receptors as well as receptor trafficking and endocytic function (18Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Li Y. Osaka H. FitzGerald D.J. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For our analysis we utilized LRP-null CHO cell lines that stably express HA-tagged minireceptors of LRP (CHO-mLRP4) and LRP1B (CHO-mLRP1B4). The mLRP1B4 minireceptor contains two sequences (within the fourth ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic tail) not present within LRP that correspond to the major structural differences between the two receptors. To determine whether APP interacts with mLRP1B4, we lysed CHO-mLRP1B4 cells and immunoprecipitated endogenous APP with an antibody to its carboxyl terminus. Western blot of immunoprecipitates probed with anti-APP antibody demonstrated that we were able to immunoprecipitate endogenous APP (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot of APP immunoprecipitates with anti-HA antibody revealed immunoreactive bands that migrate at the same molecular sizes as the furin-cleaved extracellular HA-tagged processed form (∼120 kDa) and the unprocessed form (∼210 kDa) of mLRP1B4 (Fig. 1B). No anti-APP or anti-HA signal was detected in lysates immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum. Our co-immunoprecipitation results demonstrated that LRP1B interacted with endogenous CHO cell APP, which consists predominantly of KPI-containing isoforms of APP (data not shown). Next we sought to determine whether LRP1B could also interact with APP695, an APP isoform that is predominantly expressed in neurons and lacks a KPI domain. For these experiments, we transiently transfected CHO-mLRP1B4 cells with Myc-tagged APP695 (non-KPI domain-containing), Myc-tagged APP770 (KPI domain-containing), or with empty vector. Using an antibody against the Myc epitope, we immunoprecipitated APP in both APP695myc- and APP770myc-transfected cells but not in vector control cells (Fig. 2A). When the immunoprecipitates were blotted for mLRP1B4 using anti-HA antibody, we found that mLRP1B4 co-immunoprecipitated with both APP695 and APP770 (Fig. 2B). No signal was detected in lanes of non-transfected cells. These results indicate that LRP1B can interact with both KPI-containing and KPI-lacking isoforms of APP. mLRP1B4 Degrades sAPPα Containing a KPI Domain—To determine whether the extracellular interaction between APP and domain IV of LRP1B is mediated through the KPI domain of APP, we performed continuous degradation experiments with 125I-sAPP770α (KPI-containing) or 125I-sAPP695α (non-KPI-containing). Specific degradation of sAPPα by mLRP4 or mLRP1B4 was assessed by performing the experiments in the presence or absence of excess RAP. RAP binds domain IV of LRP and LRP1B with high affinity (18Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and antagonizes the binding of ligands to members of the LDL receptor family (26Bu G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 209: 79-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We found that CHO-mLRP4 cells degraded sAPP770α but not sAPP695α (Fig. 3, A and B). These findings are in agreement with previous studies in which full-length LRP was shown to degrade only KPI-containing sAPPα (21Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Interestingly we found that mLRP1B4 also degraded sAPP770α but not sAPP695α (Fig. 3, A and B). These data provide evidence that the fourth domain of LRP1B can mediate the uptake and degradation of KPI-containing soluble APP. Furthermore these results suggest that an extracellular interaction between full-length LRP1B and APP can be mediated through the fourth ligand binding domain of LRP1B and the KPI domain of APP. Since the endocytosis rate of mLRPP4 is much faster than that of mLRP1B4 (18Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we were initially surprised to find that both cell lines demonstrated similar levels of sAPP770α degradation. However, these results could be explained by a greater number of mLRP1B4 receptors at the cell surface available for binding to ligand. When we assessed the number of cell surface receptors present in each cell line using FACS, we found that 77,452 receptor sites in CHO-mLRP4 cells and 560,234 receptor sites in CHO-mLRP1B4 cells (Fig. 3C) were available for ligand binding at the cell surface. Given that the expression level of the minireceptors was the same when assessed by Western blotting (18Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), this ∼7-fold difference in cell surface receptor number likely arose from the differential endocytic rates of mLRP4 and mLRP1B4. To calculate the ligand degradation efficiency, we divided the amount of degraded sAPP770α by the number of cell surface receptors. We found that CHO-mLRP1B4 was ∼80% less efficient than CHO-mLRP4 at internalizing and degrading sAPP770α (Fig. 3D). mLRP1B4 Expression Increases the Cell Surface Distribution of APP—After establishing that an interaction between LRP1B and APP occurs, we sought to determine whether expression of LRP1B changes the cellular trafficking of APP. To examine whether LRP1B expression influences the cellular distribution of APP, we analyzed the amount of"

Cry1Ab toxin is reported to bind specific epitopes located in extracellular cadherin repeat (CR) 7 and CR11 on Bt-R1 (Gomez, B., Miranda-Rios, J., Riudino-Pinera, E., Oltean, D. I., Gill, S.

Biol. 32, 1025–1036). We transiently expressed CR domains of Bt-R1a in Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 (S2) cells as fusion peptides between a signal peptide and a terminal region that included membrane-proximal, membrane-spanning, and cytoplasmic domains. A domain consisting of CR11 and 12 was the minimal 125I-Cry1Ab binding region detected under denaturing conditions. Only CR12 was essential for Cry1Ab binding and cytotoxicity to S2 cells when tested under native conditions. Under these conditions expressed CR12 bound 125I-Cry1Ab with high affinity (Kcom = 2.9 nm). Flow cytometry assays showed that expression of CR12 conferred susceptibility to Cry1Ab in S2 cells. Derivatives of Bt-R1a with separate deletions of CR7, 11, and 12 were expressed in S2 cells. Only deletion of CR12 caused loss of Cry1Ab binding and cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that CR12 is the essential Cry1Ab binding component on Bt-R1 that mediates Cry1Ab-induced cytotoxicity. The cadherin protein Bt-R1a is a receptor for Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1A toxins in Manduca sexta.

Derivatives of Bt-R1a with separate deletions of CR7, 11, and 12 were expressed in S2 cells. Only deletion of CR12 caused loss of Cry1Ab binding and cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that CR12 is the essential Cry1Ab binding component on Bt-R1 that mediates Cry1Ab-induced cytotoxicity. Insecticidal Cry1 proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are used in biopesticides and transgenic crops (3Betz F.S. Hammond B.G. Fuchs R.L. Regul. Toxicol. Pharm. 2000; 32: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Each Cry1 protein is highly, yet selectively, toxic to some lepidopteran species. In a susceptible insect the process of intoxication begins with ingestion of the Cry protein and culminates in insect mortality. Proteinases in the alkaline midgut activate the Cry protein to a toxin that binds with high affinity to receptors in the brush-border epithelium. In the case of the cadherin receptor Bt-R1, toxin binding initiates a conformational change that probably results in assembling of a pre-pore toxin oligomer (4Gomez I. Sanchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberon M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Aminopeptidases also bind Cry1 toxins and catalyze toxin-induced pore formation (5Knight P.J.K. Crickmore N.

An emerging model suggests that after binding cadherin, the toxin binds aminopeptidase and inserts into membrane microdomains called lipid rafts (8Zhuang M. Oltean D.I. Gomez I. Pullikuth A.K.

At the midgut level, pore formation in epithelial cells leads to cell lysis and insect mortality. Cadherin-like proteins are receptors for Cry1A toxins in lepidopteran species.

Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cadherin-like protein BtR175 from Bombyx mori serves as a Cry1Aa receptor (12Nagamatsu Y.

Our goal was to examine the ectodomain units of Bt-R1a for interaction with Cry1Ab and their potential for mediating toxicity in a fluorescent-based Drosophila S2 assay (11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We focused on the region from CR7 to CR12 because it includes the reported Cry1A-binding epitopes (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Gomez I. Oltean D.I. Gill S.S. Bravo A. Soberon M. J. Biol.

Truncated Bt-R1a fragments were coexpressed with green fluorescence protein (GFP) in S2 cells and tested for Cry1Ab binding using ligand blots, dot-blots, and binding saturation assays. Cytotoxicity to S2 cells was measured using propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Results from binding and cell toxicity assays suggest that Cry1Ab has two binding sites located on CR11 and 12 of Bt-R1a. The CR12 domain bound Cry1Ab and conferred susceptibility to Cry1Ab when expressed in S2 cells. Cry1Ab binding to CR11 was dependent on the presence of CR12. Neither toxin binding nor toxicity was detected in cells expressing CR7. Our results identify CR11 and CR12 as Cry1Ab binding regions and CR12 as the functional Cry1Ab receptor region on Bt-R1a. Cloning of Truncated Bt-R1a Fragments—Cadherin Bt-R1a (GenBank AY094541) was used for constructing a series of truncated cadherin fragments in the insect cell expression vector pIZT (Invitrogen). Primers were manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT). The Bt-R1a signal sequence was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-AAAAACTAGTGATTGGCAGCAAAACCATCTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-ACTTCCATGGAGCTAAAACTGCAGGCGCTATAAAC-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pMECA (GenBank AF017063 (18Thompson J.M. Parrott W.A. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) using SpeI and NcoI sites to generate pMECA-Cad/S1.9. pMECA-Cad/S1.9 was digested with NcoI and XhoI to eliminate most of the 1.9 kb Bt-R1a insert, resulting in the pMECA-Cad construct. A Bt-R1a fragment encoding the MPED, and part of the transmembrane domain was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CTACCCATGGTTCGTCAACACGCTGCAACAGGTCG-3′ and 5′-GAGGCTCGAGTCAGGCGCCGAGTCCGGGCTGGAGT-3′ and cloned into pMECA-Cad in NcoI and XhoI sites to yield plasmid pMECA-Cad-MPED. Bt-R1a fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into pMECA-Cad-MPED using NcoI. CR7 fragment was amplified using primers 5-GAACCCATGGGTGCGCGAGATGTCAGCGGGCGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCTCCCATGGATACACGACGGTATCGAACTTAGTC-3′. A fragment including CR7 to the BtR1a stop codon (includes CR7–12) was amplified using primers 5′-GAACCCATGGGTGCGCGAGATGTCAGCGGGCGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCCCTTGAGGTCCATGGCGGTCTCCAGCTCTCCCG-3′. Primers for fragments encoding CR10, CR11, or CR12 to the end stop codon (referred to as CR10–12, CR11–12, and CR-12, respectively) were 5′-ACCTCCATGGTTCGTCTTCCCGACCAACGATGCCG-3′, 5′-ACCTCCATGGGCGTCCTCAGAACATGCTGTCGCTT-3′, and 5′-CACCCCATGGATATCCACAGCGGACTCCATCGGCA-3′ as forward primers, which were used to amplify the fragments with the reverse primer, 5′-GAGGCTCGAGTCAGGCGCCGAGTCCGGGCTGGAGT-3′. Primers 5′-GCCCCCATGGGGAGAACCTAGATTCGCGTCCTCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTCCATGGCCCTGCGGTGTACAATTCCCTCATA-3′ were used to amplify CR11. To construct the reversed order CR12–11 peptide, CR11 and 12 units were individually PCR amplified with terminal NcoI and XbaI sites. The PCR fragments were digested with XbaI, ligated to form CR12–11, and then CR12–11 was cleaved with NcoI and cloned into pMECA-Cad-MPED. All truncated Bt-R1a constructs in pMECA-Cad-MPED were excised with SpeI and SacII and cloned into pIZT to yield pIZT-Cad7, pIZT-Cad7–12, pIZT-Cad10–12, pIZT-Cad11, pIZT-Cad11–12, pIZT-Cad12–11, pIZT-Cad12 and pIZT-Cad-MPED. Bt-R1a was cloned into pIZT as described previously (11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), resulting in the pIZT-Cad construct. Deletions of CR7, CR11, or CR12 in pIZT-Cad-full were constructed using Elongase Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen) to amplify pIZT-CadD7, pIZT-CadD11, and pIZT-CadD12 directly. The primers for D7, D11, and D12 were designed as follows: 5′-CGTCGAATTCATTTACGAGAACGCAACCCACT-3′ and 5′-TCTCGAATTCGCGGAAGTTCTGCTCCAGAGTC-3′; 5′-CACCGAATTCATATCCACAGCGGACTCCATCG-3′ and 5′-CTGAGAATTCGAATCTAGGTTCTCCTTGCGTG-3′; 5′-CTACGAATTCTTCGTCAACACGCTGCAACAGG-3′ and 5′-CTGTGAATTCCCCTGCGGTGTACAATTCCCTC-3′, respectively. PCR fragments were cleaved with EcoRI, purified, and ligated overnight at 15 °C. The coding regions of all Bt-R1a expression plasmid vectors were sequenced in both forward and reverse directions at the Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility (University of Georgia). Transient Expression of Bt-R1a Cadherin and Bt-R1a Fragments in Drosophila S2 Cells—Drosophila S2 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in serum-free insect cell medium (Hyclone) and transfected as described previously (19Banks D. Hua G. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DNA for pIZT and pIZT-Cad plasmids was prepared using a Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Approximately 1.5 × 106 S2 cells from a confluent culture were resuspended in 5 ml of fresh medium and allowed to adhere to polystyrene dishes (Falcon) overnight. Plasmid transfection mixtures were prepared by mixing either 5 μg of pIZT-truncated cadherins or 20 μg of pIZT-Cad plasmid with 1 ml of serumfree insect medium (Hyclone) and 10 μl of Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). 4 ml of medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Invitrogen) were added to the cultures, and cells were incubated at 25 °C for 2.5 days. Purification and Labeling of Cry1Ab Toxin—Procedures for production and purification of Cry1Ab-containing inclusion bodies in an Escherichia coli strain carrying the B. thuringiensis NRD-12 cry1Ab toxin gene are described elsewhere (20Masson L. Prefontaine G. Peloquin L. Lau P.C. Brousseau R. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Activated toxin was prepared and purified according to Ref. 21Luo K. Banks D. Adang M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Purified toxin was quantified by the Bradford protein assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard and stored at –80 °C until used. Purified Cry1Ab toxin (10 μg) was radiolabeled with 0.5 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Specific activity, based on input toxin, was 4.1 μCi/μg. Brush-border Membrane Vesicle (BBMV) Preparation—Midguts were dissected from 2nd-day 5th instar M. sexta larvae and stored at –80 °C until used to prepare BBMV. BBMV were prepared according to Ref. 23Wolfersberger M.G. Luthy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Sacchi V.F. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86A: 301-308Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar and stored at –80 °C in 300 mm mannitol, 5 mm EGTA, 17 mm Tris, pH 7.5, until needed. The protein amount was determined according to Ref. 22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar using BSA as standard. Immunoblot and Ligand Blot Analysis—Drosophila S2 cells were seeded and transfected as described above. For dot-blotting, transfected cells were collected and counted with a hemocytometer. Duplicate aliquots of 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in PBS (135 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% BSA, and dot-blotted on PVDF filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a Bio-dot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Filters were blocked in blocking buffer (PBS, 3% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated with 0.25 nm125I-labeled Cry1Ab for 1 h in washing buffer (PBS, pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20). Nonspecific binding was detected by including 500-fold excess Cry1Ab with radiolabeled toxin in the incubation mixtures. After washing, filters were exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C overnight. For immunoblots and ligand blotting, 1 × 107 transfected S2 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 400 × g for 2 min followed by three washes in PBS. Cell pellets were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) and separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide 4–20% gel (BioRad) as described previously (11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF filters. Filters were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature before probing with anti-Bt-R1 serum in PBST containing 0.1% skim milk for 2 h or with 0.25 nm125I-Cry1Ab for 1 h. Bound antibodies were visualized by probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and chemiluminescent substrate (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). S2 cell proteins binding 125I-Cry1Ab on ligand blots were detected by autoradiography at –80 °C. Specific Binding of 125I-Cry1Ab to Cadherin Fragments Expressed on S2 Cells—Saturation of specific 125I-Cry1Ab binding to S2 cells transfected with pIZT or pIZT-cadherin fragments was measured according to Ref. 11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Increasing amounts of 125I-Cry1Ab were incubated with a constant number of S2 cells (1.6 × 105 S2 cells) for 1 h at room temperature in 100 μl of binding buffer (PBS plus 0.1% BSA). Binding reactions were stopped by centrifugation, and cell pellets were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Radioactivity of the final pellets was counted in a Beckman model 4000 Gamma detector. Nonspecific binding was measured as the amount of 125I-Cry1Ab toxin bound in the presence of unlabeled Cry1Ab toxin at a concentration 100-fold higher than the highest 125I-Cry1Ab concentration used in the assays. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. The dissociation constant (Kcom) and concentration of binding sites (Bmax) for 125I-Cry1Ab were calculated using the KELL software (BIOSOFT, Cambridge, UK). Data shown are the means of two independent experiments done at least in duplicate. Cell Toxicity Assays—Toxin treatments were conducted on two dishes containing 3 × 106 transfected S2 cells, two samples of 10,000 cells from each dish being analyzed by flow cytometry. Fresh medium with 20 μg/ml Cry1Ab toxin (∼330 nm toxin concentration) was added, and dishes were incubated with gentle shaking for 2.5 h. Cells were then stained with 4 μm (final concentration) of PI for 10 min and then gated for size determination by comparing forward and side scattered light dual parameters using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur instrument. For GFP fluorescence gating, cells were excited with kryptonargon laser, and emission was monitored with a 530/30 nm band-pass filter. GFP-gated cells were then examined for PI fluorescence by monitoring emission with a 585/42 nm band-pass filter. We used the formula described previously (11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to calculate the percentage of GFP-positive cells in the pIZT-Cad cell populations killed by Cry1Ab toxin. This formula accounts for the dead cells (PI-positive) in an untreated population, GFP-positive dead cells that lost GFP because of cell leakage, and the observed transfection efficiency (GPF-positive) for an experiment. The results are the mean of three independent experiments done at least in triplicate. Truncated Bt-R1a peptides were expressed on the surface of S2 cells to identify regions that bound Cry1Ab and induced cytotoxicity. Previous studies identified Cry1Ab binding regions TBR1 (1Gomez B. Miranda-Rios J. Riudino-Pinera E. Oltean D.I. Gill S.S. Bravo A. Soberon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30137-30143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and TBR2 (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), amino acid residues 865–875 and 1291–1360, respectively, which are located in CR7 and CR11. Truncated versions of Bt-R1a were constructed in pIZT so that the repeated CR units of Bt-R1a were preceded by the signal peptide and followed by the C-terminal region (including the membrane-proximal extracellular, membrane-spanning, and cytoplasmic domains) (Fig. 1). For example, pIZT-Cad7, referred to subsequently as Cad7, was designed to express the CR7 unit attached to the MPED on the S2 cell surface. pIZT-Cad7–12, abbreviated Cad7–12, would be expressed as CR7–12 attached to the MPED. Full-length and truncated Bt-R1a peptides were detected on immunoblots of S2 cell protein by sera against Bt-R1 (Fig. 2). Immunorecognition of full-length Bt-R1a, Cad7–12, and the smallest peptide, Cad-MPED, was stronger than for the other truncated peptides.Fig. 2Expression of full-length and truncated Bt-R1a in S2 cells and Cry1Ab toxin binding to expressed protein on ligand blots. Cell proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF filters. After blocking, filters were probed with anti-Bt-R1 serum or 125I-Cry1Ab. Con lane, S2 cells transfected with pIZT vector; other lanes correspond to Bt-R1a constructs shown in Fig. 1; BBMV, from M. sexta.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Truncated Bt-R1a peptides expressed from Cad7–12, Cad10–12, and Cad11–12 bound 125I-Cry1Ab on blots (Fig. 2). However, the individual CR units (7, 11, or 12) contained in Cad7, Cad11, and Cad12 and the MEPD (i.e. Cad-MPED) did not bind Cry1Ab. In agreement with (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the Cry1Ab binding region detected on ligand blots is contained in CR11–12. To test whether the order of the CR units is important for toxin binding, we produced Cad12–11 in S2 cells. Expressed Cad12–11 did not bind Cry1Ab on blots, suggesting that position of CR11 and 12 is crucial for Cry1Ab binding on blots. Because proteins on blots are denatured, and denaturation can expose epitopes that do not occur in natural conditions (25Lee M.K. Dean D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Daniel A. Sangadala S. Dean D.H. Adang M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2106-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we tested Cry1Ab binding to Bt-R1a peptides under native conditions. S2 cells expressing full-length and truncated cadherin peptides were dotted on filters and probed with 125I-Cry1Ab. As seen in Fig. 3, peptides containing CR12 attached to the MPED (full-length cadherin, Cad7–12, Cad10–12, Cad11–12, and Cad12) bound 125I-Cry1Ab. As is apparent in Fig. 3 and when radioactivity of the individual dots was counted (data not shown), Cad11–12 containing CR11 and 12 bound more Cry1Ab toxin than the other peptides. In contrast to the ligand blot results, CR11 was not required for Cry1Ab binding to nondenatured Bt-R1a. CR12 was the only repeated unit essential for Cry1Ab binding. The reversed order peptide, Cad12–11, did not bind Cry1Ab on dot-blots, suggesting either that the CR11 and 12 order is involved in binding, or the membrane-proximal region participates with CR12 in binding or spatially positions CR12 proximal to the membrane surface. Bt-R1a expressed on S2 cells demonstrated saturable and high affinity (Kcom = 3nm) binding to Cry1Ab (11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To calculate the parameters of Cry1Ab binding to expressed Bt-R1a fragments, we performed Cry1Ab binding saturation assays by incubating a constant number of S2 cells with increasing concentrations of 125I-Cry1Ab. Results from saturation binding assays agreed with dot-blot binding assays. 125I-Cry1Ab bound saturably to Cad7–12, 11–12, 12, and full-length cadherin (Fig. 4). Although quantitative binding analyses to Cad11–12 showed a single high affinity binding site, the increased binding detected at 10 nm125I-Cry1Ab may suggest the presence of lower affinity interactions at higher toxin concentrations. Although all Bt-R1a fragments that bound Cry1Ab displayed similar binding affinities (Table I), the concentration of binding sites was higher for Cad11–12 and Cad12 than for Cad7–12 or full-length cadherin. Furthermore, Cad11–12 displayed a 2-fold higher concentration of binding sites than Cad12, a result consistent with the dot-blot binding experiment. A plausible explanation for these results is that toxin binding to TBR2 in CR11 and an epitope in CR12 increases the number of toxin molecules bound per expressed cadherin fragment.Table IDissociation constants (Kcom) and concentration of receptors (Bmax) calculated from125I-Cry1Ab toxin binding saturation assays with S2 cells expressing Bt-R1a fragmentsBt-R1a fragmentKcomaValues shown are nm ± S.E.BmaxbValues shown are fmol/mg of protein ± S.E.nmfmol/mg proteinCad-full3.5 ± 1.2625 ± 15Cad7-122.0 ± 0.1505 ± 22Cad11-123.5 ± 1.03,319 ± 627Cad122.9 ± 0.81,407 ± 45a Values shown are nm ± S.E.b Values shown are fmol/mg of protein ± S.E. Open table in a new tab We recently described a S2 cell cytotoxicity assay based on the fluorescent detection of PI in cells permeabilized by Cry toxin (11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this system Bt-R1a is a functional receptor for Cry 1A toxins. To investigate the role of CR11 and 12 in Cry1Ab toxicity, we used flow cytometry to measure quantitatively the percentage of cytotoxic response induced by Cry1Ab in S2 cells expressing different truncated fragments. Coexpression with GFP provided a method to monitor transfection efficiency, and we used PI to detect cell death. Cytotoxicity was quantified using a formula reported previously (11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which relates both transfection and cytotoxicity to background cell death in control (mock transfected) cells. As presented in Fig. 5, Cry1Ab was similarly cytotoxic to cells expressing Cad7–12, Cad10–12, Cad11–12, Cad12, and full-length Bt-R1a cadherin. On the other hand, Cry1Ab was not cytotoxic to cells expressing Cad7, Cad11, or Cad-MPED. These results are evidence that CR12 contains the minimal functional receptor epitope in Bt-R1a necessary for Cry1Ab cytotoxicity. To confirm CR12 as the essential Cry1Ab toxin functional receptor domain, we separately deleted CR7, CR11, or CR12 in full-length cadherin (Fig. 6). Each cadherin clone with a deleted CR unit was expressed in S2 cells (Fig. 6A). In ligand blots, labeled Cry1Ab bound to CadD7 and Cad-full, but not to CadD11 or CadD12 (Fig. 6B). CR11 and CR12 units are both required for Cry1Ab binding when cadherin is denatured. Under the native conditions of dot-blotting, cells expressing CadD7, CadD11, or Cad-full bound Cry1Ab toxin (Fig. 6C). In cytotoxicity assays, Cry1Ab toxin was cytotoxic to 6.7 ± 0.57% of cells expressing CadD7, 7.5 ± 0.58% of cells expressing CadD11, and 8.5 ± 0.59% of cells expressing full cadherin. Conversely, Cry1Ab toxin treatment did not affect control cells (0.17 ± 0.37%) or cells expressing CadD12 (0.05 ± 0.78%). These data are in agreement with the truncated cadherin data, supporting CR12 as the Cry1Ab functional receptor domain in M. sexta BtR1a cadherin. Cadherin-like proteins are functional B. thuringiensis Cry1A toxin receptors in lepidopteran larvae. Elimination or alteration of binding to receptors is an important mechanism of insect resistance to B. thuringiensis toxins. In tobacco hornworm (M. sexta) larvae, the Bt-R1 cadherin-like protein has been resolved as a functional Cry1A toxin receptor (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In Ref. 11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar we described an assay for Cry toxin binding and cytotoxicity based on expression of Bt-R1a on the surface of S2 cells. The ectodomain CR units of Bt-R1a were expressed on the surface of S2 cells and tested for their Cry1Ab binding abilities under denaturing and native conditions. Binding to sites in CR11 and CR12 was dependent on whether the target CR peptide was denatured (ligand blots) or native (dot-blots and saturation binding assays). TBR2 in CR11 was discovered by Dorsch et al. (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) as the consequence of the loss of Cry1Ab binding to truncated Bt-R1 peptide on blots. Those authors also reported inhibition of Cry1Ab larval toxicity by a truncated Bt-R1 peptide containing TBR2. More recently, loop 2 and α-8 in Cry1Ab domain II were identified as the Cry1Ab regions that interact with TBR2 (27Gomez I. Dean D.H. Bravo A. Soberon M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10482-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In agreement with Dorsch et al. (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we observed that CR11 contains a region necessary for detection by Cry1Ab on blots. For example, although the Cad11–12 peptide bound Cry1Ab on ligand blots, elimination of CR11 caused loss of binding (Fig. 2; Cad11, Cad12). Unexpectedly, CR11 alone and the reversed construct Cad12–11 did not bind Cry1Ab on ligand or dot-blots and did not promote Cry1Ab cytotoxicity. These results may seem in conflict with (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); however, the TBR2 region proposed by those authors contained part of CR12. Therefore CR11 and an epitope in CR12 would be required for detection of Cry1Ab binding on blots. In contrast to the ligand blot results, TBR2 binds toxin under native conditions as the short peptide 1331IPLASILTVTV1342 located on CR11 decreased toxin binding and Cry1Ab toxicity to M. sexta larvae (27Gomez I. Dean D.H. Bravo A. Soberon M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10482-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our quantitative binding data, discussed below, are additional evidence that Cry1Ab binds TBR2 under native conditions when CR12 is present. The Cad12 peptide bound 125I-Cry1Ab under native conditions (dot-blot and quantitative binding assays), but binding was not detected on ligand blots. Dorsch et al. (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) also did not detect a binding region in CR12 on blots. However, those authors did not analyze the Cry1Ab binding properties of ectodomain CR12 under native conditions, emphasizing the need to perform binding studies under conditions that retain functional proteins. In our saturation binding assays we detected increased Cry1Ab binding to Cad11–12 compared with Cad12. Additionally, the Cad11–12 saturation binding curve (Fig. 4) shows increased binding between 5 and 10 nm ligand concentrations. These results can be explained by either the existence of binding sites in both ectodomains or by conformational changes associated with concurrent expression of both ectodomains that increase the amount of bound toxin. Because Cad11 did not bind Cry1Ab, we presume that toxin binding to CR11 is dependent on prior binding of toxin to CR12. Thus, after binding to CR12, a conformational change in either the toxin or Bt-R1a may promote binding to CR11. Gomez et al. (27Gomez I. Dean D.H. Bravo A. Soberon M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10482-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) proposed a sequential interaction of loops of domain II from Cry1Ab with TBR2 that could lead to proteolytic activation of Cry1Ab to a pre-pore toxin-oligomer structure. Gomez et al. (17Gomez I. Oltean D.I. Gill S.S. Bravo A. Soberon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28906-28912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) identified a Cry1Ab toxin binding epitope, called TBR1, on Bt-R1 through its amino acid sequence identity with an scFv antibody (scFV73) that blocked toxin binding to Bt-R1 cadherin on blots. TBR1 corresponds to residues 865–876 located in CR7 of Bt-R1. Additionally, a truncated peptide that included TBR1 bound Cry1Ab toxin on blots (27Gomez I. Dean D.H. Bravo A. Soberon M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10482-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TBR1 is bound by loop 2 of Cry1Ab domain 2 (1Gomez B. Miranda-Rios J. Riudino-Pinera E. Oltean D.I. Gill S.S. Bravo A.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10482-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In agreement with Dorsch et al. (2Dorsch J.A. Candas M. Griko N. Maaty W. Midboe E. Vadlamudi R. Bulla L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we did not observe Cry1Ab binding associated with CR7 on blots. Neither did we detect Cry1Ab binding to the CR7 unit as presented by the Cad7 peptide on dot-blots or in quantitative binding assays. Additionally, deletion of CR7 in full-length cadherin did not eliminate Cry1Ab binding in ligand or dot-blots or cause loss of cytotoxicity in cell assays. The different techniques to test for Cry1Ab binding used by Gomez and colleagues may account for the discrepancies. Furthermore, because S2 cells expressing Cad7 did not bind or were not susceptible to Cry1Ab toxin, potential toxin binding to these sites would not be related to cytotoxicity. Full-length Bt-R1a had a lower concentration of receptors than both Cad11–12 and Cad12, which resulted in lower amounts of Cry1Ab toxin bound to S2 cells expressing Cad-full compared with Cad11–12 and Cad12. However, because S2 cells expressing Cad11–12, Cad12, or the full-length Cad displayed the same level of susceptibility to Cry1Ab toxin, the increased binding to Cad11–12 and Cad12, although specific, was not related directly to cytotoxicity. The substantial amount of Bt-R1a and truncated Bt-R1a peptides detected in transfected cells (Fig. 2) suggests that receptor was not limiting. In Ref. 11Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar we discuss factors that may limit the toxicity of Cry1A toxins to S2 cells. For example, the low pH 6.4 of the cell culture medium relative to the alkaline lepidopteran midgut may not be optimal for toxin insertion into the membrane. Midgut trypsin-like proteinases involved in toxin processing and pore formation (28Miranda R. Zamudio F. Bravo A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) are lacking from the S2 system. At the epithelial membrane level, toxin is known to sequester into lipids rafts whose components include Cry1Ab-binding aminopeptidase (8Zhuang M. Oltean D.I. Gomez I. Pullikuth A.K. Soberon M.

Adang M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although not perfected as a model for midgut epithelial cells, the S2 assay system served to identify CR12 as the critical domain of Bt-R1a. Our results clearly identify ectodomain CR12 as a critical Cry1Ab receptor epitope in Bt-R1. CR12 was necessary and sufficient for Cry1Ab binding in both dot-blots and saturation binding assays. Furthermore, this ectodomain was the minimum region necessary to confer cell susceptibility to Cry1Ab to the same level as full-length Bt-R1a. Nagamatsu et al. (13Nagamatsu Y. Koike T. Sasaki K. Yoshimoto A. Furukawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) observed that a mutant of the B. mori cadherin, BtR175, lacking CR9, failed to mediate Cry1Aa toxicity in Sf9 cells. Our results and those of Nagamatsu et al. (13Nagamatsu Y. Koike T. Sasaki K. Yoshimoto A. Furukawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) indicate that the CR unit adjacent to the membrane-proximal region is critical to Cry1 toxin binding and pore formation. For BtR175, the critical unit is CR9, and for Bt-R1a the critical unit is CR12. Experiments using the S2 cell expression and FACS approach aimed at defining the specific amino acids from CR12 involved in Cry1Ab binding are currently being performed in our laboratory. Results obtained from this work will shed light on B. thuringiensis toxin pathogenesis as well as enable the design of optimized toxins with improved efficacy. Knowledge of the functional receptor region would also facilitate detection of changes resulting in toxin binding alteration, the most reported mechanism of resistance to B. thuringiensis toxins.

We have shown that Axl expression increases in the neointima of balloon-injured rat carotids. Because oxidative stress is known to play a major role in remodeling of injured vessels, we hypothesized that H2O2 might activate Axl by promoting autophosphorylation. H2O2 rapidly stimulated Axl tyrosine phosphorylation in rat vascular smooth muscle cells within 1 min that was maximal at 5 min (6-fold). The response to H2O2 was concentration-dependent with EC50 of ∼500 μm. Axl phosphorylation was partly dependent on production of its endogenous ligand, growth arrest gene 6 (Gas6), because Axl-Fc, a fragment of Axl extracellular domain that neutralizes Gas6, inhibited H2O2-induced Axl phosphorylation by 50%. Axl phosphorylation by H2O2 was also attenuated by warfarin, which inhibits Gas6 activity by preventing post-translational modification. In intact vessels Axl was phosphorylated by H2O2, and Axl phosphorylation was inhibited by warfarin treatment in balloon-injured carotids. Akt, a downstream target of Axl, was phosphorylated by H2O2in Axl+/+ mouse aorta but significantly inhibited in Axl-/- aorta. Intimal proliferation was decreased significantly in a cuff injury model in Axl-/- mice compared with Axl+/+ mice. In summary, Axl is an important signaling mediator for oxidative stress in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and intact vessels and may represent an important therapeutic target for vascular remodeling and response to injury.

Axl, also known as Ark, UFO, and Tyro7, is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 1The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; Gas6, growth arrest gene 6; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; LFA, left femoral artery; RFA, right femoral artery. expressed in several types of cells, including VSMC and mesangial cells (1Berk B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 62-68PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that Gas6 (growth arrest gene 6), a homolog of Protein S, is a ligand for Axl (2Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J.

Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Gas6 has been shown to induce Axl tyrosine phosphorylation and promote cell survival, migration, and growth (3Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7123-7126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Importantly, Axl is a member of a large RTK family that includes Sky (also named Rse, Dtk, and Tyro3) and Mer. These RTKs have important roles in inflammatory cell function (both T cells and monocytes) (6Lu Q. Lemke G. Science. 2001; 293: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has studied Axl in cardiovascular disease for many years because we identified it as the RTK most highly regulated following balloon injury of the rat carotid (4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently we have established that Gas6-Axl-Akt pathway is one of the antiapoptic mechanisms for VSMC that may be important in the response to vascular injury (4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Axl may be activated not only by Gas6 but also by H2O2 because other RTKs (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and fibroblast growth factor receptor) are tyrosine-phosphorylated by H2O2 (7Wang X.

Thus, under conditions of oxidative stress such as commonly occur with hypertension and diabetes, Axl is likely to be activated. Most relevant are data that reactive oxygen species including H2O2 are increased in diabetic glomeruli and injured vessels. A role for the Gas6-Axl pathway in nephropathy was suggested by a recent report that showed diabetic nephropathy was less severe when Gas6 expression was decreased (Gas6 knock-out mice) or Gas6 activity was inhibited (treatment with warfarin that blocks γ-carboxylation) (12Nagai K. Arai H. Yanagita M. Matsubara T. Kanamori H. Nakano T. Iehara N. Fukatsu A. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18229-18234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on these data we hypothesized that Gas6-Axl activation may be important in the vascular response to injury mediated by reactive oxygen species. Materials—Antibodies to phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, and phospho-p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to Axl (goat polyclonal), p38 (rabbit polyclonal), and phosphotyrosine (mouse monoclonal) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Axl-Fc was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for Axl (13Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliott G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.W. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C. Toso R.J.

All other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma unless specifically indicated. Cell Culture—VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of 200–250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats and maintained in DMEM containing 5.5 mm glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as previously described (14Ishida T. Ishida M. Suero J. Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (15Konishi A. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35049-35056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). VSMC were lysed in Triton-based lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), scraped off the dish, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as a total cell lysate. Equal amounts of cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™ EDL; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies, and membrane-bound antibodies were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To detect Axl or phospho-Axl in the membranes prepared from vessel lysates, SuperSignal West Femto (Pierce, Milwaukee, WI) was used for a chemiluminescent reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols. For lysate preparation from aortae or carotids, vessels were ground with a pellet pestle (Kimble Kontes, Vineland, NJ) in a 1.5-ml tube cooled with liquid nitrogen and suspended in lysis buffer. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was collected as a total cell lysate. Immunoprecipitation—Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with anti-Axl antibody (goat polyclonal) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 2 h, precipitates were washed with lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After being denatured at 100 °C for 5 min, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Animal Experiments—Axl-/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Goff (16Lu Q. Gore M. Zhang Q. Camenisch T. Boast S.

Mice homozygous for null mutation of Axl were viable and fertile and displayed no anatomical abnormality as described before (16Lu Q. Gore M. Zhang Q. Camenisch T. Boast S. Casagranda F. Lai C.

Femoral artery cuff injury was performed exactly as previously described (17Moroi M. Zhang L. Yasuda T. Virmani R. Gold H.K. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Balloon injury of the rat left carotid was performed exactly as described using male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–400 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MS) (4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Warfarin was administered to rats in drinking water (0.25 mg/liter, warfarin sodium; Sigma) beginning 2 days prior to carotid injury. The dosage was determined based on a previous report (12Nagai K. Arai H. Yanagita M. Matsubara T. Kanamori H. Nakano T. Iehara N. Fukatsu A. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18229-18234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment, the injured (cuff or balloon) and uninjured contralateral vessels were removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Animals whose vessels were used for histological analysis were perfusion-fixed at 130 mm Hg with 10% formalin. All procedures were carried out in a specific pathogen-free animal care facility at the University of Rochester and were approved by the University's Committee on Animal Resource. Histological Analysis—Paraffin-embedded carotid and femoral arteries (5-μm sections) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and photographed with a digital camera equipped with a microscope. The intima/media ratio was measured using Image J software. Statistics—Cell culture results are representative of two or three different experiments. Data with error bars were expressed as mean ± S.E. The comparison between uninjured and injured arteries was performed using 2-way analysis of variance. The comparison of phospho-Axl between vehicle and warfarin treatment was performed using Student's t test. To initiate our studies of Axl, we measured the activation in response to H2O2. As shown in Fig. 1, 600 μm H2O2 rapidly stimulated Axl tyrosine phosphorylation (onset within 1 min) with a 6-fold increase at 5 min. Immunoprecipitation of Axl yielded three immunoreactive bands (140, 120, and 104 kDa) as reported previously (18O'Bryan J.P. Fridell Y.W. Koski R. Varnum B. Liu E.T. J. Biol.

These differences are because of varied N-glycosylation, because N-glycanase treatment reduced molecular mass to 104 kDa. The major protein phosphorylated was the 140-kDa protein, which was used for all quantification. No obvious differences in regulation of the three Axl immunoreactive proteins were observed. The response to H2O2 was concentration-dependent with EC50 of ∼500 μm (Fig. 2). The magnitude of Axl phosphorylation by 500 μm H2O2 was ∼2-fold greater than phosphorylation by 50 nm Gas6, an endogenous ligand (not shown). The mechanism by which H2O2 stimulates Axl phosphorylation is unknown. Previously, RTK activation has been shown to involve both intracellular (e.g. via c-Src activation and protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition) and extracellular pathways (via generation of HB-EGF) (8Frank G.D.

To characterize the relative roles of these pathways in H2O2-mediated Axl activation we studied the effect of Axl-Fc, a fragment of the extracellular domain of Axl that binds Gas6 and inhibits Gas6-Axl signaling (19Yanagita M.

Inhibition of Axl phosphorylation in the presence of Axl-Fc implicates Gas6 as the activating ligand. As shown in Fig. 3, 2 μg/ml Axl-Fc inhibited H2O2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation at 5 min by ∼50%, suggesting an important role for extracellular Gas6. To confirm the role of Gas6 we also investigated the effect of warfarin, which inhibits γ-glutamyl carboxyltransferase and prevents γ-carboxylation of Gas6, thereby decreasing its interaction with Axl (4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, warfarin inhibited H2O2-dependent Axl tyrosine phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 ∼100 nm). In summary, these data indicate that endogenous Gas6 is partially required for H2O2-mediated Axl tyrosine phosphorylation.Fig. 2Axl tyrosine phosphorylation is induced by H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner.A, VSMC were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24 h and then treated with the indicated concentrations of H2O2 for 5 min.

Aortae were cultured ex vivo and stimulated with 1 mm H2O2. Axl phosphorylation peaked at 5 min, similar to cultured VSMC (Fig. 5). We and others (3Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C.

Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have shown that Axl mediates antiapoptotic effects, in part, via activation of Akt. To evaluate the importance of Axl in H2O2-mediated Akt activation we used mouse aortae that lack the Axl receptor (Axl-/-). As shown in Fig. 6A, H2O2-mediated activation of Akt (measured by phosphoserine 473-Akt) was dramatically inhibited in Axl-/- aortae. Interestingly, H2O2 activation of p38 measured by phospho-p38 was not inhibited (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Akt is a downstream target of Axl activation induced by H2O2.A, aortae from Axl-/- mice or wild-type littermates (Axl+/+) were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24 h and then treated with H2O2 (600 μm) for 5 min. The aortae were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lysates were prepared. Lysates were blotted with antiphospho-Akt or antiphospho-p38 antibody and then stripped and reprobed with anti-Akt or anti-p38 antibody, respectively. B, quantified densitometry data expressed as percentage of phospho-Akt or phospho-p38 in Axl-/- aorta treated with H2O2. Results are representative of two experiments using aortae pooled from two animals for each measurement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To clarify further the physiological importance of Axl activation in VSMC in vivo, we studied phosphorylation of Axl in injured vessels as well as the effects of warfarin on Axl phosphorylation and the neointimal response to injury. We chose the balloon-injured rat carotid as a standard model to assess the VSMC response to injury. To evaluate the effect of warfarin, rats were given 0.25 μg/ml warfarin in the drinking water for 2 days prior and 7 days after injury. Previously, we found that Axl expression reached a plateau at 7 days (4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Lysates of injured and uninjured vessels were collected, and Axl expression, as well as Axl phosphorylation, were studied by Western blot. As we have already shown (4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Axl expression in injured vessels was significantly increased both in vehicle and warfarin-treated animals compared with uninjured vessels (1.41 ± 0.18-fold in the vehicle group and 1.26 ± 0.12-fold in the warfarin group, p <0.05 versus uninjured). Furthermore, Axl phosphorylation was increased in injured vessels compared with uninjured vessels as shown in Fig. 7A. Warfarin treatment significantly inhibited the increase in Axl phosphorylation normalized to Axl expression (Fig. 7B), demonstrating that the inhibition of Gas6 activity by warfarin attenuated Axl activation in injured carotids. Axl activation may increase VSMC migration, proliferation, and survival (4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Fridell Y.W. Villa Jr., J. Attar E.C. Liu E.T. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 323: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), potential mechanisms involved in neointima formation. To study the effect of warfarin on neointima formation, animals were treated for 15 days after balloon injury. The animals were perfused, vessels harvested, and morphometry performed. The intima/media ratio of injured vessels was determined as a measure of neointima formation. The ratios were 0.953 ± 0.093 and 0.921 ± 0.137 in control and warfarin-treated groups, respectively (n = 11). Thus, there was no statistically significant effect of warfarin to inhibit neointima formation (p >0.05). To evaluate further the role of Axl in VSMC function, we studied the vessel response to injury in the Axl-/- mouse. Neointima formation was induced by placement of a polethylene cuff around the left femoral artery (LFA) (right femoral artery (RFA) was control). After 28 days of cuff injury, vessels were harvested for analysis. The uninjured RFA showed no intima formation in either Axl-/- or Axl+/+ (not shown). The injured LFA in Axl+/+ exhibited substantial intima formation (Fig. 8, A and D). In contrast, intima formation was markedly less (∼80% inhibition) in the injured LFA of Axl-/- mice (Fig. 8, B and D). There were no significant differences in lumen, media, or adventitia area in Axl-/- compared with Axl+/+ (Fig. 8, C, E, and F). These data show that neointima formation induced by vascular injury is significantly reduced in the Axl-/- mice. The major findings of the present study are that Axl is a redox-sensitive receptor tyrosine kinase activated by H2O2 in VSMC (both in culture and intact aorta) as well as by injury in intact carotid and femoral arteries. Specifically, we found that Axl was tyrosine-phosphorylated by H2O2 via a mechanism that was partially dependent on endogenous Gas6, as shown by inhibition with Axl-Fc or warfarin. There was a significant increase in Axl phosphorylation in the injured artery. Importantly, mice deficient in Axl expression exhibited markedly smaller neointima formation in response to injury. These data demonstrate the essential role for Axl in the vessel response to injury and represent the first report of Axl activation by a pathophysiological process in the vasculature. It has previously been shown that several RTKs, including EGF receptor (7Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Signal. 1997; 9: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), are activated by H2O2 at concentrations ranging from 20 to 5 mm, although the precise mechanisms of receptor activation are unknown. Several investigators have shown that proteolytic shedding of an endogenous ligand, HB-EGF, is involved in EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with H2O2 or angiotensin II (8Frank G.D. Mifune M. Inagami T. Ohba M. Sasaki T. Higashiyama S. Dempsey P.J. Eguchi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Kalmes A. Daum G. Clowes A. Ann. N. Y.

Therefore, we assessed the role of endogeneous Gas6 in Axl phosphorylation by inhibiting Gas6. Axl phosphorylation was partially attenuated by both Axl-Fc and warfarin (Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that endogenous Gas6 is involved in H2O2-induced Axl activation. Interestingly, a Gas6 splice variant is proteolytically cleaved, releasing a peptide that has full capability to activate Axl receptor phosphorylation (23Marcandalli P. Gostissa M. Varnum B. Goruppi S. Schneider C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 56-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24Goruppi S. Yamane H. Marcandalli P. Garcia A. Clogston C. Gostissa M. Varnum B. Schneider C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because Gas6 can localize on the cell surface through its γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain (25Nakano T. Ishimoto Y. Kishino J. Umeda M. Inoue K. Nagata K. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29411-29414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), it is possible that active fragments might be proteolytically released (similar to HB-EGF) upon stimulation with H2O2. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases, which has been proposed to be responsible for platelet-derived growth factor receptor activation, is an alternative mechanism of activation (26Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Although the tyrosine phosphatase modulating Axl activation has not been identified, it has been reported that a protein containing a putative tyrosinephosphatase domain specifically associates with Axl (27Hafizi S. Alindri F. Karlsson R. Dahlback B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that Axl receptor activation by H2O2 may be regulated both by intrinsic tyrosine-kinase activity (stimulated by receptor dimerization in part due to Gas6 binding) and by tyrosine-phosphatase activity (inhibited by H2O2) (28Reynolds A.R. Tischer C. Verveer P.J. Rocks O. Bastiaens P.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the present study we showed Axl phosphorylation ex vivo in intact vessels using a relatively high dose of H2O2 (1 mm, Fig. 5). We believe that the high concentration of H2O2 was necessary because of the very low expression levels of Axl and Gas6 in the normal aorta (4Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, Axl expression was increased in injured carotids (Fig. 7A) in which Gas6 as well as H2O2 production would also be augmented (29Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is likely that a large amount of H2O2 would be required to activate Axl in normal vessels, whereas only a small increase in oxidative stress may be enough under pathologic conditions in which Axl and Gas6 are already increased. Neointima formation in response to cuff injury was significantly reduced in Axl-/- mice compared with Axl+/+ mice. These data demonstrate an essential role for Axl in the vessel response to injury. Axl expression likely contributes to neointima formation by two non-exclusive mechanisms. First, Axl expression is required for VSMC migration, proliferation, and protection from apoptosis. All three processes have been shown to augment neointima formation in response to vascular injury. Second, Axl expression may contribute to stem cell-dependent neointima formation. Axl is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, and these cells have been shown to participate in vascular injury, repair, and atherosclerosis lesion formation (30Sata M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we could not detect a significant decrease in neointima formation by warfarin treatment, although the same dose of warfarin clearly reduced Axl phosphorylation in injured carotids (Fig. 7B). There are several explanations why warfarin had no effect on neointima formation in the present study although other investigators showed a clear benefit in nephropathy models (12Nagai K. Arai H. Yanagita M. Matsubara T. Kanamori H. Nakano T. Iehara N. Fukatsu A. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18229-18234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Yanagita M. Arai H. Ishii K. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Varnum B. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1423-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). First, warfarin may have both beneficial and harmful effects on the injured vessel. It has been shown that warfarin inhibits platelet adhesion to de-endothelialized vessels, a process that may protect VSMC from oxidative stress (31Hatton M.W. Ross B. Southward S.M. DeReske M. Richardson M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Second, inhibition of Axl by warfarin is likely to be partial, as shown in Fig. 4, and insufficient to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration in vivo. Third, other pathways, including EGF, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor that stimulate neointima formation (32Pastore C.J. Isner J.M. Bacha P.A. Kearney M. Pickering J.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Abe J. Deguchi J. Matsumoto T. Takuwa N. Noda M. Ohno M. Makuuchi M. Kurokawa K. Takuwa Y. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), are not blocked by warfarin. Fourth, the dominant effect of Gas6-Axl signaling may be to prevent apoptosis (rather than promote proliferation), as suggested by the difference in Akt activation in Axl-/- mouse aorta (Fig. 6) and previous studies (3Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). If apoptosis is not as important as proliferation in neointima formation it is logical that Axl inhibition may have little effect. Finally, transactivation of Axl by H2O2 will not be affected by warfarin to the extent that transactivation is independent of Gas6 (20Nakano T. Kawamoto K. Kishino J. Nomura K. Higashino K. Arita H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To address these questions we are studying the effect of Axl deficiency in mouse vascular injury models. The present observations that Axl is activated by H2O2 in cultured VSMC and intact vessels are of importance because they suggest a mechanism for Axl activation under conditions of increased Axl expression and oxidative stress. Although an Axl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor has yet to be identified, the potential role of Gas6-Axl in hypertension, atherosclerosis, and nephropathy in which increases in Axl expression and H2O2 production are evident makes this pathway an attractive therapeutic target (4Melaragno M.G.

P2X receptors are extracellular ATP-gated ion channels; they define the third major class of ligand-gated channels together with the glutamate and the nicotinic superfamilies (1Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). P2X receptors are involved in synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems, but in contrast to other ligand-gated channels, they are also widely expressed in peripheral tissues where they participate in physiological processes as diverse as smooth muscle contraction, secretion, and bone resorption. ATP-induced currents have been recorded from a large number of different cell types (2North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar), but the molecular identity of P2X receptors responsible for these currents often remains elusive because of limitations of pharmacological tools to discriminate the different subtypes of P2X channels. Seven P2X subunit genes (P2X1-P2X7) are found in the human genome; this number seems to be an accurate estimation of the extent of the P2X family in mammalian species, although in zebrafish two additional subunits appear to exist (2North R.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); however, the existence of subcellular trafficking signals in other P2X subunits has not been reported. Yet evidence suggests that additional trafficking signals are present in P2X subunits. For example, transiently expressed P2X6 subunits are not properly addressed to the cell surface presumably because of a glycosylation defect (19Jones C.A. Vial C. Sellers L.A. Humphrey P.P. Evans R.J. Chessell I.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the presence of a retention signal in the rat P2X5 subunit has been suggested to explain its poor functional expression (20Bo X. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. Kim M. Burnstock G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Different mutations that alter surface expression of P2X subunits have also been reported. Disrupting some of the conserved disulfide bridges of the extracellular loop of P2X1 subunits alters their normal trafficking to the cell surface (21Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); similarly, deletion of the three glycosylated asparagines of the P2X2 subunits induces an intracellular retention and a complete loss of function of the receptors (5Newbolt A.

Voigt M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14845-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, these mutations are likely to alter the folding of the protein, and the trafficking defects might rather be due a failure to pass the quality check test that normally takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum than due to a trafficking defect per se. In the human P2X7 receptor a dibasic amino acid motif (23Denlinger L.C. Sommer J.A. Parker K. Gudipaty L. Fisette P.L. Watters J.W. Proctor R.A. Dubyak G.R. Bertics P.J. J.

No mechanistic explanations have been put forward to explain these trafficking defects. In the present study, we have identified a motif in the C-terminal tail of P2X subunits that is conserved in almost all subunits known to date. By using a chemiluminescence assay (25Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 26Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) to measure the cell surface expression of P2X subunits, we show that in HEK 1The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; COS cells, African green monkey kidney cells; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Cy3, cyanine 3; Wt, wild type; α,β-me-ATP, α,β-methylene ATP; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; pF, picofarad; zP2X2, zebrafish P2X2. cells and in neurons this motif is involved in the stabilization at the plasma membrane of all P2X subunits tested (P2X2, P2X3, P2X4, P2X5, and P2X6). We also provide evidence that this motif might be important for the polarized expression of P2X2 receptors in neurons. Insertions of Extracellular Tags on P2X Receptors—Tags were introduced by overlapping PCR as described previously (8Stoop R. Thomas S. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in the extracellular loop of P2X subunits, all at similar positions; FLAG tags were inserted in P2X2 and P2X6 between Asp78-Lys79 and Glu83-Lys84, respectively; P2X3 has a Myc tag inserted between residues Asn104 and Arg105; P2X4 has an HA tag between Gln78 and Leu79; and P2X5 has either a Myc or an HA tag inserted between Thr78 and Thr79. In all cases tag insertions did not alter the function of the different P2X subunits measured electrophysiologically. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced as described previously (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) by using the QuickChange (Stratagene) protocol. A mutagenized fragment was excised by restriction digestion and subcloned into the respective backbone P2X subunit. All mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Construction of CD4 Chimeras—Human cDNA genes (hCD4-AAXX, hCD4-KKXX, and hCD4-GFP-KKXX) were the kind gift of B. Schwappach (Zentrum fur Molekulare Biologie, University of Heidelberg). The C termini of P2X2, P2X2b, and P2X3 were amplified with a forward primer containing an in-frame NotI site. NotI-XbaI fragments were generated and subcloned in the different CD4 plasmids (CD4-AAXX, -KKXX, and CD4-GFP-KKXX). All the clones were subsequently verified by sequencing. Chemiluminescent Assay—Cells were transfected in 35-mm dishes. Twenty four hours after transfection, each plate was divided into 4 wells of a 12-well plate. Assays were carried out 48 h after transfection. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and the cells in two of four wells in each case were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated in blocking solution PBS, 1% fetal calf serum for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with a secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase (1/1000, anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated, Amersham Biosciences). Luminescence was measured using Supersignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay femto-maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and quantified in a Victor 2 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For FLAG- and HA-tagged constructs, we used a primary antibody directly coupled with peroxidase (1/4000, anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase (Sigma), and 1/2000, anti-HA peroxidase, clone 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science)), thus eliminating the need for a secondary antibody. For other constructs, we used Myc antibody (1/1000, monoclonal anti-Myc antibody clone 9E10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) or CD4 antibody (1/100, monoclonal anti-hCD4, Immunotech). Surface expression was calculated as the ratio between the signal obtained for nonpermeabilized cells (representing the amount of proteins at the cell surface) and the signal obtained for permeabilized cells (which represents the total cellular amount of proteins). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hepes containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% GlutaMAX, and 1% penicillin plus streptomycin. Transfections were carried out in 35-mm dishes with a maximum of 1 μg of plasmid DNA, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for HEK293 cells and JetPei (Qbiogen) for COS cells, according to the manufacturers' protocols. Hippocampal cultures were prepared from E17 to E18 mice and grown in B27-supplemented neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) on poly-l-ornithine and laminin pre-coated coverslips as described previously. Ten-day-old cultures were transfected with P2XGFP fusion protein using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen); 1.5 μg of DNA and 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 were each mixed with 50 μl of neurobasal medium for 15 min and then mixed together and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After addition of 150 μl of neurobasal B27, the mixture was applied to the neuronal culture for 2 h at 37 °C, and then replaced by fresh neurobasal B27. Neurons were studied 48 h later. Data were collected from at least three different dishes prepared from at least three different cultures and transfections. Immunofluorescence on HEK293 Cells—Immunofluorescence experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, blocked in PBS, 0.5% BSA for 30 min, and incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with the primary antibody (1/1000, anti-FLAG M2 biotinylated, Sigma) in blocking solution, and then for 20 min at 37 °C with streptavidin Texas Red (1/2000, Amersham Biosciences). For labeling living cells, cells were incubated in complete culture medium for 1 h with the primary antibody at 37 °C followed by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C with streptavidin Texas Red prior to fixation. Immunofluorescence on COS Cells and Hippocampal Neurons—Forty eight hours after transfection, COS cells were fixed for 10 min at 37 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose. Cells were then washed in PBS, 0.3% BSA, and 50 mm glycine and permeabilized at 37 °C in blocking solution (PBS, 0.3% BSA, and 0.05% saponin). Cells were incubated in blocking solution containing primary antibody at room temperature for 2 h, and after an extensive wash, cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with secondary antibody. For cells transfected with P2X2-GFP fusion, anti-calreticulin (1/200, Alexis Biochemicals) and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1/1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used. For cells transfected with CD4-GFP-KKXX and FLAG-P2X2 receptors, we used biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1/1000, Sigma) and streptavidin-Texas Red (1/2000, Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence was visualized on a Leica DMRA2 epifluorescent microscope using a ×40 oil immersion objective. Images were acquired using a cool-snap HQ (photometrics) digital camera. Internalization Experiments—HEK293 cells stably expressing P2X2, P2X2[K366A], or P2X2[Y362A] were grown on polyornithine-coated coverslips for 24 h. To monitor receptor internalization, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hepes containing monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1/1000, Sigma) and 100 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were then placed on ice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. Coverslips were transferred in a PBS solution containing 0.3% BSA and 192 mm glycine for 15 min at room temperature to quench paraformaldehyde fluorescence. After an additional 30 min of blocking in PBS, 0.3% BSA, surface staining was achieved for 20 min at 37 °C with an FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1/1000, Chemicon) in PBS, 0.3% BSA blocking solution. Cells were then permeabilized for 5 min in 0.01% Triton X-100 and internalized receptors-antibodies complexes were measured following a 20-min incubation at 37 °C in the presence of a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1/2000, The Jackson Laboratory) in PBS, 0.3% BSA. Fluorescence was visualized using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal inverted microscope with a Nikon 63 × 1.32 HCX planapochromatic objective. FITC was excited with an argon laser at 488 nm; Cy3 was excited with a helium/neon at 543 nm. Images were collected sequentially to avoid cross-contamination between fluorochromes. Series of optical sections were scanned at a 1024 × 1024 pixels resolution and collected in the Leica confocal software. 8-Bit TIFF images were imported and analyzed with ImageJ 1.62 (NIH software). Electrophysiological Recordings—HEK293 cells were used to express the wild type and mutant P2X receptors with green fluorescent protein as described above. A plasmid ratio of 1/5 was adopted for co-expression of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits. Whole cell recordings were carried out at room temperature using an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Germany) as detailed previously and briefly described below. Membrane potential of the patched cells was held at -60 mV. Extracellular solution contained (in mm) 147 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, and 13 glucose. Intracellular solution contained (in mm) 147 NaF, 10 Hepes, and 10 EGTA. These solutions were maintained at pH 7.3 and 300-315 mosmol-1. Agonists were applied using an RSC 200 fast-flow delivery system (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, France). The current responses from individual cells were normalized to cell membrane capacitance (in a range of 8-20 pF) and presented as current density (in pA/pF). All data are presented where appropriate as mean ± S.E. Identification of an Intracellular Motif Implicated in the Surface Expression of the P2X2 Receptor—The C-terminal regions of rat P2X subunits have different lengths, ranging from 27 amino acids for P2X6 to 240 amino acids for P2X7. As shown in Fig. 1A, their alignment in the immediate juxtamembrane region shows little homology, but two amino acids are completely conserved. The motif YXXXK is located eight residues downstream of the end of the second transmembrane domain in all except the P2X7 subunit, where an extra 18-amino acid cysteine-rich domain is intercalated. In most subunits the residue preceding the conserved lysine is also a basic residue; therefore, we investigated if this motif YXXXK could be implicated in P2X receptor trafficking. To that goal we used P2X subunits in which epitope tags were introduced in the extracellular loop in a position that did not noticeably modify receptors properties (8Stoop R. Thomas S. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutation Analysis of P2X2[Y362A] and P2X2[K366A]—HEK cells were transfected with either P2X2, P2X2[Y362A], or P2X2[K366A] cDNAs carrying an extracellular FLAG tag; expression of the channels was analyzed 2 days later by immunofluorescence either in living cells or after fixation and permeabilization. As shown in Fig. 1B, mutation to alanine of either Tyr362 or Lys366 strongly decreases immunostaining of the receptors as compared with wild type (Wt) subunits, suggesting that the surface expression of mutated subunits is affected; when cells were permeabilized, immunofluorescence of mutated subunits was apparently not different from Wt P2X2 (not shown). Because immunofluorescence is not quantitative and does not allow for detection of subtle changes in protein expression, we used a luminescent-based assay that gave a direct and accurate quantification of the expression of proteins. Depending upon the permeabilization state of the cells, this approach allowed the quantification of cell surface-expressed receptors (nonpermeabilized state) or of the total cellular content of the protein (permeabilized state). In addition, the quantification of the total cellular amount of the protein provided a direct indication of the stability of mutated subunits. As shown in Fig. 1C, in nonpermeabilized conditions the luminescent signal was strongly reduced for cells expressing P2X2[Y362A] or P2X2[K366A] subunits as compared with cells transfected with Wt P2X2. No difference in the total amount of mutant protein was observed. The ratio of nonpermeabilized state/permeabilized state indicates that 73 ± 16% (n = 9) of Wt P2X2 receptor were present at the plasma membrane but only 34 ± 5.5% (n = 7) and 28 ± 4.5% (n = 7) for P2X2[Y362A] and P2X2[K366A], respectively. The double mutant P2X2[Y362A,K366A] did not show any further decrease in the receptor surface expression (data not shown). We next studied whether other residues in the vicinity of the YXXXK motif could also interfere with the surface expression of the P2X2 subunit. Residues downstream of the second transmembrane region, from Lys360 to Lys369, were individually mutated to alanine, and their membrane expression was examined. As shown in Fig. 1D, none of these mutants showed any decreased membrane expression nor did the mutation to alanine of the two leucines (Leu354 and Leu355) located at the end of the second transmembrane domain (data not shown). These results indicate that the YXXXK motif plays an important role in the trafficking of the P2X2 subunit to the plasma membrane. Specificity of the YXXXK Motif and Functional Characterization of Mutant Subunits—Additional amino acid substitutions were introduced at the Tyr362 and Lys366 positions (Tyr to Phe; Lys to Arg, Lys to Gly, and Lys to Gln). All mutants were individually transfected in HEK cells, and membrane expression was quantified by chemiluminescent assay. Fig. 2A shows that all mutants had reduced surface expression ranging from 22 ± 6.2% (n = 3) for K366Q to 43 ± 3.5% (n = 3) for Y362F; even when the conservative substitutions Y362F and K366R were introduced, surface expression of the receptor was still decreased. These values were not different from what was observed for membrane expression of Y362A and K366A. We next investigated if the introduced mutation at both Tyr and Lys positions had any consequences on ATP-evoked currents in HEK-transfected cells. Because a 20-40% residual membrane expression of these mutants was consistently observed, we expected to observe similar reductions of the ATP current densities. As shown in Fig. 2B, the mutations introduced at Tyr362 and Lys366 positions had different phenotypes. When either alanine or phenylalanine was introduced at the Tyr362 position, ATP was still able to induce currents. Current densities were reduced from 175 ± 29 pA/pF (n = 9) for Wt P2X2 to 62 ± 12 pA/pF (n = 6) and 58 ± 23 pA/pF (n = 5) for P2X2[Y362A] and P2X2[Y362F], respectively (Fig. 2C). These values are similar to what we observed in terms of reduction of the surface expression of these mutants. In the case of the Y362A mutation, a second application of ATP (30 μm) did not induce any current, indicating a strong desensitization of the current (data not show). This was not observed with the more conservative substitution Y362F. Cells transfected with substitutions at the Lys366 positions did not produce any current in response to ATP (concentrations up to 1 mm), although they had residual surface expression of around 30% (Fig. 2B). These results are in agreement with a previous report (27Smith F.M. Humphrey P.P. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 91-99Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in which P2X2[K366Q] was shown to be nonfunctional. The lack of function of P2X2 Lys366 mutants might be due to a disruption of the oligomeric organization of the channel and subsequently its trafficking to the cell surface. To test this hypothesis we performed co-immunoprecipitation between Wt P2X2 and P2X2[K366A] subunits. Receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated through the FLAG epitope present on one subunit, and the presence of the second subunit was detected because of its Myc epitope. In all situations, including the homomeric P2X2[K366A] complex, co-immunoprecipitation of subunits was successfully obtained (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that the decreased surface expression of the P2X2[K366A] subunit and its lack of function cannot be attributed to an inability of the mutant to oligomerize with itself or with other subunits. The YXXXK Motif Regulates Surface Expression of Other P2X Subunits—The YXXXK motif is conserved in almost all P2X subunits cloned to date; therefore, we asked whether the mutation of this motif in other P2X subunits would also impair their surface expression. Mutations to alanine of the Tyr and Lys residues were individually introduced in Myc-P2X3, HAP2X4, HA-P2X5, and FLAG-P2X6 subunits. Membrane expression of these different mutants and of their respective wild type subunits was measured by the chemiluminescence assay (Fig. 3A). Mutation of either tyrosine or lysine residues in all P2X subunits caused a large decrease of surface expression when compared with the respective wild type subunits; surface expression levels of mutated subunits were all in the same range, except for P2X6: P2X3[Y353A] 27 ± 5.3% (n = 3), P2X3[K372A] 23 ± 0.3% (n = 3), P2X4[Y367A] 36 ± 6.4% (n = 4), P2X4[K370A] 27 ± 7.2% (n = 4), P2X5[Y369A] 34 ± 6% (n = 5), P2X5[K372A] 37 ± 4.3% (n = 5), and P2X6[K365A] 58 ± 3.5% (n = 4). In all cases, the total cellular amount of protein was not altered (data not shown), indicating that a decrease of the stability mutant P2X subunits could not be accounted for the observed decrease in their surface expression. Recordings from ATP-induced currents in HEK cells transfected with P2X3, P2X4, and P2X5 tyrosine and lysine mutants showed that none of them responded to ATP, even at concentrations up to 1 mm. By comparison, when wild type subunits were used in the same experiments, normal currents were observed (see Fig. 3). The ATP analog αβ-methylene-ATP (αβ-me-ATP) was also ineffective in inducing current in HEK cells transfected with P2X3[Y353A] and P2X3[K357A] mutants. Of the eight P2X mutant subunits tested, only P2X2[Y362F] and P2X2[Y362A] showed any functional response to ATP; in the latter case the currents desensitized markedly. Surface Expression of Mutant P2X Subunit Is Rescued by Wild Type Subunits—P2X2 and P2X3 subunits form well characterized hetero-oligomeric receptors with pharmacological and biophysical properties that are clearly distinct from homo-oligomeric P2X2 and P2X3 channels (28Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 29Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Kawashima E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6529-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the trafficking of hetero-oligomeric P2X receptors formed by the association of wild type and trafficking deficient subunits. As show in Fig. 4A, when FLAG-P2X2[K366A] was co-expressed with nontagged P2X3 subunits, a strong surface immunostaining of the mutant P2X2 was recovered. Quantification of the recovery by chemiluminescent assay confirmed that when P2X2[K366A] was co-expressed with P2X3,80 ± 6.7% (n = 4) of the total cellular amount of the subunit was expressed at the cell surface, compared with only 32 ± 1.0% (n = 4) when P2X2[K366A] was expressed alone. Similar results were found when P2X2[Y362A] was co-expressed with P2X3 (data not shown). In the converse experiment, when the Myc-tagged P2X3[K357A] subunit was co-expressed with the nontagged P2X2 subunit, its surface expression rose from 23 ± 0.3% (n = 3) (P2X3[K357A]) to 79 ± 4.9% (n = 3) (P2X3[K357A]/P2X2) (Fig. 4C). Electrophysiological recordings were performed to determine whether the co-expression of P2X3 with P2X2[K366A] could rescue the lack of function of the P2X2 mutant subunit. Fig. 4B shows that when P2X2[K366A] subunit was co-expressed with the P2X3 subunit, αβ-me-ATP induced currents that desensitized slowly compared with P2X3 currents. The hetero-oligomeric current was isolated by measuring the amplitude of the currents evoked by αβ-me-ATP ("
https://openalex.org/W2057755708,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are structurally unique Ser/Thr kinases found in plants and certain protozoa. They are distinguished by a calmodulin-like regulatory apparatus (calmodulin-like domain (CaM-LD)) that is joined via a junction (J) region to the C-terminal end of the kinase catalytic domain. Like CaM, the CaM-LD is composed of two globular EF structural domains (N-lobe, C-lobe), each containing a pair of Ca2+ binding sites. Spectroscopic analysis shows that the CaM-LD is comprised of helical elements, but the isolated CaM-LD does not form a conformationally homogeneous tertiary structure in the absence of Ca2+. The addition of substoichiometric amounts of Ca2+ is sufficient to stabilize the C-terminal lobe in a construct containing J and CaM-LD (JC) but not in the CaM-LD alone. Moreover, as J is titrated into Ca2+-saturated CaM-LD, interactions are stronger with the C-lobe than the N-lobe of the CaM-LD. Measurements of Ca2+ affinity for JC reveal two cooperatively interacting high affinity binding sites (Kd,mean = 5.6 nm at 20 mm KCl) in the C-lobe and two weaker sites in the N-lobe (Kd,mean = 110 nm at 20 mm KCl). The corresponding Ca2+ binding constants in the isolated CaM-LD are lower by more than 2 orders of magnitude, which indicates that the J region has an essential role in stabilizing the structure of the CDPK regulatory apparatus. The large differential affinity between the two domains together with previous studies on a plasmodium CDPK (Zhao, Y., Pokutta, S., Maurer, P., Lindt, M., Franklin, R. M., and Kappes, B. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 3714–3721) suggests a model whereby even at normally low cytosolic levels of Ca2+, the C-lobe interacts with the junction, but the kinase remains in an autoinhibited state. Activation then occurs when Ca2+ levels rise to fill the two weaker affinity binding sites in the N-lobe, thereby triggering a conformational change that leads to release of the autoinhibitory region.

CDPKs are found only in plants and protozoa, including Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria (1Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F.

Biochemical features of CDPK substrates suggest regulatory roles for CD-PKs in gene expression, metabolism, signaling pathway components, ion transport, and cytoskeleton dynamics (1Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 2Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J.

Walker-Simmons K. Zhu J.-K. Harmon A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 132: 666-680Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence homology, CDPKs are most closely related to calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) (6Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller G.E. Putnam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 1Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The majority of CaM-regulated kinases contain a CaM binding region near their C terminus. The CDPKs are similar, except they contain their own calmodulin-like regulatory apparatus (CaM-LD) C-terminal to the CaM binding region of the catalytic domain (K) (Fig. 1). The CaM-LD consists of two structural domains (termed the N and C “lobes” in this manuscript), each containing two EF-hand helix-loop-helix Ca2+ binding motifs. The region that joins the kinase and CaM-LD is referred to as the junction (J). The junction contains an autoinhibitor and a target sequence for intramolecular binding of the CaM-LD (7Huang J.F. Teyton L. Harper J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13222-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The similarities between the CaMK and CDPK systems are numerous. For example, both CaMKs and CDPKs are regulated by an autoinhibitor located immediately C-terminal to the kinase domain. In both cases, autoinhibition is relieved by interaction with CaM or the CaM-LD. The CaM-LD of CDPK has 40% sequence identity with CaM, which suggests a potential similarity in structure and function. In fact, the CaM-LD can be functionally replaced by a CaM sequence in a chimeric CDPK (8Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12029-12037Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additionally, both an exogenous CaM and a CaM-LD were shown to be able to activate a truncated CDPK, although to no more than half of the extent of the holoenzyme (9Vitart V. Christodoulou J. Huang J.F. Chazin W.J. Harper J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4004-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, what distinguishes CDPKs and CaMKs is the covalent tethering of the CaM-LD in a CDPK. Evidence from mutational analyses indicates that this tether provides a structural constraint that is essential for the mechanism of intramolecular activation. An insertion of three glycines into the tether, which would be expected to increase its flexibility, results in a 95% disruption in calcium activation (9Vitart V. Christodoulou J. Huang J.F. Chazin W.J. Harper J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4004-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The exact structural features of the tether that help mediate activation by the CaM-LD are unclear. To more fully elucidate the mode of action of the regulatory apparatus of CDPK, we have undertaken a series of biophysical analyses of the CaM-LD and its interactions with the J region. The structural character of the CaM-LD was examined by CD and NMR. An estimate of the strength of the interaction between J and the CaM-LD was obtained by measuring the affinity between the isolated CaM-LD and a peptide corresponding to the J region. Because such measurements do not take into account the effects associated with the tethering of J to the CaM-LD, the linked thermodynamics of Ca2+ and J binding (10Peersen O.B. Madsen T.S. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 794-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Bayley P.M. Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were characterized by measuring the Ca2+ affinities of the CaM-LD and J+CaM-LD (JC) construct. The results obtained from these studies indicate that the two lobes of the CaM-LD do not function in an equivalent manner. Despite the finding that the C-lobe makes the predominant contacts with the junction region, the implications of our findings suggest that the N-terminal lobe of the CaM-LD functions as the calcium sensor for the activation of CDPK. This latter finding is consistent with previous studies on a plasmodium CDPK isoform (12Zhao Y. Pokutta S. Maurer P. Lindt M. Franklin R.M. Kappes B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) where mutational analysis showed that only the N-lobe calcium sites were essential for calcium-dependent activation. Protein Expression—The CDPK isoform, CPK-1, used in this work was cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana (13Harper J.F. Binder B.M. Sussman M.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding the regulatory apparatus of CDPK (residues Lys-428—Gly-591) were subcloned from CPK-1 and sequenced to verify the absence of mutations resulting from subcloning. The pET-28b+ plasmid (Novagen) was used for constructs of the CDPK regulatory domain. This has an N-terminal His tag and a thrombin cleavage site and was used with Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as the host bacterial strain. Standard growth conditions were used; 2xYT media for unlabeled preparations and M9 minimal media containing [15N]ammonium chloride and/or [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories, Inc.) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources as needed. Media were supplemented with the antibiotic kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and vitamins (Basal Eagle Vitamin Mix, Invitrogen). After isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, the expression of CDPK constructs accounts for the majority of total cell protein. High expression levels were achieved (∼60 mg/liter with 2xYT medium and 5–20 mg/liter in minimal media). Although much of the expressed protein was in the periplasmic fraction, the high expression levels resulted in a significant amount (typically 50%) of the target protein in inclusion bodies. Protein Purification—CDPK constructs were purified by suspending the cell pellet in a minimum volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme). Cells were lysed using gentle sonication, and after centrifugation the resulting supernatant was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography (nickel-agarose resin, Qiagen) followed by thrombin cleavage of the purification tag. Thrombin (Calbiochem) was purified before use via a Mono Q ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Thrombin inactivation was achieved via a benzamidine-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Further purification steps included either Superdex-75 or 200 gel filtration using fast protein liquid chromatography (AKTA system, Amersham Biosciences). Protein masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Further assessments of purity were by SDS-PAGE and analytical gel filtration (TSK2000SW gel filtration, Tosohaas) using HPLC. CDPK proteins concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis (Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility, University of Cambridge). A significant amount of protein was expressed in inclusion bodies, which were extracted using standard urea denaturation in the constant presence of thiol reducing agent (10 mm DTT). The denatured protein was refolded by slow dialysis and then subjected to the purification procedure described above. The structural integrity of refolded protein was assayed by two-dimensional 1H, 15N HSQC NMR, which showed the refolded protein to be identical to protein purified from soluble fractions. Peptides—Peptides corresponding to the junction region were obtained from Genemed Synthesis, Inc. Analytical reverse-phase HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry showed >95% purity. Peptide concentrations were determined by absorbance at 215 nm relative to bovine serum albumin. Circular Dichroism—Experiments were performed on Jasco J-720 and J-820 spectropolarimeters. Two scans were averaged. A bandwidth of 1 nm and a scan step size of 0.25 nm were employed with a 1-cm path length. Spectra were recorded at 298 K at 5–10 μm protein concentrations in 2 mm Tris-HCl, 18 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm DTT at pH 7.4. Spectra were processed, and plots were created using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). For studies where a strict Ca2+-free environment was required, all buffers were passed through pre-equilibrated Chelex resin (iminodiacetic acid on agarose support, Aldrich). All glassware and consumables were washed with EDTA and then thoroughly rinsed with Chelex-treated water before use. Protein samples were rendered metal-free by bringing 1 mg/ml solutions to 50 mm EDTA. This was followed by repeated dialysis against Chelex-treated buffer. NMR Spectroscopy—Experiments were recorded on Bruker Avance 500, 700, and 800 spectrometers at 310 K. Samples contained 0.5–1.0 mm protein in 50 mm Tris-d11 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc.) and 100 mm KCl with 10 mm DTT and 5% (v/v) D2O. Titrations were monitored by two-dimensional 1H, 15N HSQC spectra acquired with quadrature detection via the TPPI technique (14Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3522) Google Scholar). Sweep widths were ∼13 and 30 ppm in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively, and acquisition parameters ranged from 64 to 256 increments for each of 8–32 scans. Three-dimensional HNCO and HNCA spectra were recorded at 800 MHz with constant time in the 15N dimension (15Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spec. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). 2048, 88, and 80 complex points were recorded in the 1H, 15N, and 13C dimensions, respectively. NMR resonance assignments have been reported previously for Ca2+-loaded JC (BioMagResBank Entry 5324, www.bmrb.wisc.edu (16Christodoulou J. Hu H. Chung J. Rance M. Harper J.F. Chazin W.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 249-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)). For this study the resonances of Ca2+-loaded CaM-LD were assigned by comparison with JC. Although broadly similar, there were some significant differences in the two-dimensional 1H, 15N HSQC profile of JC and CaM-LD. Consequently, three-dimensional HNCO and HNCA spectra were recorded on 13C, 15N-labeled Ca2+-CaM-LD both in the absence and presence of the unlabeled junction peptide and compared with those of JC. Felix2000 (Accelrys, Inc.) was used for processing and display of spectra. For the three-dimensional experiments, linear prediction was used to double the number of points in each of the indirect dimensions before zero-filling. An un-shifted cosine function was applied to each dimension. The Assign module of Felix2000 was employed to assist in assigning resonances and to create overlay plots. Ca2+-affinity Determinations—Macroscopic Ca2+ binding constants (K1–K4) were determined for CDPK constructs using the method of Linse et al. (17Linse S. Johansson C. Brodin P. Grundström T. Drakenberg T. Forsén S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which involves competitive chelation using 5,5′-Br2BAPTA (Molecular Probes) monitored via the absorbance at 263 nm as a function of added calcium. 2A. M. Malmendal, M. R. Nelson, J. Christodoulou, and W. J. Chazin (2001) structbio.vanderbilt.edu/chazin/wisdom/ca_titr_new.html. Titrations were performed at 298 K with 37.3 μm 5,5′-Br2BAPTA in 18 mm KCl and 2 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.2. The concentrations of JC and CaM-LD were 12.4 and 11.6 μm, respectively, as determined by amino acid analysis. The Kd of the chelator under these conditions was found to be 0.22 ± 0.01 μm. At least two determinations were made for each protein preparation. Individual binding constants were determined using the CaLigator software (19Andre I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To examine the significance of a covalent linkage between the junction and the CaM-LD, expression constructs were engineered as shown in Fig. 1. The JC construct incorporating the CaM-LD with the N-terminally tethered junction region contains the full Ca2+ regulatory apparatus of CDPK. Studies of this construct were complemented by a bimolecular version of JC, made up of the isolated CaM-LD plus the free J peptide (J+CaM-LD). Binding events were monitored by CD, heteronuclear NMR, and calcium-affinity measurements. The Global Fold of the CDPK Regulatory Apparatus—Far UV CD spectra in the absence and presence of Ca2+ for JC and the CaM-LD are shown in Fig. 2. As expected from the sequence and structural homology with CaM, the dominant contribution is from helical secondary structure (minima at 208 and 222 nm). These results are consistent with the analysis of the NMR chemical shifts of Ca2+-loaded JC (16Christodoulou J. Hu H. Chung J. Rance M. Harper J.F. Chazin W.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 249-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which showed that the distribution of elements of secondary structure in CaM-LD (Fig. 1B) is very similar to that of CaM. Although the CD spectrum of the Ca2+-free state of JC clearly indicates considerable helical structure is present, its 1H, 15N HSQC spectrum is characterized by broad peaks and very limited chemical shift dispersion (Fig. 3). Together, the CD and NMR data indicate that the protein maintains much if not all of the native secondary structure but lacks a stable tertiary fold in the absence of Ca2+ (20Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1998Google Scholar). The addition of Mg2+ (20–100 mm) in an attempt to stabilize the tertiary structure of the apo protein had no effect on the NMR spectrum. These observations are consistent with the lack of an effect of Mg2+ on the binding of Ca2+ to soybean CDPK (8Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12029-12037Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Significantly higher intensity is found in the CD spectrum of apoJC relative to that of apoCaM-LD (Fig. 2), implying that the J region in JC has partial helical character. Because the J peptide is unstructured on its own, this observation suggests that the CaM-LD interacts with the J region even in the absence of Ca2+. This contrasts with the tethered CaM-M13 (binding sequence from myosin light chain kinase) hybrid system, where no interaction was observed between the M13 peptide and CaM in the absence of Ca2+ (21Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Brown S.E. Porumb T. Zhang M. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3508-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CD has been used to determine whether structural changes occur upon Ca2+ binding. Fig. 2 shows there is an increase in intensity of far UV CD spectra of JC upon the addition of Ca2+. This change in apparent helicity is not attributed to increased helical content but, rather, to a significant change in the spatial distribution of the helices associated with the Ca2+-induced transition from a closed to an open conformation as shown previously for troponin C (22Li M.X. Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8330-8340Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and calmodulin (23Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To obtain insights into the regulatory apparatus, the intrinsic affinity of the J region for the CaM-LD was determined. This involved using NMR to monitor structural changes as J peptide (residues 428–450, numbering as in Fig. 1B) was titrated into a CaM-LD solution, fitting chemical shift changes to a standard binding equation. Changes in the 1H, 15N HSQC spectra saturate at 1.0 (±0.3) mol eq of added J peptide, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry. Saturation at an approximately equimolar ratio was consistent with the Kd of ∼1 μm derived from surface plasmon resonance measurements (7Huang J.F. Teyton L. Harper J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13222-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of J peptide to Ca2+-saturated CaM-LD, an increase in CD intensity was observed. A similar observation has been reported for soybean CDPK (24Weljie A.M. Clarke T.E. Juffer A.H. Harmon A.C. Vogel H.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is consistent with helix formation in the J peptide upon binding to the Ca2+-CaM-LD. A transition from disorder to ordered α-helix is characteristic of many target peptides that interact with CaM (25O'Neill K.T. Degrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 26Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the magnitude of the change in CD for J+CaM-LD is so large it cannot be explained solely by J adopting α-helical conformation. We propose that binding of J further alters the disposition of the CaM-LD helices. Note that the CD profile of CaM-LD in the presence of J peptide and Ca2+ is similar to that observed for Ca2+-loaded JC. This suggests that the unimolecular and bimolecular CaM-LD+J systems adopt similar structures in the fully calcium-loaded state. Ca2+-affinity Determinations—The Ca2+ binding constants (Kd) for JC and CaM-LD (Table I) were determined by competition against BAPTA, a standard Ca2+ chelator with known Ca2+ affinity, using the approach of Linse et al. (17Linse S. Johansson C. Brodin P. Grundström T. Drakenberg T. Forsén S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). K1–K4 are the macroscopic binding constants for the binding of four ions of Ca2+ to JC. The assignment of these binding constants to specific sites in the protein requires very detailed analysis, but assignment to individual domains is somewhat easier, particularly when one domain has significantly higher binding constants than the other (27Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For JC, two pairs of co-operative binding events were observed (Fig. 4), characterized by dissociation constants of log K1,2,mean = log(K1·K2)1/2 = 8.3 and log K3,4,mean = log(K3·K4)1/2 = 6.9. The binding constants for the two stronger sites in CaM-LD are ∼2 orders of magnitude lower in CaM-LD than in JC. In the two weaker sites, the affinities in CaM-LD are so drastically reduced by the absence of the J region that their dissociation constants are in the millimolar range and could not be accurately measured. This binding affinity is well below that of Ca2+ sites participating in Ca2+ signal transduction pathways and points to the great importance of the J region in the CDPK regulatory apparatus.Table IMacroscopic Ca2+ binding constants of CDPK JC and CaM-LD[KCl]log K1log K2log K3Log K4mmJCaK1 and K2 are shown to correspond to the C-lobe sites and K3 and K4 to N-lobe sites (see text for explanation).

Open table in a new tab The C-lobe Contains the Higher Affinity Ca2+ Sites—To learn more about the mode of action of the CaM-LD, NMR was used to characterize the Ca2+ binding events in a site-specific manner. For these experiments, Ca2+ was titrated into a solution of JC, and two-dimensional 1H, 15N HSQC spectra were recorded at each step. The intensities of 45 well-resolved residues scattered across the protein sequence could be monitored in these spectra. At Ca2+ levels below 0.1 mol eq there is severe attenuation of already weak signals from apoJC, presumably because of conformational exchange between the apo and various subsaturated Ca2+ states. Above 0.1 mol eq of Ca2+, a number of signals from the C-lobe begin to appear at the same positions as in the spectrum of fully Ca2+-loaded JC (Fig. 3B). These signals continue to increase in intensity throughout the Ca2+ titration. The observation of this subset of relatively narrow signals implies the species to which it corresponds is in slow exchange with the heterogeneous ensemble of other states that we presume have partial loading of Ca2+. The putative complete filling of sites at substoichiometric levels of Ca2+ suggests binding occurs in a cooperative manner. As noted above, the first signals to appear are all from the C-lobe. In fact, differences in the relative intensity of signals from the N- and C-lobes were observed over the full course of the titration. Fig. 5 shows selected results for residues from the four calcium binding loops and for Leu-441 in the J region. At Ca2+ concentrations below 0.5 mol eq, only resonances from residues in the C-lobe (Ala-530 and onward) are observed, and these continue to have significantly higher intensity until the latter stages of the titration. These observations indicate that the high affinity Ca2+ sites are located in the C-lobe. Because the affinities differ by a factor of 25, the assignment of two pairs of binding constants to the individual CaM-LD domains is reliable. The Junction Region Interacts Predominantly with the C-lobe—NMR was also used to structurally characterize the interaction of J with the CaM-LD. Titration of the J peptide into a solution of CaM-LD caused significant perturbations in a number of CaM-LD resonances. Interestingly, plots of the chemical shift changes of backbone amides against the sequence (Fig. 6A) show large changes (>±0.1 ppm) occur almost exclusively for residues in the C-terminal lobe, with the most significant effects on residues in and around helix 7. This observation implies that the binding interactions of J with the C-lobe are stronger. Additional insight was obtained from a qualitative assessment of the rates of amide proton exchange with solvent (Fig. 6). When a sample of Ca2+-loaded JC was lyophilized then dissolved in D2O, the vast majority of signals remaining in the 1H, 15N HSQC spectrum arise from the C-lobe, indicating more protection of this domain. The data are, thus, consistent with the J region interacting predominantly with and stabilizing the C-lobe of the CaM-LD. One additional point of interest is that the NMR chemical shifts at the end of the titration of J into Ca2+-saturated CaM-LD"
https://openalex.org/W2027044703,"To investigate the potential role of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the regulation of actin polymerization and GLUT4 translocation, the type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) were expressed in 3T3L1 adipocytes. In preadipocytes (fibroblasts) PIP5K expression promoted actin polymerization on membrane-bound vesicles to form motile actin comets. In contrast, expression of PIP5K in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in the formation of enlarged vacuole-like structures coated with F-actin, cortactin, dynamin, and N-WASP. Treatment with either latrunculin B (an inhibitor for actin polymerization) or Clostridium difficile toxin B (a general Rho family inhibitor) resulted in a relatively slower disappearance of coated F-actin from these vacuoles, but the vacuoles themselves remained unaffected. Functionally, the increased PI(4,5)P2 levels resulted in an inhibition of transferrin receptor and GLUT4 endocytosis and a slow accumulation of these proteins in the PI(4,5)P2-enriched vacuoles along with the non-clathrin-derived endosome marker (caveolin) and the AP-2 adaptor complex. However, these structures were devoid of early endosome markers (EEA1, clathrin) and the biosynthetic membrane secretory machinery markers p115 (Golgi) and syntaxin 6 (trans-Golgi Network). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 has distinct morphologic and functional properties depending upon specific cell context. In adipocytes, altered PI(4,5)P2 metabolism has marked effects on GLUT4 endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking due to the derangement of actin dynamics. To investigate the potential role of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the regulation of actin polymerization and GLUT4 translocation, the type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) were expressed in 3T3L1 adipocytes. In preadipocytes (fibroblasts) PIP5K expression promoted actin polymerization on membrane-bound vesicles to form motile actin comets. In contrast, expression of PIP5K in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in the formation of enlarged vacuole-like structures coated with F-actin, cortactin, dynamin, and N-WASP. Treatment with either latrunculin B (an inhibitor for actin polymerization) or Clostridium difficile toxin B (a general Rho family inhibitor) resulted in a relatively slower disappearance of coated F-actin from these vacuoles, but the vacuoles themselves remained unaffected. Functionally, the increased PI(4,5)P2 levels resulted in an inhibition of transferrin receptor and GLUT4 endocytosis and a slow accumulation of these proteins in the PI(4,5)P2-enriched vacuoles along with the non-clathrin-derived endosome marker (caveolin) and the AP-2 adaptor complex. However, these structures were devoid of early endosome markers (EEA1, clathrin) and the biosynthetic membrane secretory machinery markers p115 (Golgi) and syntaxin 6 (trans-Golgi Network). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 has distinct morphologic and functional properties depending upon specific cell context. In adipocytes, altered PI(4,5)P2 metabolism has marked effects on GLUT4 endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking due to the derangement of actin dynamics. Insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in striated muscle and adipose tissue is induced by translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform (GLUT4) from intracellular storage sites to the plasma membrane (1Pessin J.E.

In the basal state, GLUT4 cycles slowly between the plasma membrane and multiple intracellular compartments, with the most of GLUT4 residing inside the cell. In contrast, insulin binding to its specific receptor evokes a large increase in the rate of GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis, with a small decrease in the rate of its internalization by endocytosis (4Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol.

Thus, the enhanced glucose uptake in response to insulin is achieved by a net increase of GLUT4 protein levels on the cell surface resulting from the insulin-induced shift in the cellular dynamics of GLUT4 vesicle trafficking. Recently multiple studies have begun to dissect the molecular machinery involved in the trafficking of GLUT4 vesicles, and it is increasingly apparent that both the microtubule (7Fletcher L.M.

Several recent studies have suggested a mechanism linking phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) with actin polymerization through the function of N-WASP.

We have reported recently that insulin stimulates N-WASP-dependent formation of actin comet tails on GLUT4-containing endosomes (40Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49331-49336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and also that the expression of a dominant-interfering N-WASP lacking the VCA domain in 3T3L1 adipocytes significantly inhibited GLUT4 translocation (14Jiang Z.Y.

In fibroblasts, expression of type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) to generate PI(4,5)P2 results in actin comet tails that can propel vesicles from donor to acceptor compartments through the cytoplasm in an N-WASP-dependent manner (41Rozelle A.L.

Furthermore, PIP5K can recruit the large GTP-binding protein dynamin to actin comet tails (43Schafer D.A. Weed S.A. Binns D. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 44Lee E. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Time-lapse microscopy in living cells suggested that the formation of PIP5K-induced actin comet tails was reflective of the rapid motility of intracellular membranes, including endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (44Lee E. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and the vesicles from the Golgi complex (41Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M.

Interestingly, actin comets are reportedly formed preferentially from vesicles that are enriched in lipid rafts containing high levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids, and disruption of lipid rafts reduces the number of actin comet tails (41Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr.

Together, these data raise the possibility of a direct linkage among PI(4,5)P2, actin polymerization, and vesicle transport. On the other hand, PI(4,5)P2 also appears to play an important role in the assembly/disassembly of plasma membrane endocytotic coat proteins. In the process of endocytosis, PIP2 serves as a binding site for multiple proteins crucial for the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles (46Jost M. Simpson F. Kavran J.M. Lemmon M.A. Schmid S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gaidarov I. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 48Cremona O.

Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). For example, mutants of both epsin (responsible for recruiting clathrin) and AP-2 (responsible for binding endocytic cargo) that are unable to bind to PIP2 function in a dominant-interfering manner to inhibit endocytosis (49Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 50Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 209-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, reagents that sequester PIP2 also block clathrin-dependent endocytosis in vitro (46Jost M. Simpson F. Kavran J.M. Lemmon M.A. Schmid S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several other components of the endocytic machinery also interact directly with PIP2, including Eps15, AP-180, dynamin, and clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM) (51Ford M.G.

Thus, the functional role of PI(4,5)P2 in the control of specific types of actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking events appears to be markedly cell context-dependent. To explore relationship among N-WASP-dependent actin polymerization, PI(4,5)P2 metabolism, GLUT4 endocytosis, and translocation, we examined effect of PIP5K expression on actin organization and membrane transport pathways in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Our data demonstrate that increased PI(4,5)P2 production by PIP5K expression in 3T3L1 adipocytes induces intracellular multiple vacuoles coated with F-actin, N-WASP, dynamin, cortactin, caveolin, and the integrin β1 receptor subunit consistent with the convergence of fused endosomes from both clathrin- and non-clathrin-derived endocytic vesicles. These data also demonstrate that derangement of PI(4,5)P2 metabolism severely affects the endocytic recycling pathway that consequently results in a persistent GLUT4 localization at the cell surface.

The cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody for 2 h at room temperature, mounted in Vectashield, and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cholesterol Loading and Extraction—To examine the effect of cholesterol, cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes were synthesized as described previously (60Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Briefly, 9.5 mg of cholesterol was dissolved in 126 μl of isopropyl alcohol:CHCl3 (2:1) solution. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (315 mg) was dissolved in 3.46 ml of water and heated to 80 °C with stirring. The cholesterol was added to methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and the solution was stirred until clear. This solution contained 6.8 mm cholesterol. For use, complexes were diluted into medium to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. For cholesterol removal experiments, 18 h after electroporation PIP5K-expressing cells were treated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min. Increased Expression of PIP5K Induces Actin Comet Tails in 3T3L1 Fibroblasts but Results in F-actin-coated Intracellular Vacuoles in 3T3L1 Adipocytes—To examine the role of PI(4,5)P2 in the GLUT4 translocation process, we initially expressed the type I PIP5Ks in both 3T3L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. In 3T3L1 fibroblasts (preadipocytes), overexpression of PIP5Kγ87kDa resulted in a formation of several cytoplasmic actin comet tails (Fig. 1, a–d). The PI(4,5)P2 formation of actin comet tails observed in our 3T3L1 fibroblasts was similar to that observed previously in several other fibroblast cell lines (41Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M.

A. 2002; 99: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that about 50% of PIP5K-induced actin comet tails were formed from PIP5K-positive vesicles (41Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), we seldom observed PIP5K accumulation at the head of actin comet tails (Fig. 1d). This suggests that an increased level of PI(4,5)P2 concentration on the vesicles themselves, rather than PIP5K protein itself, is sufficient for the formation of actin comet tails. In contrast to the preadipocytes, expression of PIP5K (90-kDa and 87-kDa isoforms) in 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in a formation of multiple aggregated intracellular vacuoles that were coated with F-actin (Fig. 2A, a–d and i–l). Three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal images demonstrated that these PIP5K-induced vacuoles were present in the interior of the 3T3L1 adipocytes and were not open to the extracellular space (Fig. 1B). Consistent with these data, the vacuolar structures were not accessible to the transferrin ligand at 4 °C (see Fig. 6).Fig. 2Overexpression of type I PIP5K induces PI(4,5)P2-containing multiple vacuoles coated with F-actin in 3T3L1 adipocytes. A, 3T3L1 adipocytes were electroporated with the cDNAs encoding EGFP-tagged PIP5Kγ90kDa (a–d), its K138A mutant (e–h), PIP5Kγ87kDa (i–l), or its K138A mutant (m–p). 18 h later, the cells were fixed and subjected to confocal microscopy for EGFP (a, e, i, and m), rhodamine-phalloidin (b, f, j, and n), and DAPI (c, g, k, and o). The merged images are shown in d, h, l, and p. These are a representative field of cells from three or four independent experiments. B, 3T3L1 adipocytes were electroporated with the empty vector (a and e) or cDNAs encoding HA-tagged PIP5Kβ plus cDNA encoding either EGFP-tagged PLCδ/PH domain (a–d) or EGFP-tagged GRP/PH domain (e–h). 18 h later, the cells were serum starved, fixed, and subjected to confocal fluorescent microscopy for the expressed HA-tagged PIP5Kβ (b and f) and expressed EGFP-tagged PLCδ/PH (c) or EGFP-tagged GRP/PH (g).

Binding of GCN2 to GCN1 is required for stimulation of GCN2 kinase activity by uncharged tRNA in starved cells. Here we show that YIH1, when overexpressed, dampens the GAAC response (Gcn– phenotype) by suppressing eIF2α phosphorylation by GCN2. The overexpressed YIH1 binds GCN1 and reduces GCN1-GCN2 complex formation, and, consistent with this, the Gcn– phenotype produced by YIH1 overexpression is suppressed by GCN2 overexpression. YIH1 interacts with the same GCN1 fragment that binds GCN2, and this YIH1-GCN1 interaction requires Arg-2259 in GCN1 in vitro and in full-length GCN1 in vivo, as found for GCN2-GCN1 interaction. However, deletion of YIH1 does not increase eIF2α phosphorylation or derepress the GAAC, suggesting that YIH1 at native levels is not a general inhibitor of GCN2 activity. We discovered that YIH1 normally resides in a complex with monomeric actin, rather than GCN1, and that a genetic reduction in actin levels decreases the GAAC response. This Gcn– phenotype was partially suppressed by deletion of YIH1, consistent with YIH1-mediated inhibition of GCN2 in actin-deficient cells. We suggest that YIH1 resides in a YIH1-actin complex and may be released for inhibition of GCN2 and stimulation of protein synthesis under specialized conditions or in a restricted cellular compartment in which YIH1 is displaced from monomeric actin.

Phosphorylation of the α subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2α, α subunit of translation initiation factor 2; GAAC, general amino acid control; NTD, N-terminal domain; 3AT, 3-aminotriazole; 5FT, 5-fluoro-dl-tryptophan; TRA, triazolealanine; SM, sulfometuron; WCE, whole cell extract; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is a key regulatory mechanism for down-regulating protein synthesis in response to starvation or stress in eukaryotic cells. Four different eIF2α kinases have been identified in mammalian cells that are activated by different stimuli: HRI by hemin deprivation (1Chen J.-J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 529-546Google Scholar), PKR by double-stranded RNA (2Kaufman R. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar), PEK or PERK by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (3Ron D. Harding H.P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 547-560Google Scholar), and GCN2 by amino acid starvation (4Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar, 5Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). eIF2 is necessary for delivery of charged initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAMeti) to the 40 S ribosomal subunits in an eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAMeti ternary complex and is released from the initiation complex in the inactive GDP-bound form. Phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51 by eIF2α kinases converts eIF2 from a substrate to an inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. Since only eIF2-GTP can bind Met-tRNAMeti, the inhibition of eIF2B evoked by eIF2 phosphorylation leads to a decrease in ternary complex formation and a general reduction in protein synthesis (4Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). GCN2 is the sole eIF2α kinase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it was first identified as being required for growth under amino acid starvation conditions. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 induces the translation of GCN4 mRNA, encoding a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, while dampening the translation of most other messages. Four short open reading frames in the GCN4 mRNA leader underlie a specialized reinitiation mechanism that allows efficient translation of this mRNA when the ternary complex level drops (4Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). The increased expression of GCN4 and its amino acid biosynthetic target genes in starved cells is known as general amino acid control (GAAC) (6Hinnebusch A.G. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319-414Google Scholar). GCN2 is present as a latent kinase under nonstarvation conditions and is activated by uncharged tRNAs that accumulate in amino acid-starved cells. The uncharged tRNA binds to a regulatory domain in GCN2 that resembles histidyl-tRNA synthetase, and this interaction is believed to induce a conformational change that overcomes an intrinsic defect in the adjacent kinase domain (7Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The products of GCN1 and GCN20 are also necessary for the activation of GCN2 by uncharged tRNA in starved cells (11Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3184-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). GCN1 and GCN20 form a protein complex (12Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3184-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of GCN2, which is highly conserved among all GCN2 orthologs. The GCN2 NTD is required for kinase function in vivo, and its overexpression impairs complex formation between native GCN1 and GCN2 and produces a dominant Gcn– (general control noninducible) phenotype (13Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A C-terminal segment in GCN1 is necessary and sufficient for complex formation with the GCN2 NTD and, when overexpressed in vivo, competes with full-length GCN1 for GCN2 binding and likewise confers a dominant Gcn– phenotype (14Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Arginine 2259 in the GCN2-binding domain of GCN1 was shown to be essential for GCN1/GCN2 association in vivo, and the Gcn– phenotype produced by mutating this residue was suppressed by overexpressing GCN2 (15Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Other point mutations in the GCN2-NTD and GCN1 C-terminal region that impair interaction of these segments in the yeast two-hybrid assay also conferred a Gcn– phenotype and diminished eIF2α phosphorylation in starved cells (16Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17591-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Together, these findings demonstrate that association between the NTD of GCN2 and the C-terminal region of GCN1 is required for eIF2α phosphorylation by GCN2 and the GAAC response in amino acid-starved cells. GCN1 and GCN2 can interact independently with ribosomes, and these interactions are thought to be crucial for activation of GCN2 in starved cells (8Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G.

Genetic evidence further suggests that GCN1 binds near the decoding (A) site of the ribosome. These findings have led to a model in which GCN1 and GCN2 are tethered to the ribosome in a GCN1-GCN20-GCN2 complex, wherein GCN1 facilitates transfer of uncharged tRNA from the A-site to the tRNA-binding domain in GCN2 for kinase activation (15Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Marton M.J. Aldana C.R.V.d. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This proposed mechanism has similarities with that demonstrated in Escherichia coli for activation of RelA protein by uncharged tRNA in the A site, which mediates the stringent response to amino acid starvation (19Cashel M. Rudd K.E. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Magasanik B. Low K.B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1410-1438Google Scholar, 20Goldman E. Jakubowski H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2035-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). YIH1, a yeast homologue of the mouse gene IMPACT (an imprinted gene of unknown function), has a domain related in sequence to the GCN2 NTD and was shown to interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay with the same region of GCN1 that binds to GCN2 (14Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). If YIH1 and GCN2 compete for the same binding site on GCN1 in vivo, then overexpressing YIH1 might displace GCN2 from GCN1 and impede the activation of GCN2 and attendant derepression of GCN4 translation, producing a Gcn– phenotype. In fact, it was found that overexpression of YIH1 had a dominant negative Gcn– phenotype, conferring sensitivity to an inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis, 3-aminotriazole (3AT) (14Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, no further evidence was provided that YIH1 functions by dissociation of the GCN1-GCN2 complex or that it serves as an authentic negative regulator of GCN2 when expressed at native levels in yeast cells. In this report, we provide direct evidence that overexpressing YIH1 impedes the GAAC response by competing with GCN2 for GCN1 binding, thus reducing the concentration of GCN1-GCN2 complexes in the cell and decreasing phosphorylation of eIF2α. However, deletion of YIH1 does not have a detectable effect on GCN2 kinase function under nonstarvation or starvation conditions, indicating that YIH1 at native levels is not a general inhibitor of GCN2. Interestingly, we found that YIH1 copurifies with monomeric actin (G-actin) and that a reduction in actin levels produces a Gcn– phenotype that is at least partly dependent on YIH1. These findings raise the possibility that YIH1 inhibits GCN2 only under certain growth conditions or in restricted locations in the cell, where YIH1 is displaced from G-actin. Strains and Plasmids—Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Tables I and II, respectively. Details of their construction are as follows. To generate HIS3+ versions of strains BY4741, 5780, 4562, 5688, and 249, the wild type HIS3 gene was excised from plasmid pRS413 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as an Eco47III/NsiI fragment and used to transform each stain to His+. The conversion of his3Δ to HIS3 was verified by PCR amplification of genomic DNA (22Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Dickerson M.M. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

The LEU2 marker was evicted via introduction of the Cre expression plasmid pSH65 (23Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and the URA3 marker was evicted by selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid medium. Successful replacement of the YIH1 alleles by the respective selective markers in the resulting yih1Δ::hisG/yih1Δ::loxP strain ESY12A-a and ACT1/act1Δ yih1Δ::hisG/yih1Δ::loxP strain ESY6F-b was verified by PCR analysis using primers that flank the YIH1 open reading frame. The ACT1 gene and its promoter were amplified from yeast strain BY4741 using primers designed to contain EcoRI sites that anneal to sequences upstream (Act1-UP, 5′-CAC ACG AAT TCA AAT AAG ACA CAC GCG AGA AC-3′) and downstream (Act1-DOWN, 5′-GAG AGG AAT TCA TAT GAT ACA CGG TCC AAT GG-3′) of the ACT1 coding region. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of YCplac33 (24Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) to create plasmid pMJS1. For construction of plasmids expressing the YIH1 gene from a heterologous promoter, the YIH1 open reading frame was PCR-amplified from yeast strain BY4741 using primer ES400-4 (CGC CCC GGG ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAT GAC GAC AAG GGA TCC GAT GAC GAT CAC GAA CAG TTG), containing at bases 4–9 an XmaI site, at 10–12 an ATG codon, at 13–36 the FLAG tag, at 37–42 a BamHI site, and at 43–63 YIH1 codons 2–8, and primer ES400-2 (CGA AAG CTT GTC GAC AGA ACT TGA AAT CGG ATT TCA TT), containing at bases 4–9 a HindIII site, at 10–15 a SalI site, and at 16–39 a sequence from ∼220 bases downstream of YIH1. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the same restriction sites of pET28a (Stratagene) and pES128-9-1 (15Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), yielding pES189-D1A and pES187-B1, respectively. For construction of pES191-H1, the PCR fragment was cut with XmaI and HindIII and inserted into p2444 digested with the same enzymes. 3G. Pavitt and A. G. Hinnebusch, unpublished observations. p2444 is a derivative of pEMBLyex4 (25Cesareni G. Murray J.A.H. Setlow J.K. Hollaender A. Genetic Engineering: Principals and Methods. 9. Plenum Press, New York, NY1987: 135-154Google Scholar) where the URA3 marker is replaced by the TRP1 marker. For construction of a low copy plasmid containing YIH1 under its own promoter, the YIH1 gene was PCR-amplified as outlined above, except that primer ES400-1 (TAC GGC GGC CGC TCT GCT TTT CAA ATT GGC TCA T, containing at bases 5–12 a NotI site and at 13–34 a sequence corresponding to 170–190 bases upstream of YIH1) and primer 400-2 were used. The PCR fragment was digested with NotI and SalI and introduced into pRS316 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes, resulting in pES185-1. For introduction of a FLAG tag N-terminal to YIH1, a fusion PCR was performed using as the outside primers ES400-1 (described above) and primer ES400-8 (CGG GAA GGA GAT CTG CAG T), containing at bases 9–14 the unique BglII site in YIH1 and bases 132–150 of the YIH1 open reading frame. The mutagenic primers for introduction of the FLAG tag were antisense primer ES400-5 (TC CAT TGA GCT TTT CTT TCC TC), containing at bases 3–5 the start codon and bases 6–22 from immediately upstream of YIH1, and sense primer ES400-6 (GAG GAA AGA AAA GCT CAA TGG ACT ACA AGG ACG ATG AC), containing bases 1–17 from immediately upstream of YIH1, at bases 18–20 the start codon, and at bases 21–38 the first six codons of the FLAG tag. Two separate PCRs were performed, one amplifying the sequence extending from the upstream cloning site NotI to the YIH1 ATG using primers ES400-1 and ES400-5 and pES185-1 as template and the second reaction amplifying sequences extending from the YIH1 ATG to the BglII site in the YIH1 gene with primers ES400-6 and ES400-8, using pES191-H1 as template. The two PCR products were fused together by performing a third PCR with primers ES400-1 and ES400-8 and the products of the first two PCR reactions as template. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with NotI and BglII and used to replace the NotI-BglII fragment in pES185-1, resulting in pES196-6-4. The SalI-SacI fragment of pES196-6-4, containing the FLAG-YIH1 gene including surrounding sequences, was introduced into YIplac211 digested with the same enzymes (24Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar), resulting in pES197-1. For construction of pES200-2, the MluI-SalI fragment of p1832 was used to replace the MluI-SalI fragment excised from pES174-3-2 (15Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The YIH1::hisG::URA3::hisG deletion cassette was constructed as follows. A 100-bp fragment immediately upstream of YIH1 was PCR-amplified from yeast strain BY4741 using primers ES400-22 and ES200-23. Bases 6–11 of ES400-22 introduce an XbaI site, and bases 12–32 correspond to bases 83–103 upstream of YIH1 (GCG CGT CTA GAC TTG TGC AGT CAT ATA CGC TG). Bases 9–14 of ES400-23 introduce a BglII site, and bases 15–36 anneal to the 22 bases immediately upstream of YIH1 (TCA TAA TGA GAT CTT GAG CTT TTC TTT CCT CTC TCT). Similarly, a 130-bp fragment immediately downstream of YIH1 was PCR-amplified using primers ES400-24 and ES200-25. Bases 9–14 of primer ES200-24 introduce a BglII site, bases 15–36 anneal to the 22 bases immediately downstream of YIH1, and bases 1–22 are complementary to bases 1–22 of primer ES400-23 (AAA GCT CAA GAT CTC ATT ATG ATT ATG TCA AGC ACC). Bases 6–11 of primer ES200-25 introduce a SalI site, and bases 12–33 anneal 110–131 bases downstream of YIH1 (GCC GCG TCG ACT ACC TAG AAC TAT ACT CGA AAC). By a subsequent PCR using both PCR-amplified fragments just described as templates and primers ES400-22 and ES400-25, the 100-bp sequence upstream and 130-bp sequence downstream of YIH1 were fused together and separated by only a BglII site. The fusion product was digested with XbaI and SalI and introduced into the similarly digested plasmid pBluescript (Stratagene), yielding pES221-6. The hisG::URA3::hisG cassette was excised from plasmid pHQ2212 with BamHI and inserted into BglII-digested pES221-6, resulting in pES222-202-2. Quick Preparation of Genomic DNA from Yeast Cells for PCRs—Cell pellets from 5 ml of yeast overnight cultures were resuspended in 200 μl of TE buffer. 100 μl of glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) and 200 μl of phenol were added, and the samples were vortexed for 2 min. The supernatant was extracted once with 200 μl of chloroform and then used directly as a template in PCRs. Protein Techniques—In vitro and in vivo binding assays using GST and His6 fusion proteins and co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (15Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using gradient gels (4–12 or 4–20%; Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized in gels by staining with Coomassie R250 (0.1% (w/v) in 40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid) and subsequent treatment with destain solution I (20% ethanol, 7% acetic acid) and destain solution II (10% ethanol, 5% acetic acid). For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and proteins on the membranes were stained with Ponceau S (0.5% (w/v), in 1% acetic acid) according to standard procedures (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 18.67Google Scholar).

Immune complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase conjugated to donkey anti-rabbit antibodies, to sheep anti-mouse antibodies (for detection of flag antibodies), or to protein A (for detection of actin antibodies) (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of the YIH1-containing Complex—Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium to exponential phase (A600 = 10) in a 10-liter fermentor, harvested via continuous flow centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1× complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) to about 1 g of cells/ml, and passed twice through a French pressure cell. Cell debris was removed (10,500 rpm, 15 min), and the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 42"

We have determined the crystal structures of the mouse CISK-PX domain to unravel the structural basis of membrane targeting of CISK. In addition to the specific interactions conferred by the phosphoinositide-binding pocket, the structure suggests that a hydrophobic loop region and a hydrophilic β-turn contribute to the interactions with the membrane.

PIs have been universally utilized by membranes in restricting the proteins with PI-binding motifs to their desired sites (1Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev.

Among the important PI-binding modules, PH, FYVE, FERM, and ENTH domains play important roles in membrane localization of a variety of signaling proteins (6Cullen P.J. Cozier G.E. Banting G.

The phox homology domain (PX domain), recently identified as a PI-binding motif, has been found in more than 100 eukaryotic proteins with diverse functions (9Ellson C.D. Andrews S. Stephens L.R.

For example, p40phox and p47phox are involved in neutrophil defense; Vam7p and sorting nexins (SNXs) participate in protein trafficking; and PI3K C2-γ, CISK, PLD1, and RGS-PX1 are important signal transducing molecules (12Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Membrane targeting through the interaction between the PX domain and specific PIs appears to be a critical step in regulating PX domain-containing proteins. Consistent with the low sequence similarity among the PX domains, different PX domains exhibit different PI binding specificity (13Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For example, p40phox, Vam7p, SNX3, SNX7, and SNX16 bind PtdIns(3)P specifically with moderate to high affinity, whereas p47phox interacts with PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PI3K C2-γ interacts with PtIns(4,5)P2 (13Song X.

The cytokine-independent survival kinase (CISK), the only member of the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase family to contain an intact PX domain, functions downstream of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and plays an important role in cell growth and survival (19Kobayashi T.

Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/oc_sigtrans;2001/108/re17)PubMed Google Scholar). CISK is composed of an N-terminal PX domain, a conserved linker region, a Ser/Thr kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. CISK is structurally homologous to the protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt kinase family that plays essential roles in cell survival and insulin response with the major difference being the N-terminal PH domain in PKB/Akt instead of the PX domain in CISK (Fig. 1). Because of their similar domain organizations and regulatory phosphorylation sites, CISK and PKB/Akt are believed to respond to the PI 3-kinase signal in a similar manner (20Liu D. Yang X. Songyang Z. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). PIs with a 3-phosphate group produced upon PI 3-kinase activation interact with the PH domain of partially phosphorylated PKB/Akt, which may induce a conformational change in PKB/Akt that facilitates further phosphorylation and complete activation of PKB/Akt (24James S.R.

Whether the interaction between the CISK-PX domain and PIs has a similar effect on CISK activity in response to PI 3-kinase signaling is still unclear. Most interesting, mutations in the PX domain that disrupt the localization of CISK also impair CISK activity in vivo (27Xu J. Liu D. Gill G. Songyang Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PX domains from p40phox/p47phox, Vam7p, and sorting nexins can bind PtdIns(3)P (14Ellson C.D. Gobert-Gosse S. Anderson K.E.

A. 2001; 98: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) but exhibits high affinity for PIs containing a 5-phosphate group (27Xu J. Liu D. Gill G. Songyang Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of the mouse CISK-PX domain. The structure displays special features of the PI-binding pocket of CISK-PX and reveals additional structural elements involved in the membrane attachment by CISK. Our biochemical studies suggest that the linker region located C-terminal to the CISK-PX domain is necessary for PX domain dimerization, which supports a multivalent mechanism in membrane localization of CISK. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—Two CISK-PX fragments were used for the crystallographic studies. One contained the PX domain (short-PX, residues 7–126) and another contained both the PX domain and the linker between the PX domain and kinase domain (long-PX, residues 7–160) (Fig. 1). Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (29Xing Y. Xu W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1816-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, glutathione S-transferase-tagged native mouse CISK-PX fragments (long-PX and short-PX) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells in LB medium under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Selenomethionine-derivatized long-PX domain (SeMet-long-PX) was expressed in the auxotrophic E. coli cell line B834 in minimum LB medium based on a protocol for leaky protein expression (30Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Both native PX (long-PX and short-PX) and SeMet-long-PX were purified with the glutathione affinity column, the Q-Sepharose HP column, and the SP-Sepharose HP column (29Xing Y. Xu W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1816-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Purified native PX and SeMet-long-PX were finally concentrated to ∼10–15 mg/ml, respectively, into stock solution (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Purified native long-PX and SeMet-long-PX were crystallized by using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contains 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5–5.8, and 2.0 m sodium malonate buffered to pH 5.5–5.8 (29Xing Y. Xu W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1816-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The short-PX fragment was crystallized as thin plates (0.01 × 0.01 × 0.2 mm) in hanging drops using 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m (NH4)2SO4, and 25% PEG 5000 as the reservoir solution. These crystals were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen from the crystallization drops for data collection. For each CISK-PX fragment, co-crystallization with up to 4 mm Di-C4PtdIns(3,4,5)P2 or Di-C4PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Echelon, Utah) were extensively screened to obtain PI-bound CISK-PX crystals. All the crystals were further soaked in various cryoprotection solutions containing up to 4 mm PIs. To stabilize the interaction between CISK-PX and PIs in the crystal, we also extensively screened crystal stabilization conditions with lower salt concentrations. However, removal of sulfate ions from short-PX crystals or decrease of sodium malonate concentration in long-PX crystals during the soaking process resulted in the loss of diffraction ability of those crystals. Data Collection and Structure Determination—These two CISK-PX fragments were crystallized in different crystal forms. A 1.6-Å native data set and a 2.0-Å selenomethionine SAD data set were collected for long-PX fragment crystals in space group I4. A 2.2-Å native data set was collected for short-PX fragment crystals in space group P21212. Data sets were processed with the HKL program suite (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). SAD phases were calculated using SOLVE with the data truncated to 3.0 Å.

Dynamic Light Scattering—DLS was carried out using a DynaPro-99 molecular-sizing instrument equipped with a microsampler (Protein Solutions, Inc.). Two CISK-PX fragments (long-PX and short-PX) were used in the experiment. Protein samples (5 mg/ml stored in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) were loaded into a 16-μl chamber quartz cuvette after centrifugation filtration in the presence or absence of 2 mm Di-C4PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or Di-C4PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Echelon Corp.).

Both long-PX and short-PX fragments were dialyzed into the reaction solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Reactions using protein concentrations of 1 mg/ml were performed under the conditions suggested by the vendor for 1 h. 0.7 μl of sulfo-EGS (76 mm) was added to 20 μl of PX domain fragments (1 mg/ml). The reaction mixtures with a final sulfo-EGS concentration of 2.6 mm were incubated at 20 °C. Samples were taken after 30 and 60 min, respectively, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Overall Structure of CISK-PX Domain—Crystal structure of the long-PX fragment in space group I4 has one molecule per asymmetric unit. Final model of the long-PX contains residues 10–125 (Fig. 2A). The structure of the short-PX fragment in space group P21212 has two molecules per asymmetric unit with residues 11–121 in molecule A and 13–125 in molecule B (Fig. 2B). The overall fold of the CISK-PX domain is composed of a β-sheet with three antiparallel β-strands (β1, β2, and β3) and a helical subdomain consisting of four α-helices (α1, α2, α3, and α3′) together with a type II polyproline (PPII) region and a 310 helix. A β-bulge at residues 19 and 20 in the middle of strand β1 twists the β-sheet (Fig. 2A). Di-C4PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or Di-C4PtdIns(3,5)P2 was not visible in either crystal form, although multiple data sets were collected for crystals of each CISK-PX fragment from co-crystallization and soaking. Instead, CISK-PX in the P21212 crystal form is bound with two sulfates, which are introduced by the crystallization solution (Fig. 2B). Sulfate A from molecule A or sulfate B from molecule B in the P21212 crystal form is found sitting in the putative PI-binding pocket of CISK-PX domain at the same position as the 3-phosphate of PtdIns(3)P bound to the p40phox-PX (37Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, B and C). Another sulfate (sulfate A′ from molecule A or sulfate B′ from molecule B) is on a solvent-accessible surface (Fig. 2B). The presence of sulfate ions (0.15 m (NH4)2SO4) in short-PX crystals or high ionic strength (2.0 m sodium malonate) in the long-PX crystal growth condition may account for the absence of phosphoinositides in the positively charged PI-binding pocket in both crystal forms of CISK-PX. Structure superposition of the CISK-PX domain from two different space groups results in an overall r.m.s.d. ∼0.78 Å based on 106 Cα positions of molecule A and r.m.s.d. ∼0.82 Å based on 107 Cα positions of molecule B in P21212 crystal form. However, there is a significant backbone shift around the β-turn connecting the first and second β-strand involving 11 residues with the largest Cα displacement around 5 Å (Fig. 2B). Comparison of CISK-PX domain structure with the crystal structures of p40phox-PX and p47phox-PX reveals that the core secondary elements of PX domains are closely superimposable (37Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). r.m.s.d. of CISK-PX (molecule B from space group P21212) and p40phox-PX is ∼1.37 Å based on 97 Cα atoms. CISK-PX (molecule B from space group P21212) and p47phox-PX has an r.m.s.d. ∼1.46 Å based on 86 Cα atoms (Fig. 2C). The major structural difference of those PX domains is in the PPII region. The α1/PPII loop in the CISK-PX domain forms a compact turn, whereas the same region in p40phox-PX and p47phox-PX is a wide turn with a 10-residue insertion (Fig. 2, C and D). The PPII/α2 loop at the C-terminal end of the PPII, which forms one wall of the PI-binding pocket, assumes several distinct backbone conformations in different PX domain structures (Fig. 2C), which provides important clues to the selectivity of the PI-binding pocket (see below). Many PX domain-containing proteins have one or more SH3 domains, which supports intermolecular or intramolecular interactions with proline PXXP motifs in some cases (10Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). CISK contains no SH3 domains, and there is only one buried proline in the analogous region with the sequence LXXP instead of PXXP, which forms only one left-handed PPII helical turn (Fig. 2, A and D). This may indicate that the PPII region of CISK-PX may not interact with any SH3 domain without a backbone rearrangement, because exposed proline residues are necessary for the interaction (39Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Structural Features That Determine the Specificity of the PI-binding Pocket—A conserved positively charged pocket for the phosphoinositide head group binding as found in the crystal structure of p40phox-PX/PtdIns(3)P (37Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) is located similarly in the CISK-PX domain (Fig. 3, A and B). Four regions of CISK-PX domain are involved in the formation of this pocket. Residues from α2 lie at the bottom of the pocket, and those from the N-terminal end of β2, the β3/α1 loop and the PPII/α2 loop, constitute the walls of the pocket. Overall, the PI-binding pocket in CISK-PX is superimposable to that in the p40phox-PX, although the pocket in both crystal forms of CISK-PX has a wider opening between the PPII/α2 loop (residue 75–82) and the N terminus of β2 in the β1/β2 loop (Fig. 3, A and B). This more spacious opening, caused partially by an average 4–5 Å movement of backbone atoms in the PPII/α2 loop, could favor the binding of a phosphoinositide with a highly phosphorylated head group (Fig. 3C), such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 targeted by CISK-PX domain (27Xu J. Liu D. Gill G. Songyang Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Structural superposition suggests that the sulfate in the PI-binding pocket of CISK-PX mimics the binding of the 3-phosphate group of PtdIns(3)P in p40phox-PX (Figs. 2C and 3C). It is tightly coordinated with NE and NH2 of Arg-50 in α1, which is equivalent to Arg-58 in p40phox-PX. This arginine, conserved in most of the PX domains, was proposed as the binding determinant of the 3-phosphate according to the current crystal structures (37Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50371-50376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is not conserved in the PX domain of PI3K C2-γ, which binds preferentially to PtdIns(4,5)P2. Several other interactions that stabilize the binding of the 3-phosphate are also conserved in the binding of this sulfate to CISK-PX. For example, the backbone nitrogens of Tyr-51 and Ala-52, corresponding to the Tyr-59 and Arg-60 in the p40phox-PX, form hydrogen bonds with the sulfate. In addition, side chains of Tyr-51 in CISK-PX and Tyr-59 in the p40phox-PX domain are close to each other and assume the same conformation, which could provide the carbohydrate/aromatic stacking interaction with one side of the inositol ring as shown in the p40phox-PX/PtdIns(3)P structure (37Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Residues with aromatic side chains are preserved at this spot (Fig. 2D), which indicates a common binding site for the inositol ring in the PI-binding pocket. Moreover, an important basic residue, Lys-75 in the PPII/α2 region of CISK-PX is positioned similarly as Lys-92 of p40phox-PX, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the nonbridging oxygens of the 1-phosphoryl group. These structural similarities reinforce the idea that phosphoinositides most likely bind in the PI-binding pocket of CISK-PX and p40phox-PX domains at the same location with a similar orientation. A PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 head group was manually modeled into the PI-binding pocket of CISK-PX based on the sulfate-bound CISK-PX crystal structure and its superposition to the PtdIns(3)P-bound p40phox-PX (Fig. 3D). Only minor adjustment to the orientation of the inositol ring was made to avoid the steric clash with Arg-90 under the circumstances that all other interactions stabilizing the 3-phosphate and 1-phosphate binding were preserved. These restrictions indicate that 4-phosphate of the model may interact tightly with Arg-90 of CISK-PX, a residue that is also conserved in the PX domain family (Fig. 2D) and has a strong effect on the interaction of CISK-PX with PtdIns (3Odorizzi G.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this model, ND2 of the Asn-81 side chain in the PPII/α2 loop may also form hydrogen bonds with 4-phosphate and 5-phosphate. Furthermore, 5-phosphate is positioned in the pocket near the PPII/α2 loop. The more spacious pocket resulting from the movement of the PPII/α2 loop in CISK-PX compared with p40phox-PX provides the necessary space to accommodate the binding of the 5-phosphate group. In the same region of p40phox-PX, positions of backbone atoms and carbonyl oxygens will potentially collide with the 5-phosphate (Fig. 3D), as also shown by a previous modeling in the crystal structure of p40phox-PX/PtdIns(3)P (37Bravo J.

In this study, we have characterized the conformation of tBid in lipid membrane environments, using NMR and CD spectroscopy with lipid micelle and lipid bilayer samples. In micelles, tBid adopts a unique helical conformation, and the solution NMR 1H/15N HSQC spectra have a single well resolved resonance for each of the protein amide sites. In lipid bilayers, tBid associates with the membrane with its helices parallel to the membrane surface and without trans-membrane helix insertion, and the solid-state NMR 1H/15N polarization inversion with spin exchange at the magic angle spectrum has all of the amide resonances centered at 15N chemical shift (70–90 ppm) and 1H-15N dipolar coupling (0–5 kHz) frequencies associated with NH bonds parallel to the bilayer surface, with no intensity at frequencies associated with NH bonds in trans-membrane helices. Thus, the cytotoxic activity of tBid at mitochondria may be similar to that observed for antibiotic polypeptides, which bind to the surface of bacterial membranes as amphipathic helices and destabilize the bilayer structure, promoting the leakage of cell contents.

Thus, the cytotoxic activity of tBid at mitochondria may be similar to that observed for antibiotic polypeptides, which bind to the surface of bacterial membranes as amphipathic helices and destabilize the bilayer structure, promoting the leakage of cell contents. Programmed cell death is initiated when death signals activate the caspases, a family of otherwise dormant cysteine proteases. External stress stimuli trigger the ligation of cell surface death receptors, thereby activating the upstream initiator caspases, which in turn process and activate the downstream cell death executioner caspases (1Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4489-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, caspases can be activated when stress or developmental cues within the cell induce the release of cytotoxic proteins from mitochondria. This intrinsic mitochondrial pathway for cell death is regulated by the relative ratios of the pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family (2Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family proteins exert their apoptotic activities through binding with other Bcl-2 family members or other nonhomologous proteins and through the formation of ion-conducting pores that are thought to influence cell fate by regulating mitochondrial physiology. Their functions are also regulated by subcellular location, since they cycle between soluble and membrane-bound forms. The proteins share sequence homology in four evolutionarily conserved domains (BH1–BH4), of which the BH3 domain is highly conserved and essential for both cell killing and oligomerization among Bcl-2 family members. The antiapoptotic family members have all four domains, whereas all of the proapoptotic members lack BH4, and some only have BH3. These BH3-only proteins are activated by upstream death signals, which trigger their transcriptional induction or post-translational modification, providing a key link between the extrinsic death receptor and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways to cell death (3Cory S. Adams J.M. Natl. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). One of these BH3-only Bcl-2 family members, Bid, is a 195-residue cytosolic protein that lacks the hydrophobic C-terminal domain often found in other Bcl-2 family members and connects the extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathways (4Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The major mechanism for Bid activation involves its cleavage by caspase-8, after engagement of the Fas or TNFR1 cell surface receptors (5Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar, 6Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Caspase-8 cleavage of Bid releases the 15-kDa C-terminal fragment tBid, which translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it induces massive cytochrome c release and cell death. tBid has a 10-fold greater binding affinity for its antagonist Bcl-XL and is 100-fold more efficient in inducing cytochrome-c release from mitochondria than its full-length precursor. Upon translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria, tBid can interact with proapoptotic Bax and Bak to promote mitochondrial apoptosis (8Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 9Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), or it can interact with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and, thus, be sequestered from the cell and held in check (10Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Cell-free studies have shown that Bid and Bax are sufficient to form large openings in reconstituted lipid vesicles (11Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). In addition, tBid can promote the alteration of membrane curvature in artificial lipid bilayers (12Epand R.F. Martinou J.C. Fornallaz-Mulhauser M. Hughes D.W. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32632-32639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and it can associate directly with mitochondria, inducing a remodeling of mitochondrial structure. tBid-induced mitochondrial remodeling is characterized by the reorganization of inner membrane cristae to form a highly interconnected common intermembrane space and is accompanied by redistribution of the cytochrome c stores from individual cristae to the intermembrane space (13Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), which may account for the rapid and complete release of mitochondrial cytochrome c that is observed in the presence of tBid. The Bid BH3 domain, while essential for binding to other Bcl-2 family members, is not required for either translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane and mitochondrial remodeling or complete cytochrome c release. The specific targeting of tBid to the outer mitochondrial membrane is mediated by the abundant mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (14Degli Esposti M. Cristea I.M. Gaskell S.J. Nakao Y. Dive C. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1300-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), whose metabolism further regulates cytochrome c release and mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis in a Bcl-2- and caspase-independent manner (16Ostrander D.B.

These lines of evidence suggest that Bid induces cell death through two separate mechanisms, a BH3-dependent mechanism that involves binding to other multidomain Bcl-2 family members and a BH3-independent mechanism that involves direct association and interaction with the outer mitochondrial membrane. The structure of full-length Bid in solution consists of eight α-helices arranged with two central somewhat more hydrophobic helices forming the core of the molecule (17Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S.

The third helix, which contains the BH3 domain, is connected to the first two helices by a long flexible loop, which includes the caspase-8 cleavage site, Asp60 (Fig. 1). Despite the lack of sequence homology, the structure of Bid is strikingly similar to those of other anti- and proapoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 family proteins (19Fesik S.W.

Indeed, like the toxins and other Bcl-2 family proteins, tBid also forms ion-conducting pores in lipid bilayers (23Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The structural basis for Bcl-2 pore formation is not known, since the structures that have been determined are for the soluble forms of the proteins, but by analogy to the bacterial toxins, the Bcl-2 pores are thought to form by a rearrangement of their compactly folded helices upon contact with the mitochondrial membrane. One model proposes membrane insertion of the core hydrophobic helical hairpin with the other helices folding up to rest on the membrane surface, whereas an alternative model envisions the helices rearranging to bind the membrane surface without insertion (24Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B. Schendel S.L. Deriy B.N. Cohen F.S. Elkins P.A. Stauffacher C.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Schendel S.L.

In this study, we have examined the conformation and topology of tBid in lipid membrane environments, using solution NMR and CD experiments with micelle samples and solid-state NMR experiments with lipid bilayer samples. In the absence of lipids, tBid is soluble and retains a largely helical conformation, but many of the 1H/15N resonances are missing from the solution NMR heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) 1The abbreviations used are: HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; PISEMA, polarization inversion with spin exchange at the magic angle; SMAC, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]; LPPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]. spectrum, suggesting that tBid aggregates, adopts multiple conformations, or undergoes dynamic averaging on the NMR time scale. In micelles, tBid adopts a unique helical conformation, reflected in the HSQC spectrum, where each of the 130 amide sites gives rise to a single well resolved resonance. The solid-state NMR polarization inversion with spin exchange at the magic angle (PISEMA) spectrum of tBid in lipid bilayers demonstrates that it binds the membrane with its helices parallel to the membrane surface and without transmembrane helix insertion. This suggests that the BH3-independent cytotoxic activity of tBid may be similar to that observed for antibiotic polypeptides that bind to the surface of bacterial membranes as amphipathic helices and destabilize the bilayer structure, promoting the leakage of cell contents. Protein Expression—The gene encoding human tBid was obtained by PCR amplification of the 405-base pair segment corresponding to amino acids 60–195 of full-length human Bid (accession number P55957). The gene was cloned into the pMMHa vector, which directs the expression of proteins fused to the C terminus of the His9-TrpΔLE polypeptide (26Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed in Escherichia coli C41(DE3), a mutant strain that was selected for the expression of insoluble or toxic proteins (27Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). tBid was expressed as an insoluble protein, with the His9-TrpΔLE polypeptide fused to its N terminus. To enable CNBr (cyanogen bromide) cleavage of tBid from the TrpΔLE fusion partner, the Met residues (Met97, Met142, Met148, and Met194) in the tBid sequence were changed to Leu. The His9-TrpΔLE-tBid fusion protein was purified from the inclusion body fraction of the lysate by nickel affinity chromatography (His·Bind Resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) in 6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). After dialysis against water, the fusion protein was dissolved in 0.1 n HCl and then cleaved from the TrpΔLE fusion partner by reaction with a 10-fold molar excess of CNBr (28Gross E. Witkop B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 1510-1511Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). tBid was purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Delta-Pak C4 (Waters, Milford, MA) in 50% water, 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The methods for inclusion bodies isolation and fusion protein purification were as described (26Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Opella S.J. Ma C. Marassi F.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 285-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were in M9 minimal medium as described (29Opella S.J. Ma C. Marassi F.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 285-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For the production of uniformly 15N-labeled proteins, (15NH4)2SO4 was supplied as the sole nitrogen source. For selectively labeled protein, individual 15N-labeled and nonlabeled amino acids were provided. All isotopes were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Mitochondrial Release Assays—HeLa cells were harvested and then washed and suspended in HM buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm mannitol, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were homogenized with 50 strokes of a Teflon homogenizer with a B-type pestle and centrifuged twice at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet, containing mitochondria, was washed twice in HM buffer and then suspended in HM buffer at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Isolated HeLa mitochondria (10 μl) were incubated with HM buffer (50 μl) containing increasing amounts of tBid at 30 °C for 1 h. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet and supernatant fractions were each resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) antibodies. Bcl-XL Binding Assays—The expression of recombinant His-tagged Bcl-XL(ΔC), without the C-terminal amino acids 212–233, was as described (30Xie Z. Schendel S. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the binding assays, His6-Bcl-XL(ΔC) protein (15 μg) was incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with 10 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.2), and then the resin was washed three times, tBid (15 μg) was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 4 h. The resin was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then the bound proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. As a control, tBid was incubated with the resin in the absence of Bcl-XL. CD Spectroscopy—The samples were identical to those used for solution NMR experiments but contained 40 μm tBid. The samples were transferred to a quartz cuvette (0.1-mm path length), and far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a model 62A-DS CD spectrometer (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) equipped with a temperature controller. A 5-s time constant and a 1-nm bandwidth were used during data acquisition over a wavelength range of 180–260 nm. For each sample, three spectra were recorded, averaged, and referenced by subtracting the average of three spectra obtained using the buffer alone. The spectra were analyzed for protein secondary structure with the k2d program (available on the World Wide Web at www.embl-heidelberg.de/∼andrade/k2d/) (31Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Solution NMR—The sample of tBid without lipids contained 0.7–1 mm15N-labeled tBid, in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5. In the absence of lipids, tBid is not soluble in the millimolar concentrations required for NMR at pH values greater than 5. The samples of tBid in micelles contained 1 mm15N-labeled tBid in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, with 500 mm SDS (Cambridge, Andover, MA) or 100 mm 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (LPPG); Avanti, Alabaster, AL). Solution NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer (Billerica, MA) with a 600/54 Magnex magnet (Yarnton, UK), equipped with a triple-resonance 5-mm probe with three-axis field gradients. The two-dimensional 1H/15N HSQC (32Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. Vanzijl P.C.M. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) spectra were obtained at 40 °C. The 15N and 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 0 ppm for liquid ammonia and tetramethylsilane, respectively. The NMR data were processed using NMR Pipe and rendered in NMR Draw (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11541) Google Scholar) on a Dell Precision 330 MT Linux work station (Round Rock, TX). Solid-state NMR—The lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DOPG) were from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). Samples of tBid in lipid bilayers were prepared by mixing 5 mg of 15N-labeled tBid in water with 100 mg of lipids (DOPC/DOPG, 6:4 molar ratio) that had been sonicated in water to form unilamellar vesicles. The protein and lipid vesicle mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and then distributed onto the surface of 15 glass slides (11 × 11 × 0.06 mm; Marienfeld, Germany). After allowing excess water to evaporate at 40 °C, the slides were stacked and equilibrated for 12 h at 40 °C and 93% relative humidity, in order to form oriented lipid bilayers. The samples were wrapped in parafilm and then sealed in thin polyethylene film prior to insertion in the NMR probe. Hydrogen-exchanged samples were prepared by exposing the stacked oriented bilayer samples to an atmosphere saturated with D2O. Solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer (Billerica, MA) with a 500/89 AS Magnex magnet (Yarnton, UK). The home-built 1H/15N double resonance probe had a square radiofrequency coil (11 × 11 × 3 mm) wrapped directly around the samples. The one-dimensional 15N chemical shift spectra were obtained with single contact cross-polarization with mismatch-optimized IS polarization transfer (34Pines A. Gibby M.G. Waugh J.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1973; 59: 569-590Crossref Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 35Levitt M.H. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1986; 84: 4243-4255Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional spectra that correlate 15N chemical shift with 1H-15N dipolar coupling were obtained with PISEMA (36Wu C.H. Ramamoorthy A. Opella S.J. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1994; 109: 270-272Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The spectra were obtained with a cross-polarization contact time of 1 ms, a 1H 90° pulse width of 5 μs, and continuous 1H decoupling of 63-kHz radio frequency field strength. The two-dimensional data were acquired with 512 accumulated transients and 256 complex data points, for each of 64 real t1 values incremented by 32.7 μs. The recycle delay was 6 s. The 15N chemical shifts were referenced to 0 ppm for liquid ammonia. The data were processed using NMR Pipe and rendered in NMR Draw (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11541) Google Scholar) on a Dell Precision 330 MT Linux work station (Round Rock, TX). Calculation of Solid-state NMR Spectra—Two-dimensional 1H/15N PISEMA spectra were calculated on a Linux Dell computer as described previously (37Marassi F.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 994-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The 15N chemical shift and 1H-15N dipolar coupling frequencies were calculated for various orientations of an 18-residue α-helix, with 3.6 residues per turn and uniform backbone dihedral angles for all residues (ϕ = –57°; ψ = –47°). The principal values and molecular orientation of the 15N chemical shift tensor (σ11 = 64 ppm; σ22 = 77 ppm; σ33 = 217 ppm; angle (σ11NH) = 17°) and the NH bond distance (1.07 Å) provided the input for the spectrum calculation at each helix orientation. Protein Expression and Biological Activity—Full-length Bid can be expressed at high levels, in E. coli, as a soluble protein, but tBid overexpression is toxic for bacterial cells. To produce milligram quantities of 15N-labeled tBid for NMR studies, we used the pMMHa fusion protein vector that directs high level protein expression as inclusion bodies, and we transformed the plasmid in E. coli C41(DE3) cells, selected for the expression of insoluble and toxic proteins (27Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). tBid was separated from the fusion partner by means of CNBr cleavage at the engineered N-terminal Met residue (26Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This method yields ∼10 mg of purified 15N-labeled tBid from 1 liter of culture. To avoid cleavage within the tBid segment, the four Met residues in the tBid amino acid sequence were mutated to Leu (Fig. 1, asterisks), and therefore, it was important to demonstrate that the recombinant protein retained its biological activity. We tested the ability of recombinant tBid to induce the release of mitochondrial proteins by incubating it with mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells, assaying the supernatant and pelleted fractions with antibodies to cytochrome c and SMAC. Fig. 2A demonstrates that, in both cases, tBid is fully active, in a dose-dependent manner and at levels similar to wild-type tBid obtained by caspase-8 cleavage (38Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Next we tested the ability of recombinant tBid to bind Bcl-XL, since this interaction requires the BH3 domain, and recombinant tBid contains the mutation M97L in this segment. When recombinant tBid, which does not have a His tag, was incubated with Ni2+-NTA without Bcl-XL, it did not bind the resin, as evidenced by the absence of tBid in the imidazole elution (Fig. 2B, lane 4). However, when tBid was incubated with Ni2+-NTA that had been previously incubated with His-tagged Bcl-XL, it also bound to the resin and eluted with Bcl-XL in imidazole (Fig. 2B, lane 5). Thus, we conclude that recombinant tBid, isolated from inclusion bodies, is fully active in its ability to induce cytochrome c and SMAC release from isolated mitochondria and that its capacity to bind antiapoptotic Bcl-XL through its BH3 domain is not disrupted by the M97L mutation. The pMMHa vector may be generally useful for the high level expression of other proapoptotic proteins that are difficult to express because of their cytotoxic properties. The use of chemical cleavage eliminates the difficulties, poor specificity, and enzyme inactivation, often encountered with protease treatment of insoluble proteins, and in cases where Met mutation is not feasible, protein cleavage from the fusion partner can be obtained enzymatically by engineering specific protease cleavage sites for the commonly used enzymes thrombin, Fxa, enterokinase, and tobacco etch virus protease. Thrombin and tobacco etch virus retain activity in the presence of detergents, including low millimolar concentrations of SDS. tBid in Lipid Micelles—The cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 results in a C-terminal product, tBid, which targets mitochondria and induces apoptosis with strikingly enhanced activity (5Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar, 6Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To characterize the conformation of tBid in lipid environments, we obtained its CD and solution NMR 1H/15N HSQC spectra in the absence or in the presence of lipid micelles (Fig. 3). The HSQC spectra of proteins are the starting point for additional multidimensional NMR experiments that lead to structure determination. In these spectra, each 15N-labeled protein site gives rise to a single peak, characterized by 1H and 15N chemical shift frequencies that reflect the local environment. In addition, the peak line widths and line shapes and their dispersion in the 1H and 15N frequency dimensions reflect protein conformation and aggregation state. In the absence of lipids, the CD spectrum of tBid displays minima at 202 and 222 nm, characteristic of predominantly helical proteins (Fig. 3A, solid line). The helical content estimated from the CD spectrum is ∼65%, which is similar to the 67% helical content determined from the three-dimensional structure of Bid (17Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) for the 135 C-terminal amino acids that correspond to tBid. However, whereas tBid retains its helical conformation even when it is separated from the 60-residue N-terminal fragment, many of the resonances in its 1H/15N HSQC spectrum cannot be detected (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the protein aggregates in solution, adopts multiple conformations, or undergoes dynamic conformational exchange on the NMR time scale. tBid has very limited solubility at pH values greater than 5, and the addition of KCl up to 200 mm did not improve the appearance of the HSQC spectrum, whereas KCl concentrations above 200 mm yielded a gel. This behavior is consistent with the dramatic changes in the physical properties of the protein that accompany caspase-8 cleavage. Bid has a theoretical pI of 5.3 and a net charge of –7, but caspase-8 cleavage and removal of the 60 N-terminal amino acids shift these parameters to the opposite end of their spectrum, and tBid has a pI of 9.3 and a net charge of +2. In addition, the removal of helix-1 and helix-2 following caspase-8 cleavage exposes hydrophobic residues in the BH3 domain in helix-3 and in the central core helices, helix-6 and helix-7 (17Chou J.J.

When tBid associates with lipid micelles, its HSQC spectrum changes dramatically, and single, well defined 1H/15N resonances are observed for each 15N-labeled NH site"

The seeds contain multiple forms of Bowman-Birk type inhibitors. The major inhibitor HGI-III, from the native seed with 76 amino acid residues exists as a dimer. The amino acid sequence of three isoforms of Bowman-Birk inhibitor from germinated horsegram, designated as HGGI-I, HGGI-II, and HGGI-III, have been obtained by sequential Edman analyses of the pyridylethylated inhibitors and peptides derived therefrom by enzymatic and chemical cleavage. The HGGIs are monomers, comprising of 66, 65, and 60 amino acid residues, respectively. HGGI-III from the germinated seed differs from the native seed inhibitor in the physiological deletion of a dodecapeptide at the amino terminus and a tetrapeptide, -SHDD, at the carboxyl terminus. The study of the state of association of HGI-III, by size-exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE in the presence of 1 mm ZnCl2, has revealed the role of charged interactions in the monomer ↔ dimer equilibria. Chemical modification studies of Lys and Arg have confirmed the role of charge interactions in the above equilibria. These results support the premise that a unique interaction, which stabilizes the dimer, is the cause of self-association in the inhibitors.

Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Characteristically, their molecular masses are in the range of 6–9 kDa. They are single polypeptides and comprise a binary arrangement of two sub-domains with a conserved array of seven disulfide bridges, which play a prominent role in the stabilization of their reactive site configuration (2Birk Y. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1985; 25: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 3Ikenaka T. Norioka S. Barret A.J. Salvenson G. Proteinase inhibitors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 361-374Google Scholar). These inhibitors interact, simultaneously and independently with two (not necessarily identical) molecules of proteinases (4Harry J.B. Steiner R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 16: 174-179Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) without any conformational change (5Sierra I. Li de La Quillien L. Flecker P. Gueduen J. Brunie S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The BBIs have two tandem homology regions comprising a consensus motif of three β-strands, each with a kinetically independent reactive site on the outermost exposed loop that adopts a common canonical conformation, similar to that of a productively bound substrate (1Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar).In addition to protease inhibitory activity, the anticarcinogenic activity and radioprotective activity of BBIs from legumes have been widely studied (6Kennedy A.R. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68 (suppl.): 1406S-1412SCrossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Immune stimulating properties of these inhibitors have also been reported (7Harms-Ringdahl M. Forsberg J. Fedorcsak I. Ehrenberg L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The BBIs have been implicated to play a vital role in the arsenal defense mechanism that plants use to protect against insect predators and against environment hazards during germination and seedling growth.Despite extensive studies on BBIs, only a few three-dimensional structures have been solved by x-ray or by NMR.

The x-ray structure of a novel and unique monofunctional 14-amino acid residue cyclic peptide, from sunflower seeds, complexed with trypsin, has exhibited both sequence and conformational similarity to the trypsin-reactive site loop of BBIs (17Luckett S.

Four isoforms of BBIs, from horsegram seeds (18Sreerama Y.N. Das J.R. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Food Biochem. 1997; 21: 461-477Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), have been isolated. The complete primary structure of the major isoform HGI-III has been determined (19Prakash B. Selvaraj S. Murthy M.R.N. Sreerama Y.N. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 260-569Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Three linear epitopes of the major inhibitor have been mapped, of which one contains the chymotrypsin inhibitory site (20Sreerama Y.N. Gowda L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The role of disulfide linkages in maintaining the structural integrity of horsegram BBI was established by circular dichroism and fluorescence studies (21Ramasarma P.R. Appu Rao A.G. Rao D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Horsegram BBI followed the “two state” mode of unfolding and oxidative refolding of the BBI was possible only at very low inhibitor concentration in a disulfide-thiol buffer (22Singh R.R. Appu Rao A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1597: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The three new isoforms that appear upon germination of horsegram seeds (23Sreerama Y.N. Gowda L.R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1998; 46: 2596-2600Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) are derived from the dormant seed inhibitors by a limited proteolysis during germination and not by de novo synthesis (24Kumar P. Sreerama Y.N. Gowda L.R. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The inhibitors of horsegram (HGIs) are single polypeptides with a molecular mass of 8.5 kDa. SDS-PAGE and analytical gel filtration indicate the molecular mass to be ∼16 kDa (18Sreerama Y.N. Das J.R. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Food Biochem. 1997; 21: 461-477Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that they exist as dimers in solution. Such self-association and anomalous behavior on SDS-PAGE resulting in a large overestimation of molecular mass has been reported for several legume BBIs (25Wu C. Whitaker R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1990; 38: 1523-1529Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Bergeron D. Neilson S.S. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1993; 41: 1544-1552Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Terada S. Fujimura S.

Food Agric. 1994; 64: 87-93Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Many of the BBIs tend to undergo self-association to form homodimers or trimers or more complex oligomers (29Odani S. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional model of the blackeyed pea BBI-chymotrypsin complex (15de Freitas S.M. de Mello L.V. da Silva M.C. Vriend G. Neshich G. Ventura M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and light scattering data (30Ventura M.M. Mizuta K. Ikemoto H. An. Acad. Bras. Cienc. 1981; 53: 195-201Google Scholar) suggest that the inhibitor molecules are in continuous equilibrium between monomers and several forms of multimers. The data available on the protein-protein interactions, responsible for the self-association of BBIs, is sparse. In contrast to the dry seed inhibitors (HGIs), the inhibitors of germinated horsegram seeds (HGGIs), derived from the dry seed inhibitors, are single polypeptides of ∼6.5–7.2 kDa and exist as monomers (24Kumar P. Sreerama Y.N. Gowda L.R. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand and elucidate the structural features that contribute to the self-association of HGIs in solution, the primary structures of the HGGIs has been determined. The significant difference between the primary structures of inhibitors from the germinated seed (HG-GIs) and the inhibitor from the dormant seed (HGI-III) is the absence of the charged carboxyl-terminal tail and varied truncation at the amino terminus. This observation and the ability of HGI-III to self-associate and form dimers suggest that the structural elements responsible for this phenomenon occur at either the carboxyl and/or the amino terminus.The dimeric crystal structure of the pea seed BBI, PsTI-IVb (5Sierra I. Li de La Quillien L. Flecker P. Gueduen J. Brunie S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reveals two monomers associated in a nearly perfect dimer that are mainly stabilized by an extensive hydrogen-bonded network, involving specific interactions between them, namely: (i) the guanidium group of Arg23 of one monomer and the polar group of side chain of Glu68 of second monomer and (ii) Lys16 of one monomer and the dyad-related carboxyl group of Glu69 of the other monomer. This observation and the finding that HGGIs, which lack the carboxyl-terminal Asp residues, lose the ability to form dimers suggest that these interactions play a unique role in the dimerization of BBIs. Based on these findings, chemical modification of the Lys/Arg residue, a comparative evaluation of the amino acid sequences of several BBIs that exist either as monomers or dimers and homology modeling of the dimer, we demonstrate the pivotal role of an interaction between Lys24 (trypsin reactive site) and Asp76 in HGI-III that characterizes the dimer formation. The effects of such dimerization on the functional aspects of the inhibitor are presented.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Horsegram (D. biflorus) seeds were obtained locally. DEAE-Sephacel and Sepharose-4B were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. α-N-Benzoyl-dl-arginine-p-nitroanilide HCl (BAPNA), cyanogen bromide, diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), bovine pancreatic trypsin (2 × crystallized, type III, EC 3.4.21.4), l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin, endoproteinase Asp-N (EC 3.4.24.33), guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), 4-vinylpyridine, dithiothreitol, 1,2-dicyclohexanedione, and analytical gel filtration markers were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Molecular weight markers for SDS-PAGE were from Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India. All the other chemicals used were of highest purity.Purification of Isoinhibitors from Horsegram—Dormant seed inhibitor (HGI-III) and horsegram germinated inhibitors (HGGI-I, -II, and -III) were purified as reported earlier (18Sreerama Y.N. Das J.R. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Food Biochem. 1997; 21: 461-477Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Kumar P. Sreerama Y.N. Gowda L.R. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Trypsin Inhibitory Assay—The amidase activity of trypsin and its inhibition was assayed using the chromogenic substrate BAPNA as described earlier (24Kumar P. Sreerama Y.N. Gowda L.R. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One unit of trypsin enzyme activity is defined as the increase in the absorbance of 0.01 at 410 nm under the assay conditions. One inhibitory unit is defined as the amount of inhibitor, which reduces the enzyme activity by one unit.Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Denaturing SDS-PAGE (15% and 17.5% T with 2.7% C) of HGGI-III and HGI-III was performed according to the procedure of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The gels were stained for protein with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained.Protein Sequencing—Reduction and alkylation of HGGIs with 4-vinyl pyridine was carried out as described for the dry seed inhibitors earlier (18Sreerama Y.N. Das J.R. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Food Biochem. 1997; 21: 461-477Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The pyridylethylated HGGIs were cleaved with TPCK-trypsin and endoproteinase Asp-N according to Aitken et al. (32Aitken A. Geisow M.J. Findlay J.B.C. Holmes C. Yarwood A. Geisow M.J. Findlay J.B.C. Protein Sequencing a Practical Approach. IRL press, Oxford1989: 43Google Scholar). The pyridylethylated HGGIs were cleaved at the Met residue using a 50-fold molar excess of cyanogen bromide in formic acid over Met residues. Excess reagents were removed by repeated dilution and freeze-drying (33Allen G. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Sequencing of Proteins and Peptides. Elsevier, Amsterdam1989: 73Google Scholar). The lyophilized digests were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and peptides were purified by HPLC using a C-18 reverse phase column (Phenomenex ODS column, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN (7:3) linear gradient. The peptides were detected at 230 nm. The peak fractions were further rechromatographed using the same column and solvent system. The peptides were subjected to Edman analyses on an automated gas phase protein sequencer (Shimadzu PSQ-1).Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size-exclusion measurements were performed using a BIOSEP-SEC-S 3000 (300 × 8 mm, exclusion limit: 700 kDa for globular proteins) column on a Waters Associate HPLC equipped with a binary gradient pumping system and Waters Model 1296 photodiode array detector. The column was pre-equilibrated with the corresponding buffers prior to sample loading. The column was calibrated using a mixture of standard proteins, alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome c (14.4 kDa), and HGGI-III (6.4 kDa).SDS-PAGE analysis of Zn2+-induced HGI-III Monomerization—The inhibitor was incubated in the presence of 1 mm ZnSO4 for 1 h. The sample was then boiled with sample buffer for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE (17.5% T, 2.7% C) at pH 8.8. The separated proteins were then stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Chemical Modification of HGI-III—Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) was used to modify His residues. DEPC solution was freshly prepared by dilution of the reagent in cold ethanol. The concentration of the stock was determined by reaction with 10 mm imidazole (34Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). For modification with DEPC, HGI-III was diluted in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.25. At fixed time intervals, aliquots of DEPC were added to the mixture, and the formation of N-carbethoxyhistidine was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 240 nm, using a Shimadzu UV-1601 double beam spectrophotometer. The final concentration of DEPC ranged from 0 to 0.4 mm. The modified HGI-III was chromatographed on a BIOSEP-SEC-S 3000 column pre-equilibrated in phosphate buffer, pH 7.25.Arginine residues of HGI-III were modified by the reviewed method of Smith (35Smith E.L. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using 1,2-cyclohexanedione. HGI-III was dissolved in 0.2 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0 (0.1 mg/ml), and reacted with 0.15 m 1,2-cyclohexanedione at 35 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was acidified using 30% acetic acid and dialyzed against 10 mm acetic acid to remove excess reagents. The sample was concentrated and evaluated by SDS-PAGE.Lysine residues of HGI-III were modified at 25 ± 2 °C using citraconic anhydride (36Dixon H.B.F. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1968; 109: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). HGI-III (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in water and the pH adjusted to 8.0. Citraconic anhydride (1 μl/mg of protein) was added to the solution and maintained at pH 8. The modified inhibitor was desalted and analyzed for the monomer-dimer status by SDS-PAGE as described earlier.Modeling of HGI-III Dimer—The sequences of BBIs from leguminous plants were obtained from the NCBI protein sequence data base and aligned using the ClustalW multiple alignment algorithm (37Higgins D. Thompson J. Gibson T. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar). Of these, a crystal structure for the pea BBI inhibitor was available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 1PBI). The sequences of the monomeric HGGI-III and dimeric HGI-III were highly similar to that of the pea inhibitor, enabling building of their models by standard homology modeling techniques. Models of HGI-III and HGGI-III were built using the Biopolymer module in InsightII (Accelrys Inc.) and energy-minimized using DISCOVER. The quality of the structure was measured using PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). A single residue insertion at position 37, which forms part of a loop, was observed in HGI-III and HGGI-III, with respect to the crystal structure template. An analysis of related crystal structures in PDB using DALI (39Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 233: 123-138Crossref Scopus (3551) Google Scholar) and Insight-II indicated that the structure of BBI proteinase inhibitor PI-II (1pi2) contained a similar insertion at the same position. The insertion in the loop is therefore modeled based on this structure. Visualization and analysis of the structures were carried out using Insight-II.Thermal Stability Studies—The purified inhibitors were dissolved in water and incubated at 95 ± 1 °C in a constant temperature water bath. Aliquots were removed at regular time intervals, immediately cooled on ice, and assayed for residual trypsin inhibitory activity as described earlier.RESULTSPrimary Structure of the HGGIs and Comparison of Their Sequences—The complete amino acid sequences of HGGI-I, -II, and -III comprising of 66, 65, and 60 residues, respectively, were obtained by automated sequencing analysis of the proteins and peptides generated by enzymatic and chemical cleavage (Fig. 1, data shown only for HGGI-III). The molecular mass calculated on the basis of the sequence of HGGI-I, -II, and -III are 7109, 6993, and 6464, respectively. These results are in close agreement to the molecular mass determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-MS, which were 7216.7, 7074.6, and 6493.5, respectively. The determined amino acid composition agrees with that of the deduced sequence (24Kumar P. Sreerama Y.N. Gowda L.R. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The alignment of the amino acid sequences of the HGGIs with the sequence of HGI-III, the major isoinhibitor present in the dry seed is shown in Fig. 2. The sequences of the HGGIs are identical to HGI-III sequence, except for the truncation at both the amino and carboxyl termini of the sequence. The three inhibitors from germinated seeds (HGGIs) differ from each other only at the amino terminus. The absence of the charged tetrapeptide, -SHDD, at the carboxyl terminus is common to all the three HGGIs. The 14 half-cysteine residues are conserved in the HGGIs, as is the case of all legume BBIs sequenced thus far. The trypsin reactive site with Lys and chymotrypsin reactive site with Phe as the P1 residue in HGI-III remain unaltered in the sequence of the HGGIs. These results indicate that the three inhibitors of the germinated seed are in situ proteolytic products of the dry seed inhibitor HGI-III.Fig. 2Comparison of the amino acid sequences of HGGIs with HGI-III. The arrows are between the P1 and P1′ residues of the reactive site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SDS-PAGE and Size-exclusion Chromatography—SDS-PAGE analysis of HGGI-III indicates it is a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of ∼6.5 kDa (Fig. 3). HGGI-I and HGGI-II also move as single polypeptides of ∼7.0-kDa molecular mass on SDS-PAGE (24Kumar P. Sreerama Y.N. Gowda L.R. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, HGI-III moves as a single polypeptide of ∼16.0-kDa molecular mass (Fig. 3, lane C). The exact molecular mass of HGI-III as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (18Sreerama Y.N. Das J.R. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Food Biochem. 1997; 21: 461-477Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and by sequence (19Prakash B. Selvaraj S. Murthy M.R.N. Sreerama Y.N. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 260-569Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is ∼8.0 kDa. These results suggest that the HGI-III in solution undergoes self-association to form a dimer. The reduced and alkylated HGI-III is a polypeptide of ∼8.0 kDa (18Sreerama Y.N. Das J.R. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Food Biochem. 1997; 21: 461-477Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Fig. 3SDS-PAGE (15% T, 2.7% C) of HGI-III and HGGI-III. Lane A, low molecular weight markers; lane B, HGGI-III; lane C, HGI-III; and lane D, high molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The monomer/dimer status of HGI-III and HGGI-III was further evaluated by size-exclusion HPLC on a BIOSEP-SEC-S 3000 column using 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.25. HGI-III was well separated from HGGI-III (Fig. 4, A and B). HGGI-III eluted later with a retention time of 22.92 min corresponding to a molecular mass of 6.5 kDa. HGI-III elutes at 20.26 min, which corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼16.0 kDa. These results provide further evidence that HGI-III in solution associates to form a dimer.Fig. 4Size-exclusion chromatography of HGI-III and HGGI-III. The samples were dissolved in different buffers and loaded on to a BIOSEP-SEC-S 3000 column pre-equilibrated with respective buffers and eluted at 0.5 ml/min. A, HGI-III (pH 7.25); B, HGGI-III (pH 7.25); C, HGI-III (1 mm ZnSO4, pH 7.25); D, HGI-III (1 mm ZnCl2, pH 7.25); and E, HGI-III (1 mm ZnCl2, pH 6.5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Rationale for Chemical Modification—A closer evaluation of the sequences shows that the most significant difference between HGI-III and HGGI-III, is the physiological deletion of the peptide -DHHQSTDEPSES and the tetrapeptide -SHDD at the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively. Hence, either the depleted amino and/or the carboxyl termini are involved in the self-association of HGI-III. HGI-I, yet another of the isoinhibitors present in the dry seed of horsegram, although truncated at the amino terminus, exists as a dimer in solution (18Sreerama Y.N. Das J.R. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Food Biochem. 1997; 21: 461-477Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations implicate that the residues of the deleted tetrapeptide play a vital role in the dimerization of HGI-III. PsTI-IVb, a BBI from Winter pea seeds, has been crystallized as a nearly perfect 2-fold symmetric dimer in the asymmetric subunit, which includes its carboxyl-terminal segment (5Sierra I. Li de La Quillien L. Flecker P. Gueduen J. Brunie S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal tail from residues 68 to 70 (EEV), which constitutes an extended β-strand, makes no contact with its own subunit yet is held by interactions with the other subunit. Two specific interactions that have been discerned between the two subunits are (a) a hydrogen bond between the guanidium group of Arg23 of one subunit and the polar group of the side chain of Glu68 and (b) an ion pair between Lys16 of one subunit and the dyad-related carboxyl group of Glu69 of the other subunit. This observation, together with the fact that the deleted tetrapeptide contained Asp residues, suggests that such interactions could well be the premise to self-association in HGI-III. The effect of chemically modifying Arg and Lys residues of HGI-III has been studied. Chemical modification of these residues may disrupt such a subunit interaction in HGI-III leading to the formation of monomers.Chemical Modification of Arg and Lys Residues of HGI-III— The Lys residues of HGI-III were chemically modified using citraconic anhydride. Citraconylation resulted in the acetylation of the free ϵ-amino group of Lys. SDS-PAGE of the modified HGI-III revealed an increased relative mobility compared with the unmodified inhibitor (Fig. 5, lane D). The molecular mass, calculated on the basis of the relative mobilities of a set of standard proteins, was ∼8.5 kDa, corresponding to that of a monomer. The conversion of the dimer form of the HGI-III to monomer by citraconylation suggests that a Lys residue is involved in the self-association of HGI-III. The guanidium group of Arg residues were modified using 1,2-cyclohexanedione, resulting in a heterocyclic condensation product between the guanidium group of Arg and the carbonyl of 1,2-cyclohexanedione.

https://openalex.org/W2091069693,"The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene exons IIIb and IIIc are alternatively spliced in a mutually exclusive and cell type-specific manner. FGFR2 exon choice depends on both activation and silencing. Exon IIIb silencing requires cis-acting elements upstream and downstream of the exon. To examine the influence of transcription on exon IIIb silencing, the putative RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-pausing MAZ4 element was inserted at different positions within the FGFR2 minigene construct. MAZ4 insertions 5' to the upstream silencing elements or between exon IIIb and downstream silencing elements result in decreased silencing. An insertion 3' of the downstream silencing elements, however, has no effect on splicing. An RT-PCR elongation assay shows that the MAZ4 site in these constructs is likely to be a RNAPII pause site. Insertion of another RNAPII pause site into the minigene has a similar effect on exon IIIb silencing. Transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA demonstrates that the cell type specificity of FGFR2 alternative splicing requires co-transcriptional splicing. Additionally, changing the promoter alters both FGFR2 minigene splicing and the MAZ4 effect. We propose that RNAPII pauses at the MAZ4 elements resulting in a change in the transcription elongation complex that influences alternative splicing decisions downstream."
https://openalex.org/W2066881724,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kin28 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family. Kin28 is a subunit of the basal transcription factor holo-TFIIH and its trimeric sub-complex TFIIK. Kin28 is the primary kinase that phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) within a transcription initiation complex. Mediator, a global transcriptional co-activator, dramatically enhances the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA pol II by holo-TFIIH in vitro. Using purified proteins we have determined that the subunits of TFIIK are sufficient for Mediator to enhance Kin28 CTD kinase activity and that Mediator enhances phosphorylation of a glutathione S-transferase-CTD fusion protein, despite the absence of multiple Mediator and/or TFIIH interactions with polymerase. Mediator does not stimulate the activity of several other CTD kinases, suggesting that the specific enhancement of TFIIH kinase activity results in Kin28 being the primary CTD kinase at initiation. In addition, we have found that Kin28 phosphorylates Mediator subunit Med4 in an assay, including purified holo-TFIIH, and either Mediator or recombinant Med4 alone. Furthermore, Kin28 appears to be, at least in part, responsible for the phosphorylation of Med4 in vivo. We have identified Thr-237 as the site of phosphorylation of Med4 by Kin28 in vitro. The mutation of Thr-237 to Ala has no effect on the growth of a yeast strain under normal conditions but confirms that Thr-237 is also the site of Med4 phosphorylation in vivo.

In S. cerevisiae, Kin28 and Ccl1 are a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-cyclin-like pair that possesses the ability to phosphorylate the CTD of RNA pol II, whereas in higher eukaryotes the cdk-cyclin (Cdk7/cyclin H) components of TFIIH also serve as a Cdk-activating kinase. It has recently been shown that TFIIK exists separately from holo-TFIIH in yeast extracts, but it is still unclear what function TFIIK, as an independent entity, has in vivo (4Keogh M.C. Cho E.J. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies (for review see Ref. 5Prelich G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), clearly defining the role of the kinase activity of Kin28 in transcription has remained elusive. The kinase activity of Kin28 is essential for viability (6Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and a whole genome analysis, using the temperature-sensitive mutant strain kin28-ts3, has shown a decrease in the mRNA levels of nearly all RNA pol II-transcribed genes at the non-permissive temperature (7Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether this decrease results from defects at transcription initiation or one of the many other processes regulated and targeted by the dynamic phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA pol II. Kin28 has been shown to be the primary CTD kinase at initiation in vivo (6Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 10Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), but the CTD and its phosphorylation state also play an important role in transcription elongation, mRNA processing, and mRNA export (11Shilatifard A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 693-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), all of which could affect steady-state mRNA levels. Small molecules that specifically inhibit the kinase activity of Kin28 cause a decrease in elongating polymerases in vivo and a defect in transcription in yeast nuclear extracts (6Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the role of Kin28 in transcription is not straightforward, because basal transcription reactions reconstituted from purified factors require neither the Kin28 kinase activity nor the CTD itself (12Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Srb10/11 is a second cdk-cyclin-like pair in yeast that is a component of transcription initiation complexes formed in nuclear extracts (14Liu Y. Ranish J.A. Aebersold R. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In an otherwise wild-type background, Srb10/11, which are encoded by non-essential genes, do not seem to be major contributors to the phosphorylation (6Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Cooper K.F. Strich R. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 43-57PubMed Google Scholar) of the CTD in vivo. Genetic and genomic analyses show that Srb10/11 can have both negative (7Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar) and positive (16Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) effects on the expression of certain subsets of genes in vivo. Experiments in vitro have shown that repression of transcription may originate from Srb10/11 phosphorylating the CTD prior to initiation and preventing the entry of RNA pol II into initiation complex, whereas Kin28 seems to phosphorylate the CTD only after the initiation complex has formed (17Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Transcription in nuclear extracts was actually decreased by the specific inhibition of Srb10, but only in the absence of Kin28 kinase activity (6Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). What causes Kin28 and not Srb10/11 to be the primary CTD kinase at initiation is still an open question. Biochemical and genetic studies have provided evidence that the role of CTD phosphorylation in transcription is linked to the global co-activator complex Mediator. The Mediator complex is a conserved interface between gene-specific regulatory proteins and the general transcription apparatus of eukaryotes at transcription initiation (18Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and is required for the expression of nearly all RNA pol II-transcribed genes (7Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). A genetic connection between Mediator and the CTD was revealed by studies that identified extragenic suppressors (the SRB genes) of a cold-sensitive phenotype caused by RNA pol II CTD truncation (19Nonet M.L. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hengartner C.J. Thompson C.M. Zhang J. Chao D.M. Liao S.M. Koleske A.J. Okamura S. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When Mediator, and Mediator-containing complexes, were subsequently isolated biochemically, Srb2, Srb4, Srb5, Srb6, and Srb7 were all identified as part of the 20-subunit minimal Mediator that is sufficient for activated transcription in a purified system (21Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 22Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The recessive suppressors Srb8, Srb9, Srb10, and Srb11 form a sub-complex (23Borggrefe T. Davis R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44202-44207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that seems to associate with the 20-subunit complex in certain holopolymerase (a pre-formed complex minimally containing Mediator and RNA pol II) preparations and in pre-initiation complexes (14Liu Y. Ranish J.A. Aebersold R. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have also revealed an intimate physical and functional association between Mediator and the CTD. Purified S. cerevisiae Mediator binds directly to a GST-CTD fusion protein (22Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 24Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and the CTD, although not required for basal transcription, is required for Mediator to function as a co-activator in the purified transcription system (22Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Genetic and functional biochemical studies have also identified connections between TFIIH and Mediator. Deletion of SIN4, whose protein product is a subunit of Mediator, is synthetically lethal with a kin28 temperature-sensitive mutant (25Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4503-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Assembly of TFIIH into a pre-initiation complex in extracts requires Mediator (26Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and, subsequent to transcription initiation, phosphorylation of the CTD by Kin28 correlates with the release of Mediator from the CTD of RNA pol II as promoter clearance occurs (27Svejstrup J.Q. Li Y. Fellows J. Gnatt A. Bjorklund S. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6075-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Within a purified pre-initiation complex, Kin28 was found to phosphorylate the Med4 and Rgr1 subunits of Mediator (6Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, Srb10 has also been shown to phosphorylate Med2 (28Hallberg M. Polozkov G.V. Hu G.Z. Beve J. Gustafsson C.M. Ronne H. Bjorklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3370-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Mediator has been shown to substantially enhance the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA pol II by TFIIH, adding a direct functional connection between TFIIH, the CTD, and Mediator. Several participants in transcription initiation in both yeast and metazoan cells have been shown to enhance phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA pol II. Assembly of the general transcription factors at a promoter (29Lu H. Zawel L. Fisher L. Egly J.M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), DNA alone (30Serizawa H. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17300-17308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TFIIE (31Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20750-20756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9534-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have all been shown to enhance phosphorylation of the CTD by TFIIH. Mediator purified from mouse (33Jiang Y.W. Veschambre P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8538-8543Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (34Spahr H. Beve J. Larsson T. Bergstrom J. Karlsson K.A. Gustafsson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1351-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or S. cerevisiae (22Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) enhances CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH in a largely species-specific manner (34Spahr H. Beve J. Larsson T. Bergstrom J. Karlsson K.A. Gustafsson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1351-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The potential role of various Mediator components in this phenomena is unclear, because the Mediator subunit Gal11 alone can enhance TFIIH kinase activity (32Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9534-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), yet purified mutant yeast Mediator lacking Gal11 still enhances CTD phosphorylation at wild-type levels (35Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the Mediator enhancement of CTD phosphorylation, we have defined the substrate and kinase requirements by using minimal substrates and TFIIH sub-complexes that contain Kin28 or other kinases that are capable of CTD phosphorylation. In the course of this work we found that Kin28 phosphorylation of Med4 occurs in vivo as well as in reactions using purified proteins. We have identified Thr-237 as the site on Med4 phosphorylated by TFIIH and investigated the functional role of this modification. Protein Purification—The S. cerevisiae strain YT063 (3Takagi Y. Komori H. Chang W.H. Hudmon A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43897-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with TAP-tagged TFB3 was grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 3–4 in YPD media (2% w/v peptone, 1% w/v yeast extract, and 2% glucose). The following steps were then performed at 4 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, broken with glass beads as described previously (21Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman JLA-10.500 at 8000 rpm for 20 min. One-ninth volume of 5 m potassium acetate was added, and the lysate was stirred at 4 °C for 20 min. Polyethyleneimine was slowly added to a final concentration of 0.2%, and the lysate was stirred for 30 min followed by a 2-h, 35,000 rpm ultracentrifugation step in a Beckman 45-Ti rotor. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay, and 600 mg of protein was loaded onto 100 μl of IgG-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in IPP-550 (IPP buffer contained 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT; the millimolar concentration of potassium acetate is indicated by a hyphen followed by a number) with protease inhibitors (36Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The lysate and resin were incubated for 2 h with rotation. The beads were collected in a column and washed with 10 ml of IPP-550 with protease inhibitors, 10 ml of IPP-550, and 10 ml of IPP-550 with 0.5 mm EDTA. The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of IPP-550 with 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 μg of mutant TEV protease that resists autoproteolytic inactivation (purified according to Lucast et al. (37Lucast L.J. Batey R.T. Doudna J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)). The beads were incubated with the TEV protease buffer for 10–15 h and the TEV eluate drained from the column. 3 μl of 1 m calcium chloride was added to the eluate, and the mixture was incubated on 200 μl of calmodulin-affinity beads (Stratagene) equilibrated in CBB-550 (CBB buffer contained 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm calcium chloride) for 1 h with rotation. The resin was then washed three times with 10 ml of CBB-550. Bound proteins were eluted with 5 × 200 μl CBE (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 200 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm EGTA). To remove any remaining holo-TFIIH from the TFIIK, the sample was adjusted to 100 mm potassium acetate and loaded on a Mono Q 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer A-100 (Buffer A contained 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT; protease inhibitors; the millimolar concentration of potassium acetate is indicated by a hyphen followed by a number) and eluted with a 18-ml linear gradient to A-1000. TFIIK eluted at ∼260 mm potassium acetate. The vector for expression of recombinant Med4 with a 6-histidine tag (His6·rMed4) on its N terminus was constructed by amplifying the S. cerevisiae Med4 gene by PCR using the primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCTGTCCAAGATACTAAA-3′ and 5′-CGCGCTCGAGTTTTCCAGTTCCTGTGG-3′, cleaving the PCR product with NdeI and XhoI and ligating the product into the vector pET15b (Novagen). The vector (pMed4·15b) was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS, and the transformants were grown at 37 °C to an A550 value of 0.5 in LB media containing 20 mm glucose and the appropriate antibiotics. Expression of His6·rMed4 was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were harvested after 4-h growth at 30 °C. The cells were harvested and lysed with a French pressure cell, and the protein was purified from the soluble fraction on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols. To construct a GST-CTD expression vector, the C-terminal domain and the proceeding acidic domain (38Xiao H. Friesen J.D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7507-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) of S. cerevisiae Rpb1 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GCGCGCGGATCCCCGGTGCATTTGATGTGATG-3′ and 5′-CCGGCCGAATTCTTATCATCTGGAATTTTCATTTTCAT-3′. The PCR product was then cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the expression vector, grown, and lysed, and the protein was purified over glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The full-length GST-CTD fusion protein was separated from N-terminal proteolytic fragments by fractionation on a 1-ml Hi-Trap Phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, the glutathione-Sepharose eluate was adjusted to 1 m AmSO4, loaded on the Phenyl-Sepharose column, and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from buffer C (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 1 m AmSO4, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) to buffer D (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). The full-length fusion protein elutes at ∼50 mm AmSO4. Mediator, RNA pol II, and holo-TFIIH were purified as previously described (36Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Purified Mediator was treated with phosphatase as previously described (39Balciunas D. Hallberg M. Bjorklund S. Ronne H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3831-3839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recombinant Srb10/11 (rSRb10/11) was a gift of C. Hengartner and R. Young and purified from insect cells as described (17Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Casein kinase 1 was from New England Biolabs. A purified synthetic CTD peptide (NH2-YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPS-COOH) was obtained from Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia). Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed as previously described (21Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) with the addition of the following amounts of proteins in the combinations described in the figures: holo-TFIIH (20 fmol), TFIIK (20 fmol), Mediator (30 fmol), GST-CTD (300 fmol), RNA pol II (200 fmol), rSrb10/11 (400 fmol), and casein kinase 1 (25,000 units). Because small changes in the absolute magnitude of the Mediator enhancement between batches of reactions were possible, an individual control is shown for each experiment. Western Blot Analysis—To examine the phosphorylation state of Med4 in the KIN28 wild-type strain (GF260-2) and kin28-ts3 temperature-sensitive strain (JGV105) we followed the protocol of Valay et al. (8Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) previously used to harvest and lyse these same strains for the analysis of the phosphorylation state of Rpb1p. In brief, yeast cultures were grown in YPD medium at 24 °C to an A600 of ∼1.0, quickly shifted to 37 °C, and 5-ml samples were removed at 0, 20, and 60 min. For analysis of the med4-T237A mutant and the MED4 wild-type control, the cells were grown in YPD medium to an A600 of ∼1.2 at 30 °C. The cells were harvested and disrupted as described (8Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 200 μl of loading dye. Protein samples of ∼2 μl were loaded onto an 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with polyclonal α-Med4 serum. Genetic Manipulations—A BamHI-XhoI fragment containing the MED4 gene and its native promoter was cut out of pGM23 (22Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and cloned into these same sites in pRS315 (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to construct the vector pMED4 (LEU2 MED4). Starting from pMED4 the Stratagene QuikChange kit was used to mutate Thr-237 to alanine to create pMED4 T237A (LEU2 med4-T237A), or a stop codon to create pMED4 Δ237 (LEU2 med4-Δ237). A diploid yeast strain (accession number Y22430, EUROSCARF, Frankfurt), that was heterozygous for MED4 deletion (BY4743; MAT a/α; his3Δ1/his3Δ1; leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0/LYS2; MET15/met15Δ0; ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0; med4::kanMX4/MED4) was transformed with pGM23 (MED4 URA) and sporulated, and tetrads were dissected on YPD agar and scored for survival on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) and G418. Using a spore that was G418-resistant and subject to killing by 5-FOA (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; LYS2; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; med4::kanMX4; pGM23 (MED4 URA)), the pMED4 (LEU2 MED4), pMED4 T237A (LEU2 med4-T237A), or pMED4 Δ237 (LEU2 med4-Δ237) plasmids were shuffled as in a previous study (41Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), and survival was scored on 5-FOA. Mass Spectrometry—Gel-resolved proteins were digested with trypsin, batch-purified on a reversed-phase (RP) micro-tip, and an aliquot analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) reflectron time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) (UltraFlex TOF/TOF; BRUKER Daltonics; Bremen, Germany) for peptide mass fingerprinting, as described (42Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Lacomis L. Grewal A. Annan R.S. MacNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. A. 1998; 826: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 43Winkler G.S. Lacomis L. Philip J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Svejstrup J.-Q. Tempst P. Methods. 2002; 26: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This served to confirm the identity of the proteins and to locate possible differences between the tryptic peptide maps of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms. The remainder of the RP-eluted digest mixtures were then subjected to immobilized gallium(III) affinity chromatography for selective capture of phosphopeptides, followed by elution with phosphate buffer, desalting over an RP tip, and a second round of MALDI-reflectron TOF MS (44Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Peak m/z values were matched to the protein sequence, allowing for the likely presence of one or more phosphate groups. Mass spectrometric sequencing of the putative phosphopeptides was then carried by MALDI-TOF/TOF (MS/MS) analysis using the UltraFlex instrument in “LIFT” mode. Fragment ion spectra were inspected for a″, b″, and y″ ions to compare with the computer-generated fragment ion series of the predicted tryptic peptides to locate the exact position of either phosphoserine or phosphothreonine.

Neuropilin-1 (NP-1) is a receptor for VEGF165 and placental growth factor-2 (PlGF-2), but the role of NP-1 in VEGF-dependent neurotrophic actions is unclear. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressed high levels of NP-1 mRNA and protein, much lower levels of KDR, and no detectable Flt-1. VEGF165 and PlGF-2 promoted DRG growth cone formation with an effect similar to that of nerve growth factor, whereas the Flt-1-specific ligand, PlGF-1, and the KDR/Flt-4 ligand, VEGF-D, had no effect. The chemorepellent NP-1 ligand, semaphorin 3A, antagonized the response to VEGF and PlGF-2. The specific KDR inhibitor, SU5614, did not affect the anti-chemorepellent effects of VEGF and PlGF-2, whereas a novel, specific antagonist of VEGF binding to NP-1, called EG3287, prevented inhibition of growth cone collapse. VEGF stimulated prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 production in DRG cultures that was blocked by inhibitors of cyclooxygenases; the anti-chemorepellent activities of VEGF and PlGF-2 were abrogated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and a variety of prostacyclin analogues and prostaglandins strikingly inhibited growth cone collapse. These findings support a specific role for NP-1 in mediating neurotrophic actions of VEGF family members and also identify a novel role for prostanoids in the inhibition of neuronal chemorepulsion.

A growing body of evidence indicates that VEGF also has neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities. VEGF stimulates axonal outgrowth and enhances the survival of superior cervical and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (3Sondell M. Lundborg G. Kanje M. J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the neuronal effects of VEGF remain largely unclear, however. VEGF exerts its biological effects through high affinity binding to two tyrosine kinase receptors, Flt-1 (VEGF-R1) and KDR (VEGF-R2), which are expressed in most vascular endothelial cells (8Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3118) Google Scholar, 9Zachary I. Gliki G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). KDR binds VEGF with lower affinity than Flt-1 and is also recognized by VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-E, whereas Flt-1 is also a receptor for PlGF and VEGF-B (1Ferrara N. Gerber H.-P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7667) Google Scholar). After binding and activation of KDR, VEGF stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and an array of other early signaling events followed by short and long term cellular biological effects including production of prostacyclin (PGI2) and nitric oxide, increased cell survival, cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis (10Waltenberger J.

The function of Flt-1 in the endothelium is unclear, but it is thought to regulate the activity of VEGF partly by acting as a decoy receptor, and in part though direct regulatory effects on KDR (1Ferrara N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Neuropilin-1 (NP-1) is a non-tyrosine kinase receptor for VEGF165, the heparin-binding PlGF-2 isoform, VEGF-B, and VEGF-E (19Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar, 20Migdal M. Huppertz B. Tessler S. Comforti A. Shibuya M. Reich R. Baumann H. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

NP-1 was first identified as a receptor for semaphorin 3A (sema 3A), a member of a family of polypeptides involved in axonal guidance and patterning (22He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 23Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), and is expressed in endothelial cells, several tumor cell types, and in certain types of neuron including DRG, olfactory, and optic nerves (19Soker S.

Hirata T. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NP-2 has a similar domain structure to NP-1 with 44% amino acid identity and exhibits a distinct expression pattern in the developing nervous system (23Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 25Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Sema 3A binds and induces neuronal growth cone collapse specifically through NP-1, whereas sema 3B, 3C, 3E, and 3F recognize both neuropilins, acting as NP-1 antagonists and NP-2 agonists (25Chen H.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Neuropilins also play essential roles in angiogenesis. Overexpression of NP-1 in mice results in increased capillary formation, vasodilatation, and malformation of the heart (29Kitsukawa T. Shimono A. Kawakami A. Kondoh H. Fujisawa H. Development. 1995; 121: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mice deficient in NP-1 exhibit both defects in embryonic axonal patterning and an array of vascular abnormalities including defective development of large vessels and impaired neural and yolk sac vascularization (30Kawasaki T. Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of both NP-1 and NP-2 causes a more severe failure of embryonic vascularization resulting in death at E8.5 (31Takashima S. Kitakaze M. Asakura M. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Tashiro F. Niwa H. Miyazaki J.J. Hirota S. Kitamura Y. Kitsukawa T. Fujisawa H. Klagsbrun M. Hori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, despite the strong evidence that NP-1 is a major receptor for VEGF165, its roles in the biological functions of this factor remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to define the receptors and intracellular mechanisms underlying VEGF-dependent inhibition of DRG growth cone collapse. DRG neurons expressed high levels of NP-1 mRNA and protein and a low level of KDR. VEGF164/165 and PlGF-2, ligands for NP-1, both inhibited growth cone collapse with similar efficacy, whereas ligands specific for either Flt-1 or KDR and Flt-4 had no effect. The chemoattractant effects of VEGF164/165 and PlGF-2 were unaffected by KDR inhibition but were blocked by a specific inhibitor of VEGF binding to NP-1. The results also show that the inhibition of growth cone collapse by VEGF family NP-1 ligands is dependent upon cyclooxygenase-derived prostanoid production and that prostanoids exert striking anti-chemorepellent effects on DRG neurons. These findings demonstrate key roles for NP-1 and prostanoid generation in mediating neuroprotective effects of VEGF family members in DRG neurons. Materials—Recombinant human VEGF165 (hVEGF165), rat VEGF164 (rVEGF164), PlGF-1, PlGF-2, sema 3A, and VEGF-D were obtained from R & D Systems. Iloprost and cicaprost were the gift of Dr. Fiona McDonald (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany). PGE2, NS-398, SC-560, indomethacin, SQ22536, and 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (DDA) were from Calbiochem. Carbaprostacyclin, PGE1, sulprostone, and butaprost were from Cayman Chemical Inc. M199 and Ham's F-12 medium were from Invitrogen. Endothelial cell basal medium and DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, were from Clonetics and Sigma, respectively. EG3287 was synthesized as described previously (32, Selwood, D., Zachary, I., and Loehr, M. (October 9, 2003) U. S. Patent WO03082918Google Scholar) and by Bachem Inc. and was >90% pure. Full details of the design, synthesis, and biological characterization of EG3287 will be described elsewhere. 2H. Jia, A. Bagherzadeh, M. Löhr, L. Cheng, D. Selwood, and I. Zachary, manuscript in preparation. All other reagents used were of the purest grade available. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from TCS CellWorks Ltd. (Buckingham, UK) and cultured in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin-8. Porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing NP-1 (PAE/NP-1) were provided by Dr. Shay Soker. The cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 μg/ml hygromycin B. PAE cells expressing either KDR (PAE/KDR) or Flt-1 (PAE/Flt-1) were provided by Professor Lena Claesson-Welsh and grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 250 μg/ml gentamicin G418. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants from newborn rats were cultured as described (33Williams R.S. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 34Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) on 24-well tissue culture plates precoated with poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml) and laminin (10 μg/ml) in serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml transferrin, 16 μg/ml putrescine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 50 ng/ml thyroxine, 50 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 39 ng/ml sodium selenite, 100 μg/ml crystallized bovine serum albumin, and with or without nerve growth factor (50 ng ml-1, mouse 7 S form, Alomone Labs). Cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 μm) was added after 1 day in culture to kill non-neuronal cells. To obtain DRG neuronal cell cultures, DRG were dissected into L15 medium and then incubated at 37 °C in EBSS containing 0.025% trypsin, 0.1% collagenase, and 0.004% DNase; enzymes were inactivated by addition of 10% fetal calf serum, and the suspension was centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in growth medium and filtered through nylon mesh (20-μm pore size) to obtain a single cell suspension. Sciatic nerves were dissected from P7 rats, enzymatically dissociated to single cells, and filtered through 20-μm gauze, and the Schwann cells were purified by immunopanning to remove OX42-positive blood cells and Thy+ fibroblasts as described previously (34Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These cells were plated on poly-d-lysine and laminin-coated dishes and grown in serum-free, defined medium. Fibroblasts were from Thy+ panning dishes and plated on PDL-coated dishes; growth medium was DMEM/F-12 plus 10% fetal calf serum. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from P4 rats and dissociated in calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' solution containing trypsin, grown in neurobasal medium with 200 mm glutamine, newborn serum, and B27 supplement. Neuronal Growth Cone Collapse—The growth factors and chemicals to be tested were added after 1 day, and explants were cultured for a further 24 h or at the times indicated before fixation. Recombinant sema 3A protein was routinely added only for 30 min prior to fixation. Explants or cells were loaded with the fluorescent dye calcein (Molecular Probes) for 30 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in cytoskeletal buffer containing 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6.1, with 138 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA buffer; aldehydes were quenched with sodium borohydride. In some experiments, cells were labeled with monoclonal antibody to acetylated tubulin (Sigma, clone 6-11 B-1) followed by anti-mouse immunoglobulin and then biotin/streptavidin conjugated to Texas Red. Random fields were scored at the perimeter of the axonal halo that grows out from the explanted cell bodies. Collapsed growth cones had no calcein-labeled lamellae extending beyond the microtubules. Experiments were performed by using triplicate coverslips for each treatment, and data were pooled from three to five different cultures. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 64 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were probed with antibodies to NP-1, NP-2, KDR, and Flt-1 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). RNA Isolation and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Ltd.). During RNA purification an on-column DNase digestion was performed using the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen Ltd.) to remove residual chromosomal DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of each total RNA sample using the Superscript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed on a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research, Inc.) using the TaqPCR master mix kit (Qiagen Ltd.) and custom-made rat or human gene-specific oligonucleotide primers (MWG Biotec). The PCR cycle number required for amplification to be within the exponential phase was experimentally determined for each primer pair. First strand cDNAs were normalized with respect to expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sense 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and antisense 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Subsequently, first strand cDNAs were used to assess expression of neuropilin 1 (sense 5′-TCAGGACCACACAGGAGATG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTGGCTTCCTGGAGATGTTC-3′), neuropilin 2 (human/mouse/rat neuropilin 2 primer pair, R & D Systems), KDR (sense 5′-TAAGGGCATGGAGTTCTTGG-3′ and antisense 5′-AGGAAACAGGTGAGGTAGGC-3′), and Flt-1 (sense 5′-TGCAAGGAACCTCAGACAAG-3′ and antisense 5′-GCAGTATTCCACGATCACCA-3′). PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. 125I-VEGF165 Binding—Confluent endothelial cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. At 4 °C, various concentrations of peptides, as indicated, diluted in binding medium (DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) were added, followed by addition of the indicated concentration of 125I-VEGF165 (1200–1800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the medium was aspirated and washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed with 0.25 m NaOH, 0.5% SDS solution, and the bound radioactivity of the lysates was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled VEGF165. PGI2 and PGE2 assay—Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the stable PGI2 metabolite, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α, were measured in DRG culture supernatants using specific enzyme immunoassays kits (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of data was performed using the Prism (version 3.0) statistical package. Differences in the frequency of growth cone collapse between two groups were assessed by χ2 test. A value of p < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. The expression of the VEGF receptors, KDR, Flt1, NP-1, and NP-2, was examined in DRG neurons by RT-PCR and Western blot and compared with that in HUVECs, an endothelial cell type that naturally expresses all four receptors abundantly. Cultured DRG neurons, DRG-associated fibroblasts, Schwann cells, and hippocampal neurons all strongly expressed mRNA for NP-1 at a level similar to that in HUVECs and co-expressed NP-2 at a lower level (Fig. 1A). KDR mRNA was detectable in DRG neurons but at a much lower level than in HUVECs, and Flt-1 expression was not detectable (Fig. 1A). KDR and Flt-1 mRNAs were not detected in the other neuronal cell types examined. Western blot analysis showed that DRG-derived neurons expressed a NP-1-immunoreactive band of Mr ∼130,000 that co-migrated with the major NP-1 band present in HUVECs and at a similar level (Fig. 1B). In contrast, NP-2 was strongly expressed in HUVECs but not detectable in DRG extracts. Immunoreactive bands corresponding to KDR and Flt-1 could not be detected in DRG neurons but were strongly expressed in HUVECs. Treatment of cultured DRG explants with rVEGF164 in the absence of other factors reduced growth cone collapse from ∼60 to ∼40%, an effect very similar to that of nerve growth factor (Fig. 2A). In addition to reducing the percentage of collapsed growth cones, it was also observed that rVEGF164 induced a noticeable increase in the area of individual growth cones (Fig. 2B). Similar effects were produced by hVEGF165 and the heparin-binding PlGF isoform, PlGF-2, that binds to both Flt-1 and NP-1 (20Migdal M. Huppertz B. Tessler S. Comforti A. Shibuya M. Reich R. Baumann H. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22272-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In contrast, PlGF-1, a specific ligand for Flt-1 that is unable to bind NP-1, caused no decrease in growth cone collapse. In addition, VEGF-D, a ligand for KDR and Flt-4 (35Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Makinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), had no effect on growth cone collapse at concentrations from 50 ng/ml up to 1 μg/ml; it was verified that VEGF-D at 1 μg/ml induced KDR phosphorylation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, cell migration, and tubulogenesis in HUVECs (results not shown). Recombinant sema 3A protein induced growth cone collapse in cultured DRG explants in a concentration-dependent manner, and preincubation with either rVEGF164, hVEGF165, or PlGF-2 inhibited the chemorepulsive effect of 100 and 500 ng/ml sema 3A (Fig. 2C). The anti-chemorepulsive effects of rVEGF164 or mPlGF-2 were not reduced by a specific inhibitor of the KDR tyrosine kinase, SU5614, whereas this inhibitor blocked a range of VEGF-induced signaling events and biological responses in HUVECs (results not shown). To examine specifically the role of NP-1 receptors in DRG neurons, several peptides encoded by VEGF exons 7 and/or 8 (Table I), previously identified as the major NP-1-binding region (36Soker S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31582-31588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), were tested for their effects on 125I-VEGF binding to NP-1. At a concentration of 100 μm, a dicyclic exon 7-derived peptide (32, Selwood, D., Zachary, I., and Loehr, M. (October 9, 2003) U. S. Patent WO03082918Google Scholar) corresponding to residues 138–165 of VEGF165 comprising the COOH-terminal residues of exon 7 and all of exon 8 (designated EG3287) inhibited 125I-VEGF165 binding to PAE/NP-1 (Fig. 3A). EG3287 inhibited binding of radiolabeled 125I-VEGF165 to PAE/NP-1 with an IC50 of 3 μm and 95% inhibition of binding at 100 μm but had no effect on 125I-VEGF165 binding to PAE/KDR or PAE/Flt1 cells (Fig. 3B). EG3287 also inhibited 125I-VEGF165 to HUVECs with reduced potency (IC50 26 μm) and caused ∼70% inhibition of specific binding at 100 μm, consistent with expression of KDR and Flt-1 receptors in these cells (Fig. 3B). Preparations of EG3287 retained full activity, as determined by inhibition of 125I-VEGF165 binding to NP-1, for up to 12 months with storage at -20 °C.Table IVEGF exon 7/8 peptides Boldface letters indicate aminobutyric acid. Open table in a new tab EG3287 reduced the anti-chemorepulsive effects of rVEGF164 and PlGF-2 within the concentration range 10–100 μm (Fig. 4, A–C) and also blocked the ability of VEGF to inhibit sema 3A-induced growth cone collapse (results not shown). EG3287 co-incubation of sema 3A with a submaximum concentration of the antagonist (30 μm) caused some increase in growth cone collapse above that obtained with either EG3287 or sema 3A alone, but the effect of the two combined was not additive (results not shown). Incubation of DRG explants with EG3287 alone caused a marked and concentration-dependent increase in growth cone collapse with a detectable effect at 10 μm and a maximum effect at 100 μm similar to the effect of sema 3A (Fig. 4C). The results presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 indicated that the chemoattractant and anti-chemorepulsive effects of VEGF in DRG growth cones were mediated primarily through the NP-1 receptor with little involvement of Flt-1 or the major VEGF signaling receptor, KDR. Given that NP-1 does not have a known signaling function, we next examined other signaling pathways that could be responsible for mediating VEGF-dependent inhibition of DRG growth cone collapse. Prostaglandins exert direct effects on sensory neurons via specific EP and IP receptors (37Smith J.A. Amagasu S.M. Eglen R.M. Hunter J.C. Bley K.R. Br. J.

Treatment of DRG neurons with rVEGF164 and PlGF-2 increased production of PGI2 and PGE2 that was inhibited by the nonspecific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, indomethacin, and specific inhibitors of COX-1, SC560, and COX-2, NS-398 (Fig. 5A). In three independent experiments, rVEGF164 and PlGF-2, respectively, increased production of PGI2 1.7- and 1.6-fold (p < 0.014 and 0.019 for rVEGF164 and PlGF-2 versus control), and PGE2 2.4- and 1.6-fold (p < 0.015 and 0.022 for rVEGF164 and PlGF-2 versus control) above the control, unstimulated level. Significant basal PGI2 and PGE2 production was detected in DRG cultures and was also markedly reduced by COX inhibitors (Fig. 5A). To examine whether endogenous prostanoid production was necessary for the inhibition of growth cone collapse by VEGF164 and PlGF-2, DRG explants were treated with these factors in the presence of COX inhibitors. Indomethacin caused an increase in the basal level of growth cone collapse and prevented inhibition of collapse induced by rVEGF164 or PlGF-2 (Fig. 5B). SC560 and NS-398 similarly reduced the anti-chemorepulsive effects of rVEGF164 and PlGF-2 and caused a more marked inhibition of the response to rVEGF164 and PlGF-2 when added together (Fig. 5B). The inhibition of anti-chemorepellent effects of VEGF by COX inhibitors prompted us to examine whether addition of exogenous prostanoids could prevent growth cone collapse. The prostacyclin analogues iloprost, cicaprost, and carbaprostacyclin all caused a striking decrease in the percentage of collapsed growth cones, accompanied by an increase in the size of growth cones (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, the prostaglandins, PGE1 and PGE2, markedly inhibited growth cone collapse, whereas the EP3 and EP1 receptor agonist, sulprostone, and the EP2 agonist butaprost had little effect. Similar to results obtained with VEGF164/165 and PlGF-2, iloprost antagonized the chemorepulsive effects of 100 and 500 ng/ml sema 3A (Fig. 6C). Al"

This high-resolution analysis indicates that the active site is partially occupied with picric acid and that the anomalous density seen in the original study is attributed to the population of multiple conformational states of Trp-102 and not a formal covalent bond between the indole ring of Trp-102 and picric acid. The significance of any interaction between Trp-102 and nitroaromatic substrates was probed further in solution and crystal complexes with wild-type and mutant (W102Y and W102F) enzymes.

Solution studies indicate tighter binding of picric acid in the active sites of the W102Y and W102F enzymes. Mutation of Trp-102 does not impair significantly enzyme reduction by NADPH, but the kinetics of decay of the hydride-Meisenheimer complex are accelerated in the mutant enzymes. The data reveal that decay of the hydride-Meisenheimer complex is enzyme catalyzed and that the final distribution of reaction products for the mutant enzymes is substantially different from wild-type enzyme.

Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) 1The abbreviations used are: PETN, pentaerythritol tetranitrate; TNT, trinitrotoluene; GTN, glycerol trinitrate; OYE, old yellow enzyme; 2,4-DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol. reductase is a member of the old yellow enzyme (OYE) family of flavoproteins and was purified from a strain of Enterobacter cloacae (strain PB2) originally isolated on the basis of its ability to utilize nitrate ester explosives such as PETN and glycerol trinitrate (GTN) as sole nitrogen source (1Binks P.R.

Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is similar to that of OYE (3Fox K.M. Karplus P.A.

Consistent with this close relationship is the ability of the OYE family of enzymes to reduce a variety of cyclic enones, including 2-cyclohexenone and steroids. Some steroids act as substrates, whereas others are potent inhibitors of these enzymes. PETN reductase, and the related orthologues from strains of Pseudomonas (7Blehert D.S. Fox B.G. Chambliss G.H.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7796-7802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), show reactivity against explosive substrates. PETN reductase degrades major classes of explosive, including nitroaromatic compounds (e.g. trinitrotoluene TNT) and nitrate esters (GTN and PETN) (9French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ.

Degradation of TNT involves reductive hydride addition to the aromatic nucleus (Fig. 1). In the case of members of the old yellow enzyme family of enzymes that are closely related to PETN reductase, the products of TNT reduction have been shown to result from both reductive hydride addition at the aromatic nucleus and also nitro group reduction in two competing pathways in the oxidative half-reaction of the enzyme (9French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pak J.W. Knoke K.L. Noguera D.R. Fox B.G. Chambliss G.H. Appl. Environ.

The reaction of PETN reductase comprises two half-reactions: in the reductive half-reaction, enzyme is reduced by NADPH to yield the dihydroquinone form of the enzyme-bound FMN, and in the oxidative half-reaction the flavin is oxidized by the nitro-containing explosive substrates or cyclic enone substrates. A detailed kinetic mechanism based on stopped-flow data has been proposed (14Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and recently hydride transfer in the reductive half-reaction was shown to proceed by quantum mechanical tunneling (15Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The structures of PETN reductase in complex with steroid substrates and inhibitors have been determined (2Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), as have complexes of the enzyme with 2-cyclohexenone, the inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), and the substrates TNT and picric acid (14Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 1.55 Å structure of the enzyme in complex with picric acid indicated additional electron density between the indole ring of residue Trp-102 and the nitro group at C-6 of picrate, which at this resolution suggested the presence of an unusual bond between substrate and the tryptophan side chain (14Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The formation of such an unusual bond would clearly have profound implications for the mechanism of picric acid and TNT reduction in the enzyme. Thus, to address the origin of the additional electron density observed between residue Trp-102 and picric acid, in this paper we have extended the resolution of the wild-type enzyme in complex with picric acid to 0.9 Å. Our high resolution studies reveal that the additional density observed in the 1.55 Å structure of the wild-type-picric acid complex is attributed to the population of multiple conformational states of Trp-102 and not a formal covalent bond between the indole ring of Trp-102 and picric acid. To understand further the reaction mechanism of PETN reductase, and in particular the role of Trp-102, we have mutated this residue to phenylalanine (W102F) and tyrosine (W102Y) and we describe detailed kinetic studies of these mutant PETN reductases. Solution studies indicate that exchange of Trp-102 for tyrosine and phenylalanine favors the binding of picric acid through the removal of steric constraints, an aspect also confirmed by determination of the crystal structures of these enzymes bound to picric acid. Kinetic and NMR studies with the mutant and wild-type enzymes indicate that removal of the indole side chain also influences the distribution of the reaction products with the nitroaromatic substrate TNT. The role of Trp-102 in catalysis by PETN reductase and related enzymes, and implications for the partitioning of reaction pathways in nitroaromatic reduction, are discussed. Chemicals—All chemicals were of analytical grade where possible. Complex bacteriological media were from Unipath, and all media were prepared as described in Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mimetic Orange 2 affinity chromatography resin was from Affinity Chromatography Ltd. Q-Sepharose resin was from Amersham Biosciences. NADPH, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate, benzyl viologen, methyl viologen, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone, phenazine methosulfate and 2,4-DNP were from Sigma. 2-Cyclohexenone was from Acros Organics. Dr. S. Nicklin (UK Defense and Evaluation Research Agency) supplied TNT, GTN, and picric acid. The following extinction coefficients were used to calculate the concentration of substrates and enzyme: NADPH (ϵ340 = 6.22 × 103m-1 cm-1); PETN reductase (ϵ464 = 11.3 × 103m-1 cm-1). Stock solutions of TNT (600 mm) were made up in acetone. Dilutions were then made into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the acetone concentration was maintained at 1% (v/v). The presence of acetone in buffers at 1% (v/v) was shown not to affect enzyme activity. Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis of Trp-102 was achieved using the QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene) and the following oligonucleotides (and their complementary sequences): 5′-CGG TTC AGC TGT TTC ACA CCG GTC G-3′ (W102F forward primer), 5′-CGA CCG GTG TGA AAC AGC TGA ACC G-3′ (W102F, reverse primer), 5′-CGG TTC AGC TGT ATC ACA CCG GTC G-3′ (W102Y, forward primer), and 5′-CGA CCG GTG TGA TAC AGC TGA ACC G-3′(W102Y, reverse primer). Plasmid pONR1 (6French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6623-6627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template for mutagenesis reactions. All mutant genes were completely sequenced to ensure that spurious changes had not arisen during the mutagenesis reaction. The expression and purification of the wild-type and mutant PETN reductase enzymes was as described previously for wild-type enzyme (6French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. J.

We have shown subsequently that this value is incorrect because of incorrect calibration of the electrode used in potentiometric analysis. Correct values for wild-type PETN reductase (-267 ± 5 mV) and the W102Y (-236 ± 5 mV) and W102F (-241 ± 5 mV) enzymes were determined and reported herein.

Data were collected in the UV-visible region (250–600 nm), and the absorption at 518 nm plotted as a function of ligand concentration. Data in the plots were analyzed by fitting to Equation 1,ΔA=ΔAmax2ET[(LT+ET+Kd)−((LT+ET+Kd)2−(4LTET))0.5](Eq. 1) where ΔAmax is the maximum absorption change at 518 nm, LT is the total ligand concentration and ET the total enzyme concentration. Rapid reaction kinetic experiments using single wavelength absorption and photodiode array detection were performed using an Applied Photophysics SF.17MV stopped-flow instrument contained within an anaerobic glove box as described previously for wild-type PETN reductase (14Khan H.

Multiple Turnover Studies and NMR Analysis of Reaction Products— Multiple turnover studies were performed under anaerobic conditions and the reaction progress monitored by absorption spectroscopy. The reaction mix (total volume, 1 ml) comprised 0.2 μm PETN reductase, 30 μm NADPH, and 100 μm TNT contained in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and reactions were performed at 25 °C. A NADPH-generating system comprising 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was also included in the reaction mix. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Jasco V530 spectrophotometer contained within a Belle Technology anaerobic glove box. Multiple turnover studies were also performed directly in the NMR instrument. Reference one- and two-dimensional COSY proton spectra were collected for the reaction components. The reaction mixture of 1 mm TNT, 0.2 μm PETN reductase, 1.5 mm NADPH, in the D2O buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) was transferred into the NMR tube under anaerobic conditions, and a series of one-dimensional NMR spectra were collected at 5-min intervals. Upon completion of the reaction, as evidenced by the absence of changes in the NMR spectra, a two-dimensional COSY spectrum was acquired. The dead time of the reaction between the mixing of the components and the acquisition of the first one-dimensional spectrum was ∼10 min. All spectra were acquired at 600 MHz on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer at 25 °C. The spectra were processed and analyzed using XWINNMR 3.5 software (Bruker), and were referenced to the external DSS standard at 0.000 ppm.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggests that, upon binding picric acid, the side chain of Trp-102 moves to accommodate the bulky nitro group at C-6. The relatively low occupancy of the picric acid leads to an apparent connection between the electron densities even at near-atomic resolution. The electron density of the minor conformation was initially interpreted as evidence for the lack of planarity of the indole side chain of Trp-102, which would be expected upon formation of a link between picric acid and the indole side chain but, as demonstrated herein, extension to high resolution indicates that this is not the case. The multiple conformations of Trp-102 have a further effect on the side chain of Thr-104, which is seen to adopt two conformations. Tyr-68, which is also involved in formation of the active site is also seen to adopt two conformations about chi-2; these multiple conformations are seen to extend as far as the main chain of Gly-67 (Fig. 3). The side chain of Ser-132, distal to the active site from Tyr-68, is also seen to have two conformations. There are also other regions of the enzyme away from the active site where multiple conformations are found, which is consistent with observations made with other structures reported at subatomic resolution (e.g. Ref. 22Lario P.I. Sampson N. Vrielink A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1635-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In particular, methionine and proline show as mixed conformational populations. There is also evidence for the radiation-induced decarboxylation of some amino acid residue side chains and the carboxyl-terminal group as reported by Ravelli and McSweeny (23Ravelli R.B. McSweeney S.M. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 315-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (332) Google Scholar); deamination of some side chains is also seen at a lower level. Crystallographic Structures of the W102Y and W102F Enzyme-Ligand Complexes and Ligand Binding to W102Y and W102F Enzymes—In contrast to the multiple conformations found in the active site of the wild-type enzyme, the W102F and W102Y mutant enzymes, where a potential steric clash upon picrate binding has been removed by engineering, show no evidence for multiple conformations of the residues in the active site. Furthermore, the picric acid appears to fully occupy the active site. The active sites of the mutants are shown in Fig. 3B. The mutations at residue 102 have not introduced any other significant alteration. The structures suggest that the nitro group at C-6 of picric acid is accommodated without steric clash, which should favor binding of picric acid (and by inference TNT which is likely to bind in a similar mode, Ref. 14Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in the active site of PETN reductase. The binding of nitroaromatic compounds (picric acid and TNT) to wild-type and mutant forms of PETN reductase was investigated by perturbation of the electronic absorption spectrum of the enzyme-bound FMN. Equilibrium binding measurements with wild-type PETN reductase have been reported (14Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and an identical approach was used with the mutant enzymes. Addition of picric acid and 2,4-DNP to the mutant PETN reductase enzymes elicited changes in the electronic absorption spectrum with well defined isosbestic points (Fig. 4) and enzyme-ligand dissociation constants were calculated by fitting data obtained at 518 nm to Equation 1. Enzyme-ligand dissociation constants are collected in Table II. With picric acid, the dissociation constants indicate tighter binding of the ligand to the mutant enzymes compared with wild-type PETN reductase. The wild-type and mutant enzymes have similar affinities for 2,4-DNP. These observations are consistent with the crystallographic data, which indicate a steric interaction between the side chain of Trp-102 and one of the nitro groups of picric acid, but not 2,4-DNP. Titrations were also performed with progesterone, an inhibitor of PETN reductase that also elicits spectral changes on binding in the active site (14Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this case, the dissociation constant for the progesterone-enzyme complex is not affected by mutation, which is consistent with the lack of interaction between Trp-102 and progesterone in the crystal structure of the steroid-enzyme complex (2Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As with wild-type PETN reductase (14Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the addition of TNT to the W102Y and W102F enzymes did not elicit spectral change, suggesting weak binding of this ligand is attributed to poor interaction of the methyl group of TNT with His-181 and His-184. These latter residues form strong interactions with the hydroxy group of picric acid, which is replaced by a methyl group in TNT.Table IICalculated dissociation constants for wild-type, W102F, and W102Y PETN reductases Wild-type PETN reductase and W102F and W102Y mutant enzymes (10 μm) were each titrated with picric acid, progesterone, and 2,4-DNP in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 25 °C.

The rate of formation and decay of the charge-transfer complex for the mutant enzymes was measured in stopped-flow studies with absorption detection at 560 nm (Fig. 5). Reduction of the flavin was monitored at 464 nm as a single exponential decrease in absorbance and was shown to be kinetically equivalent to the slow-down phase observed in the biphasic transients observed at 560 nm. As with wild-type PETN reductase (14Khan H. Harris R.J. Barna T. Craig D.H. Bruce N.C. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the rate of flavin reduction for the mutant enzymes was essentially independent of NADPH concentration (range 100–1000 μm coenzyme) at 5 °C (Fig. 5A). Global analysis of photodiode array data has indicated that flavin reduction is essentially irreversible in wild-type PETN reductase (i.e. k-2 ∼0; see Ref. 15Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar for more detailed discussion), and similar observations were made for the W102Y and W102F enzymes by global fitting of spectral data sets obtained in stopped-flow studies of the reductive half-reaction (data not shown). Consistent with the kinetic model proposed for wild-type enzyme (Scheme 1), charge-transfer complex (E-NADPH) formation in the mutant enzymes is dependent on NADPH concentration and is reversible (Fig. 5B). Rate constants for formation and decay of the charge-transfer complex and for flavin reduction are given in Table III. From these data it is clear that mutation of Trp-102 does not substantially affect the rate of flavin reduction by NADPH or the rate of formation and decay of the E-NADPH charge-transfer species, although a modest ∼2-fold increase in the hydride transfer rate and the rate of decay of the enzyme-NADPH complex is seen with the W102F PETN reductase.Fig. 5Plot"

Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we further show that Ski together with Smad4 binds to the endogenous Smad7 promoter. Finally, we show that RNAi knockdown of Ski increases Smad7 reporter gene activity in transient transfection assays as well as elevating the endogenous level of Smad7 mRNA.

The 8-bp palindromic sequence (GTCTAGAC) was initially identified to be a high affinity binding site for Ski, screened by using nuclear extracts from c-Ski-transformed cells (11Nicol R. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3588-3597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, Ski cannot bind to this sequence directly. Instead, Ski bound to this site along with certain unidentified cellular proteins (11Nicol R. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3588-3597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Shortly afterward, the same 8-bp palindromic sequence was found to be the consensus binding site for Smad3 and Smad4, identified by a PCR-based selection from random oligonucleotides using recombinant full-length Smad4 or the N-terminal domain of Smad3 (12Zawel L.

This led to the hypothesis that Ski may bind to the GTCTAGAC sequence indirectly through interaction with Smad4 or Smad3. Indeed, several independent studies on Smads subsequently found that Ski and the related SnoN interact with Smads (13Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Ski may also inhibit TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses by competing with Smad2 and Smad3 binding to Smad4 (20Frederick J.P. Wang X.F.

In addition, Ski has also been reported to inhibit TGF-β signaling by suppressing Smad2 phosphorylation by the receptor (26Prunier C. Pessah M. Ferrand N. Seo S.R. Howe P. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26249-26257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The transforming activity of Ski and SnoN is dependent on their ability to repress the activity of Smad proteins (27He J. Tegen S.B. Krawitz A.R. Martin G.S. Luo K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30540-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to Smads, Ski is also required for transcriptional repression by several other proteins, including the Mad repressor, the thyroid hormone receptor-β, the Rb protein, and the Gli3 repressor (19Liu X.

Thus, Ski appears to be an integral part of the cellular transcriptional repression machinery. SnoN, and to a lesser extent Ski, is degraded upon TGF-β treatment (16Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S.

Interestingly, the Smad7 promoter represents the first natural promoter in vertebrates that contains the 8-base pair (GTCTAGAC) palindromic Smad-binding element (SBE).

In this study, we show that Ski, recruited to the SBE by interacting with Smad4, inhibits the basal level of the endogenous Smad7 gene. Our studies provide the first evidence that Ski indeed is a corepressor of Smad4 to repress a natural TGF-β responsive gene at the basal state. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—HaCaT, L17, HepG2, and SW 480.7 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran (125 μg/ml) for 3–5 h and treated with or without 500 pm TGF-β for 18–24 h. HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000. The Smad7-Luc (–251 to +32) reporter genes containing wild type or mutant SBE were used. Very similar results were obtained using the Smad7-Luc (–339 to +641) reporter gene. The results represent at least three independent transfection experiments. RNAi—The RNAi constructs were built in the pSHAG-1 vector (32Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The Ski RNAi #1 construct targets Ski mRNA starting at nucleotide 30. The sequences of the two oligonucleotides are as follows: TCTTCTGCAGCCCCGGGTGCGGCTGGAAGAAGCTTGTTCCGGCTGCACCTGGGGCTGCAGAGGACGCTTTTTT and GATCAAAAAAGCGTCCTCTGCAGCCCCAGGTGCAGCCGGAACAAGCTTCTTCCAGCCGCACCCGGGGCTGCAGAAGACG.

For siRNA experiments, guaranteed double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. HeLa cells were transfected using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) and harvested 60–72 h post-transfection. poly(A)+ RNA were then purified. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was carried out as described previously (33Saunders A. Werner J. Andrulis E.D. Nakayama T. Hirose S. Reinberg D. Lis J.T. Science. 2003; 301: 1094-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. HepG2, SW480.7, or HeLa cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 20 min. Cells were sonicated on ice nine times each 30 s with the Fisher Sonic Dismembrator 300. The desired amount of protein-cross-linked DNA extract was precleared in batches. The following antibodies were used for this assay: 4 μl of anti-Ski antibody (H-329, Santa Cruz), 4 μl of SnoN antibody (N-20, Santa Cruz), 4 μl of the Smad4 antibody (6Denissova N.G. Pouponnot C. Long J. He D. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6397-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), 4 μl of anti-Smad2/3 antibody (6Denissova N.G. Pouponnot C. Long J. He D. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6397-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and 4 μl of goat IgG as a negative control. The Smad7 SBE is localized at –210. The primer TAGAAACCCGATCTGTTGTTTGCG (Smad7 promoter sequence –274 to –251) and the primer CCTCTGCTCGGCTGGTTCCACTGC (Smad7 promoter sequence –142 to –165) were used to amplify the fragment of the Smad7 promoter. The upstream pair of primers, TAGAAACCGGAGCCCGGAGCTGAGAG (Smad7 promoter sequence –778 to –753) and ATTTATACCGGACTGGACCGAGGC (Smad7 promoter sequence –638 to –661), and the downstream pair of primers, AAAGACCAGAGACTCCCCTAAACC (Smad7 5′UTR +584 to +607) and GCTCCTCTTCCTCTCCTTTTCTTC (Smad7 5′UTR +715 to +692), served as negative controls. Both pairs amplified the corresponding fragment from the Smad7 plasmid by PCR and yielded essentially the same size PCR product as the primers that span the SBE. Mutation of the SBE Confers a Higher Basal Activity on the Smad7 Reporter Gene—As we and others have previously reported, the 8-base pair palindromic SBE is essential for TGF-β induction of the Smad7 promoter (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, mutation of the SBE leads to a significantly higher basal transcriptional activity of the Smad7 reporter gene in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A). This effect was also observed in a number of other cell types that we examined, such as HeLa, Mv1Lu/L17, and 293 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). In HaCaT keratinocytes, this effect is modest (Fig. 1B), similar to our previous report (6Denissova N.G. Pouponnot C. Long J. He D. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6397-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which may reflect very low levels of the Ski and SnoN proteins in HaCaT cells (data not shown). Overall, these observations suggest that certain factors bind to the 8-bp palindromic SBE and repress the basal transcriptional activity of the Smad7 promoter. When the SBE is mutated, the basal activity then increases because of derepression. Ectopically Expressed Ski and SnoN Repress the Basal Transcriptional Activity of the Smad7 Reporter Gene in a SBE-dependent Manner—To identify the factors that inhibit the Smad7 basal level, we first asked whether overexpression of Ski or SnoN, which can be recruited to the SBE by Smads, can inhibit the Smad7 reporter construct. As shown in Fig. 2A, overexpression of Ski or SnoN inhibited the Smad7 basal level in a dose-dependent manner. When the SBE is mutated, the inhibitory effect of Ski or SnoN is abrogated. Both Ski and SnoN also inhibited TGF-β induction of the Smad7 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). TG-interacting factor (TGIF), another Smad corepressor (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), can also inhibit the basal level of the Smad7 reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner, but this effect is independent of the SBE (Fig. 2B). Conversely, as we reported previously (35Long J. Matsuura I. He D. Wang G. Shuai K. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9791-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), overexpression of PIASy, which can inhibit Smad3 transcriptional activity (35Long J. Matsuura I. He D. Wang G. Shuai K. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9791-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 36Imoto S. Sugiyama K. Sato N. Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34253-34258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), had little effect on the basal or TGF-β induced level of the Smad7 promoter (35Long J. Matsuura I. He D. Wang G. Shuai K. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9791-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of the Smad7 promoter is a specific feature of the Ski and SnoN proteins. Ski as well as SnoN potentially could be involved in maintaining the Smad7 promoter in a repressed state in the absence of TGF-β signaling. Endogenous Ski Together with Smad4 Is Associated with the Smad7 Promoter in the Basal State—To determine whether endogenous Ski binds to the Smad7 promoter in the natural setting, we performed ChIP assays using HepG2 cells. Since the Ski family members do not possess DNA binding activities on their own but instead are presumably recruited to TGF-β-responsive promoters via interaction with Smad proteins, we also included antibodies against Smad4 or Smad2/3 in our ChIP experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, Ski and Smad4, but not Smad2/3, are bound to the Smad7 promoter at the basal state in the ChIP assay in a SBE-dependent manner. This is consistent with previous notions that among the Smads, only Ski constitutively interacts with Smad4 in the basal state (13Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Upon TGF-β treatment, Smad3, and presumably to a significantly lesser extent, Smad2, also bound to the Smad7 promoter (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, Ski is still associated with the Smad7 promoter in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 3A). This may reflect Ski association with DNA in a complex with Smad4 alone, in a complex with both Smad3 and Smad4, or in a mixture of both complexes. It is possible that Smad3-Smad4, Smad3-Ski, Smad4-Ski, and Smad3-Smad4-Ski complexes may coexist in TGF-β-treated cells and that the Smad3-Smad4 complex leads to the activation of target genes, including the Smad7 gene. Future studies will be required to resolve these complex issues. To determine whether Ski is recruited by Smad4 to the Smad7 promoter, we performed the ChIP assay using SW480.7 cells, which do not express Smad4 protein. As shown in Fig. 3C, left, Ski had no detectable binding to the Smad7 promoter in the absence of Smad4. When retroviral Smad4 was introduced into the SW480.7 cells, Ski binding was then detected. Furthermore, this led to reduced mRNA level of Smad7 (Fig. 3C, right). It is noteworthy that when Smad4 is overexpressed at high levels through transient LipofectAMINE-mediated transfection of large amounts of Smad4 plasmid, Smad4 can lead to the binding of not only Ski but also Smad3 to the Smad7 promoter in the absence of TGF-β signaling; the net effect is an increase of the Smad7 mRNA level (data not shown). To provide further evidence that Ski is recruited by Smad4 to the Smad7 promoter, we asked whether the inhibitory effect of Ski is dependent on the presence of Smad4. As shown in Fig. 3D, overexpression of Ski does not inhibit the Smad7 reporter gene in SW480.7 cells unless Smad4 is cotransfected. Taken together, these experiments suggest that Ski, recruited to the endogenous Smad7 promoter by interaction with Smad4, represses Smad7 expression in the basal state. Although overexpression of SnoN also inhibits Smad7 (Fig. 2A), we could not detect SnoN binding to the Smad7 promoter in the ChIP assay by using a few different SnoN antibodies (Fig. 3E and data not shown). It is possible that Ski and SnoN have overlapping as well as distinct promoter specificities in natural settings. It appears that Ski is better suited than SnoN to bind the Smad7 promoter, based on the results of ChIP and RNAi assays described in the following section. Depletion of Ski by RNAi Relieves Repression of the Transfected Smad7 Reporter As Well As the Endogenous Smad7 Gene—To determine whether the endogenous Ski and/or SnoN indeed repress the Smad7 promoter, we analyzed whether knockdown of endogenous Ski or SnoN by RNAi relieves the repression of the Smad7 promoter. Using a U6 RNA polymerase III-based RNAi vector (pSHAG-1 (32Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar)), we created two Ski RNAi plasmids and two SnoN RNAi plasmids, each targeting different parts of the mRNA molecule for Ski or SnoN, respectively. The Smad7 reporter gene and a Ski RNAi plasmid or a SnoN RNAi plasmid were cotransfected into HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, co-transfection with a Ski RNAi plasmid, either Ski RNA #1 or Ski RNA #2, led to significant activation of the Smad7 reporter gene. In comparison, cotransfection with a SnoN RNAi plasmid, either SnoN RNAi #1 or SnoN RNAi #2, had little or no effect on the Smad7 reporter gene activity. These two SnoN RNAi plasmids are capable of, at least partially, relieving repression caused by ectopically overexpressed SnoN (data not shown). From these experiments, we conclude that the endogenous Ski protein indeed represses the Smad7 reporter gene. To demonstrate that endogenous Ski represses the Smad7 promoter in the natural setting, HeLa cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting Ski mRNA for degradation. poly(A)+ RNA were then prepared and analyzed for Smad7 and Ski mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4B, the Smad7 mRNA level is significantly increased in cells transfected by Ski siRNA compared with cells transfected by control siRNA. Accordingly, the Ski mRNA level is greatly reduced in cells transfected by the Ski siRNA in comparison with control cells. Examination of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase level confirmed equal loading. Thus, recruited by binding to Smad4, Ski indeed represses the endogenous Smad7 promoter at the basal state. Since knockdown of Ski alone is sufficient to cause a marked increase in Smad7 mRNA level (Fig. 4B), this suggests that in our experimental system, the endogenous SnoN could not compensate for the inhibitory role of Ski on the Smad7 promoter. Our observations provide the first evidence that Ski is indeed a corepressor of Smad4 that inhibits a natural TGF-β-responsive gene in the basal state. Our study has also revealed that a normal physiological function of Ski is to repress Smad7 expression, and it is the first report of negative regulation of the Smad7 promoter. What is the physiological significance of Ski repression of the Smad7 gene? Since Smad7 binds and inhibits TGF-β receptor phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, the low level of Smad7 maintained by the repressive action of Ski may greatly facilitate, at least in the initial stage, propagation of the TGF-β signal. Smad7 expression needs to be tightly regulated. Aberrant expression of Smad7 is involved in the pathology of several diseases. For example, Smad7 is overexpressed in inflammatory bowel disease mucosa and purified mucosal T cells. Both whole tissue and isolated cells exhibited defective TGF-β signaling (37Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N.M. McKenzie C. Steer H.W. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of Smad7 in transgenic mice results in severe pathological alterations in multiple epithelial tissues (38He W. Li A.G. Wang D. Han S. Zheng B. Goumans M.J. ten Dijke P. Wang X.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2580-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Conversely, deficient Smad7 expression is causally linked to scleroderma (39Dong C. Zhu S. Wang T. Yoon W. Li Z. Alvarez R.J. ten Dijke P. White B. Wigley F.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3908-3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Decreased Smad7 expression also contributes to cardiac fibrosis in the infarcted rat heart (40Wang B. Hao J. Jones S.C. Yee M.S. Roth J.C. Dixon I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1685-H1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, the appropriate Smad7 level is critical for balanced TGF-β activity, and deregulated Smad7 activity can lead to the development of disease. We thank S. Ishii, X. Liu, K. Luo, and K.

https://openalex.org/W1988127877,"Recently two β-defensins, named spheniscins, have been isolated from the stomach content of the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), which is capable of preserving food for several weeks during egg incubation (Thouzeau, C., Le Maho, Y., Froget, G., Sabatier, L., Le Bohec, C., Hoffmann, J. A., and Bulet, P. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 51053–51058). It has been proposed that, in combination with other antimicrobial peptides, spheniscins may be involved in this long term preservation of food in the bird's stomach. To draw some structure/function features, the three-dimensional structure in aqueous solution of the most abundant spheniscin (Sphe-2) was determined by two-dimensional NMR and molecular modeling techniques. The overall fold of Sphe-2 includes a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet stabilized by three disulfide bridges with a pairing typical of β-defensins. In addition, the N-terminal segment shows helical features on most structures. Sphe-2 is highly cationic, and its surface displays a hydrophobic patch. Comparative modeling revealed that this patch is preserved in avian defensins. The activity of Sphe-2 against a pathogenic Gram-positive strain was retained in vitro in the conditions of osmolarity found in penguin stomach content and also in different salt concentrations and compositions up to those reported for seawater. Comparison with structurally related mammalian β-defensins showed that the hydrophobic patch is not preserved in mammalian β-defensins and that the high cationicity of Sphe-2 is presumably the critical factor for its retained activity in high salt concentrations. Such peculiarities, in addition to a broad activity spectrum, suggest that penguin defensins may represent interesting probes for the design of highly efficient antibiotics to fight off pathogens that develop in relatively salt-rich body fluids.

During the final stage of egg incubation in king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), the male can preserve undigested food in the stomach for several weeks (1Gauthier-Clerc M. Le Maho Y. Clerquin Y.

This ensures survival of the newly hatched chick in the event that the return of the foraging female from the sea is delayed.

The two forms of spheniscins differ by a single residue, His14, in Sphe-1 versus Arg14 in Sphe-2. A data bank search revealed that spheniscins are members of the well known defensin family. Defensins are small (3–5 kDa) cationic antimicrobial peptides that are part of the innate immunity of vertebrates (4Ganz T. Nat. Rev.

The unusual θ-defensin, which is a circular peptide, was initially isolated from rhesus macaque (8Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Recently a pseudogene coding for a homologue, named retrocyclin, was found in the human genome (9Cole A.M. Hong T. Boo L.M. Nguyen T. Zhao C. Bristol G. Zack J.A. Waring A.J. Yang O.O. Lehrer R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The α- and β-defensins are the most widespread in nature, and they are subclassified according to precursor and gene structures and to the position and connectivity of the six cysteine residues of their sequence. In α-defensins, the disulfide pairing is Cys1-Cys6, Cys2-Cys4, and Cys3-Cys5, whereas it is Cys1-Cys5, Cys2-Cys4, and Cys3-Cys6 in β-defensins. In spheniscins, the disulfide pattern is identical to that of β-defensins (3Thouzeau C. Le Maho Y. Froget G. Sabatier L. Le Bohec C. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51053-51058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). β-Defensins are more widely distributed than α-defensins as only β-defensins have been isolated from birds. In addition to the two spheniscins isolated from the king penguin, bird β-defensins have been found in polymorphonucleated granulocytes and in epithelia of chickens and turkeys. Four β-defensins named gallinacins and chicken heterophil peptides (Gal-1/CHP1, Gal-1α/CHP2, Gal-2, and Gal-3) have been reported in Gallus gallus (10Harwig S.S. Swiderek K.M. Kokryakov V.N. Tan L.

Sphe-1 and -2 have been isolated from the stomach contents of king penguins that efficiently conserve food for several weeks (3Thouzeau C. Le Maho Y. Froget G. Sabatier L. Le Bohec C. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51053-51058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The activity of a synthetic version of Sphe-2 is preferentially directed against Gram-positive bacteria including pathogenic strains and is of bactericidal type. Interestingly, when an activity was recorded against Gram-negative strains, the effect of Sphe-2 is mainly of bacteriostatic type. This contrasts with the activity generally observed for β-defensins as most of them are effective against Gram-negative bacteria and yeast cells. In fact, the activity of spheniscin is closer to that of α-defensins that are microbicidal against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeast fungi, and several enveloped viruses (4Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). This biological property of the spheniscins compared with other vertebrate β-defensins in addition to (i) the low percentage of similarity with mammalian β-defensins, (ii) their high efficacy on human pathogenic fungi, and (iii) their location within the rather unfavorable environment of the penguin stomach prompted us to investigate the three-dimensional structure of Sphe-2. The structure of six β-defensins has been solved by NMR or x-ray crystallography (13Schibli D.J. Hunter H.N. Aseyev V. Starner T.D. Wiencek J.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Tack B.F. Vogel H.J. J. Biol.

In this study, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the king penguin β-defensin, Sphe-2, in aqueous solution by two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling and compared this structure to those of the closest β-defensins from mammals. The global fold of Sphe-2, as of most β-defensins, includes a well defined three-stranded β-sheet and a short N-terminal domain with an α-helical propensity. However, differences were observed in the distribution of the charged and hydrophobic residues. While HBD-2 and BNBD-12 are amphipathic, HBD-3 is mainly hydrophilic. Sphe-2, although very cationic, is slightly less hydrophilic than HBD-3, and its surface displays a small hydrophobic patch that was not described in HBD-3 but apparently preserved in avian β-defensins according to comparative modeling studies. These results provide evidence that penguin β-defensin has some structural peculiarities that may explain the differences in the antimicrobial spectrum and activities between the bird and the mammalian β-defensins. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Synthetic Sphe-2 was obtained from Altergen Laboratory (Schiltigheim, France). The integrity, purity, and correct refolding were confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS fingerprinting of a tryptic digest of 2 μg of peptide following the experimental procedure reported previously (3Thouzeau C. Le Maho Y. Froget G. Sabatier L. Le Bohec C. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51053-51058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly purified Sphe-2 (native and synthetic) was treated with trypsin (Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w), and the digest was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. NMR Experiments—The NMR sample was prepared by dissolving 5.5 mg of synthetic Sphe-2 in 600 μlofH2O/D2O (90:10) to obtain a final concentration of 2 mm. All 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer equipped with a z-axis field-gradient unit and operating at a proton frequency of 600 MHz. The pH was adjusted to 4.3, and the double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (20Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar), clean TOCSY (21Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1193) Google Scholar), and NOESY (22Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4828) Google Scholar) experiments were performed at 293K. Clean TOCSY was acquired using a mixing time of 80 ms; NOESY spectra were performed with mixing times of 120, 160, and 300 ms. All spectra were referenced to the residual H2O signal set as the carrier frequency, 4.821 ppm at 293 K, and were processed with NMRPipe/NMRDraw softwares (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar). The identification of amino acid spin systems and the sequential assignment were performed using the standard strategy described by Wüthrich (24Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986: 130-161Google Scholar). To identify the exchange rate of backbone amide protons, the sample was lyophilized and quickly dissolved in D2O. The exchange kinetic experiments were then monitored from one-dimensional spectra at different time intervals and from short TOCSY spectra. Structure Calculations—Distance constraints were determined by volume integration of correlations observed in the NOESY spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 160 ms using the NMRView software (25Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). Since the disulfide pairing is known (3Thouzeau C. Le Maho Y. Froget G. Sabatier L. Le Bohec C. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51053-51058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), covalent bonds were built between the sulfur atoms of the paired cysteine residues, Cys5-Cys33, Cys12-Cys27, and Cys17-Cys34. Structure calculations were carried out with ARIA 1.1 (26Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) implemented in the software CNS 1.1 (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. De Lano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). ARIA is a powerful approach using an iterative process to perform the assignment of ambiguous NOEs from structures calculated using a combination of NOEs assigned at the previous step and a set of ambiguous distance restraints treated as the sum of contributions from all possible assignments. Each ARIA run included nine iterations. In the last step, the 20 best structures were refined by molecular dynamics in explicit solvent to remove artifacts due to the simplification of the force field used in the previous steps. A table of chemical shifts and a first set of distance restraints deduced from easily assigned NOEs were introduced as input to ARIA, and the calculations were initiated. The “ambicutoff” p (26Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) for accepting or rejecting possible assignments was modified compared with the default values. In the standard ARIA protocol, p varies from 0.999 to 0.8 during the whole process. The variation was reduced from 0.999 to 0.9 to prevent the elimination of weak contributions to ambiguous cross-peaks that are essential for the formation of the secondary structure elements. At the end of each run, the new assignments proposed by ARIA were checked manually and introduced (or not) in the following run. Rejected restraints and residual violations were also analyzed, and assignments were corrected if required. This iterative process was repeated until complete assignment of the NOESY map was achieved. A last run of 100 structures was then performed with the final list of NOE-derived distance restraints in which no restraint can be rejected. The 10 structures with the lowest energy were considered as characteristic of the peptide structure. The structures were displayed and analyzed using the MOLMOL (28Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar) and SYBYL (SYBYL®6.5, TRIPOS Inc., St. Louis, MO) programs, and their quality was evaluated using the PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar) and PROMOTIF (30Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) softwares. The formation of hydrogen bonds was established according to distance criteria. Lipophilic and electrostatic potentials were calculated and represented using the MOLCAD option of SYBYL. Salt Effect on the Antibacterial Activity of Sphe-2—The effect of sodium and magnesium chloride on the antibacterial activity of Sphe-2 was assessed using a liquid growth inhibition assay (31Hetru C. Bulet P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 78: 35-49PubMed Google Scholar). Growth inhibition was estimated by measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against selected strains, the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the pathogenic Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Briefly logarithmic phase bacterial cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.001 (approximately 105 colony-forming units/ml) in a broth supplemented or not with various concentration of salts. Diluted bacteria (90 μl) were mixed with 10 μl of either distilled water (control) or different concentrations of Sphe-2 ranging from 0.75 up to 100 μm. Bacterial growth was measured after an overnight incubation at 30 °C by measuring the change in the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm with a microplate reader. The MIC value corresponds to the interval of concentration [a]–[b] where [a] is the highest concentration tested at which the bacteria are growing and [b] is the lowest concentration that causes 100% inhibitory growth (32Casteels P. Tempst P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To assay the salt effect on the bacterial growth, the poor broth medium (1% bactotryptone, 85 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was supplemented with NaCl and MgCl2 separately or in combination. The following final salt concentrations were assayed: (i) 160 and 480 mm in NaCl, (ii) 1 and 50 mm in MgCl2, and (iii) 160 mm NaCl plus 1 mm MgCl2. Osmolarity of the different media and of the stomach content was determined using an automatic milliosmometer (type 13/13DR, Roebling, Berlin, Germany). NMR Data—After identification of the spin systems on the correlation spectroscopy and TOCSY spectra, sequence-specific assignments were obtained from the sequential connectivities observed on the amide-α, amide-amide cross-peak region of the NOESY spectrum. The fingerprint region of the TOCSY and NOESY spectra are shown in Fig. 1 (see the complete maps in the supporting information). All protons were assigned except for the amide proton of Phe2, which was not observed in our experimental conditions; the arginine ηNH2; the serine OH; and the N-terminal NH +3 groups, which are in very fast exchange with water. In addition, the ξ protons of Phe residues could not be assigned unambiguously due to overlapping with the other aromatic protons (see the chemical shift table in the supporting information). Low field shifted Hα chemical shifts and a characteristic set of interstrand Hα(i)-Hα(j), NH(i)-NH(j), and Hα(i)-NH(j) connectivities delineate a triple-stranded β-sheet. The presence of medium range NOEs in the rest of the sequence suggests that it consists mainly of loops and turns. Strong sequential Hα/Hδ NOE cross-peaks for Xaa-Pro peptide bonds indicate a trans configuration for Pro20 and Pro23. Twenty-one NH signals, exchanged before the acquisition of the first one-dimensional spectra (t = 5 min), are described as “very fast exchanging protons.” Four additional amide proton signals disappeared within the first 18 h. The residual amide protons, not exchanged after 18 h, are all located in the β-sheet (Phe11, Ala13, Ile22, Ile24, Cys27, Gln32, Cys33, Cys34, and Arg35) except for the NH of Gly10 and Val31 (Fig. 1) (see the short TOCSY spectra recorded in D2O to monitor the exchange data in the supporting information). Structure Calculations—The NOE data set used in the final ARIA run included 594 distance restraints (Table I) involving 335.2 intraresidue, 139.7 sequential, 32 medium range (2 ≤ |i–j| ≤ 4), and 87.1 long range (|i–j| ≥ 5) restraints with an average of 16 restraints/residue. Among these restraints, 551 are non-ambiguous. Ten structures, in very good agreement with all the experimental data and the standard covalent geometry, were selected for further analysis. For these structures, no experimental distance constraint violation greater than 0.3 Å was observed and the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values, with respect to the standard geometry, are low. The Ramachandran plot exhibits 95% of the ϕ, ψ angles of the 10 converged structures in the most favored and additional allowed regions according to the PROCHECK software nomenclature. The selected structures display small potential energy values. In particular negative van der Waals and electrostatic energy values are indicative of favorable non-bonded interactions.Table IStructural statistics for the 10 final models of Sphe-2NOE restraintsTotal594Intraresidue (|i - j| = 0)335.2Sequential (|i - j| = 1)139.7Medium range (2 ≤|i - j| ≤ 4)32.0Long range (|i - j| ≥ 5)87.1Ambiguous restraints43r.m.s.d. on backbone Cα atoms (pairwise, Å)Global (residues 2-37)1.93 ± 0.45Triple-stranded β-sheet (residues 11-13, 21-27, and 31-36)0.54 ± 0.10β1 (residues 11-13)0.10 ± 0.07β2 (residues 21-27)0.45 ± 0.12β3 (residues 31-36)0.36 ± 0.12N terminus (residues 2-10)2.40 ± 0.73L1 (residues 14-20)1.55 ± 0.62Ramachandran plotaDetermined by PROCHECK.

Open table in a new tab Structure Description—The overall fold of Sphe-2 is typical of β-defensins including a twisted three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with a (+2X, –1) topology as defined by Richardson (33Richardson J.S. Anfinsen C.B. Edsall J.T. Richard F.M. Advances in Protein Chemistry. 34. Academic Press, New York1981: 167-339Google Scholar). Strand β1 (Phe11–Ala13) is hydrogen-bonded to strand β3 (Val31–Arg36), which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to strand β2 (Ser21–Cys27) (Fig. 2). Residues Ile24 and Gly25 are both hydrogen-bonded to Cys33 (Fig. 1) leading to a β-bulge in β2. The amide protons of all residues involved in hydrogen bonds exhibited a slow exchange rate in D2O (Fig. 1), and the two other residues with a slow NH exchange rate, Gly10 and Val31, are embedded in the structure and particularly inaccessible to the solvent. Strands β1 and β2 are separated by a long loop, L1, including a type IV β-turn between residues Arg18 and Ser21 and a type I β-turn involving residues Ser28 to Val31. Due to a low number of NOEs in this region, the N-terminal segment (Ser1–Gly10) is less “well” defined (Fig. 2). In fact, a small helical turn is formed on a majority of structures, but depending on the structure it was considered by PROMOTIF as an α-helix or as a succession of turns. In addition, a PROCHECK analysis showed that most residues in the segment from Phe2 to Arg8 lie in the helical region of the Ramachandran plot. As evidenced by the r.m.s.d. calculations (Table I) and by a superposition of the backbone of the selected structures (Fig. 2), the β-sheet region of Sphe-2 is well defined with a pairwise r.m.s.d. on the Cα atoms of 0.54 Å. The pairwise r.m.s.d. calculated for all Cα backbone atoms is large (1.93 Å) due to the N-terminal segment (2.40 Å) and to the L1 loop (1.55 Å). The tertiary structure of Sphe-2 is very compact. The hydrogen bonds between the three strands of the β-sheet and the three disulfide bridges contribute to the compactness of this molecule. Most residues are exposed to the solvent and exhibit a large variability in the position of their side chains. The only residues showing a low circular variance of their χ1, χ2 angles are hydrophobic ones, Phe11, Phe19, Ile22, Ile24, Phe30, and Val31. Several of these residues contribute to the formation of a hydrophobic pole at the surface of the molecule: Phe19, Pro20, Ile22, Val37, and Trp38 (Fig. 3A). The other hydrophobic residues are scattered all over the rest of the molecule and are separated by hydrophilic residues. With 10 arginine residues over 38 amino acids and no anionic residue, Sphe-2 is a highly cationic molecule. The charges are spread all over the surface of the molecule, and the electrostatic potential calculated with SYBYL using Kollman charges (34Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Calwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. DeBold S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-4Crossref Scopus (2647) Google Scholar) varied between –15 and +380 kcal·mol–1 so that the surface of the molecule is almost entirely positively charged except for the C terminus (Fig. 3A). Salt Sensitivity of Sphe-2—In control poor broth medium (85 mm NaCl, 216 mosm), Sphe-2 is active at a concentration below 6 μm against the two microorganisms selected for this study, S. aureus (Gram-positive) and E. coli (Gram-negative) (Table II). An increase in the NaCl content to a concentration of 160 mm, representing an intermediate concentration between the values observed in seawater fishes and mammals (35Eckert R. Randall D. Augustine G. Animal Physiology. Mechanisms and Adaptations. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1988: 389Google Scholar), did not affect Sphe-2 activity. The osmolarity measured for this culture medium (348 mosm) was close to the value measured in the stomach content of three different penguins (324 ± 23 mosm) and to the osmolarity of the plasma of sea water fishes (337 mosm) (35Eckert R. Randall D. Augustine G. Animal Physiology. Mechanisms and Adaptations. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1988: 389Google Scholar). When the concentration in sodium chloride was increased up to 480 mm, the efficacy of Sphe-2 against S. aureus decreased by a factor of 16 (MIC, 50–100 μm). In the control experiment with poor broth supplemented at 480 mm NaCl, E. coli did not grow properly.Table IIEffect of sodium and magnesium chloride on Sphe-2 activityFinal salt concentration in poor brothOsmolarityMICS. aureusE. colimosmμm85 mm NaClaControl poor broth.2163-61.5-3.0160 mm NaCl3483-61.5-3.0480 mm NaCl96150-100—bThe bacterial strain did not grow properly in the control experiment.85 mm NaCl + 1 mm MgCl22203-63-685 mm NaCl + 50 mm MgCl234425-506-12cAbnormal bacterial growth, characterized by the presence of a bacterial pellet, was present.160 mm NaCl + 1 mm MgCl23526-123-6a Control poor broth.b The bacterial strain did not grow properly in the control experiment.c Abnormal bacterial growth, characterized by the presen"

An average structure was calculated, representing the overall fold from a set of 20 minimized structures. The core residues (18–41) overlay with a root mean square deviation of 2.29 ± 0.62 Å. The N- and C-terminal segments exhibit higher root mean square deviations, reflecting more flexibility in solution and/or fewer long-range NOEs for these regions.

The variety of functions of vitronectin in the two microenvironments is a manifestation of its ability to interact with numerous humoral and cellular proteins. An important binding partner for vitronectin is the serine protease inhibitor PAI-1, which also is found both in circulation and the ECM. Furthermore, it has different activities depending upon this localization; the anti-protease activity of PAI-1 that regulates thrombolysis in the circulation is targeted instead toward pericellular proteolysis when localized to the ECM or cell/matrix boundary. Vitronectin binds to PAI-1 with high affinity and stabilizes the inhibitor in its active conformation (8Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol.

Key to the adhesive functions of vitronectin are its interactions with cell-surface receptors including integrins and uPAR.A widely accepted model suggests that vitronectin is organized into functional domains that provide the broad repertoire necessary for binding to target ligands (12Tschopp J.

Baburaj K. Peterson C.B. Xu Y. Proteins. 2001; 44: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A threading algorithm gave high confidence predictions for the central domain of ∼200 amino acids and the C-terminal domain of ∼100 amino acids. Both domains exhibit features of a β-propeller fold. The computational approach was less successful for the third domain, corresponding to the N-terminal span of ∼50 amino acids that has been denoted the “somatomedin B” domain of vitronectin (14Suzuki S. Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Nguyen K. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15307-15314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An experimental determination of the fold of this domain is thus needed and is relevant to over 100 homologues in the sequence data base. Within this short N-terminal region from vitronectin lie binding sites for three critical ligands: PAI-1, integrins, and uPAR. The SMB domain contains eight cysteine residues that form four disulfide bonds, and recombinant forms of SMB have been used to identify amino acid residues that participate in binding these ligands (16Seiffert D.

The structure of a co-crystal of PAI-1 and a recombinant SMB was recently reported, further elucidating the features of the binding interface between vitronectin and PAI-1 (20Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).We have purified the SMB domain from human plasma vitronectin using cyanogen bromide cleavage to release the first 51 amino acids from the bulk of the protein. In this work, two-dimensional NMR methods have been used to determine the solution structure of this domain. A single homogeneous species is observed with a unique disulfide-bonding pattern. Our results complement the x-ray crystallography on the complex and confirm the presence within the SMB domain of a sole α-helix containing known PAI-1-binding residues. However, the remainder of the chain displays an entirely different fold and different pattern of disulfides. Furthermore, the NMR structure defines the position of the integrin-binding tripeptide (RGD) site, which was unstructured in the co-crystal with PAI-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The C-18 reverse phase HPLC column was obtained from Vydac, Hesperia, CA. HPLC grade acetonitrile was from Fisher. Cyanogen bromide and trifluoroacetic acid were from Pierce. D2O was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). All other chemicals were of the highest purity available.Cyanogen Bromide Digestion of Vitronectin—Human plasma vitronectin was isolated as described in Zhuang et al. (21Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14323-14332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purified vitronectin in an ammonium sulfate suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20–30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid and dialyzed against 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 4 °C. The solvent was removed by lyophilization, and cyanogen bromide in 70% trifluoroacetic acid containing 200 mm iodoacetamide was added to the lyophilized vitronectin. The reaction mixture was flushed with N2 and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 22 h. After 22 h the reaction mixture was diluted with twice the volume of water and lyophilized. The lyophilized product was resuspended in 1% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged. The supernatant was separated on a 1 × 25-cm reverse phase C-18 HPLC column by gradient elution with 17–32% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to isolate the desired N-terminal fragment representing the SMB domain. Fractions were analyzed for purity by re-injecting an aliquot on the reverse phase C-18 column, and the desired fractions were combined and stored at –20 °C. The size (m/z 5762.3) of the fragment was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and its monomeric state was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium analysis using an Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge from Beckman. The typical yield of vitronectin was 7–8 mg/liter of human plasma. The yield of SMB domain was ∼5%. Four preparations of vitronectin, each from 2 liters of plasma, were combined to accumulate the required amount of SMB domain for the NMR experiments.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR studies were performed with ∼90 μm SMB in a 500-μl sample volume. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in D2O or H2O containing 10% D2O at the appropriate pH. The sample pH was adjusted with either 100 mm trifluoroacetic acid or 100 mm NaOH. All NMR experiments were performed on a 600 MHz Varian Inova instrument equipped with a single gradient axis and a triple resonance probe for the observation of proton, carbon, and nitrogen nuclei. To assign overlapping resonances in two-dimensional NMR spectra, experiments were recorded at 288, 298, and 308 K and pH values ranging from 1.4 to 7.3. Best resolution was obtained at pH 4.4, and all the assignments were reported with respect to the spectra obtained at pH 4.4 and 298 K. Two-dimensional NMR data were acquired in phase-sensitive mode using the States-Haberkorn (22States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Res. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) method for quadrature detection in the indirect dimension. Spectra of SMB in H2O were recorded by using WET (23Ogg R.J. Kingsley P.B. Taylor J.S. J. Magn. Res.

Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4816) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with mixing times of 150, 200, and 250 ms. TOCSY spectra (27Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Res. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar) were recorded using DIPSI spin-lock sequence with a 8 kHz radio frequency field and mixing times of 15, 30, 60, and 80 ms. Typically, spectra were acquired with 256 t1 increments, 2048 data points, a relaxation delay of 1 s, and a spectral width of 8500 Hz. For DQF-COSY spectra (28Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar), 512 t1 increments were acquired. Spectra were recorded with 64–96 scans per increment for NOESY, 24–80 scans per increment for TOCSY, and 56 scans per increment for DQF-COSY. In all NOESY and TOCSY spectra, the data were multiplied by a 60–90° phase shifted sin2 window function in both dimensions before Fourier transformation.Data Analysis and Structure Determination—NMR data were processed with Felix 2000 and SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, The University of California, San Diego) software operating on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 work station or on a Silicon Graphics Origin 300 server. Cross-peak intensities observed in NOE experiments were divided into four categories as strong, medium, weak, and very weak. These intensities were converted into distance restraints as follows: strong, 1.8–2.7 Å; medium, 1.8–3.4 Å; weak, 1.8–4.5 Å, and very weak, 1.8–6.0 Å. An additional 1.0 Å was added to upper limits involving methyl protons. Similarly, an additional 0.5 Å for methylene protons and 2.3 Å for degenerate Hδ and Hϵ protons of tyrosines and phenylalanines were added to the upper limits. Also, 0.2 Å was added to the upper limits of NOEs involving amide protons. Coupling constants were extracted from the DQF-COSY spectra. Backbone Φ angles were restrained to –120 ± 50° for 3JHNHα = 8–9 Hz, and –120 ± 40° for 3JHNHα > 9 Hz. A restraint of –100 ± 80° was also applied to the Φ angle for residues that show stronger NHi-Hαi-1 NOE than the intraresidue NH-Hα NOE (29Clubb R.T. Ferguson S.B. Walsh C.T. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2761-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A total of 329 NOE restraints and 18 Φ restraints were used in structure determination.All calculations were carried out using the AMBER force field interfaced with DISCOVER (Accelerys, San Diego, CA) on an Origin 300 work station. Random structures were generated by subjecting the peptide to an initial 10,000-step minimization at 298 K. The temperature was then raised gradually to 1000 K during a 1000-step dynamics simulation. The peptide was subjected to minimization and a 10-ps dynamics run at 1000 K. The NMR-derived restraints were then imposed on the peptide and the peptide was slowly annealed to 298 K in a 100-ps trajectory. Finally, the structures were subjected to further minimization at 298 K. The force constant for the distance restraints was 100 kcal/mol Å–2 and the dielectric constant was 4. Using this simulated annealing protocol, an ensemble of 20 starting structures was obtained. These structures were then used to make further resonance assignments and increase the number of unambiguous NOE restraints. In the final step of the refinement, 60 structures were obtained and analyzed by MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wütrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK NMR (31Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thorntorn J.M. J. Biomol.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSResonance Assignments—The material used in this study was the SMB domain isolated from plasma vitronectin, so 1H NMR was used exclusively because the sample could not be isotopically labeled. Sequential resonance assignments were made by the analysis of fingerprint regions of TOCSY and NOESY spectra using standard procedures (32Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986: 130-161Google Scholar, 33Redfield C. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1993: 71-79Google Scholar). Excellent dispersion was observed in the spectra. Examples that demonstrate the quality of the data and the dispersion observed in a one-dimensional spectrum and TOCSY and NOESY spectra are given in Supplemental Materials Figs. 1–3. There were numerous overlaps, presumably because of the compact and globular nature of the polypeptide, causing some residues to be in similar magnetic environments. DQF-COSY was used to determine 13 unambiguous NH-Hα coupling constants. Cross-peaks representing smaller coupling constants were absent from the DQF-COSY spectrum because of limitations in concentration of the biological material. All the determined coupling constants were >8 Hz. There were no patterns of cross-peaks to indicate the presence of regular secondary structure elements in SMB. Rapid exchange of virtually all amide protons also supported this observation. Thus, the backbone assignment strategy relied heavily on the sequential NOESY-TOCSY cross-peak analyses of the NH-Hα regions of the spectra.Side chain assignments were made on the basis of the scalar connectivities obtained through a series of TOCSY spectra using different mixing times at different pH values and temperatures. Aromatic parts of tyrosine and phenylalanine residues were assigned on the basis of NOE cross-peaks. No stereospecific assignments were made for methylene protons. Because of ring opening of homoserine lactone at higher pH values, a few residues near the C terminus showed two sets of resonances with slight differences in chemical shifts that did not hinder the resonance assignments. A sequential connectivity for the last three residues was not observed, thus these residues were tentatively assigned. Residues 9 and 10 were also tentatively assigned because of resonance overlap. Overall, backbone, and side chain assignments of 46 residues were completed, sufficient for structural calculations to be performed on this polypeptide. The single proline residue (Pro41) of SMB was identified to be in a trans conformation based on the observation of NOEs between lysine 40 NH/Hα and proline 41 Hδ. The complete resonance assignment of SMB is given in Supplemental Materials Table I.Assignment of Disulfides—Attempts to identify the disulfide bridges from NOE cross-peaks observed between CHαi and CHβj and/or between CHβi and CHβj of cysteines using published methods (34Williamson P.M. Havel T.F. Wütrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; : 295-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 35Adler M. Lazarus R.A. Dennis M.S. Wagner G. Science. 1991; 253: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) were not successful. Spectral overlap between intra- and inter-residue NOE cross-peaks involving cysteines, combined with the spatial proximity of the six cysteines in the core region of SMB, precluded unequivocal identification of the disulfide bridges solely by NMR. Similar problems have been encountered with other cysteine-rich proteins (36Heitz A. Chiche L. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Klaus W. Broger C. Gerber P. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).In early stages of simulated annealing calculations, “floating” cysteines were used without any disulfide assignments. These early structures consistently showed that cysteines 5 and 9 were near each other, and four cysteines (Cys19, Cys21, Cys31, and Cys32) formed a cluster in the core of SMB. Either cysteine 25 or cysteine 39 was also near this cluster in most structures. In a concurrent study from this laboratory, two of the disulfide bonds of SMB were determined by biochemical methods and mass spectrometry. 2Horn, N. A., Hurst, G. B., Mayasundari, A., Whittemore, N. A., Serpersu, E. H., and Peterson, C. B. (2004) J. Biol. Chem., in press. This work revealed one disulfide bridge as 5–9 and another as 25–39. These findings were in agreement with the initial calculations, so the two experimentally determined disulfides were imposed to refine the structure of the SMB domain, and two possible alternatives were then pursued separately in the structure determination. These alternatives were: SMB with Cys19–Cys31 and Cys21–Cys32 disulfides or SMB with Cys19–Cys32 and Cys21–Cys31 disulfides. A third alternative pairing among the four cysteines is not feasible and was not considered because it would involve a disulfide bridge between adjacent cysteines 31 and 32. The disulfide bridge restraints were set for the two alternatives (38Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), and both were subjected to simulated annealing separately. Calculations with the second alternative involving disulfides 19–32 and 21–31 did not yield acceptable converged structures. Thus, the structure of SMB containing disulfides 5–9, 19–31, 21–32, and 25–39 was determined and is described in this work.Structure Refinement—The three-dimensional structure of SMB was determined by simulated annealing calculations using a total of 347 NMR-determined restraints (Table I). A large fraction of intra- and intermolecular NOEs were observed in the region spanning residues 18–41 of SMB. It should be noted that NOEs involving any tentatively assigned residues (Supplemental Materials Table I) were not included in structure calculations. As described above, the best structures from initial calculations were selected and used as starting structures with imposed disulfide restraints (Cys5–Cys9 and Cys25–Cys39) for the final stages of the structure calculation. The 20 lowest energy structures were chosen from among an ensemble of 60 minimized structures. The Ramachandran plot showed that >90% of Φ and ψ angles were within the most favored and allowed regions, and less than 7% of the Φ and ψ angles from all 20 structures were within the disallowed region. Cluster analysis resulted in a r.m.s. deviation value for the backbone atoms of the 20 structures of 2.29 ± 0.62 Å when the region limited to residues 18–41 was considered (Fig. 1a). The low r.m.s. deviation for this portion of the structure resulted because the majority of the observed NOEs were from the residues in this region, which also contains three of the four disulfide bridges that stabilize the compact structural core of the domain.Fig. 1b shows the entire chain trace for all 20 resulting structures superimposed in this region spanning residues 18–41. These data indicate that, in solution, the core region of SMB yields converged structures, whereas the structures at both the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecule are less well defined. The greater flexibility of the C-terminal region (residues 42–51) compared with the core is apparent from the NMR data, which showed sharper resonances and chemical shifts similar to random coil values for these residues (Fig. 2). Another interesting feature of the structure is the lower refinement of the N-terminal section, which contains the fourth disulfide bridge between cysteines 5 and 9. Despite all efforts, no unambiguous NOEs could be identified between this section and the core region to define its relative orientation. This is perhaps not surprising because global bends can be difficult to detect by NMR, as long-range NOEs do not exist. Also, the higher r.m.s. deviation for this region of the SMB domain may result from inherent limits in sensitivity that arise from the low concentration of this sample isolated from human plasma, precluding observation of weaker NOEs. Also, there are relatively few unambiguous intra-domain NOEs. On the other hand, the less refined structure may indicate that this region is more flexible than the core region in solution. The lack of interaction of the 4Hβ protons of cysteines 5 and 9, combined with the ambiguity of the resonance assignments of cysteine 9, is consistent with these observations and suggests that the corresponding disulfide bridge is either somewhat flexible or located in a more mobile part of the molecule.Fig. 2Differences in chemical shifts for α-protons in SMB relative to standard values for free amino acids. Up-field shifts are shown below the line, and downfield shifts above the line. The two clusters of up-field shifts correspond to the two secondary structural elements, the α-helix from 26 to 30 and the 310 helix from 36 to 38.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Solution Structure of the Somatomedin B Domain of Vitronectin—The average structure, shown in Fig. 1c, yields an r.m.s. deviation value of 2.29 Å for the core backbone atoms of the ensemble. As shown in this figure, the core region of SMB is held by three disulfide bridges, which form the disulfide knot. The only regular secondary structure is a single-turn α-helix spanning residues 26–30. Observation of successive dNN(i,i+1) NOEs (see Supplemental Materials Fig. 4), a single dNN(i,i+3) NOE, and up-field shifted Hα resonances of residues 26–30 (Fig. 2) also support the presence of a short α-helix in this region. A second region that has a loosely defined 310 helix spans residues 36–38. The remainder of the molecule is comprised of loops, some of which appear to be flexible in solution. Rapidly exchanging amide protons and the lack of strong dβN(i,i+1) NOEs are consistent with the absence of β-sheet in the rest of the molecule. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies of the SMB domain showed that virtually all of the backbone amide and other exchangeable protons of the molecule were exchanged within a few minutes of exposure to D2O, indicating that the majority of the residues of SMB are exposed to solvent and signifying the absence of a hydrogen-bonded network of protons in the molecule. This observation is in accord with the determined solution structure of SMB, in which the N- and C-terminal segments are flexible with a small, solvent-accessible core that is stabilized by three disulfide b"
https://openalex.org/W2010050464,"The cellular target responsible for the nuclear export of Daxx has been identified as chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), which is a carrier protein for nuclear export and a receptor for the nuclear export signal (NES) of Daxx. Binding of Daxx to CRM1 was increased early during glucose deprivation and then gradually decreased. This interaction was inhibited by leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Substitution of the serine 667 amino acid residue of Daxx with alanine reduced the interaction with CRM1 during glucose deprivation, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Ser-667 is required for its binding to CRM1 and for its subsequent nuclear export. Data from coupled transcription-translation studies reveal that the NES (amino acids 565–575) of Daxx is a binding site for CRM1. Interestingly, constitutive export of Daxx has occurred by replacement of the tryptophan 621 Daxx residue with alanine. These results suggest that this tryptophan residue plays a key role in masking the NES of Daxx from its receptor, CRM1, in the resting state, whereas phosphorylation of serine 667 would release the NES, which could then be recognized by the CRM1.

Interestingly, constitutive export of Daxx has occurred by replacement of the tryptophan 621 Daxx residue with alanine. These results suggest that this tryptophan residue plays a key role in masking the NES of Daxx from its receptor, CRM1, in the resting state, whereas phosphorylation of serine 667 would release the NES, which could then be recognized by the CRM1. Daxx is a nuclear protein that normally interacts with promyelocytic leukemia protein and localizes to promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic domains (1Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J.

Under certain circumstances, Daxx associates with cytoplasmic and cell surface molecules, including transforming growth factor-β and Fas (3Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F.

Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Recently we reported that phosphorylation of Daxx occurs during glucose deprivation, and its phosphorylation is mediated through the ASK1-SEK1-JNK1-HIPK1 signal transduction pathway (6Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Daxx is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, binds to ASK1, and subsequently leads to ASK1 oligomerization (6Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at serine 667 of Daxx is required for relocalization of Daxx during glucose deprivation (6Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although Daxx translocation is associated with the phosphorylation of its specific serine residue, it still remains obscure how the export of Daxx is regulated during glucose deprivation. Several researchers reported that chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1) (also known as exportin 1) is an evolutionarily conserved nuclear export factor (7Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M.

In fact, Daxx contains a putative consensus sequence with a typical leucine-rich (in bold) NES for a functional Rev/Rex NES (amino acids 565–575 LFELEIEALPL) (12Yang J. Bardes E.S. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the present study, we hypothesized that CRM1 binds to phosphorylated Daxx and leads to translocation of Daxx. To test this possibility, we investigated the role of phosphorylation at Ser-667 of Daxx in the interaction between Daxx and CRM1 during glucose deprivation. We provide evidence that phosphorylation at Ser-667 of Daxx promotes the association of Daxx with CRM1 and its translocation. In addition, constitutive relocation of Daxx and its association with CRM1 were observed when Trp-621 was replaced with Ala. Taken together, we propose a model for the mechanism of the dual regulation of Daxx-CRM1 interaction by Ser-667 and Trp-621. Trp-621 plays a key role of preventing the interaction between Daxx and CRM1, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-667 promotes the interaction between them. Cell Culture—Human prostate adenocarcinoma DU-145 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 26 mm sodium bicarbonate for monolayer cell culture. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and air at 37 °C. Reagents and Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies were purchased from the following companies: anti-HA (clone 3F10) from Roche Diagnostics, anti-FLAG from Sigma, and anti-CRM1 from BD Biosciences. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to make point mutations in Daxx protein. One tryptophan residue in Daxx (Trp-621) was replaced with alanine (W621A). A sense primer oligonucleotide (5′-CTCTCCTCACAACGCGGGAGATTCTGGTCC-3′) and antisense primer oligonucleotide (5′-GGACCAGAATCTCCCGCGTTGTGAGGAGAG-3′) were used for site-directed mutagenesis. The PCR reaction mixture was prepared by adding 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 20 ng of double-stranded DNA template (pAdlox-FlagDaxx), 125 ng of each sense primer, 125 ng of each antisense primer, 1 μl of dNTP mix, double-distilled water to a final volume of 50 μl, and 1 μl of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (2.5 units/μl). PCR was performed for 16 cycles (95 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 1 min; 68 °C for 14 min) with the initial incubation at 95 °C for 30 s. Following temperature cycling, the reaction was placed on ice for 2 min to cool the reaction. After PCR, 1 μl of DpnI restriction enzyme (10 units/μl) was added directly to each amplification reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to digest the parental supercoiled double-stranded DNA. The DpnI-treated double-stranded DNA was transformed into Epicurian Coli® XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Colonies were selected, and each plasmid (pAdlox-FlagDaxx) was digested with HindIII/KpnI. Its fragment containing the mutation site was subcloned into pBluescript SK(-). Each pBluescript SK(-)-Daxx fragment was sequenced using T7 primer to confirm mutation. pFlagDaxx S667A and S670A were constructed as described previously (6Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Labeling and Gel Electrophoresis—To investigate the phosphorylation of Daxx during glucose deprivation, DU-145 cells were transfected with pFlagCMV2-Daxx, pFlagCMV2-Daxx-S667A, or pFlagCMV2-Daxx-S670A. Transfections were done by using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were pre-equilibrated in phosphate-free medium for 3 h prior to the addition of 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in phosphate- and glucose-free medium for 1 h and then lysed in a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-agarose. The beads were washed three times with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein inhibitor mixture solution. The immune complex was separated by SDS-PAGE, and dried gel was visualized by autoradiography. Shuttle Vector Construction—pFlag/CMV2-Daxx was kindly provided by Dr. Horikoshi (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). pAdlox/Flag-Daxx was made by inserting the SpeI/BamHI fragment from pFlag/CMV2-Daxx into the SpeI/BamHI-cut pAdlox shuttle vector (13Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various Daxx deletion mutants, which were FLAG-tagged at their N terminus and had restriction enzyme recognition sites at the flanking sides (5′-EcoRI, 3′-BamHI), were produced by PCR. For Daxx1–625 (amino acids 1–625), the sense primer was 5′-GAGCGAATTCAGCCACCGCTAACAGCATCATC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-CTGCGGATCCCTAACCAGAATCTCCCCAGTTGTG-3′. For Daxx1–500 (amino acids 1–500), the sense primer was the same as that of Daxx1–625, and the antisense primer was 5′-CTATGGATCCCTACTGTAGTGAGGACATGGGGCTC-3′. For Daxx626–739 (amino acids 626–739), the sense primer was 5′-GGTTGAATTCACCCCCCTGCAAAAATCTCGG-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-CTATGGATCCCTAATCAGAGTCTGAGAGCAC-3′. pcDNA3-HA-ASK1 was kindly provided by Dr. Ichijo (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). pAdlox-HA-ASK1 was made by inserting the SpeI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-HA-ASK1 into XbaI-cut pAdlox. Adenoviral Vector Construction—All of the recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by employing the Cre-lox recombination system (13Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selective cell line CRE8 has a β-actin-based expression cassette driving a Cre recombinase gene with an N-terminal nuclear localization signal stably integrated into 293 cells. Transfections were done by using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen). 5 × 105 cells were split into a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection. For the production of recombinant adenovirus, 2 μg of SfiI/ApaI-digested Adlox/HA-ASK1 fragment or SfiI-digested Adlox/Flag-Daxx and 2 μg of Ψ5 viral genomic DNA were cotransfected into CRE8 cells. The recombinant adenoviruses were generated by intermolecular homologous recombination between the shuttle vector and Ψ5 viral DNA. The new virus has an intact packaging site and carries a recombinant gene. Plaques were harvested, analyzed, and purified. The insertion of HA-ASK1 or FLAG-Daxx to the adenovirus was confirmed by Western blot analysis after infection of the corresponding recombinant adenovirus into DU145 cells. In Vivo Binding of Daxx with CRM1 or ASK1—To examine the interaction between Daxx and CRM1, adenovirus of FLAG-tagged Daxx (Ad.Flag-Daxx) at an m.o.i. of 10 was infected into DU-145 cells in 100-mm culture plates. To examine the interaction between ASK1 and Daxx, adenovirus of HA-tagged ASK1 (Ad.HA-ASK1) and FLAG-tagged Daxx (Ad.Flag-Daxx) at an m.o.i. of 10 were co-infected into DU-145 cells in 100-mm culture plates. For immunoprecipitation, after 48 h of infection, the cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm NaOVO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 80 μm aprotinin, and 2 mm leupeptin, and the lysates were incubated with 3 μg of anti-FLAG M2 mouse IgG1 (Sigma) or 0.5 μg of rat anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) for 2 h, respectively. After the addition of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), the lysates were incubated for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with mouse anti-CRM1 antibody, mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science) antibodies, or mouse anti-FLAG. Proteins in the membranes were then visualized using the ECL reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS under reducing conditions, and the proteins in the gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated with 7% (w/v) skim milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, v/v) and then reacted with primary antibodies. After washing three times with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG. Proteins in the membranes were then visualized using the enhanced ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Immunofluorescence—Cellular localization of FLAG-Daxx was investigated using fluorescence microscopy. The cells were plated onto Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and infected with Ad.Flag-Daxx at an m.o.i. of 10. After 48 h of infection, the cells were fixed in 100% cold methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. After washing twice with cold PBS, the cells were blocked in 1% BSA plus 10% rabbit serum for 1 h at room temperature. They were then incubated with anti-FLAG (clone M2; mouse) antibody containing 1% BSA plus 10% rabbit serum for 1 h at room temperature followed by three washes with cold PBS. Samples of FLAG-Daxx were incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. After washing three times with cold PBS, the slides were mounted in 90% glycerol. Coupled Transcription-Translation—For coupled transcription-translation, pXHC1 containing the human CRM1 cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Minoru Yoshida (RIKEN, Hirosawa, Japan), was digested with XhoI and NotI and then subcloned into XhoI/NotI-cut pTnT™ vector. Coupled transcription-translation was performed with the TnT system in reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) supplemented with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences catalog no. AG1094). Also, we obtained putative NES or mutated NES affinity columns by coupling 4 mg of biotinylated BSA (Pierce) to 1 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Sulfo-SMCC, Pierce). After removal of excess Sulfo-SMCC using a desalting column, the putative NES peptide (LFELEIEALPL) or mutated NES peptide (AFEAEIEAAPA) was incubated with the maleimide-activated biotinylated BSA at 4 °C for 4 h. Biotinylated BSA coupled to the peptides was bound to 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce). After being washed in PBS, the beads were incubated in 30 μl of PBS containing BSA (100 μg/ml), 5 μl of the TnT reaction, and peptides (2 mg/ml) for the competition experiments for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the beads were treated with Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min in boiling water, and then the samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Daxx Binds to CRM1, and Leptomycin B Inhibits Its Binding to CRM1—Several researchers reported that CRM1, a member of the β-karyopherin family, mediates nuclear export of several proteins, including human immunodeficiency virus type-1 regulator of expression of virion genes, transcription factor IIIA, protein kinase A inhibitor, and yeast AP-1-like transcription factor (Yap1p) (14Fisher U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 15Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 16Fridell R.A. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. Meyer B.E. Meinkoth J.L. Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S.

These proteins contain a NES that consists of several leucine residues with uneven spacing. We hypothesized that transport of Daxx across the nuclear envelope is mediated through CRM1 and that CRM1 binds to a NES in Daxx and promotes Daxx translocation from the nucleus. During the first step in this study of the export of Daxx, we investigated whether CRM1 is the binding protein of Daxx during glucose deprivation. Fig. 1A shows that Daxx rapidly bound to CRM1 within 10 min during glucose deprivation. However, the interaction between Daxx and CRM1 gradually decreased as a function of time. We next investigated whether the inhibition of CRM1 prevents the relocalization of Daxx. Previous studies show that a Streptomyces-derived antibiotic, leptomycin B, can specifically block CRM1-mediated nuclear export by binding to CRM1 (11Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 18Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with leptomycin B inhibited the interaction between Daxx and CRM1 as well as relocalization of Daxx during glucose deprivation (Fig. 1, B and C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that glucose deprivation-induced Daxx translocation is mediated through the Daxx-CRM1 interaction. As described previously, ASK1 binds Daxx in the cytosol after a glucose deprivation-induced translocation of Daxx out of the nucleus (6Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Leptomycin B blocks translocation of Daxx out of the nucleus (as expected if CRM1 is involved in export) in the absence of glucose and consequently the Daxx-ASK1 interaction. Previous studies have already shown that CRM1, as well as two other proteins, CAS (cellular apoptosis susceptibility) and exportin(tRNA), are involved in exporting proteins from the nucleus. Each nuclear exporter binds to its respective substrates. For example, Yap1p is a target of CRM1 (17Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). CAS is known to be responsible for importin-α re-export (19Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Gorlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Exportin(tRNA) exports tRNA (20Arts G.J. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 305-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Recognition of these proteins by the nuclear export receptors occurs in the presence of RanGTP, and in each case a cooperative complex is formed between them (17Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 19Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Gorlich D.

Biol. 1998; 8: 305-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Interestingly, oxidative stress inhibits the interaction of CRM1 with Yap1p and subsequently prevents nuclear export of Yap1p. This inhibition requires at least one of the three cysteine residues flanking the NES. These results suggest that a single cysteine residue within the cysteine-rich domain is sufficient to confer redox-sensitive binding to CRM1 (17Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, unlike Yap1p, Daxx is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during oxidative stress (6Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that a stress-regulated signal for nuclear export is not the same in all cases. The Serine 667 Site of Daxx Is Responsible for Its Binding to CRM1—We reported previously that mutation of Daxx Ser-667 to Ala (S667A) results in suppression of Daxx relocalization during glucose deprivation (6Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We postulate that Ser-667 is phosphorylated during glucose deprivation, and its phosphorylation promotes the interaction between Daxx and CRM1. Fig. 2A shows that glucose deprivation increased the phosphorylation of wild-type Daxx and S670A mutant-type Daxx but not Ser-667A mutant-type Daxx. These results indicate that Ser-667 is phosphorylated during glucose deprivation. Fig. 2B shows that, unlike wild-type Daxx and S670A mutant-type Daxx, S667A mutant-type Daxx was not increasingly bound to CRM1 during glucose deprivation. Fig. 2C shows that glucose deprivation increased association between wild-type Daxx and ASK1, which is mainly located in the cytoplasm. In contrast to wild-type Daxx, S667A mutant-type Daxx did not bind to ASK1 during glucose deprivation. These results suggest that phosphorylation on Ser-667 of Daxx is a prerequisite for interaction with CRM1, Daxx translocation, and subsequent binding to ASK1. Daxx565–575 Is the Binding Motif to CRM1—Next, we attempted to determine which domain of Daxx is responsible for the interaction with CRM1. Cells were infected with adenoviral vectors containing wild-type Daxx or its various Daxx-deletion mutants (amino acids 1–625, 1–500, 626–739). In this study, a Daxx deletion mutant (amino acids 501–625) could not be used, because it is exclusively localized to the cytoplasm (6Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47245-47252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that wild-type Daxx and one Daxx deletion mutant (amino acids 1–625), but not other types of mutants (amino acids 1–500 and amino acids 626–739), interacted with CRM1 during glucose deprivation, suggesting that the Daxx binding site for CRM1 exists between amino acids 501–625. As mentioned previously, Daxx contains a putative NES (amino acids 565–575). We postulated that the putative NES of Daxx interacts with CRM1. To test this possibility, we conjugated biotinylated BSA to Daxx NES (LFELEIEALPL) or mutated NES (AFEAEIEAAPA) peptides and coupled it to streptavidin-agarose. CRM1 translated in vitro bound to a NES affinity column. However, little binding of CRM1 was observed when leucine residues of NES were replaced with alanines (Fig. 3B). CRM1-NES interaction was prevented by the addition of an excess of NES peptide but was not affected by the mutated NES (Fig. 3B, lane 2 versus lane 3). These results demonstrate that the NES of Daxx is a binding site for CRM1. Tryptophan Residue at 621 of Daxx Acts as an Inhibitory Residue Masking the NES—A fundamental question, which remains unanswered, is why phosphorylation on Ser-667 of Daxx is required for interaction between Daxx and CRM1. Molecular modeling was used to investigate the role of phosphorylated Ser-667 in the interaction of Daxx with CRM1. On the basis of a primary structure alignment and a putative three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal region and the NES domain, we speculated that Daxx contains an autoinhibitory A-helix motif at the C-terminal region (Fig. 4). A tryptophan residue at position 621 may interact by van der Waals contacts with the hydrophobic region in the C terminus and consequently prevent interaction between the NES of Daxx and CRM1. Phosphorylation of Ser-667 results in a negative phosphate charge and subsequently disrupts the interaction between the tryptophan side chain of the A-helix and the hydrophobic region of the C terminus. This disruption allows CRM1 to bind to the NES of Daxx. To test our hypothesis, we replaced the tryptophan at position 621 of Daxx with alanine (W621A). Fig. 5A shows that wild-type Daxx was relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during glucose deprivation (top panels). However, mutant-type Daxx (W621A) was not confined within the nucleus regardless of glucose deprivation (Fig. 5A, bottom panels). CRM1 and ASK1 increasingly bound to mutant-type Daxx (W621A) regardless of glucose deprivation (Fig. 5, B and C). These results and molecular modeling of Daxx (Fig. 6) illustrate that the Trp-621 could fit into the hydrophobic pocket of the C terminus resulting in prevention of the interaction between CRM1 and Daxx. Phosphorylaton at serine 667 probably unmasks the NES of Daxx to CRM1 by destabilizing the inhibitory motif. Similar observations were reported in cyclin B1, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase 2, p27Kip1, and snail gene product (12Yang J. Bardes E.S. Moore J.D. Brennan J.

Franci C. Garcia de Herreros A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5078-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of each of these is required for binding to CRM1 and nuclear export. For example, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase 2 at Thr-317 may destabilize the A-helix itself and/or its binding to the hydrophobic cleft and consequently release the autoinhibitory motif. This process contributes to activation of the enzyme and, in parallel, might unmask the NES (24Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M.

As a result, the activated kinase is exported rapidly from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.Fig. 5Role of tryptophan 621 residue of Daxx in masking the NES from CRM1. A, DU-145 cells were transfected with either pFlag-Daxx (wild-type) or pFlag-W621A Daxx (mutant type). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for 1 h. The subcellular localization of Daxx was determined by immunofluorescent staining with anti-FLAG antibody. B, DU-145 cells were transfected with pFlag-Daxx (wt, wild type) or pFlag-Daxx (W621A, mutant type). After 48 h of incubation, the cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for 10 min. The lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted (WB, Western blot) with anti-CRM1 or anti-FLAG antibody (upper panels). The presence of CRM1 in the lysates was verified by immunoblotting with anti-CRM1 antibody (lower panel).

The phosphorylated Daxx is translocated to the cytoplasm (as discussed in the preceding paragraphs), binds to ASK1, and subsequently leads to ASK1 oligomerization. We hypothesized that association of Daxx with ASK1 maintains JNK activity. To examine this possibility, DU-145 cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for 1 h and then incubated with complete medium for various times (0–120 min). Fig. 7 shows that glucose deprivation-induced association of Daxx with ASK1 as well as JNK activity gradually reduced during incubation with complete medium. These results suggest that Daxx is involved in the ASK1-JNK1 activity. At this time, only speculation can be made concerning the biological function of relocalized Daxx during glucose deprivation. Several researchers have shown that Daxx acts as a transcriptional regulator in the nucleus (25Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G.

Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that cytoplasmic Daxx binds to ASK1 and is subsequently involved in the oligomerization of ASK1. Although we are far from understanding the role of Daxx in the cytoplasm, we speculate that ASK1 oligomerization maintains ASK1 activity by preventing ASK1 degradation. We believe that this model will provide a framework for future studies."

However, the roles of PI3K and Akt in embryonic development still remain to be elucidated. We hypothesize that PI3K signaling plays an important role in embryonic development because PI3K is commonly activated by growth factors, some of which display dorsalizing activity to induce a secondary axis in Xenopus embryos. Here we used Xenopus as a model system to investigate the roles of PI3K and Akt in embryonic development. To determine whether PI3K is sufficient to induce a dorsal phenotype, an active form of PI3K was expressed in Xenopus embryos, and its effect on development was studied; to determine whether PI3K activity is required, a dominant negative form of PI3K was expressed to specifically inhibit endogenous PI3K activity in the embryos. To further understand the downstream signaling molecules involved in PI3K-mediated embryo development, we analyzed the effects of Akt and identified Akt as an essential target through the forced activation or inhibition of its activity in the embryos. We also used a similar approach to identify GSK-3β as a potential target of Akt to mediate the PI3K-initiated developmental cue in Xenopus embryos.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEmbryo Manipulation—Adult pigmented Xenopus laevis specimens were obtained from Xenopus I, Inc. (Dexter, MI). Xenopus laevis embryos were obtained by artificial insemination after females were injected with 500 units of human chorionic gonadotropin. The embryos were chemically dejellied using 2% cysteine and then washed and transferred to Petri dishes containing 0.3× MMR solution (0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and 3% Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences). The embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber's table (23Nieuwkoop P.O. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). 2nd Ed.

The cDNA constructs encoding an active form of the PI3K catalytic subunit, p110α*, and a dominant negative form of the PI3K regulatory subunit, p85ΔiSH2, were inserted into pSG5 vector and linearized by SalI for in vitro synthesis of capped sense mRNA using the T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Myr-Akt, an active form of Akt, was inserted into pBluescript II KS±, and linearized by NotI for in vitro synthesis of capped sense mRNA using the T7 transcription kit. DN-Akt constructed in PBS-Sfi vector was linearized by SalI for in vitro synthesis of capped sense mRNA using the T3 transcription kit (Ambion). Cellular GSK-3β and a dominant negative mutant of GSK-3β, DN-GSK-3β, were subcloned into pSP64TEN vector and linearized by XbaI for in vitro synthesis of capped sense mRNA using the Sp6 transcription kit (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The synthetic RNAs were quantitated by ethidium bromide staining with reference to standard RNA (24Xu R.H. Kim J. Taira M. Lin J.J. Zhang C.H. Sredni D. Evans T. Kung H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Embryo Injection and Explant Culture—Embryos at the two-cell stage were injected in the animal poles with various mRNAs. The embryos were cultured up to 45 stages after injection. Animal caps were dissected from the injected embryos at stages 8.5–9 and cultured at 22 °C in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) with 7 mm Tris-HCI (pH7.5) and gentamicin (50 μg/ml) to various stages before being harvested for RT-PCR for further analysis.RT-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted from cultured animal cap explants with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR amplification was performed using a Superscript preamplification system (Invitrogen). The primer sets and PCR condition for EF-1α, NCAM, BMP-4, Xvent-1, Xmsx1, Otx2, and Hoxb9 were as described previously (24Xu R.H. Kim J. Taira M. Lin J.J. Zhang C.H. Sredni D. Evans T. Kung H.F. Mol.

PCR products were analyzed by data from replicate experiments.RESULTSEctopic Expression of PI3K Induces Double Heads and Dorsal Axes—The PI3K pathway has been demonstrated to play a significant role in cell survival, proliferation, protein synthesis, myogenic differentiation, and angiogenesis. However, the role of PI3K in development still remains to be defined. To understand the role of PI3K signaling during early Xenopus development, we overexpressed an active form of the PI3K catalytic subunit, p110α* (27Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas C. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of p110α* increased PI3K activity in the embryos dose-dependently (Fig. 1A). The embryos expressing p110α* developed with double heads and dorsal axes (Fig. 1B). This result indicated that the activation of PI3K is sufficient to induce axis duplication and is a potent inducer for neurogenesis during Xenopus embryonic development. To test whether PI3K is required for embryo development, a truncated form of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85ΔiSH2, was expressed. p85ΔiSH2 is unable to bind to the catalytic subunit of PI3K but retained its ability to bind to the receptor tyrosine kinases, thereby specifically inhibiting endogenous PI3K activation by growth factors (12Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar, 21Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Aoli M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of p85ΔiSH2 during Xenopus embryonic development produced a losing posterior structure phenotype at the tadpole stage, which lacked apparent axial structures and had a short tail and well patterned ventral tissues (Fig. 1C). These data suggested that PI3K activation is required for dorsal axis development in Xenopus embryos. To investigate whether ectopic expression of the active form of PI3K, p110α*, may reverse the inhibitory effect of p85ΔiSH2 on the activation of PI3K by receptor tyrosine kinases, both p110α* and p85ΔiSH2 were co-expressed in the Xenopus embryos. The expression of p110α* bypassed the p85ΔiSH2 inhibitory effect and restored Xenopus phenotypes similar to those of the control (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggested that PI3K activity is essential for axis duplication in Xenopus development.PI3K Signaling Is Required for Neural Tissue Induction in Animal Caps—The blastula animal cap is composed of pluripotent cells that can be induced to form endodermal, mesodermal, or ectodermal cell types and is a useful tissue for assessing the roles of various inducing factors in development. To study further the role of PI3K activity in neurogenesis, Xenopus embryos at the two-cell stage were injected with mRNAs coding for β-gal as a control or p110α*. Animal caps were dissected at stages 8.5–9 and cultured in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium until the equivalent of stage 22. Expression of p110α* induced a neural like extension (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of p85ΔiSH2 inhibited p110α*-induced neural development, and the phenotype was similar to that of the control and the caps treated with p85ΔiSH2 alone. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that p110α* induced pan-neural marker NCAM expression, whereas p85ΔiSH2 inhibited the p110α*-induced NCAM expression. Expression of the mesoderm tissue marker Xbra was negative, which implied no mesoderm tissue induction (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that activation of PI3K is sufficient to mediate neural development in Xenopus embryos. To study the role of PI3K activity in neural development mediated by other upstream inducers, we tested whether the inhibition of endogenous PI3K activity by LY294002 or p85ΔiSH2 affected neural development in animal caps induced by retinoic acid. Retinoic acid is a derivative of vitamin A and a potent teratogen. In vertebrates, retinoic acid is involved in the development of the central nervous system and is a neural inducing factor (25Suzuki A. Ueno N. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xenopus embryos at the two-cell stage were injected with mRNAs coding for β-gal control or p85ΔiSH2. Animal caps were dissected at stages 8.5–9 and cultured in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium with retinoic acid in the absence or presence of LY294002 until the equivalent of stage 22. Animal caps induced by retinoic acid and injected with β-gal developed a neural like phenotype. Their appearance was slightly swollen and elongated, with one side white and the other side black. In contrast, animal caps injected with p85ΔiSH2 or treated with LY294002 developed an epidermal like phenotype. They had a round shape and were evenly brownish in color (Fig. 2C). LY294002 and p85ΔiSH2 inhibited retinoic acid-induced NCAM expression. Mesoderm induction was also excluded as a negative Xbra expression (Fig. 2D). These data further suggest that PI3K is required for neural development of the Xenopus embryo.Fig. 2PI3K activity mediates neural tissue induction.A, embryos at the two-cell stage were injected with mRNA coding for β-gal (control), p110α*, p110α* plus p85ΔiSH2, or p85ΔiSH2 as indicated. The animal caps were dissected at stages 8.5–9 and then cultured in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium until the equivalent of stage 22 for photography. The ectopic expression of p110α* induced neural tissue, which was inhibited by the co-expression of p85ΔiSH2. B, animal caps were harvested at the equivalent of stage 22 for RT-PCR and analysis of the expression of the pan-neural marker NCAM and the mesoderm marker Xbra. EF-1α expression was used as an internal control. C, retinoic acid (RA)-induced neural tissue development was inhibited by LY294002 and p85ΔiSH2. The embryos at the two-cell stage were injected with β-gal (control) or p85ΔiSH2 into the animal pole area. The animal caps were dissected at stages 8.5–9 and incubated in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium with retinoic acid (10-5m) in the absence or presence of 50 μm LY294002 until the equivalent of stage 22 for photography. D, animal caps were also harvested at the equivalent of stage 22 for analysis of the expression of NCAM and Xbra by RT-PCR. No RT, absence of reverse transcriptase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Akt Is a Sufficient Downstream Target of PI3K for Axis Duplication—The serine-threonine kinase Akt is a well known target of PI3K, which mediates PI3K-induced multiple functions in response to growth factors in vitro. To test whether Akt activity is regulated by PI3K in the embryos, relative Akt activity in response to the activation of PI3K activity was determined in these cells. The expression of p110α* induced the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473, which determines Akt activation in the cells (Fig. 3A). To test whether Akt is sufficient to mediate the process, an active form of Akt, Myr-Akt, was expressed in the embryos by microinjection of its mRNA. When compared with the β-gal control, ectopic expression of Myr-Akt also induced axis duplication (Fig. 3B). This phenotype was similar to that observed in the embryos by the expression of PI3K, indicating that Akt is a target of PI3K for the process. To further determine whether Akt activity is required, endogenous Akt activity was inhibited by the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Akt, DN-Akt. The expression of DN-Akt inhibited axis formation, resulting in a phenotype with a shorter tail and smaller head than those of the β-gal control (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that Akt is required for axis induction during embryo development. To determine whether Akt activity is required for PI3K-induced axis duplication, DN-Akt was co-expressed with the active form of PI3K, p110α*. The co-expression of DN-Akt inhibited PI3K-induced axis duplication, resulting in a normal phenotype similar to that of the control (Fig. 3D). Similarly, the expression of DN-Akt also inhibited Myr-Akt-induced axis duplication in embryo development (Fig. 3E). These data further confirmed that Akt is an essential downstream target of PI3K for axis formation and neurogenesis during Xenopus embryonic development.Fig. 3Akt is an essential downstream target of PI3K in mediating axis duplication.A, the activation of Akt by p110α*. Protein extracts were prepared from the embryos as described in Fig. 1 and used for an immunoblot assay using specific antibodies against phospho-Akt at Ser-473 (19Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K.

The embryos at the two-cell stage were injected in the animal pole area with 1 ng of mRNA encoding Myr-Akt or β-gal (control). The embryos were cultured in 30% MMR solution until the equivalent of stage 45 after the injection. Embryos injected with Myr-Akt generated a dorsalizing phenotype with double heads and axes (35/50, 70%). C, the embryos injected with a dominant negative construct of Akt, DN-Akt, produced a ventralizing phenotype with a short tail and a small head (31/50, 62%). D, Akt is required for PI3K-induced axis induction. The embryos were injected with mRNAs for β-gal (control), p110α*, or p110α* and DN-Akt and cultured in 30% MMR solution until the equivalent of stage 45. The phenotypes were observed and photographed at stage 45. E, the embryos were injected with mRNAs for β-gal (control), Myr-Akt, or Myr-Akt and DN-Akt and cultured as above. Expression of DN-Akt inhibited p110α*- and Myr-Akt-induced axis duplication and restored to embryos phenotypes similar to those of the control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PI3K and Akt Induced Axis Formation through the Inhibition of GSK-3β during Xenopus Development—The activation of Akt is known to induce the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β in the cells. To determine whether GSK-3β is a functional downstream target of Akt for inducing dorsal axis formation, cellular GSK-3β was co-expressed with active forms of PI3K or Akt in the embryos. Co-injection of cellular GSK-3β reversed the effects by the expression of PI3K and Akt on axis induction and resulted in a normal phenotype similar to that of the control (Fig. 4). This result suggests that PI3K and Akt induced axis formation through the inhibition of GSK-3β.Fig. 4GSK-3β is a downstream negative regulator in PI3K- and Akt-induced axis duplication.A, embryos were injected with mRNA coding for β-gal (control), p110α*, or p110α* and GSK-3β and cultured in 30% MMR solution until the equivalent of stage 45 as above. B, embryos were injected with mRNA coding for β-gal (control), Myr-Akt, or Myr-Akt and GSK-3β and cultured in 30% MMR solution until stage 45. Axis duplication was observed by the expression of p110α* and Myr-Akt, and the co-expression of GSK-3β completely inhibited PI3K- and Akt-mediated axis induction, resulting in normal phenotypes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PI3K and Akt Signaling Is Required for the Expression of Neural and Ventral Markers during Embryo Development—To study the roles of PI3K and Akt signaling in neural development in Xenopus embryos, the expression of neural and ventral markers was analyzed by performing RT-PCR using RNA extracted from the initial neural stage of embryos. Xenopus embryos at the two-cell stage were injected with mRNAs encoding, respectively, β-gal, p110α*, p85ΔiSH2, Myr-Akt, DN-Akt, GSK-3β, or DN-GSK-3β. Animal caps were dissected at stages 8.5–9 and cultured until the equivalent of stage 13 for the analysis of neural and ventral markers. p110α*, Myr-Akt, and DN-GSK-3β induced the expression of the pan-neural marker NCAM (29Kintner C.R.

Development. 1990; 109: 225-234PubMed Google Scholar), whereas p85ΔiSH2, DN-Akt, and GSK-3β induced the expression of the ventral markers Xvent1, Xvent2, BMP-4, and Xmsx1 (Fig. 5A). EF-1α mRNA expression was used as an internal control to indicate that similar RNA amounts and reaction conditions were used. This result further confirmed that PI3K and Akt were involved in the neurogenesis of Xenopus embryonic development.Fig. 5Effects of PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β on the expression of neural and ventral markers.A, embryos at the two-cell stage were injected into the animal pole with mRNAs encoding β-gal, p110α*, p85ΔiSH2, Myr-Akt, DN-Akt, GSK-3β, or DN-GSK-3β respectively. Animal caps were dissected at stages 8.5–9 and cultured in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium until the equivalent of stage 13. Total RNA was isolated from the animal caps and assayed for the expression of NCAM, Otx2, HoxB9, Xvent1, Xvent2, BMP-4, Xmsx1, and EF-1α by RT-PCR. EF-1α mRNA expression was used as an internal control. Total RNAs from a whole embryo at the equivalent stage were used as a positive control (second lane from the right), and the reaction without the addition of reverse transcriptase (No RT) was used as a negative control (far right lane). B, embryos at the two-cell stage were injected into the animal pole with mRNAs encoding β-gal, p110α*, p110α* plus p85ΔiSH2, p110α* plus DN-Akt, p110α* plus GSK-3β, p85ΔiSH2 plus Myr-Akt, p85ΔiSH2 plus GSK-3β-DN, Myr-Akt, Myr-Akt plus DN-Akt, Myr-Akt plus GSK-3β, and DN-GSK-3β plus DN-Akt, respectively. Animal caps were dissected at stages 8.5–9 and cultured in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium until the equivalent of stage 13. Total RNA was isolated from the animal caps and analyzed for mRNA levels of NCAM, Otx2, HoxB9, Xvent1, Xvent2, BMP-4, Xmsx1, and EF-1α. Total RNAs from a whole embryo at the equivalent stage were used as a positive control (second lane from the right). Negative control reactions (far right lane) were performed with total RNAs obtained from the embryos in the absence of reverse transcriptase (No RT) to confirm the absence of contaminating genomic DNA. C, schematic presentation of PI3K/Akt signaling in axis induction and neurogenesis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further elucidate the signaling pathway leading to the expression of neural markers and neural development, we explored whether the inhibition of PI3K and Akt activity or the ectopic expression of GSK-3β could inhibit the induction of neural marker expression. The expression of the PI3K dominant negative mutant p85ΔiSH2 inhibited PI3K-induced, but not Akt- and DN-GSK-3β-induced, neural marker expression (Fig. 5B). This result is consistent with a position for PI3K upstream of Akt and GSK-3β for mediating neural marker expression and axis induction. The expression of Akt dominant negative mutant DN-Akt inhibited both PI3K- and Akt-induced neural marker expression but not DN-GSK-3β-induced neural marker expression. However, the expression of the ventral markers (i.e. Xvent1, Xvent2, BMP4, and Xmsx1) induced by p85ΔiSH2, DN-Akt, and GSK-3β were blocked by p110α*, Myr-Akt, and DN-GSK-3β, respectively. These data further confirmed that Akt mediated neural marker expression and axis formation through the inhibition of GSK-3β.In conclusion, this study has demonstrated a novel role of PI3K in mediating axis formation and neural development in Xenopus embryos. The activation of PI3K is transmitted through its downstream target, Akt, which inhibits the activation of GSK-3β for the process (Fig. 5C).DISCUSSIONPI3K and the Akt signaling pathway play an important role in many cellular functions, including survival, proliferation, protein synthesis, and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of an active form of PI3K was sufficient to induce axis duplication and neurogenesis through the increased expression of neural markers such as NCAM, Otx2, and HoxB9 and that the inhibition of PI3K activity by a PI3K inhibitor or a PI3K dominant negative mutant inhibited axis formation and neural development. PI3K was also found to transmit retinoic acid-induced mesoderm induction and a neural like phenotype (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with recent observations that PI3K, Ras, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase (MEK) have a synergistic effect in mesoderm induction by the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway (33Carballada R. Yasuo H. Lemaire P. Development. 2001; 128: 35-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study also showed that overexpression of an active form of Akt induced double heads and axes and the expression of neural markers such as NACM, Otx2, and Hoxb9 (Figs. 3 and 5). The inhibition of Akt activity by DN-Akt induced Xenopus to produce a ventral phenotype and expression of the ventral markers, including Xvent1, Xvent2, BMP-4, and Xmsx1. These data indicated that Akt is an essential downstream target of PI3K for mediating axis formation and neural development. Our results provide the first evidence that PI3K and Akt are involved in axis formation and neurogenesis in vertebrate embryonic development.

https://openalex.org/W2032522475,"SHPS-1 is a transmembrane protein whose cytoplasmic region undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and then binds the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Formation of the SHPS-1-SHP-2 complex is implicated in regulation of cell migration. In addition, SHPS-1 and its ligand CD47 constitute an intercellular recognition system that contributes to inhibition of cell migration by cell-cell contact. The ectodomain of SHPS-1 has now been shown to be shed from cells in a reaction likely mediated by a metalloproteinase. This process was promoted by activation of protein kinase C or of Ras, and the released ectodomain exhibited minimal CD47-binding activity. Metalloproteinases catalyzed the cleavage of a recombinant SHPS-1-Fc fusion protein in vitro, and the primary cleavage site was localized to the juxtamembrane region of SHPS-1. Forced expression of an SHPS-1 mutant resistant to ectodomain shedding impaired cell migration, cell spreading, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. It also increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK triggered by cell adhesion. These results suggest that shedding of the ectodomain of SHPS-1 plays an important role in regulation of cell migration and spreading by this protein.

Characterization of immortalized fibroblasts from mice that lack most of the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 revealed a marked impairment of cell migration associated with an increased formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (18Inagaki K.

These observations suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and the consequent association of SHPS-1 with SHP-2 promote cell migration through regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization.CD47, also named IAP, is implicated as a ligand for SHPS-1 (11Seiffert M.

Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), is also a member of the Ig superfamily, possessing an Ig-V-like extracellular domain, five putative membrane-spanning segments, and a short cytoplasmic tail (21Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). CD47 and SHPS-1 appear to constitute a cell-cell communication system (the CD47-SHPS-1 system) that plays an important role in a variety of cell functions. We have recently shown that the CD47-SHPS-1 system and SHP-2 contribute to the inhibition of cell migration by cell-cell contact (22Motegi S. Okazawa H. Ohnishi H. Sato R. Kaneko Y. Kobayashi H. Tomizawa K. Ito T. Honma N. Bühring H.J. Ishikawa O. Matozaki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2634-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation is markedly impaired in CD47 knockout mice (23Lindberg F.P. Bullard D.C. Caver T.E. Gresham H.D. Beaudet A.L. Brown E.J. Science. 1996; 274: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD47 inhibit neutrophil transmigration (24Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40156-40166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that the CD47-SHPS-1 system might mediate bidirectional inhibitory regulation of cell migration. The binding of CD47 on red blood cells to SHPS-1 on macrophages also inhibits phagocytosis of the red blood cells by the macrophages (25Oldenborg P.A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Thus, SHPS-1 appears to play multiple roles in cellular activities in a manner dependent on or independent of its interaction with CD47. It has not been known, however, whether SHPS-1 undergoes ectodomain shedding, a process that might potentially regulate its function.We now show that SHPS-1 indeed undergoes ectodomain shedding. Furthermore, we have characterized the molecular mechanism of this process as well as examined its physiological role in the regulation of cell migration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Antibodies and Reagents—A rat mAb (αp84) to mouse SHPS-1 was purified from culture supernatants of hybridoma cells kindly provided by C.

Briefly, confluent CHO-Ras cells stably expressing CD47 in 96-well plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of SHPS-1-Fc in the culture medium described above, after which the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat pAbs to the Fc fragment of human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were again washed with PBS, and Fc fusion protein binding was determined by measurement of peroxidase activity with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) as substrate. The absorbance of each well at 492 nm was monitored with a microplate reader. The binding of CD47-Fc to CHO-Ras cells stably expressing wild-type or a mutant SHPS-1 was also performed as described above.Identification of the SHPS-1 Peptide Bond Cleaved by Matrix Metalloproteinases—Incubation of SHPS-1-Fc with MMP-1 or MMP-9 was performed according to the method described by Franzke et al.

The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Stained bands corresponding to proteins of 35 and 30 kDa were excised, and their NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined with a gas-phase amino acid sequence analyzer (Procise 492; Applied Biosystems) as described previously (29Ohe Y.

The sense primer encodes the artificial amino acid sequence DIDYKDDDDK, the last eight residues of which correspond to the FLAG epitope tag. The amplification product thus encoded a mutant SHPS-1 protein (SHPS-1-FLAG-JM) with this 10-amino acid sequence instead of the juxtamembrane sequence SMQTFPGNNA368 (Fig. 5A); it was digested with EcoRV and then self-ligated, and its entire nucleotide sequence was verified by DNA sequence analysis with an ABI PRISM310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). CHO-Ras cells were then transfected with the plasmid containing the mutant SHPS-1 cDNA with the use of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured in αMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 10% FBS, and Zeocin (200 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), and colonies were isolated 14–21 days after transfection. CHO cells were also transfected with the plasmid containing the mutant SHPS-1 cDNA and selected as described above. The cells were cultured in F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and Zeocin (200 μg/ml). Colonies were isolated 14–21 days after transfection, and several cell lines expressing the mutant SHPS-1 protein were identified by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with the mAb αp84.Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed with a Transwell apparatus (Corning) as described previously (22Motegi S. Okazawa H. Ohnishi H. Sato R. Kaneko Y. Kobayashi H. Tomizawa K. Ito T. Honma N. Bühring H.J. Ishikawa O. Matozaki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2634-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO, CHO-Ras, and derived cell lines were detached from culture dishes and resuspended in αMEM containing 10% FBS. A portion of the cell suspension (1 × 105 cells in 100 μl) was then transferred to a polycarbonate filter (pore size, 8 μm; Corning) in the upper compartment of a Transwell apparatus, and 600 μl of fresh culture medium was placed in the lower compartment. The number of cells that had migrated into the lower compartment after incubation for 16 h at 37 °C was then counted in triplicate with a hemocytometer and was expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells added to the upper compartment.Immunofluorescence Analysis—CHO-Ras and derived cell lines were plated on cover glasses 12–24 h before analysis. They were fixed for 20 min either with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for vinculin staining or with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for actin and paxillin staining. The cells were then permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature in buffer G (PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100) before incubation for 1 h at room temperature with a mAb to vinculin (1/400 dilution), a mAb to paxillin (5 μg/ml), or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (2 units/ml) (Molecular Probes) diluted in buffer G. They were then washed three times with PBS. For staining of vinculin or paxillin, the cells were incubated for 30 min with Alexa488-conjugated sheep pAbs to mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) and then washed another three times with PBS. All cells were examined with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 5 Pascal, Carl Zeiss).Cell Spreading and Adhesion Assay—Detached cells were suspended in fresh culture medium and transferred at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml to 35-mm dishes coated with fibronectin (Asahi Technoglass). After incubation for 1 or 4 h, the cells were examined with a light microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics (Leica DM IRBE), and digital images of random fields were captured with a charge-coupled device camera (Penguin 600CL, Pixera).RESULTSEctodomain of SHPS-1 in Conditioned Medium of SHPS-1-expressing Cells—We first examined whether the ectodomain of SHPS-1 was shed from CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells, CHO cells that were transformed as a result of expression of an active form of H-Ras and that also express mouse SHPS-1. Given that SHPS-1 is extensively glycosylated and therefore binds to ConA (7Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), we incubated the conditioned medium obtained by overnight culture of these cells with ConA-coupled agarose beads and then examined bead-bound proteins by immunoblot analysis with a mAb (αp84) that specifically recognizes the extracellular region of mouse SHPS-1 (31Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An immunoreactive protein of ∼100 kDa was detected in the conditioned medium from CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells (Fig. 1A) but not in that from parental CHO-Ras cells (data not shown). The same protein was also observed in immunoprecipitates prepared with the αp84 mAb from the medium conditioned by CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, immunoblot analysis with rabbit pAbs that react with the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 failed to detect the ∼100-kDa protein in precipitates prepared from this conditioned medium with either ConA or the αp84 mAb (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis with these pAbs to SHPS-1 did detect an ∼20-kDa protein in lysates of CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells but not in those of parental CHO-Ras cells (Fig. 1B). This ∼20-kDa protein appeared to be localized predominantly in a membrane fraction, rather than a cytosolic fraction, of CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells (Fig. 1B). The molecular size of intact SHPS-1 in lysates of CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells was ∼120 kDa (Fig. 1A), whereas that of the transmembrane plus cytoplasmic regions of SHPS-1 was estimated to be ∼20 kDa on the basis of the predicted amino acid sequence of SHPS-1 (30Yamao T. Matozaki T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Takahashi N. Ochi F. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Together, these results thus suggested that the ∼100-kDa protein detected in the conditioned medium of CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells was the extracellular domain of SHPS-1, whereas the ∼20-kDa protein present in the membrane fraction of these cells was the transmembrane-cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 remaining after cleavage (see also Fig. 5B).Fig. 1Presence of the ectodomain of SHPS-1 in the conditioned medium of cultured cells.A, conditioned medium of CHO-Ras cells stably expressing SHPS-1 (CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells) was incubated with ConA-coupled agarose beads or with protein G-Sepharose beads containing bound mAb αp84 to SHPS-1. The proteins precipitated by each type of beads were subjected to immunoblot analysis with αp84 (left panel) or with pAbs to SHPS-1 (αSHPS-1) (right panel). Whole cell lysates were also similarly subjected to immunoblot analysis. The positions of full-length SHPS-1 and of the ectodomain of SHPS-1 (SHPS-1-EX) are indicated by lines and an arrow, respectively. B, cell lysates prepared from parental CHO-Ras cells or CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells (left panel) as well as membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared from CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells (right panel) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with pAbs to SHPS-1. The position of an immunoreactive protein of ∼20-kDa is indicated by arrows. C, conditioned medium of primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, or RAW264.7 mouse macrophages was incubated with ConA-coupled agarose beads, after which the bead-bound proteins (ConA ppt.), as well as total cell lysates, were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the αp84 mAb to SHPS-1. All data are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Endogenous SHPS-1 was detected in lysates prepared from primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, or RAW264.7 mouse macrophages (Fig. 1C). We also detected ∼80- to 100-kDa proteins that were reactive with the αp84 mAb (Fig. 1C), but not with the pAbs to SHPS-1 (data not shown), in the conditioned media obtained from these cells. The molecular sizes of the SHPS-1 fragments in these conditioned media were also ∼20 kDa smaller than that of the intact SHPS-1 protein in the corresponding cell lysates. These results indicated that the ectodomain of SHPS-1 is shed into the medium of cultured cells that express endogenous SHPS-1 as well as into that of CHO-Ras-SHPS-1-WT cells. We also observed that the ectodomain of human SHPS-1 was present in the culture medium of CHO-Ras cells expressing the intact human protein (data not shown).Regulation of Ectodomain Shedding of SHPS-1—We next examined whether the shedding of the ectodomain of SHPS-1 occurs in response to extracellular or intracellular stimulation. Minimal ectodomain shedding of SHPS-1 was apparent after incubation for 4 h in serum-free medium of CHO cells that stably express mouse SHPS-1 (CHO-SHPS-1-WT cells) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, incubation of the cells for 4 h in the presence of either 10% FBS or 1 μm LPA resulted in a marked increase in the amount of the SHPS-1 ectodomain in the medium (Fig. 2A). LPA induces activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (32Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and PKC activation in turn triggers ectodomain shedding of various membrane-associated proteins (33Pandiella A. Massague J.

https://openalex.org/W2034021449,"Tropomodulin (Tmod) is a cytoskeletal actin-capping protein that interacts with tropomyosin at the pointed end of actin filaments. E-Tmod is an isoform that expresses predominantly in cardiac cells and slow skeletal muscle fibers. We unexpectedly discovered significant levels of Tmod in nuclei and then defined peptide domains in Tmod responsible for nuclear import and export. These domains resemble, and function as, a nuclear export signal (NES) and a pattern 4 nuclear localization signal (NLS). Both motifs are conserved in other Tmod isoforms and across species. Comparisons of wild-type Tmod and Tmod carrying mutations in these peptide domains revealed that Tmod normally traffics through the nucleus. These observations logically presuppose that Tmod functions may include a nuclear role. Indeed, increasing Tmod in the nucleus severely hampered myogenic differentiation and selectively suppressed muscle-specific gene expression (endogenous p21, myosin heavy chain, myogenin, and Tmod) but did not affect endogenous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or expression from a transfected E-GFP vector. These results suggest that, at least in myogenic cells, nuclear Tmod may be involved in the differentiation process.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It was first cloned from a human fetal liver cDNA library and was later shown to be the capping protein for the pointed end of actin filaments (3Sung L.A. Fowler V.M. Lambert K. Sussman M.A. Karr D.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tmod contains two known functional domains: an N-terminal tropomyosin binding domain and a C-terminal actin binding domain (5Gregorio C.C. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Four different Tmod isoforms, E-, N-, Sk-, and U-, have been identified to date (6Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A.

Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All Tmod isoforms have a similar number of amino acids and show very few deletions or insertions relative to one another (3Sung L.A. Fowler V.M. Lambert K. Sussman M.A. Karr D. Chien S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2616-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de Pouplana L. Fowler V.M. J. Biol.

Helfman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory role of Tmod in the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments has been studied intensively. Tmod is well established as a major regulatory component for the architecture of the sarcomere in muscle cells and of the membrane skeleton in non-muscle cells (6Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de Pouplana L. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28466-28475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that overexpression of Tmod or depletion of Tmod by introduction of anti-Tmod monoclonal antibody in well differentiated cardiac myocytes can disrupt the sarcomeric structures of myofibrils (10Sussman M.A. Baque S. Uhm C.S. Daniels M.P. Price R.L. Simpson D. Terracio L. Kedes L. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In a transgenic model, overexpression of Tmod in the heart leads to a dilated cardiomyopathic phenotype (10Sussman M.A. Baque S. Uhm C.S. Daniels M.P. Price R.L. Simpson D. Terracio L. Kedes L. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This requirement for stoichiometric stability has led to speculation that regulated tropomodulin expression is necessary to maintain stabilized actin filament structures in cardiac muscle cells (10Sussman M.A. Baque S. Uhm C.S. Daniels M.P. Price R.L. Simpson D. Terracio L. Kedes L. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Sussman M.A. Fowler V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have been studying the functional peptide domains of the E-Tmod isoform. This isoform, initially isolated from human erythrocyte membranes and hence dubbed E-Tmod, is highly expressed in the cytoplasm of striated muscles and at lower levels in a number of nonmuscle tissues (3Sung L.A. Fowler V.M. Lambert K. Sussman M.A. Karr D. Chien S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2616-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de Pouplana L.

Unexpectedly we find that E-Tmod can traffic through the nucleus. We have defined functional nuclear import and export domains on E-Tmod that are conserved across species and among other Tmod isoforms. The accumulation of Tmod in the nucleus hampers the normal myogenic process in C2 cells. It is possible that Tmod in the nucleus may play a role in the normal proliferation and differentiation processes in muscle cells. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single amino acid mutations on Tmod were generated using custom-designed primers (Invitrogen) that are specific to the site of mutation. The reactions were carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR conditions were carried out following the supplier's suggestions. The integrity of the coding capability of all Tmod mutants was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers used to generate single mutations are listed below: I134D Forward: GACATCGCAGCTGACCTGGGCATGCAC and Reverse: GTGCATGCCCAGGTCAGCTGCGATGTC; L135E Forward: CATCGCAGCTATCGAGGGCATGCACACAC and Reverse: GTGTGTGCATGCCCTCGATAGCTGCGATG; L135V Forward: CATCGAAGCTATCGTGGGCATGCACACAC and Reverse: GTGTGTGCATGCCCACGATAGCTGCGATG; RAGR Forward: GACCTTGTGAGGGCGGGGAGGCTCGCAGAC and Reverse: GTCTGCGAGCCTCCCCGCCCTCACAAGGTC. Plasmid Construction—pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used for the construction and expression of GFP fusion proteins. All Tmod constructs (wild type or mutants) and a low molecular weight tropomyosin isoform, TM5, were subcloned into this vector through its EcoR1 site. The forward and reverse primers used to generate the TM5 cDNA insert for subcloning are 5′-GGTGAATTCCATGGCCGGGAGCACCACCATCG-3′ and 5′-TGGGAATTCCTACATCTCGTTCAGGTCCAGCAG-3′, respectively. The TM5 template used in the PCR reactions was a gift from Dr. D. Helfman (16Temm-Grove C.J. Guo W. Helfman D.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). pCDNA3 (Amersham Biosciences) was also used as a second mammalian expression vector for transfection assays. A FLAG epitope tag, DYKDDDK, was added upstream to all Tmod and TM5 constructs by PCR before subcloning into pCDNA3 through its EcoR1 sites. pHR′-IRES-GFP (provided by Dr. N. Kasahara, UCLA) was used to subclone both wild type and NES Tmod mutants through the EcoRI site for the generation of lentiviruses. Transient Transfection—C3H10T1/2 cells and C2C12 myoblasts were grown to 50–60% confluency and were transfected with various DNA constructs using calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) ∼16 h after transfection. Fresh medium was added, and cells were allowed to grow for an additional 8–10 h before fixing or harvesting for further analysis. 10T1/2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) (Invitrogen). C2C12 muscle cells were cultured in growth medium (20% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% kanamycin (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% chicken embryo extract (Invitrogen)) before transfection and in differentiation medium (2% horse serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% kanamycin) after transfection. Microscopy and Imaging—Cells transfected with GFP constructs were examined with an IMT 2 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Lake Success, NY). Photomicrographs were taken through the ×20 objective with Fuji 400 ASA film. Cells transfected with pCDNA3 constructs were fixed and immunostained as described under “Immunofluorescence Staining.” Nuclear Protein Extraction—24 h after transient transfection, 10T1/2 cells were washed twice in PBS, harvested, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2–3 min. CERI (NE-PER™, Pierce) was added to each sample following the supplier's guideline (100 μl of CERI per 10-μl cell volume). Cells were resuspended by vortexing for 15 s and then incubated on ice for 10 min. CERII was then added to each sample (5.5 μl of CERII solution for every 10-μl cell volume) followed by repeated vortexing and centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was immediately stored on ice. The insoluble nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of NER (NE-PER™, Pierce) per 10-μl cell volume and incubated on ice for 40 min with intermittent brief vortexing. The samples were centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was stored on ice. After measuring the total volumes of each fraction, their protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. All cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions were stored at -80 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Aliquots of protein extracts (25% of cytoplasmic or 50% of nuclear extracts) were used for protein gel electrophoresis (4–10% Tris-glycine precast SDS gradient gels; Novex, San Diego, CA). In extracts prepared from non-transfected C2C12 cells (∼106), 9% of the cytoplasmic proteins and 90% of the nuclear proteins, respectively, were used for gel assays. Gel-separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a blot transfer cell chamber (Bio-Rad) at 70 V overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed with PBS and blocked with 5% dry milk/PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed with PBST several times and then incubated with primary antibodies at room temp for 1 h. After washing with PBST, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The signal intensities of targeted proteins were detected with ECF chemifluorescence assays (see following). Primary antibodies used for the assays were anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Tmod polyclonal antibodies (5 μg/ml) (18Sussman M.A. Sakhi S. Tocco G. Najm I. Baudry M. Kedes L. Schreiber S.S. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 80: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), anti-HSP90 polyclonal antibodies (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-p300 polyclonal antibodies (1:250)(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1: 25,000) (Sigma). ECF Chemifluorescence Detection—Probed and washed membranes were incubated with Vistra ECF substrate solution (Amersham Biosciences) at a ratio of 1 ml per 24 cm2 for 5 min. Membranes were scanned directly with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and signals emitted by targeted proteins were measured with the ImageQuant v.1.1 program (Molecular Dynamics). Primary Neonatal Rat Cardiac Myocyte Culture and Leptomycin B Treatment—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes from 2–4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared by using a previously described protocol (19Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and cultured for 5–7 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in modified Eagle's medium (5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% 5-bromodeoxyuridine). Leptomycin B (LMB) was then added to the medium at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml, and incubation of the cells continued at 37 °C for 24 h before fixation. Control cells were supplemented with the same volume of 70% methanol, the LMB solvent. LMB was a gift from Dr. M. Yoshida (20Yoshida M. Nishikawa M. Nishi K. Abe K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and was used to block protein export from the nucleus (21Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 22Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem.

Immunofluorescence Staining—Untreated (control) and LMB-treated cardiac cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraform-aldehyde for 15 min. Fixed cells were first rinsed with PBS, then with 0.1 m glycine and then with PBS again before incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After rinsing extensively with PBS, cells were incubated with anti-Tmod polyclonal antibodies (10 μg/ml) in 10% horse serum in PBS for 1 h at ambient temperature. Cells were then washed several times with PBS and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:80) (Sigma) for 1 h in the dark. After the final washing with PBS, cells grown on cover slips were mounted on glass slides with slide mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), sealed and secured with nail polish (Revivánail™, European Touch). 10T1/2 cells transiently transfected with pCDNA3 constructs bearing FLAG-tagged Tmod or TM5 were fixed after 24 h and treated similarly except the primary antibody used for immunostaining was anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) (Sigma), and the secondary antibody was rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100)(Sigma). Photomicrographs of immunostained cardiac myocytes were taken with a ×40 objective on a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal system, and images were processed by LSM 5 Pascal software V 2.8 WS. 100 cells from separate experiments were examined to calculate the percentage of cells possessing the representative phenotype. Among these cells, 50 from each experiment were further analyzed to determine the percentage of Tmod located in the nuclei of untreated cardiomyocytes and in the nuclei of LMB-treated cardiomycocytes. Intensities of the fluorescence signal within the whole cell and within the nuclear area of the same cell were quantified separately using the ImageJ software (NIH Image). % of nuclear Tmod = (pixel intensity of nuclear area/pixel intensity of whole cell area) × 100%. The p value of the difference between nuclear Tmod in untreated cardiomyocytes versus LMB-treated cardiomyocytes was calculated by Student's t test. Photomicrographs of immunostained 10T1/2 fibroblasts were taken using a ×40 dry objective on an Olympus camera with Fuji 400 ASA film. Generation of Lentiviruses—Lentivirus-based vectors encoding IRES-GFP (pHR′-IRES-GFP) were generated by transient co-transfection of 293T cells with a three-plasmid combination as described previously (24Sakoda T. Kasahara N. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 2037-2047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All viral stocks used in the transduction of C2 myoblasts were from unfractionated culture media. Titers were determined by infecting 293T cells with an aliquot of each viral stock in a dilution series. Control cells were examined at the time of infection and at the time of harvesting. The percentages of GFP-positive cells were determined by flow cytometry by the USC Pathology Reference Laboratory. Viral Transduction, Cell Sorting, and Cell Enrichment of C2 Myoblasts—C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in 6-cm tissue culture plates until reaching ∼30–40% confluence. An MOI of five copies of virus per cell was used for all lentiviral transductions. After 8 h of incubation, fresh medium (20% fetal bovine serum, 1% kanamycin, and 0.05% CEE) was added to each plate, and cells were cultured for three more days. Cells were then trypsinized and collected into 5-ml round bottom polystyrene tubes for cell sorting by a MoFlo Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Cells expressing moderate to high GFP signals were selected and deposited into a premounted 35-mm culture plate containing fresh culture medium. Approximately 5,000 to 10,000 GFP-positive cells were recovered from each viral transduction preparation. After another week of culturing, cells were trypsinized again and subjected to a second round of cell sorting to enrich the GFP-positive population. Aliquots of lentiviral-infected, GFP-positive C2 cells were cultured in parallel with uninfected C2 myoblasts as controls for time course studies on the change of cell morphology and the expression of myogenic markers before and after the induction of differentiation. Northern (RNA) Blot Analyses—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Aliquots (10 μg) of total RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and then hybridized with radiolabeled probes and examined by autoradiography. Probes used for Northern blots were all generated by RT-PCR reactions using the RETROscript™ first strand synthesis kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas) except for EGFP and G3PDH. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was used for each reverse transcription (RT) reaction and the 2.5-μl RT reaction from a total volume of 20 μl was used for each PCR reaction afterward. Annealing temperature for the PCR reactions were from 55 to 58 °C, depending on the predicted melting temperature of the primers. Random sequence oligonucleotides from the RT-PCR kit were used for all reverse transcription reactions. Primers designed to target specific cDNAs were used for the PCR reactions. Primers targeted to nucleotides 1157–1180 (forward, GenBank™ NM_021883) and nucleotides 1523–1500 (reverse) were used for the mouse E-Tmod 3′-UTR fragment. Primers for the mouse p21 5′-UTR and coding region fragments were targeted to nucleotides 101–120 (forward, GenBank™ U09507) and nucleotides 444–425 (reverse). Primers for the mouse myogenin coding region were targeted to nucleotides 185–202 (forward, GenBank™ NM_031189) and nucleotides 548–531 (reverse). Primers for nucleotides 4863–4885 (forward, GenBank™ BC008538) and nucleotides 5500–5479 (reverse) were used to target the mouse myosin heavy chain (MCH)3′-UTR fragment. BamH1 and NotI double digestions generated a full-length cDNA of EGFP from a pEGFP-N1 vector. A DNA fragment from the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (G3PDH, Clontech), excised with HindIII and PstI, served as an internal control for relative concentrations among RNA samples. Signal intensities of each band from Northern blot analyses were semiquantified using the NIH Image software (Version 1.63). Subcellular Location of Exogenous Tmod, Tmod Mutants, and Tropomyosin Fusion Proteins—We have used biochemical and cellular protein-protein interaction studies to define residues on Tmod that interact with tropomyosin and actin. 2K. Y. Kong and L. Kedes, manuscript in preparation. During the course of those studies we examined the effect on cellular phenotype of mutations that affected the protein interactions and others that did not. Several of the Tmod mutant proteins that we engineered with single amino acid substitutions showed surprising differences in intracellular localization from that of wild-type Tmod. When wild-type Tmod-GFP fusion protein was overexpressed in cells, it accumulated in the cytoplasm as expected and any suggestion of nuclear immunofluorescence was not noticeably different from that of cells expressing a GFP control vector (Fig. 2A). However, two Tmod mutants that we had been studying, I134D and l135E (see Fig. 1A), showed a strong and dominant nuclear localization following transient transfection of their expression vectors in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). The same results were also observed when these vectors were transfected into C2C12 myoblasts (data not shown). Although GFP has been reported to diffuse into the nucleus even though it has no NLS, we are unaware of GFP causing nuclear localization as a fusion protein. To eliminate this possibility we included a low molecular weight (LMW) tropomyosin isoform, TM5, in these studies for comparison. Unlike Tmod, wild-type TM5-GFP fusion protein did not seem to localize into the nucleus when overexpressed (Fig. 2A). Because TM5 also has no known NLS (16Temm-Grove C.J. Guo W. Helfman D.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Sung L.A. Lin J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the size of the TM5-GFP fusion protein would probably be large enough (∼58 kDa) to keep it from diffusing into the nucleus. To further address the specificity of Tmod nuclear localization mechanism, we decided to construct a second set of vectors carrying wild-type Tmod, I134D Tmod mutant, l135E Tmod mutant, and TM5, each with a FLAG epitope tag. Strong nuclear signals were observed once again from cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged I134D and L135E mutants (Fig. 2B) whereas the FLAG-tagged wild-type Tmod only had a strong cytoplasmic signal and a moderate nuclear signal (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged TM5 construct showed a clear nuclear exclusion immunostaining pattern (Fig. 2B) that is similar to the TM5-GFP fusion protein subcellular localization pattern (Fig. 2A). The same nuclear exclusion immunostaining pattern was also observed when the FLAG-tagged TM5 construct was introduced into primary cardiomyocytes, C2C12, and L6 muscle cells (data not shown). Lastly, because both I134D and L135E mutations generate an extra charge on Tmod it was also possible that the increased nuclear localization was simply because of a gain of charge. To address this issue we tested a second mutation at the 135 position, L135V. Once again, a relatively strong nuclear signal was seen from cells transfected with this charge-neutral mutant (Fig. 2B). Identification of Nuclear Transport Signals on E-Tmod—The amino acids encompassing residues 134 and 135 do not resemble known nuclear localization import motifs making it unlikely that our mutations had artificially created an NLS. However, these mutations did fall in the midst of a previously unsuspected motif resembling a class III nuclear export signal (NES) motif (26Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 27Turpin P. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), which is usually composed of short leucine-rich amino acid sequences (Fig. 1B). Thus, the mutations at residues 134 and 135 have disrupted a likely nuclear export signal of Tmod that would also imply the presence elsewhere in the protein of one or more NLS motifs. Examination of the Tmod amino acid sequence indeed revealed a region from amino acids 340 to 343 (RKRR) that meets the criteria of a pattern 4 nuclear localization signal (29Burglin T.R. De Robertis E.M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2617-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with 76% reliability (30Nakai N. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). Mutations at NLS Affect Nuclear Accumulation of Tmod—To determine whether this motif indeed plays a role in Tmod nuclear entry we created a Tmod expression vector that carries K341A and R342G mutations. Tmod proteins carrying this RAGR mutation (Fig. 1C) at the site of the putative NLS RKKR (Fig. 1C) indeed have been excluded from nuclei compared with wild-type Tmod in either 10T1/2 cells or C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 2C). Thus, this mutation appears to have disrupted a functional NLS in Tmod that is required for its previously unsuspected nuclear import. If the accumulation of Tmod in nuclei we observed with the mutations at residues 134 and 135 is caused by disruption of a normal NES, then double mutants also carrying the RAGR substitution would be expected to reduce the nuclear accumulation of Tmod. As predicted, the presence of Tmod in nuclei appears to be greatly diminished in either 10T1/2 cells or the C2 myoblasts expressing the double mutants (Fig. 3B). Measurement of Tmod in Nuclear Extracts—To measure the levels of Tmod in nuclei and confirm the effects of the various mutations, we extracted nuclear proteins from the transfected cells and measured the relative Tmod abundance by semiquantitative Western blotting using fluorescent ECF signals detected by a phosphorimager. The degree of cytoplasmic contamination in the nuclear extracts was monitored using a probe for HSP90, a purely cytoplasmic protein. Conversely the degree of nuclear contamination in the cytoplasmic extracts was monitored by measuring the presence of the nuclear transcription co-factor, p300. Following separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic components, minimal amounts of HSP90 were detected in the nuclear extracts, and p300 was almost undetectable in cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 3A). Thus, we subsequently used the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of HSP90 and p300 to correct the fraction of various Tmods in the nuclear compartment. The RAGR mutation of the NLS reduced the fraction of Tmod detected in nuclei to between 45% to 80% of the levels of wild type or the I134D and L135E mutations (Fig. 3B). Further, all three constructs carrying the RAGR mutation (wild type, I134D, and L135E) had reduced levels of nuclear Tmod accumulation compared with the fully wild-type construct. Cells expressing the L135E RAGR double mutant consistently accumulated in nuclei less than half the ECF detectable signal emitted by cells expressing the wild-type construct. Subcellular Localization of Endogenous Tmod in Myogenic C2 Cells—We analyzed the subcellular location of Tmod in proliferating C2 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes both by immunofluorescence microscopy and by Western blotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. Tmod could not be detected in myoblasts by immunostaining but in myotubes we observed strong Tmod staining exclusivel"
https://openalex.org/W2123958492,"Members of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors control the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol, fatty acids, triglycerides, and phospholipids. Continuous intragastric infusion of ethanol-containing diets as part of total enteral nutrition generates well defined 6-day cycles (pulses) of urine ethanol concentrations (UECs) in rats. Pulsatile UECs are the result of cyclical expression and activity of the principal alcohol-metabolizing enzyme, hepatic Class I alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and this mechanism involves regulated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-beta expression and binding to the ADH promoter. In this study, we further explore the molecular mechanism for ethanol-induced ADH expression during the UEC pulse in adult male rats fed ethanol by total enteral nutrition for 21-30 days. In hypophysectomized rats, in which the ADH protein increased by approximately 6-fold, the nuclear form of SREBP-1 decreased by approximately 7-fold. Because the ADH promoter contains two canonical sterol response element (SRE) sites (-63 to -53 and -52 to -40 relative to the transcription start site), electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted using an ADH-specific SRE site. Hepatic nuclear protein binding decreased by 2.4-fold on the ascending limbs and by 3.6-fold on the descending limbs of UEC pulses (p < 0.05). The specificity of nuclear protein binding to the ADH-SRE site was confirmed using antibody and UV cross-link assays. The in vivo binding status of SREBP-1 to ADH-SRE sites, as measured by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, had a pattern very similar to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay results. Functional analysis of the ADH-SREs demonstrated these sites to be essential for ADH transcription. In vitro transcription assays demonstrated that depletion of the SREBP-1 protein from nuclear extracts increased transcription activity by approximately 5-fold and that the liver X receptor agonist T0901317 (a known activator of SREBP-1c transcription) reduced in vitro expression of ADH mRNA by 2-fold. We conclude that SREBP-1 is a negative regulator of the ADH gene and may work in concert with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins to mediate ethanol induction of ADH in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2024437491,"DNA topoisomerase (topo) IIα, an essential enzyme for cell proliferation, is targeted to a proteasome-dependent degradation pathway when human tumor cells are glucose-starved. Here we show that the topo IIα destabilization depends on the newly identified domain, GRDD (glucose-regulated destruction domain), which was mapped to the N-terminal 70–170 amino acid sequence. Indeed, the deletion of GRDD conferred a stable feature on topo IIα, whereas the fusion of GRDD rendered green fluorescent protein unstable under glucose starvation conditions. Nuclear localization was a prerequisite for GRDD function, because the inhibition of nuclear translocation resulted in the suppression of GRDD-mediated topo IIα degradation. Further, GRDD was identified as an interactive domain for Jab1/CSN5, which promoted the degradation of topo IIα in a manner dependent on the MPN (Mpr1p/Prd1p N terminus) domain. Depleting Jab1/CSN5 by antisense oligonucleotide and treating cells with the CSN-associated kinase inhibitor, curcumin, inhibited topo IIα degradation induced by glucose starvation. These findings demonstrate that GRDD can act as a stress-activated degron for regulating topo IIα stability, possibly through interaction with the MPN domain of Jab1/CSN5.

Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar). In humans, topo II exists in two closely related isoforms, α and β, which share a high degree of structural homology with a ∼70% sequence identity (2Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 215-226Google Scholar, 3Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Google Scholar). Three discrete functional domains are embedded in the topo II enzymes (1Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Google Scholar, 4Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-137Google Scholar). The N-terminal and the central domains are responsible for ATPase and catalytic activities, respectively, and the C-terminal domain, the least conserved region, contains the nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Although the structural and the biochemical features are closely related, the topo II isoforms show a great difference in their expression characteristics (4Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-137Google Scholar). The expression of topo IIα is regulated by the state of cellular proliferation, high in proliferation and low in quiescence with a higher cell density or a lower serum concentration. The levels of topo IIα also change within a single cell cycle, peaking in the G2/M phase and declining to a minimal level after M phase completion. However, the levels of topo IIβ are relatively constant throughout the cell cycle and in quiescent and proliferating states (5Kroll D.J. Rowe T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7957-7961Google Scholar). The topo II isoforms have been shown to be the molecular target for such clinically important antitumor drugs such as etoposide and doxorubicin (6Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Google Scholar, 7Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Google Scholar). The topo II-directed drugs convert this enzyme into a cellular poison by stabilizing the covalent DNA-enzyme intermediates, the so-called cleavable complex. Interestingly, the increase in topo II-cleavable complexes also has been observed in the presence of a number of physiological stressors such as acidic pH, oxidation, and thiol (8Brown J.M. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1408-1416Google Scholar, 9Tomida A. Tsuruo T. Anticancer Drug Des. 1999; 14: 169-177Google Scholar). DNA damage resulting from the cleavable complexes is thought to lead to eventual cell death. Thus, any processes leading to a decrease in the number of cleavable complexes may have a positive impact on cell survival. In the case of topo II-directed drugs, cellular resistance can be achieved by both qualitative and quantitative changes in topo II much more frequently with the α-isoform. Indeed, the resistance often correlates with a decrease in topo IIα expression levels or with mutations in the protein that reduce enzymatic activity (10Vassetzky Y.S. Alghisi G.C. Gasser S.M. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 767-774Google Scholar). C-terminal truncations of topo IIα, which result in the loss of functional NLS and thus cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme, also have been found to correlate with resistance to topo II-directed drugs (11Harker W.G. Slade D.L. Parr R.L. Feldhoff P.W. Sullivan D.M. Holguin M.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1707-1716Google Scholar, 12Yu Q. Mirski S.E. Sparks K.E. Cole S.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5868-5877Google Scholar). High levels of topo IIα expression have been shown in a wide variety of tumors, partly due to the increased growth fraction (13Dingemans A.M. Pinedo H.M. Giaccone G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 275-288Google Scholar). The high topo IIα expression may provide a rationale for the use of topo II-directed drugs in clinical settings. However, most of the common solid tumors exhibit resistance to chemotherapy. Malignant cells within solid tumors are often surrounded by conditions such as glucose deprivation, hypoxia, low pH, and other forms of nutrient deprivation (8Brown J.M. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1408-1416Google Scholar, 9Tomida A. Tsuruo T. Anticancer Drug Des. 1999; 14: 169-177Google Scholar, 14Sutherland R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 177-184Google Scholar). These physiological conditions in culture can down-regulate the expression of topo IIα with growth arrest or delay at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (15Kim H.D. Tomida A. Ogiso Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 97-104Google Scholar). What we found to be consistent with the decreased topo IIα levels was tumor cells becoming resistant to topo II-directed drugs when stressed by glucose starvation and related culture conditions (16Shen J. Hughes C. Chao C. Cai J. Bartels C. Gessner T. Subjeck J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3278-3282Google Scholar, 17Yun J. Tomida A. Nagata K. Tsuruo T. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 583-590Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the stress-mediated down-regulation of topo IIα may be an obstacle to successful topo II-directed chemotherapy. Recently, we have shown that inhibition of proteasome attenuates stress-induced resistance by inhibiting topo IIα depletion (18Ogiso Y. Tomida A. Lei S. Omura S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2429-2434Google Scholar). Topo IIα restoration is seen only at the protein levels, indicating that topo IIα protein depletion occurs through a proteasome-mediated degradation mechanism. In general, proteasome-mediated proteolysis is targeted by ubiquitylation of the substrate proteins (19Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). Consistently, topo IIα can be conjugated with polyubiquitin in a cell-free system with extracts of cancer cells (20Nakajima T. Morita K. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Osaka F. Yamao F. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24842-24849Google Scholar). Thus, the ubiquitin-proteasome system appears responsible for topo IIα degradation under conditions of glucose starvation, but the regulatory mechanisms leading to topo IIα degradation are largely unknown. In this study, we have attempted to identify the domain of topo IIα responsible for degradation under glucose starvation. We report herein a novel degradation signal designated glucose-regulated destruction domain (GRDD), which presents within the N-terminal ATPase domain. Our current results show that GRDD functions in the nucleus and can lead to proteasome-mediated degradation of heterologous proteins under stress conditions. We also demonstrate that Jab1/CSN5 binds to and promotes degradation of topo IIα in a GRDD-dependent manner. Consistent with this finding was that specific inhibition of Jab1/CSN5 leads to the stabilization of endogenous topo IIα under stress conditions. Cell Culture and Treatments—HT1080 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan), and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui), each supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 μg of kanamycin/ml. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Glucose deprivation was achieved by substituting glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. PSI (carbobenzoxyl-l-isoleucyl-γ-t-butyl-l-glutamyl-l-alanyl-l-leucinal) and MG132 were purchased from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Lactacystin and curcumin were from Kyowa Medex (Tokyo, Japan) and Sigma, respectively. These compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and added to culture medium so that the final concentration of Me2SO was <0.5%. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times using exponentially growing cells. Expression Plasmids—For expression plasmid construction of full-length topo IIα and its deletion mutants from N or C terminus, the pBluescript SK+ plasmid containing full-length human topo IIα cDNA (a generous gift from Dr James C. Wang, Harvard University) (21Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Liu L.F. Liu A.A. Tewey K.M. Whang-Peng J. Knutsen T. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7177-7181Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR amplification with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, LA Jolla, CA). To facilitate subcloning, a ClaI and a SalI restriction sites were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The PCR products first were cloned into the pPCR-Script Amp vector (Stratagene) and subsequently subcloned into the ClaI/SalI site of the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector (Sigma). For construction of a Δ714–1287 topo IIα internal deletion mutant, the sequence corresponding to amino acids 714–1532 was removed from pFLAG-WT topo IIα by BglII/SalI digestion and replaced with a PCR fragment corresponding to amino acids 1288–1532. Further internal deletions within amino acids 1–713 were performed by replacing the sequence between the ClaI and BglII sites of pFLAG-Δ714–1287 topo IIα with each corresponding PCR fragment. Similarly, the expression plasmids of GFP-NLS2 fusion proteins were constructed by either replacing with or by inserting a GFP gene derived from the pCMV/Myc/nuc/GFP vector (Invitrogen). pFLAG-ND70–170 topo IIα was constructed using two PCR fragments (corresponding to amino acids 1–69 and 171–1532) that were introduced into the NotI-ClaI and ClaI-SalI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis including single amino acid substitution, double amino acid substitution, and deletion up to 10 amino acids was carried out using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pcHA expression vector derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was described previously (22Horie K. Tomida A. Sugimoto Y. Yasugi T. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7913-7922Google Scholar). Full-length human Jab1/CSN5 cDNA was generated by PCR from a cDNA library of HT29 cells. The PCR fragment was cloned into the pcHA expression vector at the BamHI/NotI site. A PCR fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–190 of Jab1/CSN5 also was cloned into the pcHA vector at the BamHI/NotI site. The plasmid construction of ΔMPN Jab1/CSN5 was carried out using two PCR fragments (corresponding to amino acids 1–54 and 191–344) that were introduced to BamHI-NotI and NotI-XbaI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The pcDNA3-GFP vector was described previously (23Mashima T. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2423-2430Google Scholar). The proper construction of all of the plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All of the plasmids for transfection were prepared using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). Transfection—Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. HT1080 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well in a six-well plate 16 h before transfection. After changing to 2 ml of fresh culture medium, 200 μl of transfection mixture containing 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 12 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent in 188 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was added to each well and the cells were incubated for 8 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and further incubated for 6 h in fresh medium. After transfection, the cells were cultivated in normal or glucose-free culture medium for the indicated periods of time. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of HT1080 cells were prepared using NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× SDS sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) as described previously (17Yun J. Tomida A. Nagata K. Tsuruo T. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 583-590Google Scholar). Protein content of the samples was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-human topo IIα (clone KF4, Sigma Genosys), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-Jab1/CSN5 (GeneTex, Inc), polyclonal anti-GFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), anti-actin (c-2) horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Signalosome subunit CSN1, CSN8 (AFFINITI Research Products Ltd), and anti-GRP78 horseradish peroxidase antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories). The specific signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on a 35-mm glass-bottom culture dish with a polylysine-coated glass (MatTek, Ashland, MA) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with methanol for 2 min. The fixed cells were processed for immunostaining with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:100 dilution) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution). The nuclei were counterstained using 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole. The cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-70) equipped with a CCD camera. Yeast Two-hybrid System—We used a yeast two-hybrid system commercially available from Clontech. The coding region of the N-terminal (aa 1–200 and 1–584) of topo IIα protein was fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). The resulting bait plasmids were used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. From 1.5 × 106 transfectants, 11 positive clones were isolated. DNA sequence analysis identified two Jab1 clones from the 11 positive clones obtained. In Vitro Protein-binding Assay—The full-length and deletion mutants cDNAs of Jab1/CSN5 were amplified by PCR and inserted into a pGEX-5 bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with GST. After DNA sequencing, GST-fused Jab1/CSN5 proteins were purified with a GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer‘s instructions. FLAG-tagged topo IIα proteins were expressed in 293T cells by transfection with SuperFect® reagent (Qiagen). The FLAG-tagged topo IIα proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and eluted from the resin with a FLAG peptide according to the manufacturer‘s instructions. The immunopurified FLAG-tagged topo IIα proteins (100 ng) were added directly to GST-Jab1/CSN5 fusion proteins immobilized on the GSH beads (100 ng). The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a total volume of 1.5 ml of a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. After washing three times with the binding buffer, the protein complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot using anti-FLAG M2 and anti-GST antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Antisense Morpholino Oligomers—A morpholino antisense oligomer specific for human Jab1/CSN5 as well as a standard control oligomer was purchased from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR). The sequences were 5′-CGGACGCCGCCATCGCCGAGGAAG-3′ for Jab1/CSN5 and 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′ for the control. Antisense treatments were performed according to the manufacturer's “special delivery protocol.” HT1080 and MCF-7 cells were seeded at 6 × 105 and 9 × 105 cells/well, respectively, in a six-well plate 16 h before antisense treatment. Antisense mixtures with the ethoxylated polyethylenizamine special delivery solution were added to the cultures, and cells were incubated for 3 (HT1080) or 6 h (MCF-7). The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in normal or glucose-free medium for 18 (HT1080) or 24 h (MCF-7), and the whole cell lysates were prepared for analyzing expression of Jab1/CSN5 and topo IIα. ATPase Domain and NLS Are Indispensable for Stress-induced Degradation of Topo IIα—When cells are cultured under the stress condition of glucose starvation, topo IIα is degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. Indeed, degradation of topo IIα, but not topo IIβ, was observed in glucose-starved HT1080 cells (Fig. 1A). Degradation of topo IIα was suppressed by proteasome inhibitor PSI at 3 μm but not by calpain inhibitor, carbobenzoxyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (Z-LL-H), at 50 μm. Likewise, wild-type topo IIα tagged with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus was degraded during glucose starvation when it was expressed transiently in HT1080 cells by transfection (Fig. 1C). To determine which regions of topo IIα were required for the degradation, we constructed a panel of expression plasmids of topo IIα deletion mutants (Fig. 1B) and transfected them into HT1080 cells. Glucose starvation-induced degradation was monitored by Western blot analysis using the anti-topo IIα C terminus and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Fig. 1C). Deletion mutants from the N terminus (Δ1–675, Δ1–1007, and Δ1–1287) revealed that the deletion of the ATPase domain led to degradation resistance under glucose starvation conditions. Deletion of the NLS2 region (ΔNLS2) from the C terminus also resulted in stabilization under the same conditions. In contrast, the Δ714–1287 mutant containing the ATPase domain and the NLS2 region was destabilized by glucose starvation, as was wild-type topo IIα. We also found that deletion mutants showed some differences in expression under the normal growth conditions. Although the exact reason is not known, we speculate that these differences are probably a result of alterations in the basal stability of each mutant topo IIα protein. Subcellular Localization of Topo IIα Deletion Mutants—Immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated that wild-type topo IIα localized in the nuclei of HT1080 cells in a predominantly diffusing manner (Fig. 2A). The Δ714–1287 mutant topo IIα, which was sensitive to the stress-induced degradation, also localized in the nucleus, and the pattern of immunostaining was similar between wild-type and Δ714–1287 mutant topo IIα. In contrast, ΔNLS2 topo IIα, which was resistant to the stress-induced degradation, accumulated mainly in the cytoplasm. A cell fractionation experiment revealed that ΔNLS topo IIα was more abundant in the cytoplasmic fractions than the WT topo IIα (Fig. 2B). The action was in agreement with the fact that the NLS2 sequence is the major functional motif for nuclear translocation of topo IIα (24Mirski S.E. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2129-2134Google Scholar, 25Mirski S.E. Gerlach J.H. Cummings H.J. Zirngibl R. Greer P.A. Cole S.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 452-455Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicated that nuclear localization of topo IIα was a prerequisite for degradation of this enzyme under glucose starvation conditions. Consistent with these findings, endogenous topo IIα remained in the nucleus of stressed cells when degradation of topo IIα was inhibited by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 2C). Analysis of Topo IIα ATPase Domain for Stress-induced Degradation—The above results suggested that the sequence within the ATPase domain could affect topo IIα stability under glucose starvation stress conditions. To determine the critical region, we constructed deletion mutants within the ATPase domain that were fused with the topo IIα NLS2 domain for nuclear localization. Stress-induced degradation of the fusion proteins was monitored as described above. As shown in Fig. 3A, aa1–584, 1–201, 1–170, and 1–140 of ATPase-NLS2 fusion proteins were destabilized by glucose starvation but the aa 1–130 fusion protein remained stable compared with the others. We further examined the N-terminal deletions of the aa 1–170 ATPase-NLS2 fusion protein by co-transfection with the GFP protein (Fig. 3B). Although stress-induced destabilization still occurred when 1–42 (ΔN1–42) and 1–69 (ΔN1–69) residues were deleted, the 1–124 deletion (ΔN1–124) led to degradation resistance. The N-terminal deletions also were applied to full-length topo IIα (Δ42, Δ69, and Δ124), and essentially, the same results were obtained with respect to the stability under glucose starvation conditions (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the 1–69 deletion, both in full-length topo IIα and in the aa 1–170 ATPase-NLS2 fusion protein, decreased its expression level under normal growth conditions as compared with the 1–42 deletion (Fig. 3, B and C). The 1–42 deletion itself had little effect on the expression levels under normal conditions (data not shown). Conversely, the 1–124 deletion greatly increased the expression levels in the aa 1–170 ATPase-NLS2 fusion protein, although it had only a marginal effect on the full-length topo IIα expression under normal conditions (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that the N-terminal regions can affect the stability of topo IIα under normal growth conditions. Identification of GRDD, a Novel Transposable Degradation Signal—This deletion analysis implied that the minimal region necessary for the stress-induced degradation was located between 70 and 140 amino acid residues of topo IIα ATPase domain. Indeed, topo IIα became resistant to the stress-induced degradation when the 70–170 residues were deleted (Fig. 4A). It is important to note that ND70–170 topo IIα localized in the nucleus (see Fig. 2). We designated the 70–170 region of topo IIα as GRDD. To evaluate the GRDD of topo IIα as a stress-specific degradation signal, we constructed GFP fusion proteins that were fused with topo IIα 1–170 or 70–170 residues at the N terminus and topo IIα NLS2 domain at the C terminus for nuclear localization (Fig. 4B). The GFP-NLS2 fusion protein (not containing GRDD) was expressed at similar levels under normal and glucose starvation conditions, showing that this fusion protein was insensitive to the mechanism (or mechanisms) of the stress-induced topo IIα degradation. By adding GRDD to GFP-NLS2 (aa 1–170 and 70–170), we found that the protein became vulnerable to degradation under glucose starvation conditions as was observed for topo IIα. Thus, the GRDD of topo IIα can act as a transposable stress-specific degradation signal. Topo IIα has a destruction box-like sequence that is located within GRDD (26Nakajima T. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Oda K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 651-662Google Scholar). In fact, the amino acid sequence, ENNLISIWN, located between 112 and 120 of topo IIα is similar to the consensus sequence of the cyclin B-type destruction box, RXXLXXIXN. To examine the contribution of the destruction box-like sequence, we used Δ714–1287 topo IIα, which consisted of the entire ATPase domain and the NLS2 region (Fig. 1). The deletion of amino acids 112–120 (ΔDB) within the GRDD of topo IIα had no effect on stress-induced degradation of Δ714–1287 topo IIα (Fig. 4C). We concluded that the destruction box-like sequence in GRDD is dispensable for topo IIα degradation under glucose starvation conditions. GRDD-dependent Topo IIα Degradation by Jab1/CSN5— Jab1/CSN5 was identified as a candidate protein that interacts with GRDD by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the topo IIα ATPase domain (aa 1–200 and 1–584) as bait. To confirm a physical interaction between topo IIα and Jab1/CSN5, we tested the ability of the GST-Jab1/CSN5 fusion protein to bind to immunopurified FLAG-tagged topo IIα. Full-length topo IIα was captured by the GST-Jab1/CSN5 but not by the GST polypeptide alone (Fig. 5A). The in vitro binding between topo IIα and Jab1/CSN5 was dependent on GRDD of topo IIα. Indeed, aa 1–584 ATPase-NLS2 and ΔNLS2 topo IIα, which contained GRDD, were captured by the GST-Jab1/CSN5. However, ND70–170 topo IIα and aa 125–170 ATPase-NLS2, which lacked the complete GRDD, were not captured by the GST-Jab1/CSN5 (Fig. 5A). To determine whether Jab1/CSN5 modulates stability of topo IIα in vivo, we examined the expression levels of FLAG-tagged topo IIα and its deletion mutants in HT1080 cells co-expressing HA-tagged Jab1/CSN5 (Fig. 5, B and C). Similar to glucose starvation, co-expression of Jab1/CSN5 induced the degradation of wild-type topo IIα and aa 1–584 ATPase-NLS2, which interacted physically with Jab1/CSN5 in vitro. However, Jab1/CSN5 as well as glucose starvation did not affect the expression levels of ND70–170 topo IIα, which lacked Jab1/CSN5 binding ability. The combination of glucose starvation and Jab1/CSN5 co-expression had no additive or synergistic effect on the topo IIα expression, and the two treatments did not seem to affect each other under the experimental conditions. The Jab1/CSN5-induced decrease in aa 1–584 ATPase-NLS2 expression was suppressed by proteasome inhibitors PSI, MG132, and lactacystin (Fig. 5C). Thus, similar to glucose starvation, Jab1/CSN5 can stimulate proteasome-mediated degradation of topo IIα, and this stimulation occurs in a Jab1/CSN5-topo IIα binding-dependent manner. The Jab1/CSN5-stimulated degradation of topo IIα also was suppressed by the CSN kinase inhibitor, curcumin (Fig. 5C). We further examined deletion mutants of Jab1/CSN5 to establish the relationship between degradation and Jab1/CSN5 binding of topo IIα. Jab1/CSN5 has a functional domain known as the MPN domain. Co-expression of ΔMPN Jab1/CSN5 had little effect on degradation of the aa 1–584 ATPase-NLS2 of topo IIα, whereas co-expression of ΔC Jab1/CSN5 containing the entire MPN domain down-regulated it similar to full-length Jab1/CSN5 (Fig. 6A). Consistent with this finding was that GST-ΔC Jab1/CSN5, but not ΔMPN, interacted physically with full-length topo IIα in vitro (Fig. 6B). These results suggested that Jab1/CSN5 stimulated the degradation of topo IIα via direct binding in a GRDD- and MPN-dependent manner. Involvement of Jab1/CSN5 in Stress-induced Topo IIα Degradation—To address whether Jab1/CSN5 mediates degradation of endogenous topo IIα under glucose starvation, we examined the effects of curcumin and Jab1/CSN5 antisense morpholino oligomers. As shown in Fig. 7A, curcumin inhibited stress-induced degradation of topo IIα in HT1080 cells as effectively as the proteasome inhibitors, PSI, MG132, and lactacystin. Curcumin also inhibited topo IIα degradation in MCF-7 cells, and interestingly, it caused a decreased expression of Jab1/CSN5 (Fig. 7C). Applying a Jab1/CSN5 antisense morpholino oligomer, but not scramble control, decreased cellular contents of Jab1/CSN5 by ∼65% in both HT1080 and MCF-7 cells without affecting those of a different signalosome subunit, CSN1 or CSN8 (Fig. 7, B and C). The Jab1/CSN5 declined as a result of antisense suppressed stress-induced topo IIα degradation. These results indicated that Jab1/CSN5 is involved in topo IIα degradation under glucose starvation conditions. Under the physiological cell conditions of glucose starvation, topo IIα is degraded by the proteasome system. In this study, we identified GRDD as the degradation signal that was loc"
https://openalex.org/W1986623297,"Although the negative regulation of gene expression by insulin has been widely studied, the transcription factors responsible for the insulin effect are still unknown. The purpose of this work was to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the insulin repression of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) gene. Deletion analysis of the 5′-regulatory region allowed us to identify an insulin-responsive region located at –459 to –354 bp. This fragment contains a highly homologous insulin-responsive (IRE) sequence. By transient transfection assays, we determined that hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1) are necessary for an appropriate expression of the ALAS gene. Insulin overrides the HNF3β or HNF3β plus NF1-mediated stimulation of ALAS transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Southwestern blotting indicate that HNF3 binds to the ALAS promoter. Mutational analysis of this region revealed that IRE disruption abrogates insulin action, whereas mutation of the HNF3 element maintains hormone responsiveness. This dissociation between HNF3 binding and insulin action suggests that HNF3β is not the sole physiologic mediator of insulin-induced transcriptional repression. Furthermore, Southwestern blotting assay shows that at least two polypeptides other than HNF3β can bind to ALAS promoter and that this binding is dependent on the integrity of the IRE. We propose a model in which insulin exerts its negative effect through the disturbance of HNF3β binding or transactivation potential, probably due to specific phosphorylation of this transcription factor by Akt. In this regard, results obtained from transfection experiments using kinase inhibitors support this hypothesis. Due to this event, NF1 would lose accessibility to the promoter. The posttranslational modification of HNF3 would allow the binding of a protein complex that recognizes the core IRE.

Many of these genes are regulated by insulin at the transcriptional level, but the molecular mechanisms by which this regulation is achieved are poorly understood.

Thus, the actual function of this consensus motif and the proteins that are relevant for the negative insulin effect are still under investigation. The first step of the heme biosynthesis in mammalian cells is catalyzed by the mitochondrial matrix and rate-limiting enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS). There are two related ALAS isozymes that are encoded by two separate genes located on different chromosomes (12Kappas A. Sassa S. Galbraith R.A. Nordmann Y. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2103-2159Google Scholar). The erythroid cell-specific enzyme or ALAS-2 is developmentally regulated, and it markedly increases during erythropoiesis to meet the demand for heme during hemoglobin production (13Sadlon T.J. Dell'Orso T. Surinya K.H. May B.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1153-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The second enzyme, ubiquitous or liver-type ALAS (ALAS-1), is probably expressed in all tissues to provide heme for cytochromes and other hemoproteins (14Ponka P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of ALAS in the liver was found to be subject to feedback regulation by heme, the end product of the pathway (14Ponka P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the liver ALAS gene is under multicomponent control at the transcriptional level. Transcription of the ALAS gene is stimulated by cAMP (15Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem.

Cell Res. 1998; 244: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) repress ALAS gene transcription. This pattern of regulation is accomplished by CREB, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and AP-1 transactivation through the cis-acting elements CRE, nuclear respiratory factor-1-binding site, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element, respectively, found in the 5′-regulatory region of ALAS gene. Although evidence has been provided that insulin provokes a rapid inhibition of ALAS transcription and that 800 bp of the proximal 5′-flanking region of the ALAS gene are sufficient to confer this negative regulation (18Scassa M.E. Varone C.L. Montero L.E. Cánepa E.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the elements and transcription factors involved in insulin-mediated regulation of ALAS gene expression are still unknown. In a recent report (19Scassa M.E. Guberman A.S. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we showed that activation of two signaling pathways often considered to be functionally separated during insulin action, the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/p90RSK pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway, are jointly required for insulin-mediated inhibition of ALAS gene expression in rat hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells. This may suggest that these two pathways converge on a common transcription factor or complex that is targeted by insulin. Because of the complexity of insulin action at the gene level, it is important to delineate the actual contribution of the regulatory sequences in several promoters to identify common themes in signaling by this hormone. The purpose of this study was to examine the molecular mechanism underlying insulin-inhibited expression of ALAS and to establish the main regulatory elements and transcription factors that determine insulin responsiveness in the ALAS gene. Our results show the presence of a functional binding site for the transcription factor HNF3 and a putative response sequence for NF1 in the proximal ALAS promoter. Both transcription factors appear to be necessary to achieve complete basal ALAS expression, although NF1 would need the presence of the HNF3 factor. In addition to the transcription factor-binding sites, this region includes an IRE-like sequence, localized at position –383 to –389 bp, overlapping the HNF3 site in an inverted orientation. Mutation of IRE is required to abrogate the insulin effect. From the data reported in this paper, it is apparent that insulin could interfere with HNF3 and NF1 binding or transactivation potential necessary, but not sufficient, to mediate its negative effect on ALAS gene transcription. Likewise, the participation of an unknown IRE-dependent binding inhibitory factor on ALAS promoter is hypothesized. These results provide a potential mechanism for the insulin-mediated repression of IRE-containing genes. Expression Vectors—The following expression vectors were used as indicated in each experiment.

Plasmid pCEFL containing the β-galactosidase gene and puroBABE vector, which conveys resistance to puromycin, were also used. Plasmid Generation—The plasmid p4XCRECAT contains four CRE sites from the somatostatin gene cloned into the HindIII-XbaI site of the pBLCAT2 vector (provided by Dr. P. Sassone-Corsi, Institut de Génetique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France). The plasmid pALIRE, containing the hepatic rat ALAS promoter fragment –459/–354 downstream of CRE sites, was created from pACAT vector by digestion with PstI and AflII. The purified fragment as well as the BamHI 4XCRECAT digested vector were blunt-ended with Klenow fragment and ligated by using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The pALIREinv contains the same 106-bp fragment from the ALAS promoter cloned in the inverted direction. Oligonucleotides of –459/–354 fragment truncations, containing promoter region –459 to –420 (5′-GCATCTCTTCACCAGGACCATTCTATTCTTGGGCCATTCA), or –419 to –380 of the ALAS gene (5′-TCAAGTAAAGAATCCCTGTCATCGATGCAAACAAAACCAA) or mutated versions of the latter sequence, 5′-TCAAGTAAAGAATCCCTGTCATCGATGCAAACAATAGCAA, in which underlined bases have been mutated to disrupt a putative IRE sequence, and 5′-TCAAGTAAAGAATCCCTGTCATCGCGGCCCCCAAAACCAA-3′, in which underlined bases have been mutated to disrupt the HNF3-like binding site, were cloned into the BamHI site of p4XCRECAT to generate pALIRE I, pALIRE II, pALIREm II, and pALIREmHs II, respectively. The fidelity of all generated plasmids was checked by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was grown as monolayers in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamax (Invitrogen), and 100 mm Hepes. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the same additions. Both cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient Transfections and CAT Assay—All plasmids used for transfection assays were isolated from Escherichia coli strain DH5α and purified using the Wizard Maxiprep kit (Promega), and the DNA concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically. Transient transfections were described previously in detail (15Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Scassa M.E. Varone C.L. Montero L.E. Cánepa E.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 2.5 ml of medium. After a 24-h attachment period, transfections were performed according to the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Each well was transfected with a mixture containing 4 μg of pACAT or its derivatives and 6.5 μg of pCEFLβgal along with the plasmids indicated in each experiment. The amount of DNA used for transfection was kept constant in all the samples by varying the amount of nonspecific DNA carrier. Control transfections with carrier alone and carrier plus vector pBLCAT6 or p4XTRECAT were performed in parallel. After 16 h, the medium was replaced with 2.5 ml of serum-free medium, and cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or in the absence of 10 nm insulin and/or the additions indicated in each experiment. As indicated in some of the experiments, 200 nm wortmannin and/or 10 μm PD98059 were added 30 min prior to insulin addition. Wortmannin was replenished twice during the incubation. Analysis of CAT and β-galactosidase activities were performed in cell extracts as described previously (15Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Scassa M.E. Varone C.L. Montero L.E. Cánepa E.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), according to Seed and Sheen (24Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) phase extraction assay for CAT activity. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed as A420 × μg of protein–1 h–1. CAT activity was expressed as the amount of radiolabeled chloramphenicol acetylated by 1 mg of protein in 1 min and normalized for equal transfection efficiency with β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was not modified by any of the treatments used. Antisense and Double-stranded Oligodeoxynucleotides Studies— HNF3 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-CGGCTCGTGCCCTTCCATCTTCAC-3′), corresponding to codons 5–12 of human HNF3β mRNA (25Navas M.A. Vaisse C. Boger S. Heimesaat M. Kollee L.A. Stoffel M. Hum. Hered. 2000; 50: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and NF1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-CAGTGCCTCGATGAACGGGTGGAA-3′), complementary to codons 4–11 of human NF1 mRNA (26Sumner C. Shinohara T. Durham L. Traub R. Major E.O. Amemiya K. J. Neurovirol. 1996; 2: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), were designed to block synthesis of these proteins. The HNF3 and NF1 sense oligodeoxynucleotides were used as controls. Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide representing the consensus sequence for PEPCK HNF3 (5′-GCCCATTGTTTGTTTTAAGCC-3′) (27Wang J. Stafford J. Scott D. Sutherland C. Granner D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide representing the consensus sequence for NF1 (5′-GGCACCTGTTTCAATTTGGCACGGAGCCAACAG-3′) or mutated versions for HNF3 (5′-GCCCATTGGGCCATTTAAGCC-3′) and NF1 (5′-GGCACCTGTTTCAATTTGTTACGGATTCAACAG-3′) in which underlined bases have been mutated, were used in competition experiments. To study the effects of oligodeoxynucleotides on CAT expression, transfected HepG2 cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing 2 μm of the indicated oligodeoxynucleotide. After 12 h media were removed and replaced by fresh media containing oligodeoxynucleotides. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated from transfected and cultured HepG2 and HeLa cells according to Chomczinsky and Sacchi (28Chomczinsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 71: 341-350Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Both cell lines were cotranfected with 2 μg of pCMV-HNF3β or 2 μg of pCMV-CTF/NF1 along with 1 μg of puroBABE. Puromycin (Sigma) (2.5 μg/ml) was added 24 h after transfection. Resistant clones were harvested 72 h later. Twenty four hours before harvesting, the cells were placed in serum-free medium and incubated with or without insulin for the last 8 h. Insulin concentration was 10 nm for HepG2 cells and 1 μm for HeLa cells. The yield and purity of RNA samples were assessed by absorbance at 260 nm and the ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, respectively. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was denatured, electrophoresed in 1% glyoxal/agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were sequentially hybridized with 32P-labeled probes to ALAS, HNF3β, NF1-X, and β-tubulin. To detect ALAS mRNA, a 26-mer oligodeoxynucleotide was synthesized complementary to bases +328 to +353 of human hepatic ALAS mRNA (29Bishop D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7187-7188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To detect HNF3 mRNA, a 24-mer oligodeoxynucleotide was synthesized complementary to bases +13 to +36 of human HNF3 mRNA (25Navas M.A. Vaisse C. Boger S. Heimesaat M. Kollee L.A. Stoffel M. Hum. Hered. 2000; 50: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The resulting probe had a specific activity of about 4–6 × 103 cpm/fmol. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 70 °C in the same prehybridization solution by adding the 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide (3.0 × 105 cpm/cm2) as described previously (30Varone C.L. Giono L.E. Ochoa A. Zakin M.M. Cánepa E.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To detect β-tubulin mRNA or NF1 mRNA, β-tubulin or NF1-X cDNA was labeled by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow to a specific activity of about 4–6 × 108 cpm/μg. Membranes were stripped, prehybridized, hybridized, and washed in standard conditions described by Sambrook and Russell (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 7.42-7.45Google Scholar). The membranes were then exposed to x-ray film or scanned directly onto a Bio-Imaging Analyzer Fujifilm LAS-1000 and quantified. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—HepG2 cells were plated in 9-cm culture plates at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells in 9 ml of medium. After 24 h of incubation in serum-free medium, the cells were treated with 10 nm insulin for 15, 30, or 60 min and then harvested. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Andrews and Faller (32Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 496-503Crossref Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). The double-stranded DNA probes and unlabeled competitors used were ALIRE II (fragment –419/–380 from ALAS promoter), a mutant version of ALIRE II called ALIREm II, in which bases at –385 and –383 have been mutated to disrupt a putative IRE sequence and HNF3 5′-GCACTAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACACG, containing the consensus sites for wild type HNF3 (33Shimizu S. Miyamoto Y. Hayashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) transcription factor. To generate radioactive probes, the sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed and labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (222 Tbq/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) as described before (15Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed by mixing 10 μg of nuclear extract with 3 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and 100,000 cpm of the labeled probe in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) in a 20-μl final volume. The reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For competition assays, 50–200-fold excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were mixed 20 min prior to the addition of labeled probes. After the binding reactions, the samples were directly loaded onto a 5% (w/v) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× TBE (1× TBE: 50 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). The gel was pre-electrophoresed at 100 V for 1 h in the cold room, and electrophoresis was performed at 180 V for 3 h in 0.25× TBE. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed by exposing overnight to Kodak XAR-5 films with an intensifying screen at –70 °C. Oligodeoxynucleotides were chemically synthesized by Bio-Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The supershift analyses were performed by incubating the nuclear extract with 3 μl of specific antibody at 4 °C overnight, prior to band-shift assays as described previously. Antibody against HNF3β was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Southwestern and Western Blotting Procedures—Southwestern blotting was based on the procedure described by Dong et al. (34Dong Y. Asch H. Ying A. Asch B. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (75–100 μg) from HepG2 cells were loaded in duplicate onto an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was cut in two. One-half was subjected to Southwestern blotting and the other half to Western blotting. For Southwestern blotting, membrane-bound proteins were allowed to renature in hybridization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% of non-fat dry milk) for 3 h at room temperature. The membrane was then rinsed twice with the hybridization buffer containing 0.25% non-fat dry milk. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose was hybridized with the end-labeled probe (107 cpm) in 25 ml of hybridization buffer containing 0.25% non-fat dry milk and 250 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) overnight at room temperature. The filter was washed five times (10 min each) with hybridization solution containing 0.25% non-fat dry milk, dried, and exposed overnight to x-ray film or scanned directly onto a Bio-Imaging Analyzer Fujifilm LAS-1000 and quantified. For Western blot, membrane-bound proteins were probed with polyclonal anti-rabbit anti-HNF3β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The antibody was detected by using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), visualized by the Pierce Super Signal Ultra Chemiluminescence signaling system and a PhosphorImager FujiFilm LAS-1000. Data Analysis—Most of the experiments were carried out at least three times. All transfection studies were performed at least in four separate experiments, in which duplicate dishes were transfected. All data were expressed as means ± S.E. When statistical analysis was performed, data were compared by the paired Student's t test, and p values below 0.05 were considered significant. The –459/–354 Fragment Is Required for Insulin-mediated Inhibition of ALAS Promoter—We reported previously that the fragment between –833 and +42 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the ALAS gene is enough for basal expression and is able to confer insulin-mediated inhibition on ALAS promoter activity (18Scassa M.E. Varone C.L. Montero L.E. Cánepa E.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In order to identify specific sequences within this upstream region that are essential for insulin inhibition, the pACAT construct, containing the entire region, was deleted stepwise, and the resulting constructs were analyzed for CAT activity in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, deletion of the sequence between –833 and –459 did not significantly impair the insulin-inhibited promoter activity. Further deletion of the promoter from –459 to –354 completely abolished the regulatory effect of insulin. Subsequent deletions were no longer responsive to the hormone. These results strongly suggest that the region between –459 and –354 in the ALAS promoter contains essential elements that confer insulin responsiveness. It is important to note that there were no significant differences in the basal expression of the ALAS/CAT fusion gene among the deletion mutants tested, except for pAΔ38CAT, in which CAT activity fell to values 50% lower than those of the entire promoter. We next analyzed whether other sequences on the ALAS promoter, adjacent to the –459/–354 fragment, although not sufficient, would be required to exert full insulin responsiveness. Previous studies (15Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Guberman A.S. Scassa M.E. Giono L.E. Varone C.L. Cánepa E.T. J.

Other factors, like C/EBP, are predicted to bind to the proximal 459 bp in the ALAS gene 5′-flanking reg"
https://openalex.org/W2062773382,"The carB operon encodes all except one of the enzymes involved in light-induced carotenogenesis in Myxococcus xanthus. Expression of its promoter (PB) is repressed in the dark by sequence-specific DNA binding of CarA to a palindrome (pI) located between positions –47 and –64 relative to the transcription start site. This promotes subsequent binding of CarA to additional sites that remain to be defined. CarS, produced in the light, interacts physically with CarA, abrogates CarA-DNA binding, and thereby derepresses PB. In this study, we delineate the operator design that exists for CarA by precisely mapping out the second operator element. For this, we examined how stepwise deletions and site-directed mutagenesis in the region between the palindrome and the transcription start site affect CarA binding around PB in vitro and expression of PB in vivo. These revealed the second operator element to be an imperfect interrupted palindrome (pII) spanning positions –26 to –40. In vitro assays using purified M. xanthus RNA polymerase showed that CarA abolishes PB-RNA polymerase binding and runoff transcription and that both were restored by CarS, thus rationalizing the observations in vivo. CarA binding to pII (after association with pI) effectively occludes RNA polymerase from PB and so provides the operative mechanism for the repression of the carB operon by CarA. The bipartite operator design, whereby transcription is blocked by the low affinity CarA-pII binding and is readily restored by CarS, may have evolved to match the needs for a rapid and an effective response to light.

Bacteria typically adapt to changing environmental conditions by switching on or off the expression of specific subsets of genes. Transcription initiation is the principal stage at which bacterial gene expression is regulated (for review, see Refs. 1Rojo F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2987-2991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Lloyd G. Landini P. Busby S. Essays Biochem. 2001; 37: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Initiation of transcription at a given promoter is a multistep process that begins with the recognition of the promoter by RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MxRNAP, M. xanthus RNAP; PB, carB promoter. holoenzyme guided at this step by specific σ factors. The “closed” binary complex formed by the initial binding of RNAP to the promoter is then stabilized by local DNA melting to form an “open” complex. In the presence of the four ribonucleotides, an initial transcribing complex is formed that eventually leaves the promoter as a productive elongation complex. Any of these steps in transcription initiation can be targeted for negative regulation by specific transcription factors. In the classical sense, phage repressors such as those of λ and 434 (3Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch: Gene Control and Phage λ. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Cambridge, MA1986Google Scholar), or the Escherichia coli lac repressor (see Ref. 4Schlax P.J. Capp M.W. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), bind to operator sites that overlap the RNAP recognition elements. Repressor-operator binding can therefore serve as a physical block to RNAP-promoter binding as long as the operator binding affinity of the repressor exceeds that of RNAP for its promoter. Variations on this theme include binding to a site outside the promoter region, which then favors the propagation of multiply bound repressor complexes that come to occupy regions within the promoter and thereby occlude RNAP (5Lee Y.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the repressor may alter the DNA structure in a manner that makes the promoter refractory to RNAP binding (6Rojo F. Salas M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3429-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Choy H. Adhya S. Neidhardt F. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 1. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1287-1299Google Scholar). Transcription initiation can nevertheless be impaired at a step after closed complex formation. This is usually achieved by repressors that coexist with RNAP on DNA and whose binding sites may or may not overlap. Examples include repressors that interfere with the isomerization to the open complex (8O′Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of light-induced carotenogenesis in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus is the focus of our work. Blue light switches on a regulatory cascade in M. xanthus that culminates in the synthesis of carotenoids, a major class of pigments that protect cells against photo-oxidative damage (13Hodgson D.A. Murillo F.J. Dworkin M. Kaiser D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1993: 157-181Google Scholar). The known circuits in the light-induced carotenogenesis in M. xanthus are schematically shown in Fig. 1. The carB operon constitutes one of two distinct genetic loci (the other being the unlinked crtI) involved in expressing the enzymes required for carotenoid synthesis. Six of these enzymes are encoded by this operon and only one by crtI (14Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Fontes M. Murillo F.J. Mol.

The carQRS locus is a key regulatory operon that encodes three proteins with low, basal levels of expression in the dark: the extracytoplasmic function σ-factor CarQ (18Gorham H.C. McGowan S.J.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 801-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29McGowan S.J. Gorham H.C. Hodgson D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 713-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the dark, carB is repressed by the sequence-specific binding of CarA to a DNA stretch that includes an interrupted palindrome located upstream of the carB promoter (PB) (22López-Rubio J.J.

Illumination leads to an increase in the levels of CarS, which physically interacts with CarA, and thereby dismantles the CarA·DNA complex to cause derepression of carB (21Whitworth D.E. Hodgson D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol.

Our previous study identified the palindrome that is present upstream of PB (between positions –47 and –64 relative to the transcription start point) as an essential element of the CarA operator. We had also presented evidence that binding to this palindrome somehow aided CarA in reaching out to additional sites that lie within PB, but the details of this remained to be elucidated. In this study we delineate the operator design employed by the M. xanthus CarA repressor and examine how the repression of the carB operon is brought about. The additional elements that constitute the CarA operator were sought by systematic truncations and site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA probe used in CarA·DNA binding assays in vitro. The consequences of the specific mutations in the operator region on carB expression in vivo were also investigated. Furthermore, we studied the molecular basis for the CarA-mediated down-regulation of PB using purified M. xanthus RNAP (MxRNAP) in DNA binding and runoff transcription assays in vitro and how this was affected by CarS. Based on these we define all of the CarA operator elements and provide a mechanistic model for how CarA may repress carB expression. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The wild-type M. xanthus strain used in this study was DK1050 (30Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Murillo F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 818-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. xanthus cells were grown in the rich medium casitone-Tris (31Bretscher A.P. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 763-768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid constructions, BL21(DE3) (pLysS) for protein overexpression, and Luria broth as the growth medium (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Overexpression and Purification of His-tagged CarA and CarS— Plasmid constructs for overexpressing His6-tagged CarA and CarS, their overexpression, purification, and concentration determination have been described previously (22López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). His6-CarS was expressed as a soluble protein and purified under native conditions. A small amount of the partially soluble His6-CarA was purified under native conditions, but most was purified under denaturing solution conditions followed by renaturation. Both His6-CarA preparations gave identical results when examined separately; the fraction used in the in vitro assays described here was the one purified under native conditions. Purification of M. xanthus RNA Polymerase—M. xanthus strain DK1050 was grown to mid-log phase in casitone-Tris medium, and the cells (∼5 g wet weight/liter of culture) were collected by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were frozen at –70 °C before being used. The MxRNAP holoenzyme was purified under ice-cold conditions using a modification of the protocol described by Rudd and Zusman (33Rudd K.E. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 89-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen cells (∼29 g wet weight) were broken with alumina (∼2 g/g cell pellet) in a minimal amount of grinding buffer (buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) plus 0.35 m NaCl) and 0.1 ml each of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysed cells were suspended in 180 ml of grinding buffer and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove alumina. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 15 min, and the process was repeated to obtain the final debris-free supernatant. The latter was mixed with polyethyleneimine to a final concentration of 0.3%, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged (17,500 × g, 15 min). The polyethyleneimine pellet was washed with 56 ml of buffer A containing 1 m NaCl, 0.04% polyethyleneimine, and the above protease inhibitor mix, incubated, and centrifuged as before, and the pellet was subjected to a second 28-ml wash with the same solution. The washes were pooled and processed by stepwise ammonium sulfate precipitation at 58%, 47.5%, and finally 35%. Proteins were recovered from the 35% ammonium sulfate supernatant by raising it to 60% ammonium sulfate. This last pellet was resuspended in buffer A to a final salt concentration of 0.25 m (estimated by conductivity measurements) and loaded onto a 17-ml heparin column preequilibrated with buffer A plus 0.25 m NaCl. To the column was then applied ∼5–7 times its volume of buffer A containing 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing MxRNAP (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, diluted with an equal volume of buffer A, and applied to a 12-ml double-stranded DNA-cellulose column preequilibrated with buffer A containing 0.25 m NaCl and eluted with 0.6 m NaCl. Fractions containing MxRNAP were pooled, precipitated with ammonium sulfate, resuspended in buffer A containing 50% glycerol, and stored at –70 °C. Western blots employing polyclonal antibodies raised against the Bacillus subtilis RNAP holoenzyme were used to verify that the purified MxRNAP holoenzyme contained the major M. xanthus vegetative σA (80 kDa; apparent size of 105 kDa), α (43 kDa) and β/β′ subunits (at ∼150 kDa). The presence of σA was further confirmed using B. subtilis polyclonal anti-σ-43 antibodies (34Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 80-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Biran D. Kroos L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The final MxRNAP concentration estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay was 3.5 μg/μl. Gel Mobility Shift and DNase I Footprinting Assays—PCRs with one of the two primers radiolabeled at the 5′-end were carried out to generate the DNA probes (22López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Probes with specific mutations were obtained by the PCR overlap extension method (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Binding was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 200 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as non-specific competitor, ∼1nm end-labeled double-stranded probe (∼13,000 cpm), and the indicated amounts of proteins. In reactions containing both CarA and MxRNAP, the DNA probe was preincubated with CarA at 37 °C for 30 min, then MxRNAP was added and incubation continued for an additional 30 min, unless otherwise stated. When CarS was also present, it was added simultaneously with CarA. Reactions were loaded onto 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 37.5:1) pre-run at 200 V/10 °C for 30 min in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA), and electrophoresed for 1–1.5hat 200 V/10 °C. Gels were vacuum dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Experimental conditions for DNase I footprinting matched those used for the gel shift assays. After incubation at 37 °C of the indicated DNA probe and protein(s), the mix was treated with 0.07 unit of DNase I for 2 min at 37 °C and then quenched with EDTA. DNA was ethanol-precipitated and run in 8 m urea and 8% or –6% polyacrylamide gels against G+A and C+T chemical sequencing ladders of the DNA probe used. In Vitro Runoff Transcription—In vitro transcription reactions employed MxRNAP holoenzyme and CCR209 as template DNA. Transcription was carried out in a total reaction volume of 30 μl containing 0.5 nm CCR209, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 20 units of Protector RNase inhibitor (Roche), and 32 nm MxRNAP. When CarA was included (with or without CarS), it was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with CCR209 prior to the addition of MxRNAP, followed by a further 15-min incubation at 30 °C. Transcription was then initiated by adding ATP, CTP, and GTP to 400 μm each, UTP to 20 μm, [α-32P]UTP to 0.42 μm, in the presence of 50 μg/ml rifampicin to prevent reinitiation of transcription (33Rudd K.E. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 89-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 15 min and then quenched with EDTA (final concentration 25 mm). Unincorporated nucleotides were eliminated by two successive ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitations. The precipitated products were analyzed by 8 m urea and 6% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. In Vivo Analysis of Mutations in the PB Promoter Region—Plasmid pMAR191 contains the CCR130 DNA segment fused to a transcriptional lacZ probe. A 1.5-kb M. xanthus DNA fragment in pMAR191 serves as target for plasmid integration into the chromosome by homologous recombination (22López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). pMAR191 also harbors a kanamycin resistance marker for positive selection. Site-directed mutagenesis by the PCR overlap extension method (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) was employed to generate plasmids pMR2672 (with CCR130-DMUT3) and pMR2854 (with CCR130-pI-Imut1). The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pMAR191, or its variants pMR2672 and pMR2854, were introduced into M. xanthus by electroporation. Integration of the plasmid was selected for on casitone-Tris plates containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin. The effects of specific mutations in CCR130 were monitored qualitatively on casitone-Tris plates containing 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and quantitated by measurements of β-galactosidase activity as described previously (37Balsalobre J.M. Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Murillo F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2359-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Binding of CarA to the 130-bp carB Promoter Operator Probe and Its Fragments with 3′-End Truncations—All of the cis-acting elements essential for the correct regulation and expression of the carB promoter in vivo were shown to be located within a 130-bp segment spanning positions –102 to +28 relative to the transcription start site (22López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also determined that purified CarA binds to this 130-bp DNA fragment (CCR130; see Table I) in vitro to form two complexes in a concentration-dependent manner. At low CarA concentrations, a single retarded band was observed in gel shift assays, which in DNase I footprinting correlated with the protein being bound to an interrupted palindrome, pI, situated between positions –64 and –47 (footprint from position –70 to –41). With increasing CarA concentration, a second gel-retarded band appeared and became the predominant one at the highest protein concentrations used, and the DNase I footprint extended further downstream to around position –19. This second band was not observed with a shorter 64-bp DNA probe (CCR64), which lacks 66 bp starting from the 3′-end of CCR130 (22López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This indicated that besides pI, additional CarA operator elements must exist in the DNA stretch which includes the –35 region and at least part of the –10 region of the carB promoter. Sequence analysis of the 130-bp segment highlighted two direct repeats (Table I; 22López-Rubio J.J. Elías-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One of these (D1) partially overlaps with pI; the second (D2) lies between the –11 and the –21 positions, and so within the segment that should include the second CarA operator element (see Fig. 2A and Table I). A precedent for such an arrangement of operator elements had been reported for the dra-nupC-pdp operon in B. subtilis (38Zeng X. Saxild H.H. J.

The \p-n-\10 and \p-n-\35 promoter elements are in boldface. The CarA operator elements pI (\p-n-\64 to \p-n-\47) and pII (\p-n-\40 to \p-n-\26) are underlined and marked with solid arrows.

Positions \p-n-\10, \p-n-\40, and \p-n-\70 are highlighted on top of the CCR209 sequence. Mutations are indicated in lowercase. To define whether D2 (positioned between the –10 and –35 promoter regions) constitutes the second operator element, CCR130 was systematically truncated from its 3′-end to yield the following probes (see Fig. 2A and Table I): (i) CCR98, a 98-bp DNA fragment that retains D2 plus an additional 6 bp downstream; (ii) CCR87, an 87-bp DNA fragment where D2 is partially truncated; and (iii) CCR81, an 81-bp DNA fragment that completely lacks D2. As with CCR130, two gel-retarded bands were observed for CarA binding to CCR98, with the lower mobility one predominating at higher CarA concentrations (Fig. 2B). Thus, the second operator element is still present in CCR98. Similar results were obtained with the CCR87 probe, indicating that at least half of D2 can be eliminated without any noticeable effect on CarA·DNA complex formation (Fig. 2C). By contrast, with complete removal of D2 as in probe CCR81, primarily one retarded band was observed (Fig. 2D). However, the smearing out of the single band obtained with CCR81 at the highest CarA concentration, and not observed previously when CCR64 was used, indicates a tendency to form the second complex even in the complete absence of D2. This suggests, but does not prove on its own, that D2 may not be the second operator element. The inefficient formation of the lower mobility complex with CCR81 could then result from only partial removal of an as yet unidentified operator element. Alternatively, the second binding site could still be fully present in CCR81 but located too close to the 3′-end of the probe for a stable CarA-DNA interaction to occur. Mutational Analysis of the Downstream Direct Repeat—To investigate further the possibility that D2 is the second CarA operator element, we complemented the results obtained with the 3′-end truncated probes described in the previous section by resorting to site-directed mutagenesis. In designing the specific changes we considered D2 as consisting of two parts. One part would correspond to the first 4 bp that are identical in the two direct repeats. This part is immediately followed by a stretch of 6 bp that in the case of the upstream direct repeat D1 also constitutes the 3′-half of the palindrome pI, but differs at two positions in D2. Table I shows the specific mutations that were introduced in D2 to generate the CCR130-DMUT2 probe (which bears changes affecting the first 4 bp) and the CCR130-DMUT3 probe (which has been altered in the region that resembles the pI half-site). In the gel shift assay of Fig. 3A, the behavior of CCR130-DMUT3 at two different CarA concentrations matches that of the wild-type CCR130 probe, further reinforcing the idea that the second operator element does not map to this direct repeat. To confirm that the apparently wild-type behavior of CCR130-DMUT3 in vitro correlates with normal operator activity in vivo, regulation of the carB promoter was assessed using a lacZ transcriptional probe fused to CCR130-DMUT3 (plasmid pMR2672, see “Experimental Procedures”). The M. xanthus wild-type strain DK1050 was electroporated with pMR2672, and electroporants having integrated the plasmid via homologous recombination were selected for on plates containing kanamycin. Several kanamycin-resistant electroporants were picked, and their β-galactosidase activity was compared with that of a control strain bearing the wild-type 130-bp fragment fused to the lacZ probe.

We found previously that an element in the proximal promoter region of CYP2A3 (the nasal predominant transcriptional activating (NPTA) element), which is similar to a nuclear factor 1 (NFI)-binding site, is critical for transcriptional activation of CYP2A3 in vitro. We proposed that this element might be important for tissue-selective CYP2A3 expression. The goals of the present study were to characterize NPTA-binding proteins and to obtain more definitive evidence for the role of NFI in the transcriptional activation of CYP2A3. The NPTA-binding proteins were isolated by DNA-affinity purification from rat olfactory mucosa. Mass spectral analysis indicated that isoforms corresponding to all four NFI genes were present in the purified NPTA-binding fraction. Further analysis of NPTA-binding proteins led to the identification of a novel NFI-A isoform, NFI-A-short, which was derived from alternative splicing of the NFI-A transcript. Transient transfection assay showed that NFI-A2, an NFI isoform previously identified in the olfactory mucosa, transactivated the CYP2A3 promoter, whereas NFI-A-short, which lacks the transactivation domain, counteracted the activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that NFI proteins are associated with the CYP2A3 promoter in vivo, in rat olfactory mucosa, but essentially not in the liver where the CYP2A3 promoter is hypermethylated and CYP2A3 is not expressed. These data strongly support a role for NFI transcription factors in the transcriptional activation of CYP2A3.

For example, enzymes of the CYP2A subfamily metabolize xenobiotic compounds such as coumarin, aflatoxin B1, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, nicotine, and cotinine and endogenous compounds such as testosterone, progesterone, and other steroid hormones (1Ding X.

Several members of the CYP2A subfamily, including rat CYP2A3, mouse Cyp2a5, rabbit CYP2A10, and human CYP2A13, are expressed preferentially in the respiratory tract with the most abundant expression in the olfactory mucosa (OM) (4Ding X. Dahl A.R. Doty R.L. Handbook of Olfaction and Gustation. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2003: 51-73Google Scholar). The tissue-selective expression of these enzymes is believed to play an important role in the tissue-specific toxicity of numerous xenobiotic compounds in the respiratory tract (1Ding X. Kaminsky L.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 149-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 4Ding X. Dahl A.R. Doty R.L. Handbook of Olfaction and Gustation.

Hao B. Miao X. Zhou G. He F. Lin D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8057-8061PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate the basal expression and the tissue selectivity of the CYP2A genes are not clear. Previously, we identified a conserved DNA element (named the nasal predominant transcriptional activating element, or NPTA element) in the rat CYP2A3 promoter that interacted with OM-enriched proteins (6Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The NPTA element, which is similar to the nuclear factor 1 (NFI)-binding sites (7Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), was crucial for the activity of the CYP2A3 promoter in vitro. The NPTA-binding proteins have not been fully characterized, but in vitro studies showed that at least some of the NPTA-binding complexes are recognized by an antibody to NFI (8Zhang J. Zhang Q.-Y. Guo J. Zhou Y. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8895-8902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There are four NFI genes in mammals, NFI-A, -B, -C, and -X, from which numerous NFI isoforms are generated through alternative splicing or alternative promoter usage. NFI proteins are highly conserved in the amino-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domains, whereas the carboxyl termini contain diverse transactivation/repression domains (7Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). NFI isoforms are thought to be involved in the regulation of developmental and tissue-specific gene expression (7Gronostajski R.M.

The expression of the NFI genes in the OM has been studied using molecular cloning and in situ hybridization; all four NFI genes are expressed in the OM (14Baumeister H. Gronostajski R.M. Lyons G.E. Margolis F.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Behrens M. Venkatraman G. Gronostajski R.M. Reed R.R. Margolis F.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1372-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the identities of the specific isoforms have not been determined, with the exception of NFI-A2, which is a recently identified NFI isoform that is detected in the OM (14Baumeister H. Gronostajski R.M. Lyons G.E. Margolis F.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Xie Y. Madelian V. Zhang J. Ling G. Ding X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Most interesting, we found that NFI-A2 was capable of activating a reporter construct containing the NPTA element in yeast one-hybrid assays (16Xie Y. Madelian V. Zhang J. Ling G. Ding X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used DNA-affinity chromatography to isolate the CYP2A3 NPTA-binding proteins from rat OM for identification by immunoblot and mass spectral (MS) analyses. These efforts have confirmed NFI as the major NPTA-binding proteins and have led to the identification of a novel NFI-A isoform, named NFI-A-short, that has a truncated transactivation/repression domain. The tissue distribution of NFI-A-short and the levels of NFI-A2, NFI-A-short, and total NFI-A mRNAs were determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and the functions of the two NFI-A isoforms at the CYP2A3 promoter were analyzed by using transient transfection assays in cultured mammalian cells. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using rat liver and OM tissues demonstrated a tissue-selective association of NFI with the CYP2A3 promoter in vivo. In addition, the methylation status of the CYP2A3 promoter region in these two tissues was also compared, so as to derive a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of the tissue-specific interaction of the promoter with NFI. These studies provide compelling evidence for the in vivo role of NFI transcription factors in the expression of CYP2A3. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Heads of adult male Wistar rats (Harlen Bioproducts) were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after decapitation. Frozen rat heads were partially thawed at 4 °C before dissection of OM. Nuclear extract was prepared according to the protocol of Kudrycki et al. (17Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C. Grillo M. Akeson R. Margolis F.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as described previously, with a double-stranded NPTA element (6Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reporter Plasmid Construction, Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Reporter Assays—For the preparation of the CYP2A3-luciferase reporter gene construct, a 254-bp CYP2A3 proximal promoter region (–254 to +1), with either a wild-type (pGL2A3) or a mutated (pGL2A3M) NPTA element (6Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was inserted into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Expression vectors for NFI-A2 (pNFI-A2) and NFI-A-short (pNFI-A-short) were modified from the pCHNFI-A1.1 vector that has a cytomegalovirus promoter and the mouse NFI-A1 coding sequence (9Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). pNFI-A2 was prepared by replacement of the NFI-A1 sequence with NFI-A2, as a 1.6-kb NotI-KpnI fragment (16Xie Y. Madelian V. Zhang J. Ling G. Ding X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). pNFI-A-short was generated by replacement of the EcoRV-KpnI fragment of NFI-A1 with an ∼600-bp EcoRV-KpnI fragment of NFI-A-short; the mouse NFI-A1 sequence (NotI-EcoRV) that remained in the vector encodes the same amino acids as in rat NF1-A1. A vector with no NFI insert (pCMV), used as a control, was prepared by modification of pCHNFI-A1.1. All constructs were sequenced for confirmation of structural integrity. Human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells (HTB-36, ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs, NFI expression constructs, and a Renilla luciferase construct pRL-SV40 (Promega) were co-transfected into JEG-3 cells with use of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were done in duplicate using at least two different DNA preparations. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) was used for determination of the relative luciferase activities. Luminescence was measured using a luminometer (LB9501, Berthold). For each sample, the activity of the firefly luciferase was normalized by that of the Renilla luciferase. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP was performed as described (18Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), with modifications. Approximately 1 g of freshly dissected rat liver or OM from four rats was used for the preparation of chromatin. Tissues were minced on ice and transferred to 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a 50-ml tube, to which formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), for cross-linking of proteins to DNA. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min with constant rocking. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine. The tissues were collected by a brief spin, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1836153, Roche Applied Science) using a Dounce homogenizer (type A pestle, 10 strokes). The dissociated cells were filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and collected by spinning at 2000 × g for 10 min. Cells were washed with RSB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, supplemented with the Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture) and were incubated with cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at 4 °C. After incubation, the nuclei were collected by centrifugation and were resuspended in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2.5 mm PMSF, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. About 0.1 g of glass beads (G-1277, Sigma) were added to each tube, and the nuclei were sonicated on ice 20 times for 15 s each time, at 30% of maximum power, with a VibraCell ultrasonic processor (600 watts) equipped with a microtip (Sonics & Materials). Fragmented chromatin was separated from the glass beads and intact nuclei by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of chromatin suspension were stored at –80 °C until use. Sonicated chromatin, equivalent to ∼60 mg of tissue for each tube, was diluted to 1.5 ml with the IP buffer and was mixed at 4 °C for 2 h with 0.1 ml of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pretreated with 0.4 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After a brief centrifugation, two 0.7-ml aliquots of the supernatant were transferred to two new tubes, which were incubated overnight on a rotating platform with 3 μg of either normal rabbit IgG or the anti-NFI antibody H300 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The H300 antibody is against the conserved amino-terminal half of an NFI protein. The mixtures were then incubated with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by a brief centrifugation. An aliquot of the supernatant from the samples incubated with normal IgG was saved as the “input” chromatin. The pellets were washed twice with 1.4 ml of wash buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Sarkosyl, and 1 mm PMSF) and four times with 1.4 ml of wash buffer II (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, and 1 mm PMSF). The immobilized immune complexes were dissociated by incubating twice in 250 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 and 1% SDS) at room temperature for 15 min each. The cross-link was subsequently reversed by addition of NaCl to the eluted fractions to a final concentration of 300 mm and then heating at 68 °C for 6 h in the presence of 20 μg/ml RNase (Roche Applied Science, catalog number 1579681). DNA was then precipitated by ethanol, resuspended in 100 μl of PK buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% SDS, and 20 μg of proteinase K), and after a 1-h incubation at 45 °C, purified using QIAquick columns (Qiagen). RT-PCR—Real time quantitative PCR was performed using a Light-Cycler and the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). The reaction mixtures contained 2 μl of DNA templates, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm each of the primers, and 1 μl of 1× DNA Master SYBR Green I in a total volume of 10 μl. The following primers were used to quantitate the promoter fragments in immunoprecipitated samples: for CYP2A3, 5′-tccctgttaatctgtcatggag-3′ and 5′-tgggatgacagacacagtga-3′, amplifying –169 to +16 of the CYP2A3 promoter; for CYP1A2, 5′-tggaactgagggatcatggctt-3′ and 5′-aagctaaggtgggtccctgttt-3′, amplifying –142 to +140 of the CYP1A2 promoter; and for immunoglobulin-β (IgB), 5′-ttcaagtcctagcagaccag-3′ and 5′-agggtctggggcaaaacatg-3′, amplifying –173 to +5 of the IgB promoter (19Osano K. Ono M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2532-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The CYP2A3 and CYP1A2 PCR products include NFI-like elements, whereas the IgB PCR product (used as a negative control) does not. The annealing temperature for these primer pairs was 65 °C. Cycle numbers were used for calculation of the amounts of specific DNA sequences in the immunoprecipitated samples, relative to the amounts present in total input, as described previously (20Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Standard curves for quantitation were generated from serial dilutions of the input chromatin. Fold enrichment of a promoter fragment is the fold difference between its amount in the NFI antibody-precipitated DNA and its amount in the control IgG-precipitated DNA. Restriction Analysis of DNA Methylation—Genomic DNA from rat OM and liver (50 μg each) was digested overnight with SacI and PvuII, 250 units each, in a total volume of 100 μl. After confirmation of complete digestion, the DNA was precipitated by ethanol and was resuspended in water. The resuspended DNA was then divided into two aliquots, which were incubated overnight with 200 units of either HpaII (methylation-sensitive) or MspI (methylation-insensitive). After digestion, the enzymes were inactivated by heating at 65 °C, for 20 min, and the DNA fragments were detected on Southern blots, with a 2070-bp SacI-PvuII CYP2A3 promoter fragment as the probe. Other Methods—For SDS-PAGE, proteins were separated in 10% BisTris NuPage gels, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen), and detected using a Colloidal Blue kit or a SilverQuest silver staining kit from Invitrogen. Western blot analysis was carried out using an ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences), with use of the anti-NFI antibody (H300). RNA was prepared from adult Wistar rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories), with use of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end kit (Invitrogen) was used to clone the putative, short NFI isoforms, with an NFI-A genespecific primer (5′-ctgatggtgaacgccttgtg-3′) and the universal amplification primer. PCR products were gel-purified and then cloned into the TOPO XL vector (Invitrogen). Experimental procedures for the purification and MS analysis of NPTA-binding proteins and methods for RT-PCR quantification of NFI-A mRNAs are described in the Supplemental Material. Purification and Identification of NPTA-binding Proteins—We developed a two-step DNA-affinity chromatography scheme to identify proteins that bind to the NPTA element of CYP2A3 in rat OM. A DNA fragment containing 12 copies of the NPTA element was prepared and was used to generate NPTA-Sepharose and NPTA-Dynabead. Nuclear extract (∼100 mg of total protein, from ∼200 rat heads) was fractionated on a 1-ml NPTA-Sepharose column; bound proteins were eluted by increasing the KCl concentration stepwise, in 100 mm increments. Column fractions were analyzed for NPTA binding activity by EMSA. The highest activity was found in the 0.6 m KCl fraction (Fig. 1A). Additional clean-up steps before the NPTA-Sepharose column, either anion-exchange or cation-exchange column chromatography, did not improve yield (data not shown). Proteins in the 0.5–0.7 m KCl fractions were pooled and dialyzed to remove KCl and were further purified using NPTA-Dynabeads. Strong NPTA binding activity was recovered in the 0.6 m NaCl fraction (Fig. 1B). This fraction contained numerous proteins, most of which had molecular masses between 20 and 50 kDa (Fig. 1C). The sequence of the NPTA element is similar to sequences of known NFI-binding sites. Therefore, we suspected that the affinity-purified NPTA-binding proteins contain multiple NFI isoforms. Indeed, NFI proteins were highly enriched in the 0.6 m NaCl fraction, as indicated by Western blot analysis using an anti-NFI antibody that recognizes all NFI isoforms (Fig. 1D). Proteins encoded by each of the four NFI genes were detected in the affinity-purified fractions, as indicated by the presence of peptides unique to each gene (Table I), although the peptides detected did not permit the distinction among specific NFI proteins of each type (such as NFI-A1 and NFI-A2). However, data from MS analysis did not indicate the presence of any other known transcription factors, which suggested that the NFI proteins are the major NPTA-binding proteins. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the unique NFI-A peptides was 2–8-fold greater than the abundance of peptides of the other NFI proteins in three independent experiments (data not shown), suggesting that, in rat OM, NFI-A is the most abundant among the four types of NFI proteins. Also of note, various peptides derived from NFI-A were found with either unmodified or phosphorylated serines at residues 191 and 193. Moreover, all of the NFI-related peptides identified in the affinity-purified fractions were from the 30-kDa NH2-terminal half of full-length NFI proteins, as shown in Fig. 1E for peptides that correspond to an NFI-A isoform.Table INFI gene-specific peptides detected in affinity-purified NPTA-binding proteins of rat OMGeneGenBank™ accession numberNFI gene-specific peptides detected by MS analysisNFI-ABAA11203AVKDELLSEKPEVK, DELLSEKPEVK, DIRPEYREDFVLTVTGKNFI-BAAF23586AVKDELLSEKPEIKNFI-CAAF23587EDFVLAVTGK, APGCVLSNPDQK, FVLAVTGKNFI-XBAA25295AVKDELLGEKPEIK, DIRPEFR, EDFVLTITGK Open table in a new tab Identification of A Novel NFI-A Isoform That Contains Truncated Activation/Repression Domain—The absence of any peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal portion of the identified NFI proteins suggested that proteolysis was occurring during purification, although efforts had been made to minimize protein degradation. However, this finding also suggested the possible occurrence of unidentified, shorter NFI isoform(s) corresponding to the ∼30-kDa proteins detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of both the purified fraction and OM nuclear extract. NFI isoforms with truncated carboxyl-terminal activation/repression domains have been reported in other species (7Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 21Grunder A. Qian F. Ebel T.T. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Kruse U. Sippel A.E. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 304: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To detect mRNAs encoding putative, short NFI isoforms, we performed 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end experiments with rat OM RNA and primers specific for NFI-A. Several cDNA clones with sequences corresponding to a novel, short NFI-A isoform (designated NFI-A-short; GenBank™ accession number AY572794) were isolated. A full-length NFI-A-short cDNA (∼0.9 kb) was subsequently obtained by RT-PCR, using OM RNA as template, with a primer corresponding to the 5′-end of NFI-A1 (GenBank™ accession number D78017) and an NFI-A-short-specific primer, derived from the putative 3′-untranslated region of the short mRNA. A comparison of the cDNA sequence of NFI-A-short with that of NFI-A1 revealed that the two sequences are identical, except that in NFI-A-short exon 5 was spliced to an alternative exon 6 (Fig. 2A), which encodes three amino acids followed by a stop codon (Fig. 2B). The resulting NFI-A-short protein (about 31 kDa) has an intact DNA binding and dimerization domain (encoded by exon 2) but lacks most of the transactivation/repression domain. Tissue distribution of NFI-A-short mRNA was determined using RT-PCR, with a forward primer derived from exon 5, and a reverse primer that is unique for NFI-A-short mRNA. The PCR product representing NFI-A-short mRNA (∼250 bp) was detected in RNA preparations from all rat tissues examined, including OM, lung, liver, brain, and kidney (Fig. 2C). In experiments not shown, the same primer pair amplified a 1.1-kb fragment from rat genomic DNA. This 1.1-kb PCR product contained an 865-bp intron sequence flanked by exons 5 and 6 of NFI-A-short. A comparison of the sequence of this PCR product with that of the rat NFI-A genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession number NW_043856) indicated that the new exon 6 in NFI-A-short is located at ∼5 kb upstream of the original exon 6 of the NFI-A gene (Fig. 2A). We did not detect a similar NFI-A-short in mice (data not shown), which indicated that this alternative splicing may be specific for rats. The relative mRNA levels of total NFI-A, NFI-A2, and NFI-A-short in rat OM, liver, lung, brain, and kidney were determined by using real time quantitative RT-PCR, with gene-specific or isoform-specific primers. As shown in Table II, of the five tissues, liver had the highest and lung had the lowest levels of total NFI-A mRNA. The expression level of NFI-A-short was low in all tissues examined (∼0.5–2% of total NFI-A mRNA). NFI-A2, which had been shown previously (16Xie Y. Madelian V. Zhang J. Ling G. Ding X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to be enriched in the OM, accounted for 2.7% of total NFI-A mRNA and was about twice as abundant as NFI-A-short in OM. The presumed low abundance of NFI-A-short and NFI-A2 proteins in the OM is consistent with our failure to detect the unique carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide of NFI-A-short and the unique amino-terminal tryptic peptide of NFI-A2 by MS analysis of total peptides derived from the affinity-purified OM NPTA-binding proteins.Table IIQuantitative analysis of NFI-A mRNA expression in various rat tissuesTissueTotal NFI-ANFI-A-shortNFI-A2copy number per 103 copies of β-actinOM27 ± 20.35 ± 0.050.72 ± 0.04aSignificantly higher than NFI-A-short; p < 0.01.Liver60 ± 170.59 ± 0.15NDbND, not determined and not detected in a previous study (16).Brain30 ± 70.15 ± 0.02NDLung7.7 ± 0.40.07 ± 0.01NDKidney14 ± 40.29 ± 0.10NDa Significantly higher than NFI-A-short; p < 0.01.b ND, not determined and not detected in a previous study (16Xie Y.

Open table in a new tab NFI-A2 and NFI-A-short Form Homo- and Heterodimers When Bound to the CYP2A3 Promoter—We transfected human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells with plasmids containing NFI-A2 or NFI-A-short cDNA to characterize further the abilities of NFI-A2 and NFI-A-short to bind to the NPTA element and the potential interactions between the two NFI proteins. The expression of NFI protein and the presence of NPTA binding activity in transfected cells were determined by immunoblot analysis (using an antibody that reacts with all NFI proteins) and by EMSA (using 32P-labeled NPTA element), respectively. Extracts of mock-transfected JEG-3 cells had low endogenous NFI proteins (Fig. 3A), and they had no detectable NPTA binding activity (Fig. 3B).

Here we report the affects of the C442Y mutation on the kinetics of the actomyosin ATP hydrolysis mechanism and motor function of myosin VI. The largest changes in the kinetic mechanism of ATP hydrolysis produced by the C442Y mutation are about 10-fold increases in the rate of ADP dissociation from both myosin VI and actomyosin VI. The rates of ADP dissociation from acto-C442Y myosin VI-ADP and C442Y myosin VI-ADP are 20–40 times more rapid than the steady state rates and cannot be the rate-limiting steps of the hydrolysis mechanism in the presence or absence of actin. The 2-fold increase in the actin gliding velocity of C442Y compared with wild type (WT) may be explained at least in part by the more rapid rate of ADP dissociation. The C442Y myosin VI has a significant increase (∼10-fold) in the steady state ATPase rate in the absence of actin relative to WT myosin VI. The steady state rate of actin-activated ATP hydrolysis is unchanged by the C442Y mutation at low (<10–7m) calcium but is calcium-sensitive with a 1.6-fold increase at high (∼10–4m) calcium that does not occur with WT. The actin gliding velocity of the C442Y mutant decreases significantly at low surface density of myosin VI, suggesting that the mutation hampers the processive movement of myosin VI.

Myosin is a motor protein that interacts with actin filaments and converts energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical activity. Among diverse myosin superfamily proteins, class VI myosins are identified in various organisms in the animal kingdom (1Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In mammals, myosin VI is found in various tissues, but its physiological significance is most recognized in the auditory system (5Friedman T.B. Sellers J.R. Avraham K.B. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 89: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mouse myosin VI gene was discovered to be responsible for deafness in the Snell's waltzer mice, which show the characteristic waltzing and circling behavior (6Avraham K.B. Hasson T. Steel K.P. Kingsley D.M. Russell L.B. Mooseker M.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Myosin VI is expressed in both the inner and outer hair cells of the inner ear and is localized in the pericuticular necklace, present between the cuticular plate and circumferential actin structures. The location suggests that myosin VI may be responsible for the maintenance of sensory hair cells. In Snell's walzer mice, the cochlea shows progressive loss of hair cells soon after birth (6Avraham K.B. Hasson T. Steel K.P. Kingsley D.M. Russell L.B. Mooseker M.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat.

Res. 1966; 8: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that myosin VI function is involved in the maintenance of sensory hair cells. These findings suggest that myosin VI may function to maintain the association of the cuticular plate with the stereocilia rootlets, which in turn stabilize the hair cells (8Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B. Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Although the functional deficiency of myosin VI mutation is most pronounced in auditory function, myosin VI is expressed in a variety of cell types. The location of class VI myosin in Drosophilia (Drosophila 95F myosin) in the cytoplasmic particles that move along microfilaments suggests that myosin VI is involved in the transport processes (9Bohrmann J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 652-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In polarized cells from the intestinal brush border, myosin VI is concentrated in the terminal web with a small amount in the microvilli (10Heintzelman M.B. Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3535-3543PubMed Google Scholar, 11Buss F. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and it has been suggested that myosin VI plays a role in the endocytosis process in polarized cells. Supporting this view, the defect is most pronounced in polarized cells in myosin VI knockout mice (Snell's waltzer mice) (12Self T. Sobe T. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Avraham K.B. Steel K.P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that myosin VI associates with clathrin-coated vesicles in polarized cells (11Buss F. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that myosin VI plays a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The myosin VI motor domain is located at the N-terminal head domain followed by a neck domain containing one IQ motif that binds a calmodulin light chain. A potential coiled-coil domain is present at the C-terminal side of the neck region, and so it is predicted that myosin VI is a two-headed myosin. Finally, a unique globular tail domain is present at the C-terminal end of the molecule that is thought to be a targeting domain that determines the cellular binding counterpart. Molecular characteristics of myosin VI motor function have been studied by using various techniques. The most important feature is that myosin VI moves processively (13Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L.

Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), which is opposite the direction of most other myosins (4Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar). Processive myosin motility was first found for myosin V (16Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 17Tanaka H. Homma K. Iwane A.H. Katayama E. Ikebe R. Saito J. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. Nature. 2002; 415: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and it is thought that processive myosins are more suitable for cargo movement in cells because they spend the majority of the cross-bridge cycle bound to actin (high duty ratio) and can therefore travel on actin filaments for a long distance without dissociation. Because the actin filaments in cells extend from the barbed end on the anchoring sites at the plasma membrane, these findings imply that myosin VI plays a role in cargo transport in cells from the cell surface toward the inside of the cell. The processive movement of myosin VI has been determined by direct visualization of the movement of single molecules on actin filaments with single molecule fluorescence microscopy and by mechanical assay with optical trap nanometry. This shows that successive multiple steps of single myosin VI molecules on actin filaments occur before dissociation (13Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 14Nishikawa S. Homma K. Komori Y. Iwaki M. Wazawa T. Hikikoshi Iwane A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Katayama E. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The processive nature of myosin VI is also supported by the enzyme kinetic analysis of the actomyosin VI ATPase reaction (18De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and it was found that ADP release from actomyosin VI was the slowest measured kinetic step of the actomyosin VI ATPase reaction. Myosin VI-ADP has a high affinity for actin, therefore, myosin VI spends a majority of the time bound to actin during the cross-bridge cycle. Whereas myosin VI has been known to be responsible for deafness in mice, it has been obscure as to whether the myosin VI is linked to human hereditary hearing loss. Quite recently, it was found that the myosin VI gene is mutated in human autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (19Melchionda S. Ahituv N. Bisceglia L. Sobe T. Glaser F. Rabionet R. Arbones M.L. Notarangelo A. Di Iorio E. Carella M. Zelante L. Estivill X. Avraham K.B. Gasparini P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 635-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and a missense mutation of C442Y in the myosin VI gene was determined to be responsible for hearing loss. The aim of the present study is to determine the mechanoenzymatic basis of the deficiency of myosin VI function due to C442Y mutation found in human autosomal nonsyndromic hearing loss. To achieve the goal, we analyzed the critical kinetic steps of the actomyosin VI ATP hydrolysis mechanism that are likely to be important for myosin VI movement on actin filaments. We show here that the C442Y mutation increases the rate of ADP dissociation from myosin VI by ∼10-fold in the presence and absence of actin and smaller changes in steady state rates of ATP hydrolysis. ADP dissociation is therefore not the rate-limiting step of the ATP hydrolysis by acto-C442Y myosin VI. Materials—Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue and DH10BAC were purchased from Stratagene (San Diego, CA), and Invitrogen, respectively. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and FLAG peptide were from Sigma. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (20Spudich J.A. Watt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; mdATP, 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine triphosphate; mdADP, 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine diphosphate; mant-ADP, 2′,3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine diphosphate; S1, subfragment 1; HMM, heavy meromyosin; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). myosin VI HMM was basically prepared as below, and alternatively prepared as described previously (21Yoshimura M.

Smooth muscle myosin II was prepared as described (22Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphorylated with myosin light chain kinase (15 μg/ml) (23Ikebe M. Stepinska M. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13828-13834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 mm ATPγS in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 25 °C for 15 min. mdATP, mant-ATP, and mant-ADP were synthesized from 2′-deoxy-ATP, ATP, and ADP (Sigma) and purified according to the methods of Hiratsuka (24Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Generation of the Expression Vectors for Myosin VI Constructs— Mouse cDNA clones containing nucleotides, –150–2565 (B10) and 1460–3708 (B2), in pBluescript were kindly provided by Dr. K. Avraham (Tel Aviv University). The B10 clone was digested by KpnI/PflMI and the cDNA fragment of myosin VI-(1520–3156), obtained from the B2 clone by KpnI/PflMI digestion, was inserted into the B10 clone (B2/B10). This construct, containing the entire coiled-coil domain, was used to produce recombinant baculovirus expressing myosin VI HMM containing amino acid residues Met1–Thr1052 as described previously (21Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25O'Rielly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freedman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment containing 3156–3955 flanked with KpnI sites was produced by PCR using Pfx enzyme (Invitrogen) and was ligated to a myosin VI HMM construct to produce the myosin VI full-length construct containing amino acid residues Met1–Lys1265. Alternatively, a new KpnI site was created to produce a cDNA fragment of myosin VI S1 containing amino acid residues Met1–Glu924. A unique SpeI site was created at the 5′ side of the initiation codon, and then the myosin VI cDNA, cut by SpeI/KpnI digestion, was inserted into pFast-Bac1 (Invitrogen) baculovirus transfer vector at the polylinker region. FLAG and hexa-histidine tag sequences were introduced at the 3′ sides of the SpeI and KpnI sites, respectively. Cys442 and/or Val504 of myosin VI constructs were mutated to Tyr and/or Trp by site-directed mutagenesis (26Yano K. Araki Y. Hales S.J. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12054-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), respectively, and the mutation was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. Preparation of Recombinant Myosin VI—To express recombinant myosin VI, 2 ml of Sf9 packed cells (about 1 × 109) were co-infected with two separate viruses expressing the myosin VI heavy chain and calmodulin. The cells were cultured at 28 °C in 175-cm2 flasks and harvested after 3 days. Cells were lysed by sonication in 20 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm ATP). After centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 25 min, the supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of anti-FLAG M2-agarose for 40 min at 4 °C. The resin suspension was then loaded onto a column (1 × 10 cm) and was washed with a 40-fold resin volume of buffer A (0.15 m KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Myosin VI was eluted with buffer A containing 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide. 0.5–1 mg of purified protein was obtained from a 2-ml pellet of cells. After SDS-PAGE analysis, fractions containing myosin VI were pooled and the protein was then concentrated with a VIVASPIN concentrator (Vivascience, Carlsbad, CA). The solvent was finally exchanged into 30 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the concentrator. The purified myosin VI was stored on ice and used within 2 days. Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Molecular mass markers used were smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (204 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), myosin regulatory light chain (20 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). The amount of the myosin VI heavy chain and calmodulin was determined by densitometry as described previously (28Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ATPase Assay—The steady state ATPase activity was determined at 25 °C in the presence of an ATP regenerating system containing 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. The reaction was carried out in a buffer containing 30 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 μm ATPase sites of WT or C442Y myosin VI, and actin from 0 to 64 μm. The liberated pyruvate was determined as described (29Reinard A.M. Hass L.E. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady state actin-activated ATPase data were fit to steady state rates calculated for the first 10 s of ATP hydrolysis from differential equations describing the kinetic mechanism using least square and simplex minimization routines in the Scientist package (Micromath, Ogden, UT). Pre-steady State Kinetic Measurements—Chemical quench measurements were done using a computer-controlled stepper motor driven quench-flow apparatus used in a pulse-quench mode as described previously (30Li X.-D. Rodes T.E. Ikebe R. Kambara T. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27404-27411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow measurements of tryptophan fluorescence enhancement were done as described previously (31White H.D. Belknap B. Jiang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10039-10045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the myosin VI HMM does not have the conserved tryptophan residue responsible for fluorescence enhancement associated with the ATP hydrolysis step as in myosin II and V, the WT and C442Y mutant were constructed with a tryptophan residue in the analogous position in the sequence (V504W). Dissociation of actomyosin VI and actomyosin VI-ADP were measured from the decrease in light scattering (32White H.D. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 28: 5818-5826Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Estimates of rate constants for ATP hydrolysis and phosphate dissociation were obtained by fitting steady state and pre-steady state kinetic data to differential equations describing the kinetic mechanism using the least square and simplex minimization routines in the Scientist package (Micromath). In Vitro Motility Assay—The in vitro motility assay was performed as described previously in the buffer containing 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), 216 μg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma), 36 μg/ml catalase (Sigma), 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm ATP (33Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An appropriate concentration of WT or C442Y myosin VI full-length were attached to a coverslip, and the movement of the rhodamine-labeled actin filaments was observed. Actin filament velocity was calculated from the movement distance and the elapsed time in video images. The direction of myosin VI was determined by using rhodamine-fluorescein dual-labeled actin instead of rhodamine-labeled actin as described previously (34Homma K. Yoshimura M. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nature. 2001; 412: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of C442Y Myosin VI—Mouse myosin VI constructs were produced and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. The constructs used in the present study are shown in Fig. 1. C442Y myosin VI S1 contains the complete head (Met1–Glu924), C442Y myosin VI HMM contains the complete head and the entire coiled-coil domain (Met1–Thr1052), and C442Y myosin VI full-length contains the entire coding sequence (Met1–Lys1265). A part of the coiled-coil domain was included in the S1 construct because the inclusion of several amino acids in the coiled-coil domain stabilized calmodulin binding to myosin VI. All constructs contain N-terminal FLAG and C-terminal hexa-histidine tags to aid in purification. The cells were co-infected with an appropriate ratio of myosin VI heavy chain- and calmodulin-expressing viruses, and the expressed myosin VI was purified by anti-FLAG agarose affinity chromatography using the FLAG tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2 shows the SDS-PAGE appearance of the purified myosin VI constructs. All constructs have a high molecular mass band and a low molecular mass band and are free of 200-kDa Sf9 conventional myosin and actin. The high molecular mass bands (100, 121, and 145 kDa, for C442Y myosin VI S1, C442Y myosin VI HMM, and C442Y myosin VI full-length, respectively) were consistent with the calculated molecular mass of C442Y myosin VI S1, C442Y myosin VI HMM, and C442Y myosin VI full-length, respectively. Heavy chain bands were recognized by anti-His antibodies (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), which indicate that each high molecular mass band is the expressed myosin VI heavy chain (not shown). The small subunits show a mobility shift with a change in [Ca2+] that is characteristic of calmodulin (not shown). Dissociation of Acto-C442Y Myosin VI (ADP) by MgATP— The kobs for the dissociation of acto-WT and acto-C442Y myosin VI HMM by MgATP, measured by fitting the decrease in light scattering observed upon mixing the actomyosin with MgATP, are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The data for acto-WT and acto-C442Y myosin VI without ADP are the same within experimental error and can be extrapolated to maximum rates of ∼500 s–1 at saturating MgATP. The apparent second-order rate constants of MgATP binding to acto-WT (1.3 × 104m–1 s–1) and acto-C442Y myosin VI (1.5 × 104m–1 s–1) are ∼100-fold slower than the rates measured for fast skeletal actomyosin II. Consequently, the concentrations of MgATP required to obtain the maximum rate of dissociation are much higher than normal physiological levels. Premixing acto-WT myosin VI with 0.25 mm ADP decreases the maximum rate of dissociation to 7.7 s–1 as would be expected if dissociation of ADP from the active site limited the maximum rate of ATP binding (Fig. 3A). However, premixing acto-C442Y myosin VI with 0.25 mm ADP produces only a small decrease in the maximum rate of dissociation by MgATP (Fig. 3B, inset). The inset shows a fit of kmax (determined at saturating [ATP]), versus ADP concentration that extrapolates to ∼50 s–1 at saturating ADP and a binding constant of ADP for actomyosin VI of 0.46 mm. The C442Y mutation affects both the rate and affinity of ADP binding to actomyosin VI, decreasing the apparent affinity by ∼50-fold and increasing the dissociation rate by ∼7-fold. ATP-induced Enhancement of Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Intensity of V504W/C442Y Myosin VI—Myosin VI has a valine in the sequence position (Val504) instead of the tryptophan residue, which has a fluorescence enhancement associated with the conformational change that occurs prior to or concomitant with ATP hydrolysis of other myosins (35Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Kovacs M. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28459-28467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Myosin VI shows no ATP-induced change in tryptophan fluorescence (not shown). Therefore, we mutated Val504 of myosin VI HMM to Trp to measure the rate of the ATP-induced conformational change of myosin VI. Introduction of Trp at position 504 of myosin VI resulted in the increase in Trp fluorescence upon addition of ATP, although the observed increase (3–4%) was smaller than that for rabbit skeletal myosin S1 (20–25%). The addition of ADP did not change the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the V504W mutant. MgATP produces a similar fluorescence enhancement in V504W/WT (not shown) and V504W/C442Y myosin VI HMM (Fig. 4A). The dependence of kobs upon ATP concentration is shown in Fig. 4B. The apparent second-order rate constants of MgATP binding are 6 × 104m–1 s–1 for WT (not shown) and 5 × 104m–1 s–1 for C442Y myosin VI. The maximum rates at saturating ATP are the same within experimental error for V504W/WT (53 s–1) and V504W/C442Y myosin VI (50 s–1) and can either be interpreted as a measure of the hydrolytic step or of a conformational step preceding hydrolysis. We cannot accurately identify the value of the zero intercept in Fig. 4B, which would be a measure of the rate of dissociation of ATP from myosin in a simple binding mechanism. It was previously reported with WT myosin VI S1 that mant-ATP binding to myosin VI is reversible with a dissociation rate constant of 4 s–1 (18De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). At ATP concentrations less than 50 μm we observed a decrease in the fluorescence amplitude that is consistent with a dissociation rate of 1–2 s–1. The V504W mutant has actin-activated ATP hydrolysis activity and in vitro motility activity identical within experimental error to those of the WT (data not shown), indicating that the tryptophan is a good intrinsic probe for the substrate-induced conformational change in myosin VI. The similarity of the results of V504W/WT and V504W/C442Y myosin VI demonstrate that the C442Y mutation does not significantly alter the rates of the initial steps of the ATP hydrolysis mechanism. Kinetics of Product Dissociation from (Acto) C442Y Myosin VI—It has been reported that the rate of ADP dissociation from actomyosin VI is slow and it was proposed that ADP dissociation is the rate-limiting step of the actomyosin VI ATPase cycle (18De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Here we report measurements of the rates of dissociation of mant-ADP from (acto) C442Y myosin VI HMM to be at least 9–10-fold more rapid than from (acto) WT myosin VI HMM. Fig. 5A shows the dependence of kobs of mant-ADP binding to WT (open symbols) and C442Y myosin VI (solid symbols) upon [mant-ADP]. The values obtained by extrapolation of the binding rate to zero mant-ADP concentration are in good agreement with the dissociation rate obtained by mixing the myosin VI·mant-ADP complex with excess ATP. The dissociation rate of mant-ADP from C442Y myosin VI, 55 s–1, is almost 10-fold faster than WT, 5.7 s–1 (Fig. 5B). The rate constant for mant-ADP binding is also significantly increased in C442Y myosin VI (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that the C442Y mutation does not significantly change the affinity for mant-ADP but significantly increases the association and dissociation rates for mant-ADP. The rates of mant-ADP dissociation from acto-WT and acto-C442Y myosin VI were measured from the rates of dissociation of the ternary actomyosin VI·mant-ADP complexes by MgATP to be 6.8 s–1 for acto-WT and 63 s–1 for acto-C442Y myosin VI (Fig. 5D). The rates of dissociation of mant-ADP from C442Y myosin VI are not significantly increased by actin as was previously observed for T406A(E) myosin VI S1 (18De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We have also measured the kinetics of product release by double mixing experiments in which the myosin is mixed with substrate, incubated in a delay line for a few seconds to allow for substrate binding and hydrolysis to occur after which the myosin nucleotide complex is mixed with actin to determine the rate of product dissociation. Such experiments have been used to measured the rate of phosphate dissociation from actomyosin-ADP-Pi for myosins II, V, and VI using fluorescent phosphate-binding protein (18De La Cruz E.M.

We previously reported that the prostacyclin mimetic, cicaprost, selectively inhibits cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (Cdk2), and now we show that it acts by regulating the expression of Skp2, the F-box protein that targets p27Kip1 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. First, we show that cicaprost prevents the late G1 phase down-regulation of p27Kip1 and that the inhibitory effect of cicaprost on cyclin E-Cdk2 activity and S phase entry is eliminated by deleting p27Kip1. Levels of the closely related Cdk2 inhibitor, p21Cip1, are unaffected by cicaprost. Moreover, we show that cicaprost blocks the induction of Skp2 mRNA and that ectopic expression of a Skp2 cDNA overrides the effect of cicaprost on p27Kip1 levels and S phase entry. Our data show that inhibition of F-box protein gene expression can underlie the effect of a potent antimitogen.

The endothelium regulates vascular tone and homeostasis in part by the release of small molecules that regulate medial smooth muscle cells.

The resulting decrease in production and release of prostacyclin is thought to contribute to both atherosclerosis and restenosis. In support of this notion, deletion of IP (the heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor for prostacyclin) increases susceptibility to thrombosis (5Murata T. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Hirata M.

Circulation. 2000; 102: 234Google Scholar), and exacerbates injury-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointima formation (7Cheng Y. Austin S.C. Rocca B. Koller B.H. Coffman T.M. Grosser T.

Prostacyclin inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by blocking progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (8Weber A.A. Zucker T.P. Hasse A. Bonisch D. Wittpoth M. Schror K. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1998; 93: 54-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G1 phase progression is regulated by a sequential activation of the G1 phase cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; CRE, cyclic AMP response element; CREB, cyclic AMP response element binding protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; SCF, Skp1-cullin-F box protein. namely cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2. The activation of Cdk4/6 in mid-G1 phase is typically regulated by the mitogen-dependent induction of a D-type cyclin, usually cyclin D1 in mesenchymal cells. In contrast, cyclin E is expressed throughout the G1 phase, and the activation of Cdk2 is typically regulated by the rate at which Cdk2 inhibitors, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, are down-regulated (9Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5155) Google Scholar). Once activated, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2 phosphorylate the pocket protein family of transcriptional regulators (pRb, p107, p130), which in turn modulate the activation of E2F-dependent genes such as cyclin A (10Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cyclin A is induced at the G1/S interface, and the consequent formation of cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes marks entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. We recently reported that the prostacyclin mimetic, cicaprost, inhibits G1 to S phase cell cycle progression in aortic smooth muscle cells by inhibiting CREB- and pocket protein-dependent cyclin A gene expression (11Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Pure E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of cicaprost on pocket protein phosphorylation was associated with a selective inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity; the induction of cyclin D1 and the activation of cyclin D-Cdk4 were unaffected by cicaprost. Cicaprost did not affect the levels of cyclin E or Cdk2, but we were unable to define the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of cicaprost on cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, probably because the smooth muscle cells used in that study (primary murine smooth muscle cells and the A10 smooth muscle cell line) do not cycle efficiently. In this study, we used established mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) to show that cicaprost exerts its inhibitory effect on cyclin E-Cdk2 activity by specifically regulating the expression of p27Kip1. Furthermore, we link this effect on p27Kip1 to a cicaprost-mediated block in expression of the Skp2 gene. The Skp2 gene encodes the substrate-targeting component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that degrades p27Kip1 (12Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 13Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat.

Cell Culture—Spontaneously immortalized embryo fibroblasts from wild-type and p27Kip1–/– mice were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). In cell cycle experiments, near confluent monolayers of MEFs were G0 synchronized by incubation in a serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml heat-inactivated fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 36–48 h. The quiescent cells were trypsinized, reseeded in culture plates, and stimulated with 10% FBS as described (14Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 200 nm cicaprost. For HA-Skp2 overexpression studies, MEFs were transfected as described (14Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus and 5 μg of either pcDNA3.1 (vector control) or a pcDNA3.1-based HA-tagged mouse Skp2 expression vector (HA-Skp2). After an overnight recovery, the cells were serum-starved for 36 h. Serum-starved transfectants were trypsinized, reseeded (∼106 cells per 10 ml of 10% FBS-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) into 100-mm tissue culture dishes, and incubated in the absence or presence of 200 nm cicaprost. Cicaprost was the generous gift of Garret FitzGerald. To monitor entry into S phase, quiescent MEFs were added to 100-mm (∼106 cells) dishes containing autoclaved glass coverslips and incubated in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, 3 μg/ml BrdUrd (Amersham Biosciences) in the absence or presence of 200 nm cicaprost. Formaldehyde-fixed cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd as described (11Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Pure E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Approximately 200 cells in 3–4 fields of view were counted per sample to determine the percent of BrdUrd-labeled nuclei. Results shown are typically representative of at least three independent experiments. Cyclin A promoter-luciferase assays were performed as described (11Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Pure E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using the p434/cyclin A promoter-luciferase expression vector (bases –270 to +164 of the human cyclin A promoter cloned upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter (15Kramer A. Carstens C.P. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6579-6582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)), the Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-CMV), and an E7 expression vector. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Western Blotting and Cyclin E-Cdk2 Kinase Assays—Western blotting was performed as described (14Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) using 75–100 μg of total cellular protein and the following antibodies: Cdk4 (sc-260, Santa Cruz Biotechnology or DCS-31, BioSource), cyclin D1 (sc-8396, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p27Kip1 (K25020, Transduction Laboratories), p21Cip1 (sc-6246, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin E (sc-481, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cdk2 (06-505, Upstate Biotechnology), pRb (28-007, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), pAKT (9271S, Cell Signaling), pERK (9101S, Cell Signaling) and Skp2 (32-3400, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Rabbit polyclonal cyclin A antibody was prepared in our laboratory using recombinant cyclin A as an immunogen. Cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase assays were performed by incubating identically prepared lysates (150 μg) with anti-cyclin E (sc-481, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (16Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar); reaction products were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, and immunoblotting with anti-Cdk2 (06-505, Upstate Biotechnology). Results shown are typically representative of at least three independent experiments. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Quiescent MEFs were trypsinized, replated at subconfluence (∼5 × 105 cells in 5 ml of medium per 60-mm culture dish), and incubated in 10% FBS in the absence or presence of 200 nm cicaprost for selected times. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) per 60-mm dish to extract total RNA. Total RNA (∼400 ng) from each sample was used for cDNA synthesis using reverse transcription reagents from Applied Biosystems Inc. (5.5 mm MgCl2, 2mm dNTP, 2.5 μm oligo(dT) or 2.5 μm random hexamers, 8 units of RNase I, and 25 units of reverse transcriptase per 20 μl of reaction.) The reverse transcription was performed separately from the PCR reaction. An aliquot (10%) of cDNA was then subjected to 40 amplification cycles of PCR (Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 sequence detection system) using Taqman universal PCR master mix. For mouse Skp2, the real time PCR reaction contained 200 nm forward primer 5′-AGC GCG TGG GTG AAA GC, 200 nm reverse primer 5′-ATC ACT GAG TTC GAC AGG TCC AT, and 150 nm MGB probe 6FAM-TCA GCT CTT TCC GGG TAC-minor groove binder-non-fluorescent quencher. For mouse Cdk4, the real time PCR reaction contained 900 nm forward primer 5′-GGC CTT TGA ACA TCC CAA T, 900 nm reverse primer 5′-TCA GTT CGG GAA GTA GCA CAG A, and 250 nm MGB probe VIC-ATC CAT CAG CCG TAC A-MGB-NFQ. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate, and mRNA expression was quantified using ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system software. Mean quantities were calculated from duplicate samples. Skp2 mRNA expression was normalized to Cdk4 mRNA expression, which did not vary reproducibly during serum stimulation or cicaprost treatment. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Cicaprost Inhibits S Phase Entry in MEFs by Selectively Regulating p27Kip1—We reported previously that cicaprost selectively inhibited the activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 in vascular smooth muscle cells. Yet levels of cyclin D1, the activation of Cdk4, and the levels of cyclin E and Cdk2 were unaffected (11Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Pure E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, inefficient cycling of those cells prevented us from characterizing the responsible mechanism in further detail. Therefore we tested the effect of cicaprost in established MEFs, which efficiently re-enter G1 phase from quiescence (Fig. 1A, control). Cicaprost strongly inhibited S phase entry in MEFs (Fig. 1A) with a dose response that was similar to that of vascular smooth muscle cells (IC50 ∼30 nm; data not shown). Moreover, cicaprost blocked the phosphorylation of pRb and the induction of cyclin A in MEFs (Fig. 1B) in a manner very similar to that seen in vascular smooth muscle cells (11Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Pure E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, unlike its effects in vascular smooth muscle cells (11Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Pure E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), cicaprost did not regulate CREB-dependent cyclin A gene expression in MEFs and did not inhibit the phosphorylation of CREB or the binding of CREB and phospho-CREB to the cyclin A CRE (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of cicaprost on wild-type cyclin A promoter activity in MEFs was overcome by ectopic expression of human papillomavirus E7, a protein that sequesters pocket proteins and mimics inactivation by the G1 phase Cdks (Fig. 1C). E7 expression fails to overcome the inhibitory effect of cicaprost on cyclin A promoter activity in vascular smooth muscle cells unless the CRE-inhibitory effect of cicaprost is first eliminated by the use of a CRE-deleted or mutated promoter (11Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Pure E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the antimitogenic effect of cicaprost on pocket protein phosphorylation is conserved in these mesenchymal cells whereas the antimitogenic effect on CREB is not. As with vascular smooth muscle cells, cicaprost did not affect the levels of cyclin E and Cdk2 in MEFs (Fig. 2A) but strongly inhibited the late G1 phase activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 as determined by both the gel shift of Cdk2 (a hallmark of cdk-activating kinase mediated Cdk2 activation; Fig. 2A) and in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2B). Cicaprost also blocked the down-regulation of p27Kip1 but did not affect the G1 phase levels of p21Cip1 (Fig. 2A). The absence of an effect on p21Cip1 suggested that the antimitogenic effect of cicaprost was not caused by mere inhibition of mitogenic signaling, and indeed we found that cicaprost did not inhibit activation of several well established mitogenic targets, including ERK1/2, AKT, and cyclin D1 (Fig. 2C). Finally, the effects of cicaprost on p27Kip1 levels were causally related to its antimitogenic effect; cicaprost strongly blocked cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, cyclin A induction, and S phase entry in wild-type MEFs but not in MEFs lacking p27Kip1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Overall, these results show that the selective effect of cicaprost on the levels of p27Kip1 is causally related to its antimitogenic effect on S phase entry.Fig. 3The antimitogenic effect of cicaprost requires p27Kip1. Quiescent wild-type and p27Kip1–/– MEFs were trypsinized, reseeded at subconfluence into 100-mm dishes containing coverslips, and stimulated with 10% FBS in the presence of BrdUrd with and without 200 nm cicaprost for the indicated times. A, collected cells were lysed, and equal amounts of protein (150 μg) were incubated with anti-cyclin E. The collected immunoprecipitates were used to assess in vitro kinase activity and then analyzed by Western blotting for associated Cdk2. Duplicate lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for p27Kip1, cyclin A, and Cdk4 (loading control). B, fixed coverslips were incubated with anti-BrdUrd, and BrdUrd incorporation into nuclei was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cicaprost Inhibits Expression of the Skp2 Gene—One of the most common mechanisms for regulating p27Kip1 involves its phosphorylation at Thr-187 by cyclin E-Cdk2, an event that targets p27Kip1 for degradation by the SCF ubiquitin-ligase complex (17Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 18Malek N.P. Sundberg H. McGrew S. Nakayama K. Kyriakides T.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The substrate-targeting component of the SCF complex that is required for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p27Kip1 is the F-box protein, Skp2 (12Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 13Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Skp2 is poorly expressed in quiescent cells, and its expression is stimulated by mitogens during late G1 and S phase (12Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 19Carrano A.C. Pagano M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and B; control). Cicaprost blocked the serum-stimulated expression of Skp2 (Fig. 4A), and again this effect was not caused by an overall inhibition of mitogenic signaling (Fig. 2C). Recent reports have identified the anaphase promoting complexCdh1 complex as a major regulator of Skp2 proteolysis as cells progress from mitosis into G1 as well as when cells are serum-starved to enter quiescence (20Bashir T. Dorrello N.V. Amador V. Guardavaccaro D. Pagano M. Nature. 2004; 428: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 21Wei W. Ayad N.G. Wan Y. Zhang G.J. Kirschner M.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2004; 428: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Although these results raised the possibility that cicaprost could regulate Skp2 levels post-transcriptionally by regulating anaphase promoting complexCdh1, quantitative real time PCR showed that cicaprost strongly inhibited the induction of Skp2 mRNA (Fig. 4C). Moreover, we could rescue the expression of Skp2, the down-regulation of p27Kip1, the induction of cyclin A, and entry into S phase in cicaprost-treated cells by transfecting cells with a Skp2 cDNA and enforcing the expression of ectopic Skp2 at near normal levels (Fig. 5, A and B). The rescue of ectopic Skp2 protein expression in cicaprost-treated cells would be highly unlikely to occur if cicaprost strongly stimulated Skp2 proteolysis. Thus, our data indicate that prostacyclin is antimitogenic because it inhibits gene expression of the F-box protein that controls the degradation of p27Kip1. Note that MEFs expressing HA-Skp2 have reduced levels of endogenous Skp2 (Fig. 5A) consistent with a study indicating that Skp2 itself is a target of a Skp2-containing SCF complex (22Wirbelauer C. Sutterluty H. Blondel M. Gstaiger M. Peter M. Reymond F. Krek W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5362-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). 8-Bromo-cAMP Induces G1 Arrest without Affecting Skp2— Cicaprost binds to the IP receptor, a heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor that canonically couples to Gs and increases cAMP (23Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cAMP can increase p27Kip1 levels and inhibit S phase entry (24Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), we asked whether the effect of cicaprost on Skp2 could be recapitulated merely by increasing cAMP. Consistent with previous studies (24Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), the cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP, increased p27Kip1 levels, inhibited the induction of cyclin A, and blocked S phase entry in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). However, this effect on p27Kip1was not accompanied by a decreased expression of Skp2 (Fig. 6A). Similar results were seen with forskolin (data not shown). These results show that the antimitogenic effect of cicaprost on Skp2 expression is not a general response to increased cAMP levels and indicate that the effects of prostacyclin and cAMP on p27Kip1 are mechanistically distinct. They also emphasize that the inhibitory effect of cicaprost on the expression of Skp2 is not merely a secondary consequence of G1 phase arrest; MEFs treated with 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP are arrested in G1 phase yet still express Skp2 (Fig. 6, A and B). Our results show that prostacyclin exerts its antimitogenic effects by selectively regulating p27Kip1. We first showed that cicaprost acts through a pocket protein-dependent pathway to inhibit cyclin A promoter activity. Moreover, cicaprost inhibited the activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 and the down-regulation of p27Kip1 that accompanies cell cycle progression through G1 phase, and these antimitogenic effects of cicaprost on cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, cyclin A induction, and S phase entry are overcome by deleting p27Kip1. Interestingly, p27Kip1-null MEFs retain the ability to undergo G1 arrest in response to contact inhibition, serum starvation, and γ-irradiation (25Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Thus, although the inhibitory effect of p27Kip1 can be compensated for in these settings, p27Kip1 is essential for the antimitogenic effect of cicaprost. Our data also indicate that prostacyclin regulates p27Kip1 by controlling the expression of the F-box protein, Skp2. Cicaprost blocked Skp2 gene expression, and forced expression of Skp2 rescued p27Kip1 down-regulation and S phase entry in cicaprost-treated cells. In addition to p27Kip1, others have reported that Skp2 targets cyclin E, p21Cip1, p130, c-Myc, and p57Kip2 for proteolysis (26Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I.

We saw no effect of cicaprost on p21Cip1 or cyclin E under conditions in which the induction of Skp2 was clearly inhibited. Although the basis for these different results is not completely clear, SCFSkp2 primarily targets free cyclin E for degradation. In our established MEFs (26Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), most of the cyclin E may be complexed to Cdk2. Moreover, the effect of SCFSkp2 on p21Cip1 degradation was studied in S phase (28Bornstein G. Bloom J. Sitry-Shevah D. Nakayama K. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25752-25757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar); our study focuses on G1 phase regulation. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis appears to be the most common mechanism regulating p27Kip1 levels during G1 phase progression (31Bashir T. Pagano M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2003; 88: 101-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but p27Kip1 levels can also be regulated by an AKT-dependent transcription of the p27Kip1 gene (32Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar) and a RhoA-dependent translation of p27Kip1mRNA (33Vidal A. Millard S.S. Miller J.P. Koff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16433-16440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although we have not studied these potential mechanisms in detail, they are unlikely to be major targets of prostacyclin because (i) AKT activation is unaffected by cicaprost, and (ii) cicaprost-treated MEFs do not show the morphological changes expected to accompany RhoA inhibition. Moreover, inhibition of RhoA would strongly increase the level of p21Cip1 (34Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and cicaprost did not affect p21Cip1 levels. Previous studies have shown that Skp2 mRNA levels are also reduced when cells are detached from their extracellular matrix (19Carrano A.C. Pagano M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); the relationship between prostacyclin and integrin signaling remains to be determined. Cicaprost binds to and activates the IP receptor, a heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor that is best characterized as an activator of Gs. (35Coleman R.A. Grix S.P. Head S.A. Louttit J.B.

Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) find that cAMP-elevating agents (8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin) increase the levels of p27Kip1 and lead to G1 phase arrest. However in striking contrast to cicaprost, 8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin inhibited the down-regulation of p27Kip1 and entry into S phase without affecting the levels of Skp2. These data indicate that prostacyclin-dependent inhibition of Skp2 gene expression is not mediated merely by increasing the levels of cAMP. Our study establishes a selective and causal relationship between the effects of prostacyclin on p27Kip1 and G1 phase cell cycle progression. Others (36Ii M. Hoshiga M. Fukui R. Negoro N. Nakakoji T.

Together, these two reports strongly indicate that p27Kip1mediates the antimitogenic effect of prostacyclin on smooth muscle cell proliferation. By comparing the effects of 8-bromo-cAMP and beraprost on p27Kip1 levels in cultured smooth muscle cells, Ii et al. (36Ii M. Hoshiga M. Fukui R. Negoro N. Nakakoji T. Nishiguchi F. Kohbayashi E.

However, we show that prostacyclin (but not cAMP) is able to inhibit expression of the Skp2 gene. This result is not restricted to MEFs because cicaprost also blocks Skp2 mRNA induction in primary murine smooth muscle cells (data not shown). In summary, our data identify a new mechanism mediating antimitogenesis. Moreover, because prostacyclin is a likely inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation in atherosclerosis as well as restenosis (6Egan K. FitzGerald G.A.

https://openalex.org/W2024904425,"Topoisomerase II is an essential enzyme that is targeted by a number of clinically valuable anticancer drugs. One class referred to as topoisomerase II poisons works by increasing the cellular level of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks, resulting in apoptosis. Another class of topoisomerase II-directed drugs, the bis-dioxopiperazines, stabilizes the conformation of the enzyme where it attains an inactive salt-stable closed clamp structure. Bis-dioxopiperazines, similar to topoisomerase II poisons, induce cell killing, but the underlying mechanism is presently unclear. In this study, we use three different biochemically well characterized human topoisomerase IIα mutant enzymes to dissect the catalytic requirements needed for the enzyme to cause dominant sensitivity in yeast to the bis-dioxopirazine ICRF-193 and the topoisomerase II poison m-AMSA. We find that the clamp-closing activity, the DNA cleavage activity, and even both activities together are insufficient for topoisomerase II to cause dominant sensitivity to ICRF-193 in yeast. Rather, the strand passage event per se is an absolute requirement, most probably because this involves a simultaneous interaction of the enzyme with two DNA segments. Furthermore, we show that the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to cause dominant sensitivity to m-AMSA in yeast does not depend on clamp closure or strand passage but is directly related to the capability of the enzyme to respond to m-AMSA with increased DNA cleavage complex formation.

Furthermore, we show that the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to cause dominant sensitivity to m-AMSA in yeast does not depend on clamp closure or strand passage but is directly related to the capability of the enzyme to respond to m-AMSA with increased DNA cleavage complex formation. DNA topoisomerase II is an abundant enzyme able to regulate DNA topology by making transient double strand breaks in the DNA helix. It fulfills an essential function in chromosome segregation (1Holm C. Goto T. Wang J.C. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 41: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and is moreover the primary target for many cancer chemotherapeutics and antibiotics. The dimeric topoisomerase II mediates topological changes in DNA by introducing a transient gate in one DNA duplex, the G-segment, whereas another duplex, the T-segment, is transported coordinately through the gated DNA. The topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage reaction involves a transesterification between a pair of phosphodiester bonds in the DNA backbone and the phenolic oxygens from the active site tyrosine of each monomer identified as Tyr-805 in human topoisomerase IIα (2Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Besides DNA cleavage, a change in DNA topology catalyzed by topoisomerase II also requires a strand passage step. This is initiated by the closure of an ATP-operated clamp composed of the N-terminal region from each subunit. Upon clamp closure, the T-segment is trapped and transported concomitantly through the cleaved G-segment (3Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 5Roca J. Wang J.C.

A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The subsequent ligation of the G-segment fulfills the topoisomerase II-mediated topological change in DNA, leaving the DNA strands intact. One class of chemotherapeutic agents targeting topoisomerase II, the topoisomerase II poisons, are believed to act primarily by enhancing the concentration of topoisomerase II-mediated double strand breaks in cellular DNA. In this way, the topoisomerase becomes a cellular toxin that eventually will trigger apoptosis (reviewed in Fortune and Osheroff (7Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). m-AMSA 1The abbreviations used are: m-AMSA, 4[prime]-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-aniside; ICRF-193, meso-2,3-bis(2,6-dioxopiperazin-4-yl)butane. belongs to this class of topoisomerase II-directed drugs and is believed to stimulate the cleavage complex formation by distorting the DNA helix structure. Another class of topoisomerase II-directed drugs that has been given much attention recently is the bis-dioxopiperazine including ICRF-193. These drugs inhibit topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the closed clamp form of topoisomerase II and thus generate a non-covalent topological complex between topoisomerase II and DNA (8Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It has been anticipated that the lethal effect of ICRF is caused by a lack of topoisomerase II activity during the cell cycle (9Ishida R. Sato M. Narita T. Utsumi K.R. Nishimoto T. Morita T. Nagata H. Andoh T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies have questioned the mechanism of action of ICRF (10Kobayashi M.

An ICRF-mediated increase in DNA strand breaks has been observed both in vivo (16Hajji N. Pastor N. Mateos S. Dominguez I. Cortes F. Mutat. Res. 2003; 530: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in vitro (17Huang K.C. Gao H. Yamasaki E.F. Grabowski D.R. Liu S. Shen L.L. Chan K.K. Ganapathi R. Snapka R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44488-44494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of human topoisomerase IIα in yeast confers dominant sensitivity to ICRF in favor of an active poisoning role of topoisomerase II in the cell-killing mechanism of ICRF (15van Hille B. Hill B.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been demonstrated that cells deficient in nonhomologous end joining are hypersensitive to ICRF and to the topoisomerase II poison, etoposide, also suggesting the involvement of DNA strand breaks in the ICRF cell-killing mechanism (12Adachi N. Suzuki H. Iiizumi S. Koyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35897-35902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Munoz P. Zdzienicka M.Z. Blanchard J.M. Piette J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5797-5808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have used three human topoisomerase IIα mutant enzymes to determine the catalytic steps/activities of human topoisomerase IIα through which ICRF and m-AMSA exert cell killing: (i) a mutant enzyme unable to perform DNA strand passage but capable of both clamp closure and DNA cleavage (19Oestergaard V.H. Giangiacomo L. Bjergbaek L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); (ii) a mutant enzyme unable to close the clamp and perform strand passage but still capable of DNA cleavage (20Oestergaard V.H. Bjergbaek L. Skouboe C. Giangiacomo L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1684-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); and (iii) a topoisomerase II enzyme defective in DNA cleavage and strand passage but able to close the N-terminal clamp (2Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To investigate the poisoning mechanism of ICRF in combination with human topoisomerase IIα, the ICRF sensitivity of yeast transformants expressing the wild type or one of the different human topoisomerase IIα mutant enzymes was assayed. To obtain further knowledge of the mechanism of action of topoisomerase II poisons, the sensitivity of the yeast transformants to m-AMSA also was tested. Moreover, we purified the wild type and mutant enzymes to investigate their response to ICRF-193 and m-AMSA in vitro. Taken together, our results showed that the clamp-closing activity and the DNA cleavage activity as well as both activities together are insufficient for topoisomerase IIα to cause sensitivity to ICRF-193 in yeast. Rather, the DNA strand passage reaction of the enzyme per se is essential. In contrast, we found that the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to cause dominant sensitivity to m-AMSA in yeast is independent of clamp closure and strand passage. In this case, the sensitivity is related directly to the capability of human topoisomerase IIα to respond to m-AMSA with an increased DNA cleavage complex formation. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains BJ201 (Matα ura3 trp1 pep4::HIS3 prb1 can1 top2::TRP1) and JEL1Δtop1 (kindly provided by J. C. Wang) were used for complementation analysis and overexpression of topoisomerase II, respectively. Yeast strain Y12409 (BY4742; Matα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0; YOR153w::kanMX4), purchased from EUROSCARF, was used for the measurements of drug sensitivity in yeast. Plasmid pBY105 contains the yeast triosephosphate isomerase promotor inserted into the polylinker region of the LEU2/ARS-CEN plasmid pRS315. pRS315 was used as the backbone for pHT300, pHT213, pHT351i (pHT350-2), and pHT408i (pHT408-2) expressing the wild-type human topoisomerase IIα, a human topoisomerase IIα, in which the active site tyrosine has been substituted with a serine (Y805S), a human topoisomerase IIα bearing a two-amino acid insertion at position 351 and one bearing a two-amino acid insertion at position 408, respectively. The modified versions of YEpWOB6 were used for overexpression of the hexahistidine-tagged human topoisomerase IIα wild-type enzyme as well as for overexpression of Y805S, 351i, and 408i. Yeast Transformation and Complementation—Yeast cells were transformed by using a modified version of the LiAc method of Ito et al. (21Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of 351i, 408i, and Y805S to complement the lack of endogenous topoisomerase II in BJ201, the LEU2-based constructs pHT351i, pHT408i, and pHT213 were transformed into BJ201 and the cells were transferred to medium plates containing 5′-fluoro-orotic acid (1 mg/ml) to select against the URA3 plasmid carrying the Schizosaccharomyces pombe top2+ gene (2Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). pHT300 was used as a positive control. Measurements of Drug Sensitivity in Yeast—The measurements of drug sensitivity were carried out as described by Nitiss et al. (22Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A logarithmically growing culture of yeast cells, Y12409, grown in synthetic dropout medium was diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml (A = 0.1), and drug or Me2SO (0.8% final) was added. The aliquots were plated to synthetic dropout plates at the indicated time points after proper dilution. Analysis of Protein Expression—The cell pellet from 2 ml of yeast culture in log phase was lysed, and the lysate was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. The precipitate was resuspended in SDS-loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 1% SDS, 140 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS gel. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (45 μm, Schleicher & Schüll), and topoisomerase IIα was detected by the anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody, CRB (Genosys Biotechnologies). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used as secondary antibodies (DAKO), and immunostaining was carried out according to the ECL protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Human Topoisomerase IIα Overexpression and Purification—The recombinant human topoisomerase IIα enzymes were overexpressed in yeast strain JEL1Δtop1 and purified through Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid-agarose, heparin-Sepharose, and phosphocellulose column chromatography as described by Oestergaard et al. (20Oestergaard V.H. Bjergbaek L. Skouboe C. Giangiacomo L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1684-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Clamp-closing Assay—For clamp-closing experiments, 7.5 nm topoisomerase II was preincubated with 6.5 nm of negatively supercoiled pUC19 DNA for 5 min in a total volume of 20 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP). After preincubation, ICRF-193 (BIOMOL) was added to a final concentration of 434 μm. The reactions were incubated further for 5 min and then stopped by the addition of NaCl to 800 mm. The sample volume was increased to 80 μl by adding 60 μl of 800 mm NaCl solution. To trap enzyme-DNA catenanes, phenol extraction was performed by adding 1 volume of phenol. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min. The waterphase was removed, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) for gel analysis. The combined phenol phase and phenol/water interphase were washed once in 4 m NaCl and once in 0.8 m NaCl solution. Upon the removal of the waterphase after the last wash, the remaining material was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K. The samples were subjected next to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TBE (100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA) containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and DNA was visualized by UV light. Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA Cleavage—Topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of oligonucleotides was performed by incubating 15 nm topoisomerase II and 1 nm of labeled DNA substrate in a total volume of 20 μl of buffer (2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 112.5 mm KCl). The substrate was a pBR322-derived 40-mer duplex containing a strong topoisomerase II recognition sequence. The top strand having the sequence 5′-TGC ATG AGG ATG ACG ATG AGC GCA TTG TTA GAT TGA TG-3′ was labeled at the 3′-end with Sequenase (United States Biochemical Corp.). When indicated, the reactions contained 100 μm m-AMSA (Sigma) or 85 μm ICRF-193 in 0.5% Me2SO. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, cleavage products were trapped by the addition of SDS to 1%, and samples were subjected subsequently to SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis. Covalent complex formation was revealed by the transfer of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide to the topoisomerase polypeptide. Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of circular plasmid DNA was performed by incubating 100 nm topoisomerase II and 6.5 nm of negatively supercoiled pUC19 DNA in a total volume of 20 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 7 min, and the cleavage products were trapped by the addition of SDS to 1%. After proteinase K digestion (0.8 mg/ml), the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 nm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA) containing ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml). When topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage was carried out in the presence of m-AMSA or ICRF-193, the concentration of the drug was 50 μm in a final concentration of 0.5% Me2SO. 351i, 408i, and Y805S Are Useful in Defining the Cell-killing Mechanism behind ICRF-193—To investigate the cell-killing mechanism behind ICRF-193, we have taken advantage of three previously characterized human topoisomerase IIα enzymes. The enzymes are 351i (19Oestergaard V.H. Giangiacomo L. Bjergbaek L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), 408i (20Oestergaard V.H. Bjergbaek L. Skouboe C. Giangiacomo L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1684-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the active site mutant Y805S (2Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 351i has a two-amino acid insertion at position 351 in the transducer domain. The insertion inhibits the DNA strand passage reaction per se but leaves the enzyme with the capability to do both clamp closure and DNA cleavage. 408i has a two-amino acid insertion at position 408 in the transducer domain. The enzyme has a severe disruption of the clamp function and is unable to relax DNA but is fully capable of DNA cleavage (20Oestergaard V.H. Bjergbaek L. Skouboe C. Giangiacomo L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1684-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In Y805S, the active site tyrosine has been changed to a serine, which results in a cleavage-incompetent enzyme, but as demonstrated earlier (11Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T.

The position of the different mutations is indicated in Fig. 1A. The cDNA encoding 351i, 408i, Y805S, and wild-type human topoisomerase IIα have been inserted in pRS315 behind a constitutive TPI promoter, generating the plasmids pHT351i, pHT408i, pHT213, and pHT300, respectively. See Table I for a schematic description of the enzymes expressed from the different plasmids.Table IPlasmid overview: the catalytic capabilities of wild-type human topoisomerase IIα and three mutant enzymesPlasmidEnzymeRelaxationDNA cleavageClamp closurepHT300Wild-type human topoisomerase IIαYesYesYespHT213Y805SNoNoYespHT351i351iNoYesYespHT408i408iNoYesNopRS315No Open table in a new tab To confirm the catalytic incapabilities of the enzymes, complementation analyses were performed using an S. cerevisiae top2 deletion strain. As expected, 351i, 408i, and Y805S all failed to sustain the mitotic growth of the yeast strain in contrast to wild-type human topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 1B). 351i, 408i, and Y805S Do Not Induce Dominant Sensitivity toward ICRF-193 in Yeast—ICRF-193 is a topoisomerase II-directed drug, which stabilizes topoisomerase II in its closed clamp form (8Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and until recently, it was anticipated that the cytotoxicity of ICRF compounds simply was attributed to an inhibition of the essential topoisomerase II activity. However, the expression of wild-type human topoisomerase IIα in yeast cells has been demonstrated to confer dominant sensitivity to ICRF, suggesting that the drug acts as a topoisomerase II poison (15van Hille B. Hill B.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of a cleavage-deficient human topoisomerase II enzyme does not alter the yeast sensitivity to ICRF-193, even though this enzyme still has a functional N-terminal clamp (11Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This indicates that, besides clamp closure, either DNA cleavage or the strand passage activity of topoisomerase II is required for ICRF-193 to exert its poisoning effect. To test which of the enzymatic capabilities of human topoisomerase IIα are important for the enzyme to cause dominant sensitivity to ICRF-193 in yeast cells, we expressed 351i, 408i, Y805S, or wild-type human topoisomerase IIα in the yeast strain Y12409. As a control, the cells were transformed with the empty vector pRS315. To verify the expression of the human topoisomerase IIα enzymes, the Western blot analysis of cell lysates from all of the yeast transformants was carried out using an antibody specific to human topoisomerase IIα. As seen in Fig. 2A, both mutant and wild-type enzymes were expressed in the Y12409 yeast cells, although Y805S was expressed consistently at a lower level. To assess the cytotoxicity of ICRF-193 in the different transformants, the yeast cells were incubated either in the absence or presence of 85 μm ICRF-193. Aliquots were removed after 4 and 8 h and plated to determine cell survival after proper dilution. The results confirmed that the expression of wild-type human topoisomerase IIα in yeast confers sensitivity to ICRF-193, because the drug induced severe cell killing (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the cleavage-deficient enzyme did not confer ICRF sensitivity as expected (11Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Yeast cells expressing the clamp-deficient 408i enzyme displayed little or no sensitivity to ICRF-193, showing that the cleavage activity is insufficient to induce ICRF cytotoxicity. The strand passage-deficient human topoisomerase IIα enzyme, 351i, which retains both clamp closure and DNA cleavage activity also induced little or no ICRF cytotoxicity (Fig. 2B). Thus, neither DNA cleavage, clamp closure, nor both activities together are sufficient for ICRF-193 to mediate cell killing via topoisomerase II. Our results strongly suggest that strand transport, which is blocked in all three mutant enzymes, is an absolute requirement for ICRF-mediated cell killing. ICRF-193 Induces Stable Clamp Formation in Wild-type Topoisomerase IIα, 351i, and Y805S but Not in 408i—To investigate whether the inability of ICRF-193 to cause cytotoxicity in yeast cells expressing 351i, 408i, or Y805S was because of a lack of drug-mediated clamp stabilization with these enzymes, we tested the ability of ICRF-193 to stabilize the closed clamp conformation in the mutant topoisomerase IIα enzymes in vitro. For this purpose, the different enzymes fused to a hexahistidine tail at the C-terminal end were overexpressed in a yeast top1 null strain and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To test the effect of ICRF-193 in vitro, wild-type and mutant enzymes were preincubated with supercoiled plasmid DNA and ATP before the addition of ICRF-193. The reactions were stopped by adding high concentrations of salt, and the samples were subjected to a clamp-closing analysis modified from Bjergbaek et al. (24Bjergbaek L. Kingma P. Nielsen I.S. Wang Y. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13041-13048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast to 408i, the wild-type enzyme as well as 351i and Y805S caught the circular plasmid DNA in the presence of ATP and ICRF-193 (Fig. 3), in accordance with the previously reported clamp-closing capabilities of the enzymes (11Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol.

Thus, the inability of ICRF-193 to cause cytotoxicity in vivo in yeast cells expressing 351i and Y805S does not correlate with an inability of ICRF-193 to stabilize the closed clamp complex in 351i and Y805S. The results further revealed that the general clamp-closing defect of 408i also abolishes the ability of ICRF-193 to induce a salt-stable topological complex between this enzyme and DNA. Also, the results confirm that 351i, 408i, and Y805S are unable to perform the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, because the occurrence of relaxed DNA is only seen when clamp closure is performed in the presence of wild-type topoisomerase IIα. m-AMSA but Not ICRF-193 Increases the DNA Cleavage Level Obtained with 351i, 408i, and the Wild-type Topoisomerase IIα Enzyme—Traditional topoisomerase II poisons, including m-AMSA, increase the concentration of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks (reviewed by Fortune and Osheroff (7Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Some studies also have reported an ICRF-induced increase in topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage complex formation (17Huang K.C. Gao H. Yamasaki E.F. Grabowski D.R. Liu S. Shen L.L. Chan K.K. Ganapathi R. Snapka R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44488-44494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To test whether the different mutant enzymes as well as wild-type human topoisomerase IIα can respond to m-AMSA and ICRF-193 with increased enzyme-DNA cleavage complex formation, DNA cleavage reactions were performed in the absence or presence of 100 μm m-AMSA or 85 μm ICRF-193 using a 3′-end-labeled DNA substrate. Reactions were stopped with SDS and were subjected to electrophoresis in an 8% SDS gel. Cleavage complexes were identified because of the covalent linkage of labeled DNA after DNA cleavage. As seen in Fig. 4A, upper panel, m-AMSA dramatically increases the DNA cleavage level obtained with the wild-type enzyme as well as that obtained with 351i and 408i. Y805S is unable to cleave DNA to a detectable level even in the presence of drug. Thus, m-AMSA is able to mediate its stimulatory effect on the three cleavage-competent enzymes irrespective of their overall catalytic activity. In contrast, the induction in DNA cleavage complex formation obtained with ICRF-193 is insignificant with all of the enzymes under the reaction condition used in this study (Fig. 4A, lower panel). To investigate whether ICRF-193 stimulates topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage on plasmid DNA containing multiple DNA cleavage sites, topoisomerase II was incubated with circular plasmid DNA in the presence of 50 μm ICRF-193, 50 μm m-AMSA, or 0.5% Me2SO. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS to 1%, and topoisomerase II-mediated double strand cleavage was revealed as linearization of the plasmid DNA after proteinase K digestion (Fig. 4B, upper panel). As expected, the DNA cleavage activity of wild-type human topoisomerase IIα as well as that of 351i and 408i is stimulated by m-AMSA. However, even using a substrate containing multiple topoisomerase II recognition sites, neither of the enzymes shows an increased DNA cleavage level in the presence of ICRF-193 under the present conditions (Fig. 4B, lower panel). The DNA Cleavage-competent Enzymes, 351i and 408i, Both Confer Sensitivity to m-AMSA in Vivo—The cytotoxic effect of m-AMSA is believed to result directly from an increase in the cellular level of DNA double strand breaks, but it has not been investigated whether topoisomerase activity is in fact required for m-AMSA to exert its effect in vivo. To test this possibility, we have compared the m-AMSA sensitivity of yeast cells expressing 351i or 408i, which are able to cleave DNA in vitro but unable to perform strand passage, to the sensitivity of cells expressing either Y805S, which is incapable of both DNA cleavage and strand passage, or the wild-type enzyme, which is capable of both activities. Yeast cells transformed with the empty vector, pRS315, were used to reveal the sensitivity of the yeast strain expressing only yeast topoisomerase II. The cytotoxicity of m-AMSA in the different transformants was assessed by incubating yeast cells either in the absence or presence of 100 μm m-AMSA. Aliquots were removed after 4 and 8 h and plated to determine cell survival after proper dilution. The results show that yeast cells expressing either one of the cleavage-competent enzymes, 351i or 408i, or the wild-type enzyme are sensitive to m-AMSA, whereas cells expressing the cleavage-deficient Y805S enzyme are as insensitive as those harboring the empty vector (Fig. 5). These observations demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of m-AMSA is independent of topoisomerase II activity and solely results from the formation of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes. Furthermore, our data revealed that 351i and 408i, besides being expressed, are capable of mediating DNA cleavage in the yeast cells, in agreement with their in vitro abilities (19Oestergaard V.H.

Recently, several studies have focused on the topoisomerase II-directed ICRF compounds, and accumulating evidence that these drugs work as a type of topoisomerase II poison has been presented (10Kobayashi M.

However, it is presently not clear how the ICRF compounds exert their poisoning action. In this study, we have taken advantage of three biochemically well characterized human topoisomerase IIα enzymes to determine the steps in the catalytic cycle of human topoisomerase IIα required for the enzyme to cause sensitivity to ICRF-193 in yeast cells. In agreement with previous findings (11Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15van Hille B. Hill B.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we have shown that yeast cells expressing wild-type human topoisomerase IIα in trans are hypersensitive to ICRF-193. In contrast, the expression of neither one of the strand passage-deficient human topoisomerase IIα enzymes, 351i, 408i, and Y805S, conferred sensitivity to ICRF-193 in yeast cells, although both 351i and Y805S were found to undergo stable closure of the N-terminal clamp in the presence of ATP and ICRF-193 in vitro. The lack of sensitivity in cells expressing 408i can be explained by the inability of the enzyme to perform clamp closure. Y805S would also be expected to be unable to cause ICRF sensitivity if topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage was a requirement for ICRF cytotoxicity. However, the fact that 351i, capable of both clamp closure and DNA cleavage, still does not confer sensitivity to ICRF-193 demonstrates that neither the DNA cleavage activity of topoisomerase II nor the ability of the drug to induce stable clamp closure can be the main cause of cell killing by ICRF-193. Rather, the strand transport activity of topoisomerase II, which is the only activity lacking in all of the mutant enzymes, seems to be necessary for the cell-killing mechanism of ICRF-193. We also used the yeast system to investigate the cell-killing mechanism of a traditional topoisomerase II poison, m-AMSA. The cleavage-competent topoisomerase IIα enzymes, wild type, 351i, and 408i, were all found to cause hypersensitivity to m-AMSA when expressed in yeast, in agreement with their in vitro capability to respond to m-AMSA with increased levels of DNA cleavage complex formation. In contrast, the expression of the cleavage-deficient Y805S did not elevate the m-AMSA sensitivity of the yeast cells. This strongly suggests that m-AMSA solely works via the DNA cleavage ability of topoisomerase II and that the m-AMSA-induced increase seen in cleavage complex formation in vitro directly reflects the cell-killing mechanism of m-AMSA. The ability of 351i and 408i to cause sensitivity to m-AMSA in yeast further confirms that these enzymes are present in the yeast nucleus and have retained their ability to cleave DNA, in agreement with the previous in vitro characterizations (19Oestergaard V.H. Giangiacomo L. Bjergbaek L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28093-28099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Oestergaard V.H. Bjergbaek L.

The fact that ICRF cytotoxicity depends on the strand passage reaction of topoisomerase II strongly indicates that the drug traps a cellular topoisomerase II reaction intermediate that is toxic to the cell. The inability of 351i to create this toxic intermediate suggests that it arises during the strand passage reaction or at a later step in the catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II. The newly published structure of an N-terminal fragment of yeast topoisomerase II shows that the cavity formed by the N-terminal clamp of eukaryotic topoisomerase II is considerably smaller than that of DNA gyrase and thus cannot hold a T-segment after the clamp has been closed (6Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Consequently, the strand passage-deficient 351i and Y805S enzymes only interact with one DNA segment, the G-segment, once the clamp has been stably closed by the binding of ICRF-193 to the N-terminal domain. This provides an obvious explanation for the lack of ICRF sensitivity displayed by the yeast cells expressing these mutant enzymes compared with those expressing the wild-type human topoisomerase IIα, namely the toxic intermediate being topoisomerase II stably bound to two DNA segments. The lack of cytotoxicity observed with 351i and Y805S can be explained by a model predicting that topoisomerase II clamped around one DNA segment can slide freely on DNA and therefore does not interfere with DNA-tracking machineries during transcription and replication. In contrast, the complex formed between the wild-type topoisomerase II and two DNA segments may be more restricted in its movements along DNA and in this way inhibits both the transcription and replication processes. In support of this model, it has been shown that ICRF-193 inhibits transcription and it has been suggested that collision with the transcription machinery is responsible for the efficient degradation of topoisomerase IIβ that occurs upon ICRF treatment of human cell cultures (25Xiao H. Mao Y. Desai S.D. Zhou N. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3239-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The elevated sensitivity to ICRF displayed by chicken cells deficient in non-homologous end joining indicates that DNA strand breaks do occur upon ICRF treatment (12Adachi N. Suzuki H. Iiizumi S. Koyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35897-35902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Along with the presented model, these breaks could occur upon collision of the complex of topoisomerase II bound to two DNA segments with the replication or transcription machinery. Alternatively, the DNA breaks could result from intolerable strain in the DNA created by the topoisomerase II complex. In conclusion, we have found that ICRF-193 and m-AMSA work by distinct mechanisms where ICRF-193 depends on the strand passage activity of topoisomerase II, most probably the result of the simultaneous interaction of the enzyme with two DNA segments. This is different from m-AMSA that works directly via the DNA cleavage ability of topoisomerase II."

To date, only the RAG proteins and high mobility group protein 1 or 2 have been implicated in 12/23 regulation. Through protein fractionation and biochemical experiments, we find that Ku70/Ku80 and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) modulate RAG-mediated cleavage. Modulation of cleavage by Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs results in preferential inhibition of 12/12 and 23/23 DNA cleavage, thus increasing 12/23 rule specificity. This observation indicates that DNA repair factors, Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs, might be present upstream of the DNA cleavage events and not recruited downstream as is currently thought, assigning new nonrepair functions to the DNA-dependent protein kinase.

V(D)J recombination allows for rearrangement of antigen receptor gene variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments, resulting in a diverse array of antigen receptors. The reaction occurs in B and T cells and requires the recombinase activity of the lymphoid-specific RAG1 and RAG2 (1Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D.

Adv. Immunol. 1997; 64: 39-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombination reaction can be divided into two steps. First, RAGs bind and cleave at the heptamer/coding borders of one 12RSS and one 23RSS, generating hairpin coding ends and blunt 5′-phosphorylated signal ends (4Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Second, DNA breaks are repaired, with hairpin coding ends being opened, processed, and ligated to form an imprecise coding joint, and signal ends are precisely ligated to form a signal joint (4Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that the processing-repair step involves the participation of lymphoid-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferases (TdTS and TdTL) (5Thai T.H.

How all of these factors are specifically recruited and coordinately assembled during V(D)J recombination is largely unknown (for further discussion see Ref. 9Mansilla-Soto J. Cortes P. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it has been proposed that they are recruited through interactions of Ku70/80 with RAG-generated ends (10Jung D. Alt F.W. Cell. 2004; 116: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Recombination must be correctly targeted, both spatially and temporally. One critical level of regulation is that a 12RSS and 23RSS pairing is highly preferred for recombination. This preference, termed the 12/23 rule, operates at the cleavage step of the reaction in vivo and in vitro (13Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol.

Cell. 1996; 85: 107-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with a 3-4-fold preference for a 12/23 substrate. We and others have shown that high mobility group protein 1 or 2 (HMGB1 or HMGB2) stimulates RAG-mediated cleavage (18van Gent D.C. Hiom K. Paull T.T. Gellert M.

Using a cis-RSS cleavage assay containing RAGs, we reported that additional ubiquitous factors present in whole cell extract (WCE) enhance the 12/23 rule (19Sawchuk D.J. Weis-Garcia F. Malik S.

We have fractionated and characterized this extract and here demonstrate that DNA-PKcs and Ku70/Ku80 play a role in 12/23-regulated cleavage. Since the 12/23 rule is set at the cleavage step, this finding implicates DNA-PKcs and Ku70/Ku80 as components of the precleavage complex upstream of DNA repair.

HMGB1—Cells from a 1-liter bacterial (BL21) culture were resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and then successively treated with lysozyme (50 μg/ml) and DNase I (200 μg/ml and 5 mm MgCl2) for 1-2 h at 4 °C. The lysed mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30 min to collect the supernatant. The supernatant was passed through a 2-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column, washed extensively with the wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol), and then the protein was eluted with 350 mm imidazole in wash buffer. The sample was dialyzed in buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) and loaded on a 20-ml DEAE column. Elution was made with a 0.1-1.0 m KCl gradient, and the fractions containing HMGB1 (it was eluted near 220 mm KCl) was pooled together and dialyzed against buffer B. The dialyzed sample was loaded on a 5-ml MonoQ column, and the protein was eluted with a 0.1-0.5 m KCl gradient. His6-HMGB1 was eluted between 200 and 250 mm KCl. The fractions containing HMGB1 were pooled together and dialyzed against 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. 293T cells were grown in spinner culture in Joklik's minimal essential medium (Sigma), and 100 liters of suspension cells were grown and harvested (National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described (16Eastman Q.M. Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 19Sawchuk D.J. Weis-Garcia F. Malik S. Besmer E. Bustin M. Nussenzweig M.C. Cortes P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Column fractions were analyzed by two cleavage assays: one assaying only for cleavage enhancing activity, to locate active peaks, and the other utilizing the positive peak in combination with the S300 activity (regulated cleavage assay). The 293T WCE was loaded onto a High Q column equilibrated with BC100 (20 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The flow-through (possessing the 12/23 enforcing activity) was loaded onto a High S column equilibrated with BH100 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The column was step-eluted at 300, 600, and 1000 mm KCl. The regulatory activity separated into cleavage-enhancing and cleavage-inhibitory activities at this point. For cleavage-enhancing activity, see the Supplementary Material. For cleavage-inhibitory activity, the 300 mm elution from the High S column was further fractionated into several columns, but the inhibitory activity was lost. Using human placenta or HeLa cells as a source, Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and DNA-PKcs were separately purified as previously described (37Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). End-labeled linear double stranded cis-cleavage substrates were obtained by EcoRI digestion of the pDS substrates, liberating a DNA fragment containing the respective RSS pair. 250 ng of the cleavage substrate was then radioactively end-labeled with exo- Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]TTP. The labeled substrates were gel-purified, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9). Body-labeled linear double-stranded cis-cleavage substrates were obtained by PCR using the pJH290 DNAs, RA2, and RA14 primers and [α-32P]dCTP. Radioactive PCR products were first purified by column (Qiagen) and further purified by gel extraction; DNA was quantified by agarose gel-ethidium bromide staining. Assays Containing Linear DNA—Cleavage reaction conditions were as previously described (16Eastman Q.M. Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 19Sawchuk D.J. Weis-Garcia F. Malik S. Besmer E. Bustin M. Nussenzweig M.C. Cortes P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), except that 5 mm MgAc2 was used in the assay (50 μl). For protein purification experiments, assays contained combinations of 100 ng of GST-RAG1 (19 nm), 200 ng of GSTRAG2 (58 nm), column pools containing the cleavage enhancing and cleavage inhibitory activities, and 1.5 μg of HMGB1 (1.2 μm) when required. Reconstitution experiments using GST-RAGs contained the above proteins plus 10-100 ng of Ku70/Ku80 (1.3-13 nm) and 10-100 ng of DNA-PKcs (0.4-4 nm). Reconstitution experiments using Trx-RAGs contained 100 ng of FLAG-Trx-RAG1 (23 nm), 50 ng of HA-Trx-RAG2 (18 nm), 50-500 ng of HMGB1 (40-400 nm), 100-400 ng of Ku70/Ku80 (13-52 nm), and 100-400 ng of DNA-PKcs (4-16 nm). After sample processing, gel electrophoresis, and gel drying, DNA cleavage products were visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For body-labeled linear substrates, signal end (SE) product was used as a direct parameter to quantify cleavage activity. To properly compare between different linear DNA substrates, the levels of SE product were expressed as a percentage of the radioactivity of its corresponding DNA substrate. -Fold preference of 12/23 substrate was determined by comparing the percentages of SE products between 12/23 and 12/12 or 23/23 substrate-containing reactions. Assays Containing Plasmid DNA—Cleavage reactions were carried out with 1 μg (6.7 nm) of pDS plasmids (12/23, 12/12, or 23/23) and the same amount of proteins as above, except that 400 ng of FLAG-Trx-RAG1 (92 nm) and 200 ng of HA-Trx-RAG2 (72 nm) were used. After a 1.5-h incubation, samples were processed exactly as described above, except that precipitated DNA was resuspended in 0.1× TE buffer and digested with the single cutting enzyme NcoI (10 units) for 3 h. After digestion, DNA was fractionated on a native 1.1% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes, UV-cross-linked, and probed with a radiolabeled probe obtained by PCR using the RA2 and RA14 primers and pJH290 12/23 as template. Data were then visualized and quantified as described. SE product was used as a direct parameter to compare between different substrates. The monoclonal antibody 162 (NeoMarkers), recognizing the Ku70/Ku80 native heterodimer, or an isotype-matched control anti-keratin monoclonal antibody LHK6B (NeoMarkers) was cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose. 200 μl of S300 regulatory fraction was incubated with 10 μl of cross-linked anti-Ku or anti-keratin beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and supernatants were transferred to a second microcentrifuge tube and incubated again with 10 μl of anti-Ku or anti-keratin beads. This process was repeated four times. Protein samples were resolved on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Chicken anti-HMGB2 antibody was used for HMGB proteins. For Ku70/Ku80 Western blots, monoclonals N3H10 and 111 were used (Neomarkers). The antibody 18-2 (Neomarkers) was used to detect DNA-PKcs. Identification of a 12/23 Rule Enforcing Activity—Our previous work demonstrated that RAG1 and RAG2 complemented with 293T WCE show strict 12/23 regulation in vitro (19Sawchuk D.J. Weis-Garcia F. Malik S. Besmer E. Bustin M. Nussenzweig M.C. Cortes P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To facilitate the characterization of the regulatory activity found in the 293T WCE, we used cis-cleavage substrates (19Sawchuk D.J. Weis-Garcia F. Malik S. Besmer E. Bustin M. Nussenzweig M.C. Cortes P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) equally labeled at both ends (Fig. 1A). Cleavage at both RSSs yields 90- and 180-base pair radiolabeled DNA fragments from the 12/23, 12/12, and 23/23 substrates; single RSS cleavage events produce fragments of ∼380 or 470 base pairs (Fig. 1A). The 12/23 rule predicts that only coupled cleavage products (cleavage at both RSSs) from the 12/23 substrate should be formed. Copurified GST-core-RAG1 and GST-core-RAG2 (RAG1/2) were able to cleave all substrates (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Purified recombinant HMGB1 added to the reaction preferentially enhanced RAG-mediated cleavage of substrates possessing a 23RSS (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). Since the combination of RAG1/2 and HMGB1 still produced high levels of cleavage of 12/12 and 23/23 substrates, this protein combination was evidently not sufficient to enforce the 12/23 rule (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, the addition of 293T WCE to the reaction gave only coupled cleavage products from the 12/23 substrate and suppressed cleavage of 12/12 and 23/23 substrates in this system (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, 293T WCE possesses an activity that promotes 12/23-regulated cleavage, as previously described (19Sawchuk D.J. Weis-Garcia F. Malik S. Besmer E. Bustin M. Nussenzweig M.C. Cortes P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To identify the factors involved, we generated WCE from a 100-liter 293T cell culture. We then fractionated the WCE using a High Q column as a negative chromatography step. The flow-through from this column was applied to a High S column at 100 mm KCl and step-eluted at 300, 600, and 1000 mm KCl. This resolved two regulatory activities (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). The 300 mm High S fraction (S300) was inhibitory, decreasing RAG-mediated cleavage of all substrates (Fig. 1C, lane 2). In contrast, the 600 mm High S fraction (S600) had a cleavage-enhancing activity similar to that of HMGB1 (compare Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6, with Fig. 1C, lane 3). 12/23-regulated cleavage was reconstituted only when the S300 and S600 fractions were combined, producing a marked 12/23 RSS preference for cleavage (Fig. 1C, lane 4). Thus, inhibitory and enhancing components of the regulatory activity found in the WCE could be separated by High S column chromatography. Purification and Characterization of the Cleavage-enhancing and -inhibitory Activities—We purified the cleavage-enhancing activity present in the S600 pool by fractionation as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. Mass spectrometry identified the protein as human HMGB2 (data not shown). This protein reacted with anti-HMGB2 antibody on Western blots but migrated faster than native HMGB1 or HMGB2 from WCE (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Its faster electrophoretic mobility and binding characteristics on DNA-cellulose suggested that the form of HMGB2 purified is lacking its acidic carboxyl tail (22Isackson P.J. Beaudoin J. Hermodson M.A. Reeck G.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Removal of HMGB acidic tail allows for much higher DNA binding and bending characteristics (23Lee K.B. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, cleavage assays were performed to directly compare the HMGB species found in the DNA-cellulose fraction with full-length HMGB1 (Supplementary Fig. 1D). In the presence of the S300 fraction, HMGB1 conferred 12/23 specificity to the RAGs, yet 1.5 μg of HMGB1 were required to compare with the activity found in 10 ng of the DNA-cellulose cleavage enhancing fraction (Supplementary Fig. 1D). We conclude that the cleavage-enhancing activity found in the purified S600 fraction is due to the presence of this fast migrating form of HMGB2 and that full-length HMGB1 could replace the purified activity. We initially attempted to purify the inhibitory activity found in the S300 fraction by column chromatography, but after two subsequent columns the activity was lost (data not shown). Further attempts to purify the regulatory activity failed. As an alternative strategy to identify and characterize the activity present in the S300 fraction, we assayed for proteins known to participate in the DNA repair stage of V(D)J recombination. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the S300 fraction contained Ku70/Ku80, DNA-PKcs, and XRCC4 proteins (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Inhibitory activities of Ku70/Ku80 toward transcription factors have been described (24Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ku could be responsible for the cleavage-inhibitory activity of the S300 fraction, we immunodepleted Ku70/Ku80 from the S300 fraction using a monoclonal antibody that exclusively recognizes the native heterodimer (Fig. 2B). Two sequential depletions left only residual Ku proteins in the supernatant, which could not be further depleted (Fig. 2B). An isotype control depletion, using anti-keratin antibodies, retained all Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer in the supernatant (Fig. 2B). The Ku70/Ku80-depleted and control-depleted S300 fractions were then tested in the cleavage assay. Control-depleted S300 fractions were unchanged for activity, inhibiting RAG-mediated cleavage of substrates in the absence of HMGB1 and conferring 12/23 regulation in the presence of HMGB1, demonstrating that the depletion protocol itself does not considerably affect the inhibitory activity (Fig. 2C, lanes 10-13). In contrast, anti-Ku heterodimer depletion removed most of the inhibitory activity from the S300 fraction (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 6 and 7). When HMGB1 and Ku-depleted S300 were present in the reaction, regulated cleavage activity was lost, with high levels of cleavage of 12/12 and 23/23 substrates (Fig. 2C, lanes 8 and 9). We conclude that Ku70/Ku80 is required for the activity found in the S300 fraction. Reconstitution of the 12/23 Rule with Purified Components—We then addressed whether Ku70/Ku80 is exclusively responsible for the S300 activity. Immunodepletions may have codepleted other factors complexed with Ku70/Ku80, such as DNA-PKcs. We purified Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and DNA-PKcs in order to reconstitute the reaction (Supplementary Fig. 2). Cleavage assays were performed with combinations of purified RAG1/2, HMGB1, Ku70/80, and DNA-PKcs, whereas protein combinations including the S300 fraction served as controls (Fig. 3). The addition of DNA-PKcs to RAG1/2 or to RAG1/2 with HMGB1 had little effect on the cleavage reaction (Fig. 3). The addition of Ku70/Ku80 to RAG1/2 or to RAG1/2 with HMGB1 inhibited cleavage of all substrates (Fig. 3). This result was identical to the effect of the S300 fraction (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Although purified Ku heterodimer could inhibit cleavage of the substrates, it could not be used in combination with HMGB1 to regain 12/23 specificity, demonstrating that purified Ku70/Ku80 was not sufficient to replace the activity found in the S300 fraction (Fig. 3, compare control lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 25-28). Thus, neither DNA-PKcs alone nor Ku70/Ku80 alone is sufficient to reconstitute 12/23-regulated cleavage in a reaction mixture containing RAG1/2 and HMGB1. In contrast, when both Ku70/Ku80 and DNA-PKcs were added to a reaction containing RAG1/2 and HMGB1, we observed high levels of cleavage of the 12/23 substrate and significant inhibition of cleavage of 12/12 and 23/23 substrates (Fig. 3, lanes 29-32). This combination of proteins achieved the same effect on RAG-mediated cleavage seen with the combination of S300 and HMGB1 (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, increasing amounts of Ku70/Ku80 within this protein combination did not inhibit the high levels of 12/23-regulated cleavage that were observed (Fig. 3, lanes 29-32). In a reaction containing DNA-PKcs, Ku70/Ku80, and RAG1/2, but lacking HMGB1, regulated cleavage was not observed. Instead, inhibition of cleavage of all substrates was seen (Fig. 3, lane 33). In conclusion, Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs, when used in combination with RAG1/2 and HMGB1, increase 12/23 specificity by preferentially inhibiting 12/12 and 23/23 cleavage. In Vitro Cleavage Activity and 12/23 Rule of Thioredoxin-RAGs—Since GST dimerization may create nonfunctional RAG complexes that could interfere in our assays, we wanted to investigate whether the protein requirement for the 12/23 rule was independent of the tag used. For this, we generated Trx-core-RAG-expressing vectors. Thioredoxin was chosen, since it has been shown to increase the solubility of the fusion protein upon extraction from cells, similar to GST, yet does not dimerize. We also added the FLAG tag to the N terminus of Trx-core-RAG1 and the HA tag to the N terminus of Trx-core-RAG2. This protein combination was active in in vivo recombination assays (data not shown). Since the FLAG tag was present only in the RAG1 fusion, we took advantage of the FLAG purification system to purify the FLAG-Trx-core-RAG1·HA-Trx-core-RAG2 (Trx-RAGs) complex. As seen in Supplementary Fig. 3A, we successfully purified the Trx-RAG complex from 293T cells. This protein preparation has three major advantages over the GST-RAGs preparation. First, the RAG1-RAG2 complex is enriched, since RAG2 is purified based on its ability to interact with RAG1 and not with the matrix. Second, the possibility of having RAG1-RAG2 complexes through GST dimerization is eliminated; and third, the presence of degradation products was reduced (Supplementary Fig. 3A and data not shown). We next tested the ability of Trx-RAGs to cleave DNA. To increase the sensitivity of the assay as well as to allow detection of the SE product (direct measurement of cleavage at both RSSs), we radiolabeled the linear DNA fragment by PCR as reported (16Eastman Q.M. Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This substrate was incubated with either GST-RAGs or Trx-RAGs. Trx-RAGs alone were very inefficient in cleaving DNA, yet when HMGB1 was added to the reaction, Trx-RAGs showed a higher DNA cleavage activity compared with GST-RAGs (Supplementary Fig. 3). Under these conditions, we asked whether Trx-RAGs maintain the 12/23 rule in vitro. For that, we incubated Trx-RAGs with 12/23, 12/12, and 23/23 substrates and quantitated the SE product. As observed in Fig. 4A, at 100 ng of HMGB1, Trx-RAGs cleave efficiently only the 12/23 substrate, although cleavage of 12/12 and 23/23 was also observed. Comparing the levels of SE product, we see a 74- and a 185-fold preference over 12/12 and 23/23 substrates, respectively (Fig. 4A). At higher amounts of HMGB1 (1500 ng), we clearly see an increase of DNA cleavage in all substrates. However, the increase of SE product was higher with 12/12 and 23/23 substrates, resulting in a very significant decrease in 12/23 specificity. The -fold preference over 12/12 and 23/23 substrates was 15 and 26, reflecting a decrease of 5 and 7 times in 12/23 regulation, respectively (Fig. 4A). GST-RAGs were less efficient in maintaining the 12/23 rule in the presence of 100 ng of HMGB1, with a -fold preference over 12/12 and 23/23 of 5.1 and 8.8, respectively. However, 12/23 specificity was not significantly affected by increasing the HMGB1 concentration (Fig. 4A). Overall, Trx-RAGs show higher activity in cleavage and 12/23 regulation when they"
https://openalex.org/W2056271204,"Chimeras of Hxt2 and Hxt1, high affinity and low affinity glucose transporters, respectively, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were previously constructed by random replacement of each of the 12 transmembrane segments (TMs) of Hxt2 with the corresponding region of Hxt1. Characterization of these chimeras revealed that at least TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 of Hxt2 are required for high affinity transport activity. To determine which amino acid residues in these TMs are important for high affinity glucose transport, we systematically shuffled all of the 20 residues in these regions that differ between Hxt2 and Hxt1. Analysis of 60 independent mutant strains identified as expressing high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity by selection on glucose-limited agar plates revealed that Leu-201 in TM5 of Hxt2 is most important for such activity and that either Cys-195 or Phe-198 is also required for maximal activity."

These proteins nick the plasmid in a site- and strand-specific manner prior to transfer of the cut strand from donor to recipient. TraI36, the relaxase domain of TraI from plasmid F factor, binds a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotide containing an F factor sequence with high affinity and sequence specificity. To better understand the energetics of this interaction, we examined the temperature, salt, and pH dependence of TraI36 recognition. Binding is entropically driven below 25 °C and enthalpically driven at higher temperatures. van't Hoff analysis yields an estimated ΔCP0 of binding (–3300 cal mol–1 K–1) that is larger and more negative than that observed for most double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-binding proteins. Based on analyses of circular dichroism data and the crystal structure of the unliganded protein, we attribute the ΔCP0 to both burial of hydrophobic surface area and coupled folding and binding of the protein. The salt dependence of the binding indicates that several ssDNA phosphates are buried in the complex, and the pH dependence of the binding suggests that some of these ssDNA phosphates form ionic interactions with basic residues of the protein. Although data are available for relatively few sequence-specific ssDNA-binding proteins, sufficient differences exist between TraI36 and other proteins to indicate that, like dsDNA-binding proteins, ssDNA-binding proteins use different motifs and combinations of forces to achieve specific recognition.

These studies have shown that nature employs a variety of protein structural elements to recognize DNA, including β-sheets, α-helices, and loops. Protein-DNA complexes are stabilized in myriad ways, including hydrophobic, van der Waals, and ionic interactions. Binding specificity, however, is frequently mediated through formation of patterns of hydrogen bonding interactions between the protein and DNA bases in the major groove (2Garvie C.W. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies indicate that sequence-specific interactions between protein and dsDNA are fashioned from a broad base of structures and binding modes. In contrast, relatively few studies have examined the sequence-specific interaction between proteins and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The available structures of sequence-specific ssDNA-binding proteins involved in various aspects of DNA metabolism suggest that ssDNA binding is also accomplished using a variety of protein folds including an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold and modified RNA recognition motifs (4Mitton-Fry R.M.

More detailed information on binding by these proteins through mutagenesis and biophysical characterization is now becoming available. F factor TraI plays an integral role in the process of F bacterial conjugation, cleaving and unwinding a single strand of the plasmid prior to transfer. The 36-kDa relaxase domain of F factor TraI (TraI36) binds its origin of transfer binding site oligonucleotide with a subnanomolar dissociation constant and with extreme sequence specificity (18Stern J.C. Schildbach J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11586-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand the molecular basis of the binding of TraI36 to ssDNA, we examined the effects of changing temperature, pH, and ionic strength on the binding affinity. Protein and Oligonucleotides—The 22-base 3′-TAMRA-labeled oligonucleotide F-TAM (5′-TTTGCGTGGGGTGTGGTGCTTT-3′) containing the TraI origin of transfer binding site (19Sherman J.A. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26220-26226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and purified as described (18Stern J.C. Schildbach J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11586-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TraI36, a 36-kDa N-terminal domain of F Factor TraI possessing relaxase activity, was expressed and purified as described (20Street L.M. Harley M.J. Stern J.C. Larkin C. Williams S.L. Miller D.L. Dohm J.A. Rodgers M.E. Schildbach J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1646: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Affinity Measurements—Affinity of TraI36 for the single-stranded F-TAM oligonucleotide was measured by following changes in fluorescence intensity and anisotropy upon protein titration as described (18Stern J.C. Schildbach J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11586-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) except the standard buffer used was 20 mm bis-tris propane (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. For assessing salt dependence of binding, a solution of 20 mm bis-tris propane (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mm EDTA was supplemented with NaCl, NaBr, KCl, or KBr in concentrations ranging from 100 to 500 mm. To determine the relationship between pH and affinity, a solution of 100 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA was buffered at the desired pH using 20 mm bis-tris propane (pH 9.5–6.5), 20 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 5.5–6.5), or 20 mm CAPS (pH 9.7–11.0). Salt and pH dependence measurements were conducted at 25 °C. Salt release stoichiometry was calculated as follows. SKobs≡δlnKobs/δln[MX](Eq. 1) The confidence intervals for the SKobs values were calculated from the standard error of the linear regression fit and the t distribution as described (21Rosner B. Fundamentals of Biostatistics. 4th Ed. Duxbury Press, Belmont, CA1995: 462-465Google Scholar). van't Hoff Analysis—Affinity titrations were performed at temperatures from 7 to 35 °C in the standard buffer. The pH of the buffer in this range of temperatures should vary between 8.1 and 7.2. Binding affinity does not differ significantly over this pH range. Results were analyzed as described (22Ackroyd P.C. Cleary J. Glick G.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The data were plotted as ln Ka (the equilibrium affinity constant) versus 1/T and fitted with the equation, lnKobs=ΔCP0/R[TH/T−ln(TS/T)−1](Eq. 2) where ΔCP0 is the heat capacity change R is the gas constant, TH is the temperature at which ΔH0 is zero, and TS is the temperature at which ΔS0 is zero. Kaleidagraph 3.5 (Synergy Software) was used to fit models to the data. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism (CD) wavelength spectra of 10 μm TraI36 in 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CAPS at either pH 9.7 or pH 10.5 were collected on an AVIV 62DS CD spectrometer using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette. The signal was averaged for 5 s at each 1-nm interval. Thermal denaturation of these samples was performed using the same instrument and cuvette with unfolding followed by loss of negative ellipticity at 220 nm. The temperature was varied from 25 to 75 °C in 1 °C steps, and the CD signal was averaged for 30 s following a 1-min equilibration at each temperature step. The relaxase domain of F factor TraI (TraI36) binds to ssDNA with a high degree of sequence specificity. Single base changes in the single-stranded binding site oligonucleotide can reduce TraI36 affinities by up to 8000-fold (18Stern J.C. Schildbach J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11586-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, only the telomere-binding protein Pot1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe approaches this level of sequence-specific recognition of ssDNA (23Lei M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14560-14568Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Temperature Dependence of Binding—The crystal structure of the uncomplexed TraI36 protein (13Datta S. Larkin C. Schildbach J.F. Structure. 2003; 11: 1369-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the sequence specificity of TraI36 for its ssDNA binding site (18Stern J.C. Schildbach J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11586-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the specific ssDNA recognition of this protein requires a high degree of surface complementarity between the protein and DNA bases. To better define the energetics of binding, affinity titrations were performed between 5 and 35 °C to estimate the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding. The ln Ka was plotted versus 1/T (K) for van't Hoff analysis (Fig. 1). Highest affinity binding occurs at ∼25 °C. Above this temperature, binding is enthalpically driven, whereas binding is entropically driven at lower temperatures. The deviation of the plotted data from linearity reflects a large negative ΔCP0 of binding (–3.3 kcal mol–1 K–1), which is commonly seen among sequence-specific interactions of proteins with dsDNA (1Hard T. Lundback T. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 62: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A large negative ΔCP0 of binding might result from the removal of solvent-accessible surface areas and from conformational changes upon binding (1Hard T. Lundback T. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 62: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Ha J.H. Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 801-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Because the binding showed temperature dependence, with affinity falling at temperatures greater than 25 °C, we investigated whether results might be influenced by conformational changes in the protein and/or oligonucleotide at the higher temperatures. The TraI36 protein does not undergo significant structural rearrangements at the temperatures used in the van't Hoff analysis. Thermal denaturations monitored by circular dichroism (CD) indicate that TraI36 maintains a baseline signal through 45 °C and undergoes a highly cooperative unfolding transition with a Tm of ∼55 °C (20Street L.M. Harley M.J. Stern J.C. Larkin C. Williams S.L. Miller D.L. Dohm J.A. Rodgers M.E. Schildbach J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1646: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of TraI36 do not change between 5 and 35 °C (not shown), also suggesting that TraI36 undergoes no large scale structural changes over the temperature range used in the binding measurements. Other experiments provide no evidence for temperature-induced changes in oligonucleotide structure. First, because optical properties of DNA bases can change with changing environments, we collected absorbance spectra of F-TAM at different temperatures over the range from 5 to 35 °C. The spectra did not change when the temperatures changed, meaning that there were no observable differences in the environment of the bases, including intra- and intermolecular interactions (data not shown). Second, emission spectra of the F-TAM oligonucleotide using excitation wavelengths of 520 and 540 nm were taken at 5 and 35 °C. The normalized spectra were identical, providing no evidence of heterogeneity in the solutions at either temperature and no evidence of changes to the solution because of temperature (data not shown). Third, TraI36 binds with similar affinity to the F-TAM oligonucleotide and a smaller TAMRA-labeled oligonucleotide that contains the 5′ 17 bases of F-TAM (F-TAM17), both at 25 (18Stern J.C. Schildbach J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11586-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and 35 °C (not shown). The similarity in the temperature dependence of binding for these two oligonucleotides suggests that at least the 5 bases at the 3′-end of F-TAM do not participate in intra- or intermolecular interactions that affect binding over this temperature range. The large negative ΔCP0 for TraI36 binding its specific site (–3.3 kcal mol–1 K–1) is greater than the values observed for sequence-specific binding of many proteins to duplex DNA (24Ha J.H. Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 801-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 25Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 26Poon G.M. Gross P. Macgregor Jr., R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Analysis of the site-specific dsDNA binding of proteins indicates that much of the ΔCP0 observed stems from the hydrophobic effect, specifically the burial of nonpolar surfaces upon binding (1Hard T. Lundback T. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 62: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Ha J.H. Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 801-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 25Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 27Gallagher K. Sharp K. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 769-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We expect that considerable nonpolar surface is buried upon binding given the extensive region (∼11 bases) of ssDNA specifically recognized by TraI36 (18Stern J.C. Schildbach J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11586-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding cleft of TraI36 contains numerous small, nonaromatic hydrophobic amino acids and a number of pits large enough to accommodate DNA bases in a knob-into-hole fashion, both of which are consistent with burial of considerable hydrophobic surface area upon binding. Indeed, if the observed ΔCP0 were due entirely to burial of hydrophobic surfaces upon binding, the entropic contribution to binding could be estimated (25Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) according to Equation 3. ΔSHE0(T)=1.35ΔCp0 ln(T/386)(Eq. 3) At 301 K, TS, or the temperature at which the total entropic contribution to binding is zero, is 1100 entropic units (cal K–1 mol–1), which translates into a ΔG =–330 kcal mol–1. Because there probably are factors other than burial of hydrophobic surface area contributing to ΔCP0 (discussed below), this estimate of the entropic contribution to binding represents an upper limit. Directly measuring the surface area buried upon binding will require determination of the structure of the TraI36-ssDNA complex, which we are actively pursuing. By definition, at TS the entropic contribution to binding is offset by other entropic terms. The contributions of two of these terms, the reduction in translational and rotational entropy upon forming the complex and the polyelectrolyte effect, are thought to be small relative to the contributions from the hydrophobic effect (25Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 27Gallagher K. Sharp K. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 769-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The remaining difference between the terms is often attributed to coupled folding and binding (25Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). CD data provide evidence that folding of TraI36 and DNA does occur upon binding. Summed CD spectra of uncomplexed TraI36 and a 22-base unlabeled single-stranded oligonucleotide were compared with the CD spectra of an equimolar solution of protein and oligonucleotide (20Street L.M. Harley M.J. Stern J.C. Larkin C. Williams S.L. Miller D.L. Dohm J.A. Rodgers M.E. Schildbach J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1646: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The negative ellipticity at 222 nm is increased, indicating formation or stabilization of α-helical structures. The peak of the positive ellipticity between 270 and 290 nm, which is attributable to the oligonucleotide, increases in magnitude and shifts to a lower wavelength, suggesting that in the complex the oligonucleotide is adopting a particular conformation or limited ensemble of conformations. The crystal structure of the uncomplexed TraI36 protein has two regions in which the electron density was insufficient to trace, presumably because the regions are poorly ordered (13Datta S. Larkin C. Schildbach J.F. Structure. 2003; 11: 1369-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One of these regions (amino acids 236–267) is located near the binding cleft, and it is feasible that this segment becomes ordered as the protein binds to ssDNA. It is therefore plausible that the large negative ΔCP0 observed for the sequence-specific binding of TraI36 to ssDNA has substantial contributions not only from burial of hydrophobic surface area but also from coupled folding and binding. One specific way in which the oligonucleotide may contribute to the observed ΔCP0 of the interaction is through unstacking of bases upon binding. The more negative ΔCP0 observed when Escherichia coli single-stranded binding protein binds to single-stranded oligodeoxyadenylates compared with when binding oligodeoxypyrimidines was attributed to unstacking of adenines coupled with binding of the protein (28Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7388-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The F-TAM oligonucleotide has a high guanine content, and it is likely that the bases are stacked to some degree when the oligonucleotide is in the unbound state. The base composition of a ssDNA oligonucleotide, attributed at least in part to base stacking, has been shown to affect its solution characteristics, including flexibility (29Goddard N.L. Bonnet G. Krichevsky O. Libchaber A. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2000; 85: 2400-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Salt and pH Dependence of Binding—Electrostatic interactions, especially between amino acid side chains of basic residues and the DNA phosphate backbone, contribute frequently to DNA binding. Binding affinity is therefore often influenced by salt concentration. The van't Hoff analysis indicates that the binding energy has a significant enthalpic contribution and that the binding is enthalpically driven above 25 °C. To further investigate the electrostatic contribution to the TraI36-DNA interaction, we assessed the effects of several salts on TraI36 affinity for ssDNA. The affinity of TraI36 for the oligonucleotide decreases as salt concentrations increase. In Fig. 2, the ln Ka of TraI36 is plotted versus the ln of salt concentration for NaCl, NaBr, KCl, and KBr. As has been observed for dsDNA-binding proteins (24Ha J.H. Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 801-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 30Barkley M.D. Lewis P.A. Sullivan G.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3842-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) the identity of the anion has a greater impact than the cation on the affinity of TraI36 for ssDNA with higher affinities in the presence of Cl– than Br–. For example, the affinity of TraI36 is consistently higher at a given concentration of NaCl than at the same concentration of NaBr, whereas the affinities for NaCl and KCl are similar. Similarly, as for dsDNA-binding proteins, the affinity of TraI36 for ssDNA in solutions with acetate as an anion is higher than for those with Cl– or Br– (not shown). The salt dependence of binding can reflect conformational changes in the protein upon binding, ion release from the DNA upon binding (polyelectrolyte effect), and ion pairing in the complex. As described previously, there is evidence of conformational changes for both protein and DNA upon binding, and these could contribute to the apparent salt dependence of binding. Regarding the polyelectrolyte effect, the slope of the linear fits to the data, SKobs, is often related to the stoichiometry of salt release for the binding event. SKobs values for NaCl (–4.16) and KCl (–4.26) are smaller than the values for NaBr (–5.03) and KBr (–5.04). Although the salt dependence of binding is usually dominated by the effect of cation release, the different values for the Cl– and Br– salts may reflect a small effect because of anion release upon binding. The confidence limits of the slopes for all data sets overlap at the 90% level, however, limiting the conclusions that we can draw from the data. If we assume that there is only a minor influence of anion release on binding, then the SKobs values can be interpreted in terms of the number of cations released upon binding. Relating the SKobs values to the product of 0.7 and the number of cations released (22Ackroyd P.C. Cleary J. Glick G.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) yields an estimate of 6 (NaCl, KCl) or 7 (NaBr, KBr) cations released from the phosphates upon binding. This estimate, however, assumes a constant concentration of cations along the length of DNA and may be influenced by strong end effects (31Olmsted M.C. Anderson C.F. Record Jr., M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7766-7770Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Even if this is an overestimate of the number of cations released upon binding, it strongly suggests that a number of ssDNA phosphates are buried in the TraI36-ssDNA complex. The TraI36 SKobs values and the estimated number of cations released by TraI36 binding are in the same range as many of those reported for dsDNA-binding proteins, including EcoRI (SKobs =–8; cations released = 7) (32Sidorova N.Y. Rau D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 801-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and lac repressor (cations released = 7.5–9.3) (30Barkley M.D. Lewis P.A. Sullivan G.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3842-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The SKobs values are similar to the results for the KCl dependence of the binding of the ssDNA-binding domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Cdc13 (33Anderson E.M. Halsey W.A. Wuttke D.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3751-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Oxytrichia nova telomere end-binding protein α subunit reportedly shows only a 2-fold lower affinity for its target ssDNA sequence in 400 mm compared with 100 mm NaCl (34Classen S. Lyons D. Cech T.R. Schultz S.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9269-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Pot1 protein of S. pombe also shows only a minor salt dependence of binding consistent with formation of a single ion pair between protein and ssDNA (23Lei M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14560-14568Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whereas TraI36 interacts with phosphate groups in its ssDNA binding site, there are relatively few basic amino acids within the TraI36 binding site (20Street L.M. Harley M.J. Stern J.C. Larkin C. Williams S.L. Miller D.L. Dohm J.A. Rodgers M.E. Schildbach J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1646: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that few ion pairs may form between the phosphates and the protein side chains. Binding affinities were measured from pH 5.5 to 10.5 (sodium cacodylate buffer was used from pH 5.5 to 7.5, bis-tris propane buffer from pH 6.5 to 9.5, and CAPS buffer from pH 9.7 to 10.5) (Fig. 3). Over the pH range from 5.5 to 9.7, the binding appears relatively independent of pH. The binding affinity drops significantly at pH 10.5, with the Kd value rising 30-fold relative to that at pH 9.7. The affinity continues to fall as the pH increases, with no binding observed at pH 11 at 900 nm TraI36 (not shown). The reduced affinity at pH 10.5 relative to pH 9.7 does not appear to be because of a destabilization of the protein at the higher pH. TraI36 has comparable CD spectra at the two pH values (not shown). Furthermore, although the apparent Tm of TraI36 is lower at pH 10.5 (∼47 °C) than at pH 9.7 (∼51 °C), the binding data were collected at 25 °C, a temperature well below the start of the unfolding transition (not shown). The correlation of rising pH and the presumable deprotonation of basic residues in the binding site suggests that the cation release upon binding is accompanied by formation of salt bridges between some of the phosphates and some of the protein side chains. Although the fluorescence intensity of the TAMRA dye of the F-TAM oligonucleotide increases upon TraI36 binding at all pH values tested, at pH 10.5 the fluorescence anisotropy drops upon binding whereas at all other pH values tested the anisotropy increases upon binding (Fig. 4). This suggests that some aspect of the environment of the TAMRA dye and its resulting behavior is altered at the higher pH. Consistent with these observations, substituting Arg-150 in TraI36 with an Ala reduces affinity for ssDNA by ∼30-fold and also affects the anisotropic characteristics of the fluorophore (35Harley M.J. Toptygin D. Troxler T. Schildbach J.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6460-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A variety of factors may contribute to the sequence-specific binding of a protein to a DNA sequence: hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, base stacking, the polyelectrolyte effect of DNA, and dehydration at the complex interface (1Hard T. Lundback T. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 62: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Garvie C.W. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 3Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Jacobson L.A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic studies allow for the elucidation of the different factors involved in a binding event. However, the vast majority of thermodynamic studies of sequence-specific DNA binding have been done on proteins that recognize dsDNA. Very few studies have been done on sequence-specific ssDNA binders. Perhaps the most thorough study of the energetics of a protein binding to ssDNA sequence specifically was actually performed on an anti-ssDNA lupus antibody (22Ackroyd P.C. Cleary J. Glick G.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), rather than on a protein involved in DNA metabolism. Here we show that TraI36 exhibits many characteristics of dsDNA-binding proteins, including a large negative ΔCP0, an involvement of electrostatics and a corresponding salt dependence of binding, and a coupling of binding with protein folding. A quantitatively similar involvement of electrostatics has also been demonstrated for the binding of the ssDNA-binding domain of S. cerevisiae Cdc13, although a mutagenesis study indicates that the hydrophobic and especially aromatic side chains of this protein make greater energetic contributions to binding than the charged side chains (33Anderson E.M. Halsey W.A. Wuttke D.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3751-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An analysis of the binding of the α subunit of O. nova telomere end-binding protein also suggests that the binding specificity of this protein, like that of Cdc13, correlates not only with the stacking of the DNA bases, aromatic side chains, and other bases but also with the formation of a specific pattern of hydrogen bonding (34Classen S. Lyons D. Cech T.R. Schultz S.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9269-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The specificity of the Pot1 telomere-binding protein is achieved through both intramolecular base stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions in the bound ssDNA as well as intermolecular hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between amino acid side chains and DNA bases (16Lei M. Podell E.R. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Nature. 2003; 426: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, TraI36 has few aromatic residues within its binding cleft, meaning that few if any stacking interactions occur between the protein and DNA bases and strongly suggesting that the details of the binding by these proteins differ in significant ways. Whereas the same forces that contribute to sequence specificity of binding to dsDNA contribute to the binding of TraI36 to ssDNA, the larger estimated negative ΔCP0 observed for TraI36 than has been observed for most dsDNA-binding proteins may reflect differences in the form of DNA bound. Burial of hydrophobic surface area and unstacking of DNA bases may both contribute to the large negative ΔCP0. The ssDNA bound by TraI36, because it is not involved in base pairing, likely has more surface area available per base than a similar length of dsDNA. Similarly, the lack of base pairing and the resulting increased flexibility of the ssDNA suggest that the bases of ssDNA are more likely than those of dsDNA to adopt unstacked, non-B-like conformations when interacting with a protein to achieve binding specificity. The unstacked bases and their interactions with each other and with the protein seen in the crystal structures of the O. nova telomere end-binding protein bound to ssDNA strongly suggest that the flexibility of ssDNA contributes to the ssDNA recognition by this protein (5Horvath M.P.

When the purified membrane-bound kidney enzyme was solubilized with SDS or TDS concentrations just sufficient to cause complete solubilization, but not at concentrations severalfold higher, the enzyme retained quaternary structure, exhibiting α,α-, α,β-, β,β-, and α,γ-associations as detected by chemical cross-linking. The presence of solubilized oligomers was confirmed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. This solubilized enzyme had no ATPase activity and was not phosphorylated by ATP, but it retained the ability to occlude Rb<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>. This, and comparison of cross-linking patterns obtained with different reagents, suggested that the transmembrane domains of the enzyme are more resistant to SDS-induced unfolding than its other domains. These findings (<i>a</i>) indicate that the partially unfolded oligomer(s) retaining partial function is the intermediate in the SDS-induced denaturation of the native membrane enzyme having the minimum oligomeric structure of (α,β,γ)<sub>2</sub> and (<i>b</i>) suggest potential functions for Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase with intrinsically unfolded domains. Mixtures of solubilized/partially unfolded enzyme and membrane-bound enzyme exhibited cross-linking patterns and Na<sup>+</sup> occlusion capacities different from those of either enzyme species, suggesting that the two interact. Formation of the partially unfolded enzyme during standard purification procedure for the preparation of the membrane-bound enzyme was shown, indicating that it is necessary to ensure the separation of the partially unfolded enzyme from the membrane-bound enzyme to avoid the distortion of the properties of the latter."
