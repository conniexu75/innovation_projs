https://openalex.org/W2020153124,"In mammals the weight of the heart, kidney, lungs, and other organs can be related to total body weight through power laws (allometry). Weights of primate organs are analyzed by this technique. Allometric coefficients and size-independent organ-weight or body-form ratios may be used to compare primates, including humans, and other mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2095412119,With each flurry of rapid eye movements during the sleep of human subjects there is a decreased amplitude of respiration and a slight increase in rate. Occasionally the rhythmic breathing pattern may even resemble Cheyne-Stokes respiration. The consistency of this breathing pattern suggests that respiration in this stage of sleep is not a direct function of dream content.

https://openalex.org/W2095504882,"A stable papain membrane has been prepared on a collodion matrix by absorbing papain in a collodion membrane and then cross-linking the papain with bisdiazobenzidine 3,3'-disulfonic acid. The pH-dependence of the activity of the enzyme membrane on the low-molecular-weight substrate, benzoylarginine ethyl ester, was found to differ from that of crystalline papain; the activity was low in the neutral pH range where the native enzyme has its optimum and high at alkaline pH. This anomalous behavior is due to a lowering of the local pH within the membrane as a result of the release of acid by the enzymic hydrolysis of the ester substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2077345539,Methotrexate-promoted survival of mice bearing different transplantable leukemias was compared with uptake of the drug by leukemia cells in vitro. A high degree of correlation (r(2) = 0.88) showed that uptake may be a major determinant of the antitumor activity of methotrexate against transplantable mouse leukemias.

https://openalex.org/W2103750038,"Blood flows in the hepatic artery and portal vein have been measured with a square-wave, electromagnetic flow meter. Hepatic arterial flow increased when portal venous flow was decreased, but, when hepatic arterial flow was decreased, portal venous flow also decreased. The relation between the two blood systems can be explained as the simple mechanical effect of interposing a slower-flowing stream in the path of a faster-flowing stream."

The phospholipid component displays the characteristic gauche conformation for the choline residue and the gauche-gauche conformation for the glycerol moiety. Therefore, a possible model for the structures of phospholipids is similar to that proposed by Finean."

At the end of the pupal molt the salivary gland breaks down. While acid phosphatase in areas of nondegenerated cells is still restricted to the structures mentioned, in degenerated areas the enzyme is freely distributed in the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W50347267,"Three different imidazole compounds are known to induce the enzymes that degrade histidine in Aerobackr aerogenes (l-4). Two of them, histidine and urocanate, are, respectively, the substrate and product of the first enzyme, histidine ammonialyase; the third, imidazolepropionate, is a nonmetabolizable analogue of urocanate. Previous studies with this system did not discriminate between the possibility that histidine and urocanate act as inducers independently, or that histidine is an inducer solely by virtue of its conversion to urocanate. In order to distinguish between these alternatives a number of mutants of A. aerogenes unable to degrade histidine were isolated. Some of the mutants are impaired in the ability to convert histidine to urocanate because of a low level of the histidine ammonia-lyase: in these mutants histidine is a poor inducer, whereas urocanate and imidazolepropionate behave as in the parent organism. Other mutants lack the enzyme urocanase; these mutants have high levels of the other histidine-degrading enzymes even in the absence of added inducer. These observations suggested that exogenously supplied or endogenously produced urocanate, rather than histidine, is the inducer. This view is strongly supported by a detailed biochemical study of these mutants."

https://openalex.org/W1993800768,"Highly purified preparations of Hageman factor, a potent clot-promoting agent in normal mammalian plasma, had a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 5S before activation. After activation, the Hageman factor behaved as a much less soluble or larger molecule during ultracentrifugation and gel filtration. No significant change in sedimentation behavior was noted when the Hageman factor in plasma deficient in plasma thromboplastin antecedent was activated. The altered sedimentation behavior of purified activated Hageman factor probably reflects its decreased solubility in aqueous media."

https://openalex.org/W55110292,"The role of erotic acid as a precursor in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is well established (2). However, little is known about the mechanism by which erotic acid produces a grossly fatty liver in rats when it is fed as 1% of their diet (3). Livers from erotic acid-fed rats contain high levels of triglycerides (4)) cholesterol (5), and acid-soluble uridine nucleotides but depressed levels of adenine and pyridine nucleotides (6). Furthermore, in such livers there is an inhibition of pyridine nucleotide synthesis (7, 8), cholesterol biosynthesis (5), and lipoprotein secretion (9, lo), the latter being an apparent cause of hepatic fat accumulation. These effects can be prevented or rapidly reversed by addition of a small amount of adenine to the diet (8, 10-12). A deficiency of hepatic adenine nucleotides may be a primary factor in the chain of erotic acid-induced effects. Several compounds which depress hepatic adenine nucleotide concentrations, such as ethionine (13), 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine (14), and others (15), produce changes in liver similar to those produced by erotic acid. It is not known why erotic acid feeding depresses the concentration of adenine nucleotides. The suggestion has been made (6, 7) that because large amounts of PPribose-P are utilized for conversion of erotic acid to uridine 5â€™-phosphate, other PP-ribose-P-requiring biosynthetic reactions, including purine biosynthesis, may be inhibited. Therefore, it was of interest to determine the rate of purine biosynthesis in livers of erotic acid-fed rats. To this end, incorporation in viva of formate-14C and of glycine-2-14C into liver purines was determined. Incorporation into liver protein and lipid was also measured, primarily to detect any erotic acid-induced changes in the endogenous hepatic pools of formate and glycine. It was found that erotic acid, rather than being inhibitory, stimulated incorporation of 14C into acid-soluble as well as into nucleic acid purines. Furthermore, this effect of erotic acid was completely nullified by the addition of small amounts of adenine to the diet."

In the rat, 2 months after portacaval anastomosis, there is a generalized increase in the histamine content of the soft tissues, and the increase is most marked in the acid-secreting portion of the stomach. This appears to be secondary to increased activity of the histamine-synthesizing enzyme, histidine decarboxylase. A histidine decarboxylase inhibitor can prevent such hypersecretion of acid in the stomach of these animals."

Both proteins are present in first-generation hybrids between these species and they segregate in second-generation and backcross hybrids, as expected of a single-factor difference. This first genetic study suggests that shifts observed in the absorption spectra maxima of visual pigments are related to substitutions of amino acids in the visual proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1970460468,"The passage of a direct electric current across a fixed-charge membrane interposed between neutral electrolyte solutions can give rise to the production of hydrogen and hydroxide ions at the solution-membrane boundary in equivalent amounts, each of which can approach and equal the number of faradays passed. At this unique boundary, the electric field can inhibit the rate of recombination of hydrogen and hydroxide ions strongly enough to increase the dissociation constant of water and other weak electrolytes by several orders of magnitude. These observations lead to a model of the gastric secretory process wherein the gastric potential, primarily due to the activity of a chloride-ion pump, is applied across an adjacent ion-selective membrane also present in the mucosa. The dissociating weak electrolyte can be water, to produce hydrogen ions in the stomach and hydroxide ions which combine with carbon dioxide in the blood, or it can be carbonic acid to produce bicarbonate directly."
