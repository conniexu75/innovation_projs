https://openalex.org/W1551951435,"Metabarcoding is an emerging genetic tool to rapidly assess biodiversity in ecosystems. It involves high-throughput sequencing of a standard gene from an environmental sample and comparison to a reference database. However, no consensus has emerged regarding laboratory pipelines to screen species diversity and infer species abundances from environmental samples. In particular, the effect of primer bias and the detection limit for specimens with a low biomass has not been systematically examined, when processing samples in bulk. We developed and tested a DNA metabarcoding protocol that utilises the standard cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding fragment to detect freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa. DNA was extracted in bulk, amplified in a single PCR step, and purified, and the libraries were directly sequenced in two independent MiSeq runs (300-bp paired-end reads). Specifically, we assessed the influence of specimen biomass on sequence read abundance by sequencing 31 specimens of a stonefly species with known haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass (experiment I). Then, we tested the recovery of 52 different freshwater invertebrate taxa of similar biomass using the same standard barcoding primers (experiment II). Each experiment was replicated ten times to maximise statistical power. The results of both experiments were consistent across replicates. We found a distinct positive correlation between species biomass and resulting numbers of MiSeq reads. Furthermore, we reliably recovered 83% of the 52 taxa used to test primer bias. However, sequence abundance varied by four orders of magnitudes between taxa despite the use of similar amounts of biomass. Our metabarcoding approach yielded reliable results for high-throughput assessments. However, the results indicated that primer efficiency is highly species-specific, which would prevent straightforward assessments of species abundance and biomass in a sample. Thus, PCR-based metabarcoding assessments of biodiversity should rely on presence-absence metrics."
https://openalex.org/W2531506996,"Progesterone receptor (PR) expression is used as a biomarker of oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) function and breast cancer prognosis. Here we show that PR is not merely an ERα-induced gene target, but is also an ERα-associated protein that modulates its behaviour. In the presence of agonist ligands, PR associates with ERα to direct ERα chromatin binding events within breast cancer cells, resulting in a unique gene expression programme that is associated with good clinical outcome. Progesterone inhibited oestrogen-mediated growth of ERα(+) cell line xenografts and primary ERα(+) breast tumour explants, and had increased anti-proliferative effects when coupled with an ERα antagonist. Copy number loss of PGR, the gene coding for PR, is a common feature in ERα(+) breast cancers, explaining lower PR levels in a subset of cases. Our findings indicate that PR functions as a molecular rheostat to control ERα chromatin binding and transcriptional activity, which has important implications for prognosis and therapeutic interventions."

In the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are essential for the development of infected root nodules. We have identified a gene in Lotus japonicus, Epr3, encoding a receptor-like kinase that controls this infection. We show that epr3 mutants are defective in perception of purified EPS, and that EPR3 binds EPS directly and distinguishes compatible and incompatible EPS in bacterial competition studies. Expression of Epr3 in epidermal cells within the susceptible root zone shows that the protein is involved in bacterial entry, while rhizobial and plant mutant studies suggest that Epr3 regulates bacterial passage through the plant's epidermal cell layer. Finally, we show that Epr3 expression is inducible and dependent on host perception of bacterial nodulation (Nod) factors. Plant-bacterial compatibility and bacterial access to legume roots is thus regulated by a two-stage mechanism involving sequential receptor-mediated recognition of Nod factor and EPS signals."
https://openalex.org/W1909117315,"Metformin, a frontline treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, decreases production of the pro-form of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in response to LPS in macrophages. We found that it specifically inhibited pro-IL-1β production, having no effect on TNF-α. Furthermore, metformin boosted induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in response to LPS. We ruled out a role for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the effect of metformin because activation of AMPK with A769662 did not mimic metformin here. Furthermore, metformin was still inhibitory in AMKPα1- or AMPKβ1-deficient cells. The activity of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) was inhibited by metformin. Another complex I inhibitor, rotenone, mimicked the effect of metformin on pro-IL-1β and IL-10. LPS induced reactive oxygen species production, an effect inhibited by metformin or rotenone pretreatment. MitoQ, a mitochondrially targeted antioxidant, decreased LPS-induced IL-1β without affecting TNF-α. These results, therefore, implicate complex I in LPS action in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2140069888,"Background The burden of non-communicable disease (NCDs) has grown rapidly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where populations are ageing, with rising prevalence of multimorbidity (more than two co-existing chronic conditions) that will significantly increase pressure on already stretched health systems. We assess the impact of NCD multimorbidity on healthcare utilisation and out-of-pocket expenditures in six middle-income countries: China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. Methods Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from adult participants (>18 years) in the WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) 2007–2010. We used multiple logistic regression to determine socio-demographic correlates of multimorbidity. Association between the number of NCDs and healthcare utilisation as well as out-of-pocket spending was assessed using logistic, negative binominal and log-linear models. Results The prevalence of multimorbidity in the adult population varied from 3∙9% in Ghana to 33∙6% in Russia. Number of visits to doctors in primary and secondary care rose substantially for persons with increasing numbers of co-existing NCDs. Multimorbidity was associated with more outpatient visits in China (coefficient for number of NCD = 0∙56, 95% CI = 0∙46, 0∙66), a higher likelihood of being hospitalised in India (AOR = 1∙59, 95% CI = 1∙45, 1∙75), higher out-of-pocket expenditures for outpatient visits in India and China, and higher expenditures for hospital visits in Russia. Medicines constituted the largest proportion of out-of-pocket expenditures in persons with multimorbidity (88∙3% for outpatient, 55∙9% for inpatient visit in China) in most countries. Conclusion Multimorbidity is associated with higher levels of healthcare utilisation and greater financial burden for individuals in middle-income countries. Our study supports the WHO call for universal health insurance and health service coverage in LMICs, particularly for vulnerable groups such as the elderly with multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2109184532,"Introduction Application of system thinking to the development, implementation and evaluation of childhood obesity prevention efforts represents the cutting edge of community-based prevention. We report on an approach to developing a system oriented community perspective on the causes of obesity. Methods Group model building sessions were conducted in a rural Australian community to address increasing childhood obesity. Stakeholders (n = 12) built a community model that progressed from connection circles to causal loop diagrams using scripts from the system dynamics literature. Participants began this work in identifying change over time in causes and effects of childhood obesity within their community. The initial causal loop diagram was then reviewed and elaborated by 50 community leaders over a full day session. Results The process created a causal loop diagram representing community perceptions of determinants and causes of obesity. The causal loop diagram can be broken down into four separate domains; social influences; fast food and junk food; participation in sport; and general physical activity. Discussion This causal loop diagram can provide the basis for community led planning of a prevention response that engages with multiple levels of existing settings and systems."
https://openalex.org/W1488309124,"Remote identification and mapping of canopy tree species can contribute valuable information towards our understanding of ecosystem biodiversity and function over large spatial scales. However, the extreme challenges posed by highly diverse, closed-canopy tropical forests have prevented automated remote species mapping of non-flowering tree crowns in these ecosystems. We set out to identify individuals of three focal canopy tree species amongst a diverse background of tree and liana species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, using airborne imaging spectroscopy data. First, we compared two leading single-class classification methods--binary support vector machine (SVM) and biased SVM--for their performance in identifying pixels of a single focal species. From this comparison we determined that biased SVM was more precise and created a multi-species classification model by combining the three biased SVM models. This model was applied to the imagery to identify pixels belonging to the three focal species and the prediction results were then processed to create a map of focal species crown objects. Crown-level cross-validation of the training data indicated that the multi-species classification model had pixel-level producer's accuracies of 94-97% for the three focal species, and field validation of the predicted crown objects indicated that these had user's accuracies of 94-100%. Our results demonstrate the ability of high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing to accurately detect non-flowering crowns of focal species within a diverse tropical forest. We attribute the success of our model to recent classification and mapping techniques adapted to species detection in diverse closed-canopy forests, which can pave the way for remote species mapping in a wider variety of ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W1531955026,"Epistasis-the non-additive interactions between different genetic loci-constrains evolutionary pathways, blocking some and permitting others. For biological networks such as transcription circuits, the nature of these constraints and their consequences are largely unknown. Here we describe the evolutionary pathways of a transcription network that controls the response to mating pheromone in yeast. A component of this network, the transcription regulator Ste12, has evolved two different modes of binding to a set of its target genes. In one group of species, Ste12 binds to specific DNA binding sites, while in another lineage it occupies DNA indirectly, relying on a second transcription regulator to recognize DNA. We show, through the construction of various possible evolutionary intermediates, that evolution of the direct mode of DNA binding was not directly accessible to the ancestor. Instead, it was contingent on a lineage-specific change to an overlapping transcription network with a different function, the specification of cell type. These results show that analysing and predicting the evolution of cis-regulatory regions requires an understanding of their positions in overlapping networks, as this placement constrains the available evolutionary pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1769823553,"Background Educational disparities in U.S. adult mortality are large and have widened across birth cohorts. We consider three policy relevant scenarios and estimate the mortality attributable to: (1) individuals having less than a high school degree rather than a high school degree, (2) individuals having some college rather than a baccalaureate degree, and (3) individuals having anything less than a baccalaureate degree rather than a baccalaureate degree, using educational disparities specific to the 1925, 1935, and 1945 cohorts. Methods We use the National Health Interview Survey data (1986–2004) linked to prospective mortality through 2006 (N=1,008,949), and discrete-time survival models, to estimate education- and cohort-specific mortality rates. We use those mortality rates and data on the 2010 U.S. population from the American Community Survey, to calculate annual attributable mortality estimates. Results If adults aged 25–85 in the 2010 U.S. population experienced the educational disparities in mortality observed in the 1945 cohort, 145,243 deaths could be attributed to individuals having less than a high school degree rather than a high school degree, 110,068 deaths could be attributed to individuals having some college rather than a baccalaureate degree, and 554,525 deaths could be attributed to individuals having anything less than a baccalaureate degree rather than a baccalaureate degree. Widening educational disparities between the 1925 and 1945 cohorts result in a doubling of attributable mortality. Mortality attributable to having less than a high school degree is proportionally similar among women and men and among non-Hispanic blacks and whites, and is greater for cardiovascular disease than for cancer. Conclusions Mortality attributable to low education is comparable in magnitude to mortality attributable to individuals being current rather than former smokers. Existing research suggests that a substantial part of the association between education and mortality is causal. Thus, policies that increase education could significantly reduce adult mortality."
https://openalex.org/W768986542,"Inbreeding is often an inevitable outcome of strong directional artificial selection but on average it reduces population fitness with increased frequency of recessive deleterious alleles. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) representing genomic autozygosity that occur from mating between selected and genomically related individuals may be able to reveal the regions affecting fitness. To examine the influence of genomic autozygosity on fitness, we used a genome-wide association test to evaluate potential negative correlations between ROH and daughter pregnancy rate (DPR) or somatic cell score (SCS) in US Jersey cattle. In addition, relationships between changes of local ROH and inbreeding coefficients (F) were assessed to locate genomic regions with increased inbreeding. Despite finding some decreases in fertility associated with incremental increases in F, most emerging local ROH were not significantly associated with DPR or SCS. Furthermore, the analyses of ROH could be approximated with the most frequent haplotype(s), including the associations of ROH and F or traits. The analysis of the most frequent haplotype revealed that associations of ROH and fertility could be accounted for by the additive genetic effect on the trait. Thus, we suggest that a change of autozygosity is more likely to demonstrate footprints of selected haplotypes for production rather than highlight the possible increased local autozygosity of a recessive detrimental allele resulting from the mating between closely related animals in Jersey cattle."
https://openalex.org/W1475792883,"For orangutans, the largest predominantly arboreal primates, discontinuous canopy presents a particular challenge. The shortest gaps between trees lie between thin peripheral branches, which offer the least stability to large animals. The affordances of the forest canopy experienced by orangutans of different ages however, must vary substantially as adult males are an order of magnitude larger in size than infants during the early stages of locomotor independence. Orangutans have developed a diverse range of locomotor behaviour to cross gaps between trees, which vary in their physical and cognitive demands. The aims of this study were to examine the ontogeny of orangutan gap crossing behaviours and to determine which factors influence the distance orangutans crossed. A non-invasive photographic technique was used to quantify forearm length as a measure of body size. We also recorded locomotor behaviour, support use and the distance crossed between trees. Our results suggest that gap crossing varies with both physical and cognitive development. More complex locomotor behaviours, which utilized compliant trunks and lianas, were used to cross the largest gaps, but these peaked in frequency much earlier than expected, between the ages of 4 and 5 years old, which probably reflects play behaviour to perfect locomotor techniques. Smaller individuals also crossed disproportionately large gaps relative to their size, by using support deformation. Our results suggest that orangutans acquire the full repertoire of gap crossing techniques, including the more cognitively demanding ones, before weaning, but adjust the frequency of the use of these techniques to their increasing body size."
https://openalex.org/W1944402090,"In response to fasting or hyperglycemia, the pancreatic β-cell alters its output of secreted insulin; however, the pathways governing this adaptive response are not entirely established. Although the precise role of microRNAs (miRNAs) is also unclear, a recurring theme emphasizes their function in cellular stress responses. We recently showed that miR-184, an abundant miRNA in the β-cell, regulates compensatory proliferation and secretion during insulin resistance. Consistent with previous studies showing miR-184 suppresses insulin release, expression of this miRNA was increased in islets after fasting, demonstrating an active role in the β-cell as glucose levels lower and the insulin demand ceases. Additionally, miR-184 was negatively regulated upon the administration of a sucrose-rich diet in Drosophila, demonstrating strong conservation of this pathway through evolution. Furthermore, miR-184 and its target Argonaute2 remained inversely correlated as concentrations of extracellular glucose increased, underlining a functional relationship between this miRNA and its targets. Lastly, restoration of Argonaute2 in the presence of miR-184 rescued suppression of miR-375-targeted genes, suggesting these genes act in a coordinated manner during changes in the metabolic context. Together, these results highlight the adaptive role of miR-184 according to glucose metabolism and suggest the regulatory role of this miRNA in energy homeostasis is highly conserved.

https://openalex.org/W1503645850,"During autumn in the temperate zone of both the new and old world, bats of many species assemble at underground sites in a behaviour known as swarming. Autumn swarming behaviour is thought to primarily serve as a promiscuous mating system, but may also be related to the localization and assessment of hibernacula. Bats subsequently make use of the same underground sites during winter hibernation, however it is currently unknown if the assemblages that make use of a site are comparable across swarming and hibernation seasons. Our purpose was to characterize the bat assemblages found at five underground sites during both the swarming and the hibernation season and compare the assemblages found during the two seasons both across sites and within species. We found that the relative abundance of individual species per site, as well as the relative proportion of a species that makes use of each site, were both significantly correlated between the swarming and hibernation seasons. These results suggest that swarming may indeed play a role in the localization of suitable hibernation sites. Additionally, these findings have important conservation implications, as this correlation can be used to improve monitoring of underground sites and predict the importance of certain sites for rare and cryptic bat species."
https://openalex.org/W2123131951,"Pancreatic β cells are electrically excitable and respond to elevated glucose concentrations with bursts of Ca(2+) action potentials due to the activation of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs), which leads to the exocytosis of insulin granules. We have examined the possible role of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-mediated Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores during stimulus-secretion coupling in primary mouse pancreatic β cells. NAADP-regulated Ca(2+) release channels, likely two-pore channels (TPCs), have recently been shown to be a major mechanism for mobilizing Ca(2+) from the endolysosomal system, resulting in localized Ca(2+) signals. We show here that NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release from endolysosomal Ca(2+) stores activates inward membrane currents and depolarizes the β cell to the threshold for VDCC activation and thereby contributes to glucose-evoked depolarization of the membrane potential during stimulus-response coupling. Selective pharmacological inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca(2+) release or genetic ablation of endolysosomal TPC1 or TPC2 channels attenuates glucose- and sulfonylurea-induced membrane currents, depolarization, cytoplasmic Ca(2+) signals, and insulin secretion. Our findings implicate NAADP-evoked Ca(2+) release from acidic Ca(2+) storage organelles in stimulus-secretion coupling in β cells."
https://openalex.org/W820797620,"We report the functionalization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) via the 1,3-dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition of aromatic azides, which resulted in a detangled CNT as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Carboxylic moieties (-COOH) on aromatic azide result in highly stable aqueous dispersion (max. conc. ~ 10 mg/mL H2O), making the suitable for inkjet printing. Printed patterns on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible substrate exhibit low sheet resistivity ~65 Ω. cm, which is attributed to enhanced conductivity. Fabricated Supercapacitors (SC) assembled using these printed substrates exhibit good electrochemical performance in organic as well as aqueous electrolytes. High energy and power density (57.8 Wh/kg and 0.85 kW/kg) in 1M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed supercapacitor. Capacitive retention varies from ~85–94% with columbic efficiency ~95% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles in different electrolytes, demonstrating the excellent potential of the device for futuristic power applications."
https://openalex.org/W1583712616,"This paper examines the relationships between social participation and disaster risk reduction actions. A survey of 557 households in tsunami prone areas in Phang Nga, Thailand was conducted following the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes. We use a multivariate probit model to jointly estimate the likelihood of undertaking three responses to earthquake and tsunami hazards (namely, (1) following disaster-related news closely, (2) preparing emergency kits and/or having a family emergency plan, and (3) having an intention to migrate) and community participation. We find that those who experienced losses from the 2004 tsunami are more likely to participate in community activities and respond to earthquake hazards. Compared to men, women are more likely to prepare emergency kits and/or have an emergency plan and have a greater intention to migrate. Living in a community with a higher proportion of women with tertiary education increases the probability of engaging in community activities and carrying out disaster risk reduction measures. Individuals who participate in village-based activities are 5.2% more likely to undertake all three risk reduction actions compared to those not engaging in community activities. This implies that encouraging participation in community activities can have positive externalities in disaster mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W2950399863,"Animal migrations provide important ecological functions and can allow for increased biodiversity through habitat and niche diversification. However, aquatic migrations in general, and those of the world's largest fish in particular, are imperiled worldwide and are often poorly understood. Several species of large Amazonian catfish carry out some of the longest freshwater fish migrations in the world, travelling from the Amazon River estuary to the Andes foothills. These species are important apex predators in the main stem rivers of the Amazon Basin and make up the region's largest fishery. They are also the only species to utilize the entire Amazon Basin to complete their life cycle. Studies indicate both that the fisheries may be declining due to overfishing, and that the proposed and completed dams in their upstream range threaten spawning migrations. Despite this, surprisingly little is known about the details of these species' migrations, or their life history. Otolith microchemistry has been an effective method for quantifying and reconstructing fish migrations worldwide across multiple spatial scales and may provide a powerful tool to understand the movements of Amazonian migratory catfish. Our objective was to describe the migratory behaviors of the three most populous and commercially important migratory catfish species, Dourada (Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii), Piramutaba (Brachyplatystoma vaillantii), and Piraíba (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum). We collected fish from the mouth of the Amazon River and the Central Amazon and used strontium isotope signatures ((87)Sr/(86)Sr) recorded in their otoliths to determine the location of early rearing and subsequent. Fish location was determined through discriminant function classification, using water chemistry data from the literature as a training set. Where water chemistry data was unavailable, we successfully in predicted (87)Sr/(86)Sr isotope values using a regression-based approach that related the geology of the upstream watershed to the Sr isotope ratio. Our results provide the first reported otolith microchemical reconstruction of Brachyplatystoma migratory movements in the Amazon Basin. Our results indicate that juveniles exhibit diverse rearing strategies, rearing in both upstream and estuary environments. This contrasts with the prevailing understanding that juveniles rear in the estuary before migrating upstream; however, it is supported by some fisheries data that has indicated the presence of alternate spawning and rearing life-histories. The presence of alternate juvenile rearing strategies may have important implications for conservation and management of the fisheries in the region."
https://openalex.org/W764592776,"Biobanks are important resources which enable large-scale genomic research with human samples and data, raising significant ethical concerns about how participants' information is managed and shared. Three previous studies of the Canadian public's opinion about these topics have been conducted. Building on those results, an online survey representing the first study of public perceptions about biobanking spanning all Canadian provinces was conducted. Specifically, this study examined qualitative views about biobank objectives, governance structure, control and ownership of samples and data, benefit sharing, consent practices and data sharing norms, as well as additional questions and ethical concerns expressed by the public.Over half the respondents preferred to give a one-time general consent for the future sharing of their samples among researchers. Most expressed willingness for their data to be shared with the international scientific community rather than used by one or more Canadian institutions. Whereas more respondents indicated a preference for one-time general consent than any other model of consent, they constituted less than half of the total responses, revealing a lack of consensus among survey respondents regarding this question. Respondents identified biobank objectives, governance structure and accountability as the most important information to provide participants. Respondents' concerns about biobanking generally centred around the control and ownership of biological samples and data, especially with respect to potential misuse by insurers, the government and other third parties. Although almost half the respondents suggested that these should be managed by the researchers' institutions, results indicate that the public is interested in being well-informed about these projects and suggest the importance of increased involvement from participants. In conclusion, the study discusses the viability of several proposed models for informed consent, including e-governance, independent trustees and the use of exclusion clauses, in the context of these new findings about the views of the Canadian public."
https://openalex.org/W819704429,"Gastrotricha systematics is in a state of flux mainly due to the conflicts between cladistic studies base on molecular markers and the classical systematisation based on morphological traits. In sandy samples from Thailand, we found numerous macrodasyidan gastrotrichs belonging to an undescribed species of difficult taxonomic affiliation. The abundance and original nature of the specimens prompted us to undertake a deep survey of both morphological and molecular traits aiming at a reliable systematisation of the new taxon.Using several microscopical techniques we investigated the external and internal anatomy, including the muscular and nervous systems of the new species. Additional specimens were used to obtain the 18S rRNA gene sequence; molecular data was analysed cladistically in conjunction with data from additional species belonging to the near complete Macrodasyida taxonomic spectrum. Specimens are vermiform, up to 806 μm in total length, and show a well-defined head equipped with peculiar leaf-like sensorial organs and a single-lobed posterior end. The adhesive apparatus includes anterior, ventrolateral, dorsal and posterior tubes. Pharynx is about 1/4 of the total length and shows pores at its posterior 3/4. Adult specimens exhibit maturing eggs and a bulky, muscular caudal organ, but do not show sperm nor the frontal organ. Musculature and nervous system organisation resemble the usual macrodasyidan plan; however, the somatic circular muscles of the intestinal region surround all other muscular components and a third FMRFamide-IR commissure ventral to the pharyngo-intestinal junction appear to be an autoapomorphic traits of the new species.While the anatomical characteristics of the Asian specimens appear so unique to grant the establishment of a new taxon, for which the name Thaidasys tongiorgii gen. et sp. nov. is proposed, the result of phylogenetic analyses based on the 18S rRNA gene unites the new genus with the family Macrodasyidae."

BMI-SDS (SDS = adjusted for mean standard deviation score), waist circumference-SDS, hip circumference and sum of skinfolds were measured at baseline, at four and ten months follow-up (primary outcomes). Sedentary screen time, physical activity, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and snacks, and process measures (not at baseline) were assessed with self-reports at baseline, one, four and ten months follow-up. Multi-level-intention to treat-regression analyses were conducted.The control group decreased significantly more than the intervention group on BMI-SDS (β = 0.074, 95%CI: 0.008;0.14), and sum of skinfolds (β = 3.22, 95%CI: 0.27;6.17) (overall effects). The intervention group had a significantly higher decrease in self-reported non-active video game time (β = -1.76, 95%CI: -3.20;-0.32) and total sedentary screen time (Exp (β = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.74;0.88) than the control group (overall effects). The process evaluation showed that 14% of the adolescents played the Move video games every week ≥ 1 hour/week during the whole intervention period.The active video game intervention did not result in lower values on anthropometrics in a group of 'excessive' non-active video gamers (mean ~ 14 hours/week) who primarily were of healthy weight compared to a control group throughout a ten-month-period. Even some effects in the unexpected direction were found, with the control group showing lower BMI-SDS and skin folds than the intervention group.

https://openalex.org/W776183769,"We examined acute exposure of Holstein cows to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and its carryover effects on ovarian function and oocyte developmental competence. Synchronized cows were tube-fed with water or 100 mg/kg DEHP per day for 3 days. Blood, urine and milk samples were collected before, during and after DEHP exposure to examine its clearance pattern. Ovarian follicular dynamics was monitored through an entire estrous cycle by ultrasonographic scanning. Follicular fluids were aspirated from the preovulatory follicles on days 0 and 29 of the experiment and analyzed for phthalate metabolites and estradiol concentration. The aspirated follicular fluid was used as maturation medium for in-vitro embryo production. Findings revealed that DEHP impairs the pattern of follicular development, with a prominent effect on dominant follicles. The diameter and growth rate of the first- and second-wave dominant follicles were lower (P < 0.05) in the DEHP-treated group. Estradiol concentration in the follicular fluid was lower in the DEHP-treated group than in controls, and associated with a higher number of follicular pathologies (follicle diameter >25 mm). The pattern of growth and regression of the corpus luteum differed between groups, with a lower volume in the DEHP-treated group (P < 0.05). The follicular fluid aspirated from the DEHP-treated group, but not the controls, contained 23 nM mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Culturing of cumulus oocyte complexes in the follicular fluid aspirated from DEHP-treated cows reduced the proportion of oocytes progressing to the MII stage, and the proportions of 2- to 4-cell-stage embryos (P < 0.04) and 7-day blastocysts (P < 0.06). The results describe the risk associated with acute exposure to DEHP and its deleterious carryover effects on ovarian function, nuclear maturation and oocyte developmental competence."
https://openalex.org/W1482374180,"Motivation Reproducing the results from a scientific paper can be challenging due to the absence of data and the computational tools required for their analysis. In addition, details relating to the procedures used to obtain the published results can be difficult to discern due to the use of natural language when reporting how experiments have been performed. The Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA), Nanopublications (NP), and Research Objects (RO) models are conceptual data modelling frameworks that can structure such information from scientific papers. Computational workflow platforms can also be used to reproduce analyses of data in a principled manner. We assessed the extent by which ISA, NP, and RO models, together with the Galaxy workflow system, can capture the experimental processes and reproduce the findings of a previously published paper reporting on the development of SOAPdenovo2, a de novo genome assembler. Results Executable workflows were developed using Galaxy, which reproduced results that were consistent with the published findings. A structured representation of the information in the SOAPdenovo2 paper was produced by combining the use of ISA, NP, and RO models. By structuring the information in the published paper using these data and scientific workflow modelling frameworks, it was possible to explicitly declare elements of experimental design, variables, and findings.

https://openalex.org/W1579151434,"Mesophotic hard corals (MHC) are increasingly threatened by a growing number of anthropogenic stressors, including impacts from fishing, land-based sources of pollution, and ocean acidification. However, little is known about their geographic distributions (particularly around the Pacific islands) because it is logistically challenging and expensive to gather data in the 30 to 150 meter depth range where these organisms typically live. The goal of this study was to begin to fill this knowledge gap by modelling and predicting the spatial distribution of three genera of mesophotic hard corals offshore of Maui in the Main Hawaiian Islands. Maximum Entropy modeling software was used to create separate maps of predicted probability of occurrence and uncertainty for: (1) Leptoseris, (2) Montipora, and (3) Porites. Genera prevalence was derived from the in situ presence/absence data, and used to convert relative habitat suitability to probability of occurrence values. Approximately 1,300 georeferenced records of the occurrence of MHC, and 34 environmental predictors were used to train the model ensembles. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were between 0.89 and 0.97, indicating excellent overall model performance. Mean uncertainty and mean absolute error for the spatial predictions ranged from 0.006% to 0.05% and 3.73% to 17.6%, respectively. Depth, distance from shore, euphotic depth (mean and standard deviation) and sea surface temperature (mean and standard deviation) were identified as the six most influential predictor variables for partitioning habitats among the three genera. MHC were concentrated between Hanaka'ō'ō and Papawai Points offshore of western Maui most likely because this area hosts warmer, clearer and calmer water conditions almost year round. While these predictions helped to fill some knowledge gaps offshore of Maui, many information gaps remain in the Hawaiian Archipelago and Pacific Islands. This approach may be used to identify other potentially suitable areas for MHCs, helping scientists and resource managers prioritize sites, and focus their limited resources on areas that may be of higher scientific or conservation value."
https://openalex.org/W2337471775,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis that is endemic in tropical areas, such as Reunion Island. The species Leptospira interrogans is the primary agent in human infections, but other pathogenic species, such as L. kirschner and L. borgpetersenii, are also associated with human leptospirosis.In this study, a melting curve analysis of the products that were amplified with the primer pairs lfb1 F/R and G1/G2 facilitated an accurate species classification of Leptospira reference strains. Next, we combined an unsupervised high resolution melting (HRM) method with a new statistical approach using primers to amplify a two variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) for typing at the subspecies level. The HRM analysis, which was performed with ScreenClust Software, enabled the identification of genotypes at the serovar level with high resolution power (Hunter-Gaston index 0.984). This method was also applied to Leptospira DNA from blood samples that were obtained from Reunion Island after 1998. We were able to identify a unique genotype that is identical to that of the L. interrogans serovars Copenhageni and Icterohaemorrhagiae, suggesting that this genotype is the major cause of leptospirosis on Reunion Island.Our simple, rapid, and robust genotyping method enables the identification of Leptospira strains at the species and subspecies levels and supports the direct genotyping of Leptospira in biological samples without requiring cultures."
https://openalex.org/W793882452,"Predator confrontation or predator evasion frequently produces bone fractures in potential prey in the wild. Although there are reports of healed bone injuries and pathologies in non-avian dinosaurs, no previously published instances of biomechanically adaptive bone modeling exist. Two tibiae from an ontogenetic sample of fifty specimens of the herbivorous dinosaur Maiasaura peeblesorum (Ornithopoda: Hadrosaurinae) exhibit exostoses. We show that these outgrowths are cases of biomechanically adaptive periosteal bone modeling resulting from overstrain on the tibia after a fibula fracture. Histological and biomechanical results are congruent with predictions derived from this hypothesis. Histologically, the outgrowths are constituted by radial fibrolamellar periosteal bone tissue formed at very high growth rates, as expected in a process of rapid strain equilibration response. These outgrowths show greater compactness at the periphery, where tensile and compressive biomechanical constraints are higher. Moreover, these outgrowths increase the maximum bending strength in the direction of the stresses derived from locomotion. They are located on the antero-lateral side of the tibia, as expected in a presumably bipedal one year old individual, and in the posterior position of the tibia, as expected in a presumably quadrupedal individual at least four years of age. These results reinforce myological evidence suggesting that Maiasaura underwent an ontogenetic shift from the primitive ornithischian bipedal condition when young to a derived quadrupedal posture when older."
https://openalex.org/W1474173467,"Cellulose is a fundamentally important component of cell walls of higher plants. It provides a scaffold that allows the development and growth of the plant to occur in an ordered fashion. Cellulose also provides mechanical strength, which is crucial for both normal development and to enable the plant to withstand both abiotic and biotic stresses. We quantified the cellulose concentration in the culm of 288 two – rowed and 288 six – rowed spring type barley accessions that were part of the USDA funded barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) program in the USA. When the population structure of these accessions was analysed we identified six distinct populations, four of which we considered to be comprised of a sufficient number of accessions to be suitable for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These lines had been genotyped with 3072 SNPs so we combined the trait and genetic data to carry out GWAS. The analysis allowed us to identify regions of the genome containing significant associations between molecular markers and cellulose concentration data, including one region cross-validated in multiple populations. To identify candidate genes we assembled the gene content of these regions and used these to query a comprehensive RNA-seq based gene expression atlas. This provided us with gene annotations and associated expression data across multiple tissues, which allowed us to formulate a supported list of candidate genes that regulate cellulose biosynthesis. Several regions identified by our analysis contain genes that are co-expressed with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (HvCesA) across a range of tissues and developmental stages. These genes are involved in both primary and secondary cell wall development. In addition, genes that have been previously linked with cellulose synthesis by biochemical methods, such as HvCOBRA, a gene of unknown function, were also associated with cellulose levels in the association panel. Our analyses provide new insights into the genes that contribute to cellulose content in cereal culms and to a greater understanding of the interactions between them."

https://openalex.org/W1506026159,"In model organisms both the nutrition of the mother and the young offspring could induce long-lasting transcriptional changes in tissues. In livestock, such changes could have important roles in determining nutrient use and meat quality. The main objective was to evaluate if plane of maternal nutrition during late-gestation and weaning age alter the offspring's Longissimus muscle (LM) transcriptome, animal performance, and metabolic hormones. Whole-transcriptome microarray analysis was performed on LM samples of early (EW) and normal weaned (NW) Angus × Simmental calves born to grazing cows receiving no supplement [low plane of nutrition (LPN)] or 2.3 kg high-grain mix/day [medium plane of nutrition (MPN)] during the last 105 days of gestation. Biopsies of LM were harvested at 78 (EW), 187 (NW) and 354 (before slaughter) days of age. Despite greater feed intake in MPN offspring, blood insulin was greater in LPN offspring. Carcass intramuscular fat content was greater in EW offspring. Bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptome highlighted a modest overall response to maternal plane of nutrition, resulting in only 35 differentially expressed genes (DEG). However, weaning age and a high-grain diet (EW) strongly impacted the transcriptome (DEG = 167), especially causing a lipogenic program activation. In addition, between 78 and 187 days of age, EW steers had an activation of the innate immune system due presumably to macrophage infiltration of intramuscular fat. Between 187 and 354 days of age (the ""finishing"" phase), NW steers had an activation of the lipogenic transcriptome machinery, while EW steers had a clear inhibition through the epigenetic control of histone acetylases. Results underscored the need to conduct further studies to understand better the functional outcome of transcriptome changes induced in the offspring by pre- and post-natal nutrition. Additional knowledge on molecular and functional outcomes would help produce more efficient beef cattle."
https://openalex.org/W1688677061,"A mutation, L166P, in the cytosolic protein, PARK7/DJ-1, causes protein misfolding and is linked to Parkinson disease. Here, we identify the fission yeast protein Sdj1 as the orthologue of DJ-1 and calculate by in silico saturation mutagenesis the effects of point mutants on its structural stability. We also map the degradation pathways for Sdj1-L169P, the fission yeast orthologue of the disease-causing DJ-1 L166P protein. Sdj1-L169P forms inclusions, which are enriched for the Hsp104 disaggregase. Hsp104 and Hsp70-type chaperones are required for efficient degradation of Sdj1-L169P. This also depends on the ribosome-associated E3 ligase Ltn1 and its co-factor Rqc1. Although Hsp104 is absolutely required for proteasomal degradation of Sdj1-L169P aggregates, the degradation of already aggregated Sdj1-L169P occurs independently of Ltn1 and Rqc1. Thus, our data point to soluble Sdj1-L169P being targeted early by Ltn1 and Rqc1. The fraction of Sdj1-L169P that escapes this first inspection then forms aggregates that are subsequently cleared via an Hsp104- and proteasome-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1656572715,"A luminol-H2O2-HRP chemiluminescence system with high relative luminescent intensity (RLU) and long stabilization time was investigated. First, the comparative study on the enhancement effect of ten compounds as enhancers to the luminol-H2O2-HRP chemiluminescence system was carried out, and the results showed that 4-(imidazol-1-yl)phenol (4-IMP), 4-iodophenol (4-IOP), 4-bromophenol (4-BOP) and 4-hydroxy-4'-iodobiphenyl (HIOP) had the best performance. Based on the experiment, the four enhancers were dissolved in acetone, acetonitrile, methanol, and dimethylformamide (DMF) with various concentrations, the results indicated that 4-IMP, 4-IOP, 4-BOP and HIOP dissolved in DMF with the concentrations of 0.2%, 3.2%, 1.6% and 3.2% could get the highest RLU values. Subsequently, the influences of pH, ionic strength, HRP, 4-IMP, 4-IOP, 4-BOP, HIOP, H2O2 and luminol on the stabilization of the luminol-H2O2-HRP chemiluminescence system were studied, and we found that pH value, ionic strength, 4-IMP, 4-IOP, 4-BOP, HIOP, H2O2 and luminol have little influence on luminescent stabilization, while HRP has a great influence. In different ranges of HRP concentration, different enhancers should be selected. When the concentration is within the range of 0~6 ng/mL, 4-IMP should be selected. When the concentration of HRP ranges from 6 to 25 ng/mL, 4-IOP was the best choice. And when the concentration is within the range of 25~80 ng/mL, HIOP should be selected as the enhancer. Finally, the three well-performing chemiluminescent enhanced solutions (CESs) have been further optimized according to the three enhancers (4-IMP, 4-IOP and HIOP) in their utilized HRP concentration ranges."
https://openalex.org/W1676161098,"Copy number variations (CNVs) refer to large insertions, deletions and duplications in the genomic structure ranging from one thousand to several million bases in size. Since the development of next generation sequencing technology, several methods have been well built for detection of copy number variations with high credibility and accuracy. Evidence has shown that CNV occurring in gene region could lead to phenotypic changes due to the alteration in gene structure and dosage. However, it still remains unexplored whether CNVs underlie the phenotypic differences between Chinese and Western domestic pigs. Based on the read-depth methods, we investigated copy number variations using 49 individuals derived from both Chinese and Western pig breeds. A total of 3,131 copy number variation regions (CNVRs) were identified with an average size of 13.4 Kb in all individuals during domestication, harboring 1,363 genes. Among them, 129 and 147 CNVRs were Chinese and Western pig specific, respectively. Gene functional enrichments revealed that these CNVRs contribute to strong disease resistance and high prolificacy in Chinese domestic pigs, but strong muscle tissue development in Western domestic pigs. This finding is strongly consistent with the morphologic characteristics of Chinese and Western pigs, indicating that these group-specific CNVRs might have been preserved by artificial selection for the favored phenotypes during independent domestication of Chinese and Western pigs. In this study, we built high-resolution CNV maps in several domestic pig breeds and discovered the group specific CNVs by comparing Chinese and Western pigs, which could provide new insight into genomic variations during pigs' independent domestication, and facilitate further functional studies of CNV-associated genes."

To that effect we compared both behavior and monoaminergic markers in wild type (WT) and PrPC-null (PrP−/−) mice. PrP−/− mice performed poorly when compared with WT in forced swimming, tail suspension, and novelty suppressed feeding tests, typical of depressive-like behavior, but not in the control open field nor rotarod motor tests; cyclic AMP responses to stimulation of D1 receptors by dopamine was selectively impaired in PrP−/− mice, and responses to serotonin, but not to norepinephrine, also differed between genotypes.

Notably, PrPC-null mice reportedly showed signs of depressive-like behavior, which were corrected by imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant that acts primarily as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor (36Gadotti V.M.

A phage display screen conducted in our laboratory suggested that PrPC may bind both the 5HT5A serotonergic receptor and the serotonin transporter SERT. 3T. A. Americo, M. H. Magdesian, and R. Linden, unpublished data. In light of the apparent connections among monoaminergic neurotransmission, cell surface PrPC, and behavioral output, we hypothesized that monoaminergic signaling might be affected in the absence of PrPC. The present study both extends behavioral analysis to Prnp knock-out mice of a well controlled genetic background, as well as discloses novel neurochemical changes that may underlie their depressive-like behavior. Experiments were done using male, 8–12 weeks old, C57BL/10 and PrPC knock-out mice (Npu Prnp−/−; 107Manson J.C. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Aitchison L. McConnell I.

Bruce Chesebro and Richard Race (Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, MT). Heterozygous mice were mated and homozygous F1 descendants were crossed to generate PrPC-null (Npu Prnp−/−) embryos and their respective wild-type controls (Npu Prnp+/+). Animals were housed in groups of five per cage, under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, with controlled room temperature and humidity. Food and water were provided ad libitum. All procedures followed institutional guidelines and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The FST were conducted as described by Porsolt (46Porsolt R.D. Bertin A. Jalfre M. Behavioral despair in mice: a primary screening test for antidepressants.Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1977; 229: 327-336PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications (47Autry A.E. Adachi M. Nosyreva E. Na E.S. Los M.F. Cheng P.F. Kavalali E.T. Monteggia L.M.

Mice were individually forced to swim for 6 min in an open cylinder (65 cm height, 30 cm diameter) filled with water (24 ± 1 °C) to a height of 45 cm. The testing sessions were preceded, 1 day earlier, by an habituation session in which each mouse was placed in the swimming cylinder for 15 min, as a means to reduce stress and/or anxiety on the next day. Water was changed between subjects, and after testing animals were dried under a warm light for 20 min. Immobility time was recorded along the 6 min of testing, by a trained researcher blind to group assignment. Mice were considered immobile when they ceased struggling and remained floating motionless in the water, making only movements necessary to keep their head above water. Mice were suspended individually to 60 cm above the floor by adhesive tape placed ∼1 cm from the tip of the tail. Immobility time induced by tail suspension was recorded during 6 min according to the method described by Steru et al. (48Steru L. Chermat R. Thierry B. Simon P. The tail suspension test: a new method for screening antidepressants in mice.Psychopharmacology. 1985; 85: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (49Posser T.

J. Pharmacol. 2009; 602: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Immobility was defined as the absence of any limb or body movements, except for those caused by breathing. Mice were deprived of food for 24 h before testing. At the time of testing, one food pellet was placed on a white filter paper located in the middle of a test arena (30 × 30 × 45 cm). One at a time, mice were placed in one of the corners of the arena and allowed to explore for a maximum of 10 min. Their latency to visit and begin chewing the food pellet was recorded. Immediately after the test, animals were transferred to their home cages and allowed to feed freely. Mice were placed in the corner of a 30 × 30 × 45-cm box divided in 9 smaller squares. The number of squares crossed with all paws (crossings) and the raising the forepaws (rearings) were scored in 5-min sessions. The box was thoroughly cleaned with a solution of 30% alcohol and dried between subjects. Motor performance was tested using an accelerating Rotarod (Insight, Brazil). All mice were pre-trained in the apparatus to reach a stable performance and to minimize novelty stress. Training consisted of 3 sessions on 3 consecutive days, each session including 3 separate runs. In each training run, animals were placed on the rods at an initial speed of 6 rpm for 30 s. The speed was then increased gradually to 37 rpm over 5 min. If a mouse fell from the apparatus during a training session, it was immediately placed back on, until the end of the run. Between runs, mice rested for at least 2 min, to reduce stress and fatigue. On the day of testing, 5 consecutive trials were made with 15-min inter-trial intervals, and in each trial the speed was slowly increased from 6 to 37 rpm within 5 min. Results were expressed as latency of animals to fall from the apparatus. Mice were euthanized in a CO2 chamber and immediately decapitated. Brains were removed, and the cerebral cortex or striatum dissected out and cut into 400-μm slices using a tissue chopper. Slices were selected and distributed equally in 12-well plates filled with aCSF (126 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 21.4 mm NaHCO3, 11.1 mm glucose, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, and 400 μm ascorbic acid), saturated with a 95% O2, 5% CO2 mixture, just before the experiment. A phosphodiesterase inhibitor (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 500 μm) was added for 15 min and then each well received a 40-min stimulus with forskolin, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, SKF-38393, SCH-23390, SB-699551, or raclopride. Generation of cAMP was completely stopped by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and then assayed radiometrically, as previously described (50Gilman A.G. A protein binding assay for adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1970; 67: 305-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice cerebral cortex was dissected out in ice-cold PBS, and homogenized in a solution containing 2% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 62.5 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method. For each sample, 30 μg of protein were used for SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with: anti-D1 (1:400), anti-SERT (1:500), anti-5HT5A (1:400), anti-TH (1:1,000), anti-Phospho-TH Ser40 (Cell Signaling, number 2791, 1:1000), anti-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) (1:500), anti-DAT (1:500), anti-VMAT2 (1:500), and anti-5HT1A (Santa Cruz, sc-1459, 1:100). Anti-α-tubulin (Sigma, T6074, 1:50,000) and anti-GAPDH (Millipore, MAB374, 1:3000) antibodies were used as loading controls. Brain monoamines and their immediate metabolites were measured by HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED), following a protocol adapted from Arita and co-workers (51Arita D.Y. Di Marco G.S. Schor N. Casarini D.E. Purification and characterization of the active form of tyrosine hydroxylase from mesangial cells in culture.J. Cell Biochem. 2002; 87: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were decapitated, brains were removed, and the cerebral cortex or striatum dissected out in ice-cold PBS. Perchloric acid was added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.1 m. Samples were sonicated (2 pulses of 5 s, 50 Hz) and then centrifuged (10,000 × g) for 10 min to remove precipitated proteins. Supernatants were used for HPLC. For normalization, pellets were resuspended and protein concentrations were quantified with a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Fast isocratic separation was obtained using a reverse phase LC-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Sigma) with the following mobile phase: 20 mm sodium phosphate dibasic; 20 mm citric acid, 10% methanol, 0.12 mm Na2EDTA, and 566 mg/liter of heptanesulfonic acid, pH 2.64. Animals used for immunohistochemistry were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Brains were removed and placed in phosphate buffer containing increasing concentrations of sucrose (10, 15, and 30%), for cryoprotection. Frozen coronal sections (40 μm) were cut using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stored in TBS-AF (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% sodium azide, 30% glycerol, and 15% sucrose) at 4 °C. For free-floating immunohistochemistry, sections were washed in PBS and blocked for 2 h with 0.25% Triton, 3% BSA, and 3% normal donkey serum. The following primary antibodies were then incubated overnight at 4 °C: anti-PrPC (Cayman, SAF83, 1:200), anti-D1 (Merck, US324390, 1:400), anti-SERT (Sigma, SAB4200039, 1:500), anti-5HT5A (Sigma, SAB2101110, 1:400), anti-TH (Millipore, MAB318, 1:400), and anti-TPH (Millipore, AB1541, 1:500). After washing with PBS, sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Life Technologies), briefly stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml), and mounted on glass slides with n-propyl gallate. Recombinant mouse PrPC was separated by SDS-PAGE in various lanes (5 μg/lane), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein migration was verified with Ponceau S staining. The membrane was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in a solution containing 100 μg of a total protein extract from the cerebral cortex of wild type mice, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% BSA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Then, individual lanes were cut, and each was subject to Western blotting with the appropriate antibody. In addition to D1, 5HT5A, and SERT, we also probed overlay membranes with an antibody to dopamine receptor D4 (Santa Cruz, SC-1439, 1:1000), as a control. Target proteins are detected only if binding to the previously identified PrPC band. Except where stated otherwise, data are presented as mean ± S.E. We used Student's t test, or analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test, to compare means among treatments. Differences between treated and control groups were considered significant when p < 0.05. We first tested for depressive-like traits in PrPC-null mice as compared with control littermates. In the “forced swim test,” PrPC-null mice were immobile for significantly longer periods than wild-type controls (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with the “tail suspension test” (Fig. 1B). Such behavior, giving up struggling and remaining immobile in adverse situations, is commonly interpreted as a measure of “hopelessness,” and is susceptible to antidepressant treatments (52Yan H.C. Cao X. Das M. Zhu X.H. Gao T.M. Behavioral animal models of depression.Neurosci. Bull. 2010; 26: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), thus likely indicative of a depressive-like state. A more complex procedure, known as “novelty suppressed feeding test,” also showed a difference between groups. Food-deprived PrPC-null mice had a higher latency to seek out a food pellet, when compared with wild-type animal"

A comparison of two highly conserved duplicated PG genes, namely, Brassica campestris Male Fertility 26a (BcMF26a) and BcMF26b, revealed the different features of their expression patterns and functions. We found that these two genes were orthologous genes of At4g33440, and they originated from a chromosomal segmental duplication. Although structurally similar, their regulatory and intron sequences largely diverged. QRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of BcMF26b was higher than that of BcMF26a in almost all the tested organs and tissues in Brassica campestris. Promoter activity analysis showed that, at reproductive development stages, BcMF26b promoter was active in tapetum, pollen grains, and pistils, whereas BcMF26a promoter was only active in pistils. In the subcellular localization experiment, BcMF26a and BcMF26b proteins could be localized to the cell wall. When the two genes were co-inhibited, pollen intine was formed abnormally and pollen tubes could not grow or stretch. Moreover, the knockout mutants of At4g33440 delayed the growth of pollen tubes. Therefore, BcMF26a/b can participate in the construction of pollen wall by modulating intine information and BcMF26b may play a major role in co-inhibiting transformed plants."

However, the molecular pathways induced by V3 expression that are responsible for these changes are not yet clear. In this study, we employed a microarray approach to examine how expression of V3 induced changes in gene expression and the molecular pathways in rat ASMCs. We found that forced expression of V3 by ASMCs affected expression of 521 genes by more than 1.5-fold. Gene ontology analysis showed that components of the extracellular matrix were the most significantly affected by V3 expression. In addition, genes regulating the formation of the cytoskeleton, which also serve as markers of contractile smooth muscle cells (SMCs), were significantly up-regulated. In contrast, components of the complement system, chemokines, chemokine receptors, and transcription factors crucial for regulating inflammatory processes were among the genes most down-regulated. Consistently, we found that the level of myocardin, a key transcription factor promoting contractile SMC phenotype, was greatly increased, and the proinflammatory transcription factors NFκB1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β were significantly attenuated in V3-expressing SMCs.

Conization revealed the presence of CIN in 1113 (81.9%) patients, micro-CA in 72 (5.3%) patients and invasive carcinomas in 44 (3.2%) patients. The remaining 130 (9.6%) patients were free of diseases in the cone specimens. Positive surgical margins, or endocervical curettages (ECCs) were found in 90 (7.6%) patients with CINs or micro-CAs. Three factors were associated with positive margins and ECCs and included age (>50 years; odds ratio (OR), 3.0, P<0.01), postmenopausal status (OR, 3.1, P<0.01) and microinvasive disease (OR, 2.7, P<0.01). One thousand and eighty-nine (92.0%) patients were followed-up regularly for a median follow-up duration of 46 months (range: 24-106 months). Disease relapse was documented in 50 (4.6%) patients. Eighty-two (6.0%) cases experienced surgical complications that needed to be addressed, including early or late hemorrhages, infections, cervical stenosis, etc.Our patients demonstrated that EKC was an alternative technique for diagnosis and treatment of CIN or micro-CAs with relatively low rate of recurrence and acceptable rate of complications. A randomized clinical trial is warranted to compare EKC, CKC and LEEP in the management of CIN or micro-CA."

Up-regulation of HER2 oncogene initiates cascades of events cumulating to the stimulation of transforming PI3K/AKT signaling, which also plays a dominant role in supporting cell survival and efficacy of HER2-directed therapies. Although investigating the underlying mechanisms by which HER2 promotes cell survival, we noticed a profound reduction in the kinase activity of a pro-apoptotic mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) in HER2-positive (HER2+) but not in HER2-negative (HER2−) breast cancer tissues, whereas both HER2+ and HER2− tumors expressed a comparable level of MLK3 protein. Furthermore, the kinase activity of MLK3 was inversely correlated with HER2+ tumor grades. Moreover, HER2-directed drugs such as trastuzumab and lapatinib as well as depletion of HER2 or HER3 stimulated MLK3 kinase activity in HER2+ breast cancer cell lines. In addition, the noted inhibitory effect of HER2 on MLK3 kinase activity was mediated via its phosphorylation on Ser674 by AKT and that pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/AKT prevented trastuzumab- and lapatinib-induced stimulation of MLK3 activity. Consistent with the pro-apoptotic function of MLK3, stable knockdown of MLK3 in the HER2+ cell line blunted the pro-apoptotic effects of trastuzumab and lapatinib.

Therefore, there are agents, either in clinical use or under development, to target these dysregulated pathways downstream of amplified receptors to block uncontrolled breast cancer cell growth (3Renoir J.M.

The basic premise of targeting HER2-amplified breast cancer is to block the aberrant HER2 signaling by using Food and Drug Administration-approved trastuzumab or pertuzumab, humanized monoclonal antibodies against HER2, or a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, that blocks HER2 signaling and thus promotes cell death (8Tebbutt N.

The pro-apoptotic actions of anti-hormonal receptor therapies are fairly known; however, the pro-apoptotic pathways, mediated via anti-HER2 therapies, are not well understood. It is reported that central to anti-HER2 therapies, blocking of the PI3K-AKT pathway downstream of the receptor is essential because most of the survival signals are mediated in part via activation of PI3-AKT pathway (9Junttila T.T.

Previous works by us and others have reported that MLK family members, including MLK3, activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (12Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M.

Furthermore, we also reported that AKT, a downstream target of PI3K, directly phosphorylates MLK3 on Ser674 residue, and this phosphorylation suppresses kinase activity and pro-apoptotic function of MLK3 (13Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. Negative regulation of mixed lineage kinase 3 by protein kinase B/AKT leads to cell survival.J. Biol.

In the present report we demonstrate that activation of HER2-mediated pathway inhibits MLK3 kinase activity and its pro-apoptotic function, contributing to an enhanced cell survival. Treatment of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines with HER2 inhibitors such as trastuzumab or lapatinib activates MLK3 kinase activity via inhibition of PI3K/AKT. The activation of MLK3 by trastuzumab or lapatinib was essential for their cytotoxic effects in HER2+ breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, the expression of constitutively active MLK3 resulted in suppression of HER2+ breast cancer cell viability. Interestingly, the expression of active-MLK3 (p-MLK3) was decreased in HER2+ human breast tumors and was further decreased in higher grade tumors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that inhibition of MLK3 by the HER2 pathway is one of the mechanisms for HER2-amplified breast cancer cells survival. Human ER−/PR−/HER2+ (SKBR3, HCC202, and HCC1954), ER−/PR−/HER2− (MDA-MB-231, SUM159, and MDA-MB-468) breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA. Cells were maintained in DMEM or RPMI1640 media containing 10% FBS, 2 mmol/liter glutamine and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). Trastuzumab (10 μg/ml) (Genentech), lapatinib (1 μm), and erlotinib (100 nm) (Selleckchem) were treated for the indicated duration in cell culture media with 10% FBS. For PI3K/AKT inhibitors LY294002 (50 μm) (Calbiochem) and GDC-0941 (100 nm) (Selleckchem) treatment, cells were starved overnight in DMEM medium containing 2% FBS and pretreated for 2 h before trastuzumab treatment for 24 h. SKBR3 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml concentrations of human heregulin β-1 (Sigma) in DMEM medium with 10% FBS. SKBR3 cells were transiently transfected either with FLAG-tagged MLK3 or FLAG-MLK3 (S674A) using Xtremegene-HP (Roche Applied Science). The endogenous Her1/2/3 were knocked down in SKBR3 cells using validated Her1/2/3 siRNAs (Accell SMARTpool) and the respective non-targeting control siRNAs, purchased from (Dharmacon/ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.) and transfected using Accell siRNAs delivery media (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. To rule out any off-target effect of HER2 siRNA knockdown, second HER2 siRNA (Origene, Rockville, MD) was used along with negative control. Her1/2/3 silencing was verified by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Western blot analysis was performed following the protocols as reported earlier (13Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. Negative regulation of mixed lineage kinase 3 by protein kinase B/AKT leads to cell survival.J. Biol.

The specific signals were finally detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent. Endogenous MLK3 was immunoprecipitated by using an antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of MLK3, developed in our laboratory. Ectopically expressed MLK3 was immunoprecipitated by using antibody against the FLAG-epitope-tag (Sigma). In vitro kinase assay was performed following our published protocol (12Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. The mixed lineage kinase SPRK phosphorylates and activates the stress-activated protein kinase activator, SEK-1.J. Biol.

The incorporation of 32P into SEK1 kinase dead protein (SEK1 (K-R)) was quantified by phosphorimaging (STORM 820, GE Healthcare), and the kinase activity was presented as arbitrary phosphorimaging units. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described earlier (15Rangasamy V. Mishra R. Sondarva G. Das S. Lee T.H. Bakowska J.C. Tzivion G. Malter J.S. Rana B. Lu K.P. Kanthasamy A. Rana A. Mixed-lineage kinase 3 phosphorylates prolyl-isomerase Pin1 to regulate its nuclear translocation and cellular function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8149-8154Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatments, cells in chamber slides were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with respective primary and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and photographed using a laser confocal microscope (Zeiss). For immune-histological analysis, a total of 46 cores from breast cancer array (Biomax) were analyzed for MLK3 and p-MLK3 expressions. The 46 cores analyzed were: 12, normal/non-malignant; 8, ER−/PR−/HER2−; 26, ER−/PR−/HER2+. The ER−/PR−/HER2+ cores represent: 4, grade I; 10, grade II; 12, grade III breast cancer tissues. The deparaffinized tissue array was blocked in goat normal serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C with respective primary antibodies (pMLK3 and MLK3) followed by incubation with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and DAB (3, 3′-diaminobenzidine) peroxidase substrate staining were used for visualization of pMLK3 and MLK3 as per the manufacturer's protocol. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for nuclear staining and pictured under light microscope. The stable MLK3 knockdown in SKBR3 cells were created by utilizing validated MLK3-shRNA in lentiviral vector pLKO.1-Puro (Sigma). Lentivirus particles containing shRNAs were infected and selected with 0.6 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Knockdown of MLK3 expression was confirmed by PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell viability/proliferation was determined by using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). For the assay, 2.5 × 103 cells were plated on 96-well plates and incubated overnight for cell attachment. Cells were treated for 48–72 h either with trastuzumab or PI3K inhibitors before analysis. For sequential treatment with PI3K inhibitors and trastuzumab, the PI3K inhibitors were pretreated for 4 h before trastuzumab treatment. Colony formation assay with SKBR3-WT and SKBR3 MLK3-knockdown stable cells were carried out by seeding (1000 cells per/well) into 6-well plates containing 10% FBS. Cells were treated with trastuzumab (30 μg/ml) and lapatinib (10 nm) every 2nd day up to 14 days in fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The colonies were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet (0.05% w/v). The colonies were counted manually under a microscope in three different focusing zones and presented as the mean ± S.E. (% control). Data obtained from different sets of experiments are presented as the means ± S.E. Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ 1.42 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's multiple comparison test or unpaired Student's t test were done using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To explore the potential role of MLK3 in HER2 biology and breast cancer pathogenesis, we examined the status of MLK3 and activated MLK3 (i.e. p-MLK3) in human breast tumors. There was no difference in MLK3 protein expression between HER2+ and HER2− tumors; however, the expression of p-MLK3 was significantly down-regulated in HER2+ tumors as compared with HER2− breast tumors (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we examined the levels of MLK3 and p-MLK3 in different tumor grades of HER2+ breast tumors. Remarkably, the expression of MLK3 across all the grades of tumors was similar; however, the expression of p-MLK3 was progressively decreased and was least in Grade III tumors (Fig. 1C). To search for an experimental model system for mechanistic studies, we examined the expression of total and active MLK3 in HER2-positive and -negative cell lines. In agreement with the breast tumors, we found that the expression of p-MLK3 was significantly lower in HER2+ cell lines as compared with the levels in HER2− cell lines (Fig. 1E). Taken together, our results showed that MLK3 kinase activity is negatively regulated by HER2 pathway activation and, thus, might play a role in the progression of HER2+ breast cancer. Next, we sought to determine whether MLK3 kinase activity might be negatively regulated by HER2 signaling. Because there is no known ligand of HER2, we therefore took an reverse approach to block the HER2-initiated signaling by using trastuzumab and lapatinib, Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for HER2+ breast cancer patients. HER2+ cell lines SKBR3 and HCC1954 were treated either with 10 μg/ml trastuzumab or with 1 μm lapatinib for different period of times as indicated in Fig. 2. The endogenous MLK3 kinase activity was determined using the physiological substrate of MLK3 SEK1 (K-R) protein. There was a robust activation of the endogenous MLK3 kinase activity by both trastuzumab and lapatinib in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The kinase activity of MLK3 started to increase by 6 h of trastuzumab treatment and peaked at 24 h (Fig. 2, A and C). However, the lapatinib treatment rapidly activated MLK3 kinase activity and peaked after 2 h (Fig. 2, B and D). To confirm that MLK3 activation is specifically mediated via HER2, a HER2− cell line, MDA-MB-231 was treated with 1 μm lapatinib at different time points, and MLK3 kinase activity was determined. There was no activation of MLK3 kinase activity by lapatinib in the HER2− cell line (data not shown), suggesting that the effect of lapatinib on MLK3 activation is mediated via HER2. Furthermore, to rule out any role of the HER1/EGF receptor in MLK3 inhibition, the HER1 inhibitor, erlotinib treatment did not alter the activity of MLK3 (data not shown). Collectively, these results clearly showed that inhibition of HER2 pathway activates MLK3 kinase activity and, therefore, activation of HER2 pathway might inhibit MLK3 activity. There is no known ligand for HER2; however, HER2 is reported to be activated either via homodimerization or heterodimerization with other HER family members (2Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. ERBB receptors and cancer: the complexity of targeted inhibitors.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). The homo- or heterodimerization of HER2 eventually initiates downstream signaling in cancer cells for their survival, proliferation, and invasion (2Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. ERBB receptors and cancer: the complexity of targeted inhibitors.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further corroborate that the activation of HER2 pathway down-regulates MLK3 kinase activity and also to determine the nature of the HER family member(s) that dimerizes with HER2 in the observed negative regulation of MLK3, we knocked down HER1, HER2, and HER3 individually in SKBR3 cells and measured the MLK3 kinase activity. Our results clearly showed that knockdown of HER1 does not alter MLK3 kinase activity (Fig. 3B); however, knockdown of HER2 alone was sufficient to activate MLK3 kinase activity to a similar extent, like trastuzumab and lapatinib treatments (Fig. 3A). To rule out any off-target effects of HER2 siRNA, we also used a second siRNA against HER2; here again, the HER2 knockdown activated MLK3 kinase activity (data not shown). Similarly, knockdown of HER3 also activated MLK3 kinase activity (Fig. 3B), suggesting that HER3 is probably the dimerization partner of HER2 in MLK3 kinase activity inhibition. To further verify the role of HER3 as a dimerization partner and in MLK3 inhibition, we used heregulin, a ligand of HER3 to activate HER3/HER2-mediated downstream signaling. Treatment of SKBR3 cells with heregulin alone did not alter the basal activity of MLK3; however pretreatment of breast cancer cells with heregulin almost completely blocked trastuzumab- and lapatinib-induced MLK3 kinase activation (Fig. 3C). The immunofluorescence analysis of SKBR3 cells also confirmed that inhibitors of HER2 activate MLK3 kinase activity, whereas heregulin alone had no effect on MLK3 kinase activation (data not shown). These results suggested that HER2/HER3 or HER2/HER2 dimers mediate downstream signals leading to suppression of the MLK3 kinase activity. It is widely believed that upon HER2-HER3 heterodimerization, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of HER2 is activated and the intracellular kinase domain of HER2 trans-phosphorylates HER3 and creates a binding site for PI3K (16Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. Epidermal growth factor-dependent association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with the erbB3 gene product.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recruitment of PI3K to the HER3 intracellular domain activates downstream signaling, including activation of AKT for cell survival (17Choi B.K. Cai X. Yuan B. Huang Z. Fan X. Deng H. Zhang N. An Z. HER3 intracellular domains play a crucial role in HER3/HER2 dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways.Protein Cell. 2012; 3: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Earlier we reported that AKT directly phosphorylates MLK3 on Ser674 residue, and this phosphorylation was necessary to suppress MLK3 kinase activity by estrogen (18Rangasamy V. Mishra R. Mehrotra S. Sondarva G. Ray R.S. Rao A. Chatterjee M. Rana B. Rana A. Estrogen suppresses MLK3-mediated apoptosis sensitivity in ER+ breast cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and IGF-1 (13Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. Negative regulation of mixed lineage kinase 3 by protein kinase B/AKT leads to cell survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In these studies we also found that MLK3 inhibition by IGF-1 provides signals for cancer cell survival (13Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A.

To understand a potential role of PI3K/AKT pathway in HER2/HER3-mediated inhibition of MLK3 kinase activity, we pretreated SKBR3 cells with PI3K inhibitors, LY-294002 (19Gharbi S.I. Zvelebil M.J. Shuttleworth S.J. Hancox T. Saghir N. Timms J.F. Waterfield M.D. Exploring the specificity of the PI3K family inhibitor LY294002.Biochem.

Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 5522-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) before treatment with trastuzumab. Pretreatment of SKBR3 cells with PI3K inhibitors completely blocked trastuzumab-induced activation of MLK3 kinase activity (Fig. 4A) probably via direct phosphorylation of MLK3 on Ser674 site. To corroborate any direct role of AKT in HER2/HER3-mediated inhibition of the MLK3 kinase activity, we overexpressed constitutively active AKT (i.e. Myr-AKT) in the SKBR3 cells and determined MLK3 kinase activity upon treatment with trastuzumab or lapatinib. Interestingly, overexpression of active-AKT completely blocked trastuzumab- and lapatinib-induced MLK3 kinase activation, suggesting that perhaps AKT activation downstream of HER2-HER3 inhibits the MLK3 kinase activity (Fig. 4B). To independently confirm a direct role of AKT in MLK3 kinase activity inhibition by the HER2/HER3 pathway, we transfected an MLK3 mutant lacking an AKT phosphorylation site (i.e. MLK3 S674A) (13Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. Negative regulation of mixed lineage kinase 3 by protein kinase B/AKT leads to cell survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in SKBR3 cells. The MLK3 S674A mutant was not activated by trastuzumab, whereas MLK3-WT showed a robust activation (Fig. 4C) as expected from the earlier results. These results confirm that direct phosphorylation of MLK3 by AKT, downstream of the HER2/HER3 pathways, is necessary to suppress the MLK3 kinase activity in HER2+ breast cancer cells. Because trastuzumab causes cell death in HER2+ cells and we have reported that MLK3 activation is required to induce cell death in breast cancer cells (18Rangasamy V. Mishra R. Mehrotra S. Sondarva G. Ray R.S. Rao A. Chatterjee M. Rana B. Rana A. Estrogen suppresses MLK3-mediated apoptosis sensitivity in ER+ breast cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we next determined the effect of PI3K/AKT inhibition on MLK3-mediated cell death by HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab. The overexpression of MLK3, which leads to constitutive activation of MLK3 kinase activity, or trastuzumab treatment alone, triggered significant cell death in the SKBR3 cells, which was further potentiated by PI3K/AKT inhibitors, LY-294002 and GDC-0941 (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway downstream of HER2/HER3 inhibits MLK3 kinase activity as well as cytotoxic effects of trastuzumab in HER2+ breast cancer cells. To determine a physiological role of MLK3 in HER2-directed therapies, we generated HER2+ SKBR3 stable clones, where MLK3 was stably knocked down. The stable MLK3 knockdown clones showed a complete absence of MLK3 protein (Fig. 5A). Next, we determined the viability of these cells as a function of the trastuzumab dose. The parental SKBR3 cells were sensitive to trastuzumab-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner; however, the MLK3 knockdown cells showed complete resistance to trastuzumab-induced cell death, even at a much higher dose (100 μg/ml; Fig. 5B). We also determined the colony formation ability of these stable cell lines, and again the parental cell line showed a significantly low number of colonies compared with MLK3 knockdown cells in the presence of trastuzumab or lapatinib (Fig. 5C). Specially, the lapatinib almost completely abolished the SKBR3 parental cell colonies, whereas large numbers of MLK3 knockdown colonies were resistant to cell death by lapatinib (Fig. 5, C and D). Taken together, these results supported the finding that MLK3 plays an important role in promoting the survival of HER2+ breast cancer cells and that suppression of MLK3 kinase activity by HER2 contributes to enhanced breast cancer cell survival. The receptor-tyrosine kinase HER2 serves as prognostic marker and is targeted with agents that primarily relegate hyperactive downstream signaling pathways in breast cancer cells to promote cell death (8Tebbutt N. Pedersen M.W. Johns T.G. Targeting the ERBB family in cancer: couples therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the common endocrine therapies in breast cancer are associated with hyperactivation of RTK signaling pathways as well as therapeutic resistance and cell survival. In addition to HER2 amplification in breast cancer, IGF-1 receptor is also amplified in the majority (90–95%) of breast cancers (21Lu Y. Zi X. Zhao Y. Mascarenhas D. Pollak M. Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signaling and resistance to trastuzumab (Herceptin).J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the HER2− and IGF-1 receptor-mediated pathways might be mechanistically linked in conferring breast cancer cell survival, therapies resistance, and recurrence. Therefore, investigating the nature of a nodal molecule could resolve the concurrent compensatory roles of these receptors in breast cancer cell survival and can provide a viable future target for HER2-directed therapies. Here we report a common downstream target that is reported to be down-modulated by estrogen ER (18Rangasamy V. Mishra R. Mehrotra S. Sondarva G. Ray R.S. Rao A. Chatterjee M. Rana B. Rana A. Estrogen suppresses MLK3-mediated apoptosis sensitivity in ER+ breast cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as well as by IGF1-IGF-1 receptor (13Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. Negative regulation of mixed lineage kinase 3 by protein kinase B/AKT leads to cell survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) through a shared mechanism. In addition, we also reported recently that MLK3 kinase activity was down-regulated by IGF-1 and estrogen via activation of PI3K/AKT pathway (11Rana A. Rana B. Mishra R. Sondarva G. Rangasamy V. Das S. Viswakarma N. Kanthasamy A. Mixed lineage kinase-c-Jun N-terminal kinase axis: a potential therapeutic target in cancer.Genes Cancer. 2013; 4: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Specifically, the AKT activation, either by IGF-1 or estrogen directly, phosphorylates MLK3 on the Ser674 site (13Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. Negative regulation of mixed lineage kinase 3 by protein kinase B/AKT leads to cell survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation suppresses the MLK3 kinase activity and prevents cancer cell death (13Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. Negative regulation of mixed lineage kinase 3 by protein kinase B/AKT leads to cell survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because HER2/HER3 dimerization also promotes cell survival, in part via PI3K/AKT activation (9Junttila T.T. Akita R.W. Parsons K. Fields C. Lewis Phillips G.D. Friedman L.S. Sampath D. Sliwkowski M.X.

Our results suggest that HER2 inhibits MLK3 kinase activity and its pro-apoptotic function in breast cancer cells. The initial clue that activation of the HER2 pathway might down-regulate MLK3 kinase activity, stemmed from our original observation that in HER2+ breast tumors, the expression of activated MLK3 (p-MLK3) was significantly lower compared with HER2− breast tumors, whereas there was no change in the levels of total MLK3 (Fig. 1A). These results suggest the decrease in p-MLK3 signal in HER2+ tumors is conceivably due to post-translational modification of MLK3 (Fig. 1A). We modulated HER2 signaling using trastuzumab and lapatinib, two Food and Drug Administration-approved HER2 inhibitors in HER2+ breast cancer patients. We found that the treatment of HER2+, SKBR3, and HCC1954 cell lines with trastuzumab and lapatinib activated the kinase activity of MLK3 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the lapatinib treatment failed to activate MLK3 kinase activity in the HER2−, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Furthermore HER2 amplification inhibited MLK3 kinase activity as knockdown of HER2 or HER3 activated MLK3 kinase activity (Fig. 3, A and B). These results also suggest that HER3 is the preferred partner of HER2 in SKBR3 cells because HER1 knockdown had no effect on MLK3 activation (Fig. 3B). The anti-tumor actions of trastuzumab and lapatinib are mediated in part on their ability to down-regulate PI3K/AKT signaling (9Junttila T.T. Akita R.W. Parsons K. Fields C. Lewis Phillips G.D.

Lapatinib plus capecitabine for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). We examined whether the PI3K/AKT pathway directly impacts on the pro-apoptotic function of MLK3 in a HER2+ cell line. The fact that overexpression of MLK3 itself caused significant cell death in the HER2+ cell line (Fig. 4D), which was further synergized with PI3K/AKT inhibitors, suggests that indeed the PI3K/AKT pathway mediates pro-survival signals in HER2+ breast cancer cells, in part, via inhibition of MLK3 activity (this study). Our results suggest that MLK3 activity is necessary for HER2-directed therapies-induced cell death (Fig. 5). In summary, our results suggest that the HER2 pathway down-regulates MLK3 kinase activity via activation of PI3K/AKT pathway. More specifically, the inhibition of MLK3 kinase activity by the HER2 pathway was mediated via direct phosphorylation of a common serine residue (i.e. Ser674) by AKT. We propose that MLK3 may be a nodal point by which breast cancer cells survive via activation of PI3K/AKT pathway by HER2 and IGF-1 receptor and perhaps other cell surface receptor-initiated signaling (Fig. 6). Therefore, targeting MLK3 by using its activator could block the escape pathways that promote breast cancer cell survival, therapy resistance, and metastasis. A. R., S. D., C. O., B. R., and G.

In this study, we sought to investigate potential mechanisms that govern WWP1/Tiul1 (WWP1) ubiquitin ligase activity, focusing on its ability to trigger degradation of TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI) in conjunction with Smad7. Our data reveal that the WWP1 protein is very stable at steady states because its autopolyubiquitination activity is silenced due to an intra-interaction between the C2 and/or WW and Hect domains that favors WWP1 monoubiquitination at the expense of its polyubiquitination or polyubiquitination of TβRI. Upon binding of WWP1 to Smad7, this functional interplay is disabled, switching its monoubiquitination activity toward a polyubiquitination activity, thereby driving its own degradation and that of TβRI as well. Intriguingly, a WWP1 point mutation found in human prostate cancer disrupts this regulatory mechanism by relieving the inhibitory effects of C2 and WW on Hect and thereby causing WWP1 hyperactivation. That cancer-driven alteration of WWP1 culminates in excessive TβRI degradation and attenuated TGFβ cytostatic signaling, a consequence that could conceivably confer tumorigenic properties to WWP1.

A reduction in the hERG current causes long QT syndrome, which predisposes affected individuals to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. We reported previously that hERG channels in the plasma membrane undergo vigorous internalization under low K+ conditions. In the present study, we addressed whether hERG internalization occurs under normal K+ conditions and whether/how internalized channels are recycled back to the plasma membrane. Using patch clamp, Western blot, and confocal imaging analyses, we demonstrated that internalized hERG channels can effectively recycle back to the plasma membrane. Low K+-enhanced hERG internalization is accompanied by an increased rate of hERG recovery in the plasma membrane upon reculture following proteinase K-mediated clearance of cell-surface proteins. The increased recovery rate is not due to enhanced protein synthesis, as hERG mRNA expression was not altered by low K+ exposure, and the increased recovery was observed in the presence of the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. GTPase Rab11, but not Rab4, is involved in the recycling of hERG channels. Interfering with Rab11 function not only delayed hERG recovery in cells after exposure to low K+ medium but also decreased hERG expression and function in cells under normal culture conditions.

In the present study, we investigated the recycling of internalized hERG channels under low K+ as well as normal culture conditions. Our data reveal that Rab11-mediated recycling plays an important role in the homeostasis of hERG channels in the plasma membrane. A human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line stably expressing hERG channels (hERG-HEK cells) was provided by Dr. Craig January (University of Wisconsin-Madison); hERG cDNA was provided by Dr. Gail Robertson (University of Wisconsin-Madison). GFP-Rab11, GFP-Rab11 dominant-negative mutant S25N GFP-Rab11, GFP-Rab4, and GFP Rab4 dominant-negative mutant N121I GFP-Rab4 plasmids were obtained from Addgene as well as from Dr. Terry Hébert (McGill University, Montreal). Cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). For 0 mm K+ culture-induced hERG internalization, we used a custom 0 mm K+ MEM that lacks K+ in any form but contains all other components of standard MEM (Invitrogen). Because FBS contains K+, FBS was not included in the 0 mm K+ or 5 mm K+ (control) culture medium. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of plasmids into hERG-HEK cells. For immunofluorescence staining of cell-surface hERG channels in live cells, a HA epitope tag with the sequence 436TEEGPPATNSEHYPYDVPDYAVTFEECGY447 (bold indicates an insertion, and underlined indicates HA epitope) was inserted into the extracellularly localized S1-S2 loop of hERG to generate hERG-HAex via overlap extension PCR (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction.Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar). The hERG-HAex plasmid was transfected into HEK293 cells, and a stable hERG-HAex cell line (hERG-HAex-HEK) was created using G418 for selection (1 mg/ml) and maintenance (0.4 mg/ml). As reported previously by others and us, inserting HA into hERG in this manner does not change the electrophysiological or trafficking properties of the hERG channel (8Guo J. Massaeli H. Li W. Xu J. Luo T. Shaw J. Kirshenbaum L.A. Zhang S. Identification of IKr and its trafficking disruption induced by probucol in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Total cellular RNA was extracted from hERG-HEK cells cultured for 12 h in 5 or 0 mm K+ medium using a total RNA mini kit (catalog No. RB050, Geneaid Biotech Ltd., Taiwan). After treatment with DNase I (catalog No. M0303S, New England Biolabs), the RNA concentration and the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio were assessed using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Omniscript RT kit (catalog No. 205111, Qiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a thermal cycler (model 7500, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (catalog No. 4369016, Life Technologies). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a control housekeeping gene. Oligonucleotide primers were acquired from Life Technologies (hERG assay ID: Hs04234270_g1; GAPDH assay ID: Hs03929097_g1). The PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method and are presented as the fold induction of hERG transcripts normalized to GAPDH from hERG-HEK cells cultured in 5 or 0 mm K+ conditions. IhERG was recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp method. The bath solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution contained 135 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). IhERG was recorded by depolarizing steps to voltages between −70 and 70 mV in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of −80 mV. A repolarizing step to −50 mV was used to record the tail currents. For recordings from hERG-HEK cells transfected with GFP, GFP-tagged Rab4 mutant N121I, or Rab11 mutant S25N, GFP-positive cells were used. Patch clamp experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Whole-cell protein lysates from hERG-HEK cells were separated on 5.0 or 8.0% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted overnight at 4 °C onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20. Blocked membranes were immunoblotted for 1 h using the appropriate primary antibodies. Immunoblotted membranes were then incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein signals were detected using an ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare). The Precision Plus Protein dual color standard was used as the protein ladder (Bio-Rad). For quantification of Western blot data, the intensities of proteins of interest in each gel were first normalized to their respective actin intensities; the normalized intensities were then expressed as values relative to their controls. For each co-immunoprecipitation analysis, 0.5 mg of whole-cell protein in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The protein complexes were mixed with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads at 4 °C for 4 h prior to precipitation by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer. Then 2× Laemmli sample loading buffer was added to the pelleted immunoprecipitate prior to boiling for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected for Western blot analysis to detect proteins associated with the pulldown protein. For analysis of cell-surface proteins, a cell-surface protein isolation kit (catalog No. 89881, Pierce, Thermo Scientific) was used. hERG-HEK cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes and grown to 90% confluence. The cells were labeled with 10 ml of 0.25 mg/ml membrane-impermeant biotinylating reagent, sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, for 30 min at 4 °C. The quenching solution (0.5 ml) was added to stop the reaction. Cells were then lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, the cell lysate was precipitated with immobilized NeutrAvidin gel. The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the resin in a sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm DTT. Eluted cell-surface protein was then analyzed using Western blot analysis. To eliminate the 155-kDa hERG protein on the cell surface, hERG-HEK cells cultured in 5 or 0 mm K+ medium were treated with proteinase K (PK). Specifically, intact live cells were washed with PBS and treated with 200 μg/ml PK (Sigma-Aldrich) in a buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4)) at 37 °C for 20 min (8Guo J. Massaeli H. Li W. Xu J. Luo T. Shaw J. Kirshenbaum L.A. Zhang S. Identification of IKr and its trafficking disruption induced by probucol in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The reaction was terminated by adding ice-cold PBS containing 6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 mm EDTA. To examine the sensitivity of hERG proteins to trypsin digestion, 20 μg of whole-cell protein from hERG-HEK cells cultured in 5 or 0 mm K+ medium for 12 h was treated with various concentrations of trypsin (∼10,000 benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units/mg protein; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with lima bean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich). Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin was used to track the endocytosed hERG channels. hERG-HEK cells were cultured in 5 or 0 mm K+ medium for 12 h. Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin reacts with amine groups to form amide bonds (Pierce cell-surface protein isolation kit). Because the culture medium contains single amino acids, which may interfere with the reaction between sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and cell-surface proteins, we labeled cell-surface proteins in 0 mm K+ Tyrode's solution with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.25 mg/ml) during a 2-h cell culture period. An additional 4-h culture in 0 mm K+ medium was conducted to induce internalization of biotinylated cell-surface hERG channels. Whole-cell protein lysates were collected. Biotinylated proteins were isolated using NeutrAvidin beads and assessed using Western blot analysis. To remove N-linked oligosaccharides from the glycosylated hERG channels, peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) treatment was performed as per the protocol provided by the supplier (New England Biolabs). In brief, cells were lysed in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% protease inhibitor mixture, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% SDS. 20 μg of the protein lysate was denatured by the addition of 1 μl of 10× denaturing buffer to a total volume of 10 μl in water, and boiled (at 100 °C) for 10 min. A final volume of 20 μl was made by adding 2 μl of 10× G7 reaction buffer, 2 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, 1 μl of PNGase F (500 NEB units or 7.6 IUB milliunits), and water. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then subjected to Western blot analysis. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment was performed as per the protocol provided by the supplier (New England Biolabs). In brief, cells were lysed in a phosphate buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% protease inhibitor mixture, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% SDS (pH 7.4). 20 μg of protein lysate was denatured by the addition of 1 μl of 10× denaturing buffer to a total volume of 10 μl in water and boiled (100 °C) for 10 min. A final volume of 20 μl was made by adding 2 μl of 10× GlycoBuffer 3, 0.5 μl of Endo H (250 NEB or 25 IUB milliunits), and water. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then subjected to Western blot analysis. To determine the co-localization between hERG and Rab4 or Rab11, hERG-HEK cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h. Cells were then cultured in 5 or 0 mm K+ medium for 3 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. hERG channels were stained with goat anti-hERG primary (C-20) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies. Endogenous Rab4 or Rab11 was detected with rabbit anti-Rab4 or anti-Rab11 primary and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP2 Multi Photon confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). To visualize the recycling of hERG channels, hERG-HAex-HEK cells grown for 24 h on glass-bottom plates were incubated with anti-HA-FITC antibody at 4 °C for 20 min. Unbound antibody was then washed away with PBS. Cells were cultured in 0 mm K+ medium at 37 °C for 3 h to induce hERG endocytosis. After images were taken, the cells were cultured under normal (5 mm K+) conditions for an additional 3 h to observe recycling of the labeled channels. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Observer.Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). To examine the recycling of hERG channels in cells under normal culture conditions, hERG-HAex-HEK cells grown on glass coverslips for 24 h were labeled with mouse anti-HA primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Cells were cultured for 2 h to allow internalization of labeled HA-hERG under normal culture conditions. Non-internalized HA-labeled hERG channels on the cell-surface were stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies for 30 min. Cells were then cultured for an additional 2 h under normal conditions to allow previously internalized and labeled channels to recycle back to the plasma membrane. Recycled channels (HA-labeled, secondary antibody-free) in the cell surface were then labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies for 30 min. As the non-internalized HA-labeled hERG channels on the cell surface had already been labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (red)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 (green)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies could only stain HA-labeled recycled hERG channels. Cells were fixed at various stages with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP2 Multi Photon confocal microscope. Rabbit anti-Kv11.1 (hERG) and anti-GFP antibodies, mouse anti-HA and anti-actin antibodies, G418, BSA, cycloheximide (CHX), brefeldin A (BFA), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transport blocker FLI-06, protease inhibitor mixture, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-HA-FITC antibody was purchased from Abcam. Goat anti-hERG (C-20), anti-actin, and anti-GAPDH; rabbit anti-Rab11, anti-Rab4, and anti-GAPDH; mouse anti-Na+/K+ ATPase and anti-GAPDH antibodies; Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies; and protein A/G Plus-agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

On Western blots, hERG proteins from whole-cell lysates of cells cultured under normal conditions (5 mm K+) display two distinct bands: a mature fully-glycosylated form in the plasma membrane with a molecular mass of 155 kDa and an immature core-glycosylated form, presumably in the ER, with a molecular mass of 135 kDa (8Guo J.

Compared with cells cultured in 5 mm K+ MEM, cells cultured in 0 mm K+ medium for 6 h resulted in a disappearance of the 155-kDa hERG band and a 36 ± 9% (n = 11, p < 0.01) increase in the intensity of the 135-kDa band (Fig. 1A, upper panel). To demonstrate that the 155-kDa hERG is localized in the plasma membrane and that the 135-kDa hERG protein is localized intracellularly, we treated intact cells, precultured in 5 or 0 mm K+ medium for 6 h, with PK (200 μg/ml, 20 min) to cleave cell-surface hERG channels (8Guo J.

As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1A, treatment with PK selectively removed the 155-kDa band but did not affect the 135-kDa band, indicating that the 155-kDa hERG protein is localized in the plasma membrane. Whole-cell patch clamp analysis revealed that the 155-kDa hERG proteins represent the functional channels, as cleavage of the 155-kDa hERG by PK resulted in a complete disappearance of IhERG (Fig. 1A, lower panel). It is generally believed that under normal culture conditions the 135-kDa protein represents the immature hERG channels localized in the ER (8Guo J. Massaeli H. Li W. Xu J. Luo T. Shaw J.

However, it may be more complex during hypokalemic conditions. As shown in Fig. 1A, culturing hERG-HEK cells in 0 mm K+ medium for 6 h led to a disappearance of the 155-kDa band and a concomitant increase in the 135-kDa band. We had demonstrated previously that 0 mm K+ culture-induced internalized hERG channels undergo multivesicular body and lysosomal degradation (31Sun T. Guo J. Shallow H. Yang T. Xu J. Li W. Hanson C. Wu J.G. Li X. Massaeli H. Zhang S. The role of monoubiquitination in endocytic degradation of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels under low K+ conditions.J. Biol.

Here, we propose that the internalized 155-kDa hERG channels may have been modified into a form close to 135 kDa and are initially stored in the recycling reservoir prior to degradation. The internalized hERG channels may recycle back to the plasma membrane in a route faster than new biosynthesis. Thus, following clearance of cell-surface hERG channels by PK treatment, hERG-HEK cells with enhanced hERG internalization would display an accelerated recovery of hERG channels to the cell surface upon reculture in normal K+ (5 mm) medium. The data shown in Fig. 1, B–D, support this notion. Specifically, we precultured hERG-HEK cells in 5 (control) or 0 mm K+ medium (to promote hERG internalization) overnight (12 h). We then used PK treatments to clear cell-surface h"

However, the downstream effectors of ascorbate in the regulation of endothelial permeability remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated ascorbate as a mediator of thrombin-induced barrier permeabilization in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and their immortalized hybridoma line, EA.hy926. We found that the vitamin fully prevented increased permeability to the polysaccharide inulin by thrombin in a dose-dependent manner, and it took effect both before and after subjection to thrombin. Thrombin exposure consumed intracellular ascorbate but not the endogenous antioxidant GSH. Likewise, the antioxidants dithiothreitol and tempol did not reverse permeabilization. We identified a novel role for ascorbate in preserving cAMP during thrombin stimulation, resulting in two downstream effects. First, ascorbate maintained the cortical actin cytoskeleton in a Rap1- and Rac1-dependent manner, thus preserving stable adherens junctions between adjacent cells. Second, ascorbate prevented actin polymerization and formation of stress fibers by reducing the activation of RhoA and phosphorylation of myosin light chain. Although ascorbate and thrombin both required calcium for their respective effects, ascorbate did not prevent thrombin permeabilization by obstructing calcium influx. However, preservation of cAMP by ascorbate was found to depend on both the production of nitric oxide by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, which ascorbate is known to activate, and the subsequent generation cGMP by guanylate cyclase. Together, these data implicate ascorbate in the prevention of inflammatory endothelial barrier permeabilization and explain the underlying signaling mechanism."

Denatured dermis has the ability to restore to the morphology and function of normal skin, but the underlying molecular mechanism is elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs and regulate normal physiology as well as disease development. In this study, we assessed the potential role of miRNA-23b (miR-23b) in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration of heat-denatured fibroblasts and identified the underlying mechanism.The expression of miR-23b in denatured dermis and heat-denatured fibroblasts was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effects of miR-23b on cell proliferation and migration of heat-denatured fibroblasts were assessed by transient transfection of miR-23b mimics and inhibitor. The target gene of miR-23b and the downstream pathway were further investigated.miR-23b was downregulated in denatured dermis and heat-denatured fibroblasts. Downregulation of miR-23b dramatically promoted the proliferation and migration of heat-denatured fibroblasts. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that Smad3 was a direct and functional target of miR-23b in heat-denatured fibroblasts, which was validated by the dual luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that denatured dermis from rats displayed enhanced staining of Smad3. In addition, miR-23b modulated denatured dermis by activating the Notch1 and TGF-β signaling pathways.Our findings suggest that downregulation of miR-23b contributes to the recovery of denatured dermis, which may be valuable for treatment of skin burns."

These cell signals are propagated following receptor-ligand engagement, controlling recruitment and activation of effector proteins. The IL-2 receptor β subunit (IL-2Rβ) serves in this capacity and is known to be phosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β chain has been studied extensively. However, the identification and putative regulatory roles for serine and threonine phosphorylation sites have yet to be fully characterized. Using LC-MS/MS and phosphospecific antibodies, a novel IL-2/IL-15 inducible IL-2Rβ phosphorylation site (Thr-450) was identified. IL-2 phosphokinetic analysis revealed that phosphorylation of IL-2Rβ Thr-450 is rapid (2.5 min), transient (peaks at 15 min), and protracted compared with receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and occurs in multiple cell types, including primary human lymphocytes. Pharmacological and siRNA-mediated inhibition of various serine/threonine kinases revealed ERK1/2 as a positive regulator, whereas purified protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), dephosphorylated Thr-450 in vitro. Reconstitution assays demonstrated that Thr-450 is important for regulating IL-2R complex formation, recruitment of JAK3, and activation of AKT and ERK1/2 and a transcriptionally active STAT5.

However, the differential expression and distribution of their distinct α subunits allows IL-2 and IL-15 to have unique cellular roles. For example, IL-2 serves to eliminate self-reactive T-cells, whereas IL-15 can support memory T cell survival (12Waldmann T.A.

The positive signal transduction mediated by IL-2 has been attributed to tyrosine phosphorylation of distinct residues within the IL-2Rβ and recruitment of, predominantly, SHC to Tyr-338 and STAT5 to Tyr-338, Tyr-392, and Tyr-510 (10Delespine-Carmagnat M.

Receptor-docked molecules become activated and initiate the JAK/STAT, PI3K, and MEK/ERK pathways, which regulate genes involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (14Gaffen S.L.

Surprisingly, activation of STAT5 has been observed in cells expressing IL-2Rβ with phosphodeletion mutations of its three key tyrosine residues (Tyr-338, Tyr-392, and Tyr-510) (17Yu A. Zhu L.

Interestingly, IL-2 also induces serine and threonine phosphorylation of IL-2Rβ (18Ross J.A. Cheng H. Nagy Z.S. Frost J.A. Kirken R.A.

Recent evidence indicates that serine and threonine phosphorylation can have multiple effects on the IL-2 signaling cascade. Our group showed that activation of adenylate cyclase and PKA resulted in negative regulation of IL-2 signaling at multiple levels, characterized by heightened serine phosphorylation and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 (21Rodriguez G. Ross J.A. Nagy Z.S. Kirken R.A. Forskolin-inducible cAMP pathway negatively regulates T-cell proliferation by uncoupling the interleukin-2 receptor complex.J. Biol.

Moreover, IL-2-induced tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT5 was reduced, along with the formation of a functional IL-2R complex. It is known that negative regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway is achieved through several mechanisms, including dephosphorylation of key residues by protein tyrosine phosphatases, sequestering phosphotyrosine docking sites by suppressor of cytokine signaling molecules (22Shuai K. Liu B. Regulation of JAK-STAT signalling in the immune system.Nat. Rev.

To further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of serine and threonine phosphorylation and impact on IL-2 signaling, this study investigated IL-2Rβ serine/threonine phosphorylation in response to IL-2 stimulation. Here we provide evidence of IL-2- or IL-15-induced IL-2Rβ phosphorylation at Thr-450 mediated by ERK1/2 and negatively regulated by PP1. In addition, phosphorylation of Thr-450 was found to play a role in stabilizing the IL-2R complex and to be required for full signaling of its downstream components, including STAT5B transcriptional activity. This study suggests that cytokine receptor residues such as IL-2Rβ Thr-450, and possibly others, serve to regulate signaling pathways in addition to their well studied tyrosine-phosphorylated residues.

Mutant forms of IL-2Rβ were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The primers used for the IL-2Rβ mutation were as follows: T450A (5′-TGGGGCCTCCCGCCCCAGGAGTC-3′) and T450E (5′-CCCTGGGGCCTCCCGAGCCAGGAGTCCCAGA-3′). All subclones and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing at the Genomic Analysis Core Facility of the Border Biomedical Research Center, The University of Texas at El Paso. Transient transfections of HEK293 cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. YT cells (20 × 106) were incubated without or with human recombinant IL-2 (100 nm) for 5 min or with 100 nm CA for 15 min prior to solubilization in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 50 mm NaCl). Cell lysates were incubated without or with 0.5 units of purified PP1 or PP2A (Millipore) at 37 °C for 60 min according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The reactions were stopped by addition of sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 9.2% SDS, 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of Thr-450 was measured by WB analysis. ERK1 (SMARTpool, catalog no. M-003592-03-0010) and ERK2 (SMARTpool, catalog no. M-003555-04-0010) as well as control non-targeting (siGENOME, non-targeting siRNA pool #1, catalog no. D-001206-13-20) siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon. Transfection of YT cells was carried out by electroporation using the Nucleofection system by Amaxa according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, YT cells (5 × 106) were suspended in 100 μl of transfection solution and transfected with 750 nm of ERK1 and 1 μm ERK2 or 1.750 μm control siRNA. Transfected cells were immediately diluted with prewarmed complete RPMI medium and cultured for 48 h. Cells were then quieted for 24 h in 1% FBS medium before incubation with or without IL-2 as indicated. Subconfluent HEK293 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with the following plasmids: WT or mutant IL-2Rβ (6 μg), γc (6 μg), JAK3 (0.5 μg), STAT5B (3 μg), β-casein-luciferase reporter (3 μg), and pCMV-β-gal (1 μg). Cells were stimulated with or without 100 nm IL-2, transferred to 96-well plates (50,000 cells/well), and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Luciferase and β-gal activities were measured using ONE-Glo luciferase and Beta-Glo assay systems (Promega), respectively, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To identify unique and previously uncharacterized IL-2Rβ phosphoregulatory sites, the β subunit of the IL-2 receptor was analyzed by mass spectrometry. YT cells, which express ∼15,000 β receptors (35Robb R.J. Rusk C.M. Yodoi J. Greene W.C. Interleukin 2 binding molecule distinct from the Tac protein: analysis of its role in formation of high-affinity receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), were left untreated (Fig. 1A, lane a), stimulated with IL-2 for 10 min (Fig. 1A, lane b), or treated for 15 min with CA (Fig. 1A, lane c), a serine/threonine PP1 and PP2A inhibitor, to induce maximum phosphorylation of these residues. IL-2Rβ was immunoprecipitated, and the samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1A). An aliquot of the sample was analyzed by Western blot for tyrosine phosphorylation and total IL-2Rβ (Fig. 1B) to ensure IL-2-induced activation of the receptor. Indeed, IL-2 stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-2Rβ (Fig. 1B, lane b, top panel). In addition, a reduction in protein migration was observed in the sample stimulated with IL-2 as well as in the CA-treated sample (Fig. 1B, lanes b and c, bottom panel), a phenomenon observed frequently in phosphorylated proteins (18Ross J.A. Cheng H. Nagy Z.S. Frost J.A. Kirken R.A. Protein phosphatase 2A regulates interleukin-2 receptor complex formation and JAK3/STAT5 activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3582-3591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The bands corresponding to non-stimulated (75-kDa), IL-2-stimulated (80-kDa), and CA-treated (100-kDa) IL-2Rβ (Fig. 1A, lanes a–c) were excised, subjected to trypsin and Asp-N digestion, and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Spectrum analysis using the Sequest search algorithm revealed a combined protein coverage of 61%, 84%, and 99%, respectively, and the identification of several novel IL-2Rβ phosphorylated peptides. Of specific interest was the peptide DWDPQPLGPPTPGVPDVDFQPPPELVLR, which contains the phosphorylated IL-2Rβ Thr-450 residue (underlined). This phosphothreonine was identified in both IL-2-stimulated as well as CA-treated samples. The tandem mass spectrum for the peptide from IL-2-stimulated samples is shown in Fig. 1C. A comparable spectrum was obtained for the corresponding peptide in CA-treated YT cells, and phosphorylation of the site was confirmed in CA-treated, IL-2Rβ-transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). To determine the extent of Thr-450 evolutionary conservation, the human IL-2Rβ protein sequence was aligned with IL-2 receptor β from several species (Fig. 1D). Thr-450 is flanked by prolines, and its primary amino acid sequence is well conserved among eight different species, mostly primates. The position of this novel threonine phosphorylation site, along with previously identified and reported IL-2Rβ tyrosine phosphorylation sites, are presented in Fig. 1E. To verify that IL-2Rβ is phosphorylated at Thr-450 and to investigate the regulatory role of this phosphorylation site, a phosphospecific polyclonal antibody was generated. Dot blot analysis was performed with the immunizing phosphopeptide and the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide (see “Experimental Procedures” for sequences) to determine whether the IL-2Rβ phosphospecific antibody cross-reacts with the non-phosphorylated form of the peptide. Decreasing amounts (1 μg, 0.1 μg, 10 ng, 1 ng, and 0.1 ng) of Thr(P)-450 or Thr-450 peptides were spotted on to PVDF membranes and blotted with α-Thr(P)-450 IL-2Rβ. The α-Thr(P)-450 IL-2Rβ antibody primarily recognized the phosphorylated peptide but not its non-phosphorylated counterpart, indicating strong and selective binding to the phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 2A, first panel, far left). In addition, dot-blotted membranes were probed using α-Thr(P)-450 IL-2Rβ preincubated with increasing amounts of non-phosphopeptide or phosphopeptide as indicated. The α-Thr(P)-450 IL-2Rβ phosphoantibody was specifically blocked by the phosphopeptide (Fig. 2A, fourth and fifth panels, right) but not the non-phosphopeptide (Fig. 2A, second and third panels, center), confirming antibody-peptide specificity. To further characterize this phosphospecific antibody, HEK293 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding WT IL-2Rβ, T450A, or T450E mutants. 48 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm CA for 1 h, and IL-2Rβ was immunoprecipitated, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and examined for Thr-450 phosphorylation by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, the α-Thr(P)-450 IL-2Rβ antibody recognized CA-treated WT IL-2Rβ (lane d) but not the T450A mutant (lane f). Recognition of the T450E mutant (Fig. 2B, lanes g and h) by the antibody was comparable with non-treated WT (Fig. 2B, lane c); however, CA-induced phosphorylation was not detectable in either Thr-450 mutants (Fig. 2B, lanes f and h). Reprobing these blots with α-IL-2Rβ antibody showed a similar expression of the protein. Taken together, the data confirm the specificity of this antibody toward the Thr-450-phosphorylated form of IL-2Rβ by Western blot analysis. IL-2 and IL-15 share the β and γc subunits of their receptors and utilize common JAK/STAT signaling molecules, which results in shared functions, including T and B cell proliferation and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. However, IL-2 and IL-15 also play distinct roles necessary for homeostasis of the immune response (12Waldmann T.A. The biology of interleukin-2 and interleukin-15: implications for cancer therapy and vaccine design.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-2Rβ is phosphorylated at Thr-450 in response to physiological stimuli and to assess whether IL-2-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine and Thr-450 differ in kinetics, YT cells were subjected to a cytokine stimulation time course (0–30 min) with IL-2. Endogenous IL-2Rβ was immunoprecipitated and examined for phosphorylation by either α-Tyr(P) or α-Thr(P)-450 IL-2Rβ antibodies (Fig. 3A, lanes a–g). IL-2 stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of tyrosine and Thr-450 within 30 s (Fig. 3A, lane b). Although tyrosine phosphorylation reached maximal levels between 30 s and 2.5 min (Fig. 3A, lanes b and c), the Thr-450 phosphorylation signal was protracted and continued to increase until 10 min after IL-2 stimulation (Fig. 3A, lanes b–e). Dephosphorylation of tyrosine and Thr-450 began 30 min post-stimulation (Fig. 3A, lane g). It should be noted that internalization of the receptor begins 15–25 min after binding of IL-2 (36Duprez V. Ferrer M. Dautry-Varsat A. High-affinity interleukin 2 receptor α and β chains are internalized and remain associated inside the cells after interleukin 2 endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18639-18643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hence the reduction in signal for total protein. The densitometry analysis of the representative blot is shown in Fig. 3B. To evaluate a putative pleiotropic role of Thr-450 phosphorylation, YT cells were stimulated with IL-15 and harvested at different time points (0–60 min), and then immunoprecipitated IL-2Rβ was examined for phosphorylation with α-Thr(P)-450 IL"
https://openalex.org/W2262432939,"Uncaria tomentosa is widely used in folk medicine for the treatment of numerous diseases, such as urinary tract disease. Hemorrhagic cystitis (HE) is an inflammatory condition of the bladder associated with the use of anticancer drugs such as cyclophosphamide (CYP). Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (Mesna) has been used to prevent the occurrence of HE, although this compound is not effective in established lesions. It has been demonstrated that the purinergic system is involved in several pathophysiological events. Among purinergic receptors, P2X7 deserves attention because it is involved in HE induced by CYP and, therefore, can be considered a therapeutic target. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of the quinovic acid glycosides purified fraction (QAPF) from U. tomentosa in the mouse model of CYP-induced HE. Pretreatment with QAPF not only had a protective effect on HE-induced urothelial damage (edema, hemorrhage and bladder wet weight) but was also able to control visceral pain, decrease IL-1β levels and down-regulates P2X7 receptors, most likely by inhibit the neutrophils migration to the bladder. This research clearly demonstrates the promising anti-inflammatory properties of QAPF, supporting its use as complementary therapy. QAPF represents a promising therapeutic option for this pathological condition."
https://openalex.org/W1494923057,"Background Diarrhea is a prevalent pathological condition frequently associated to the colonization of the small intestine by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains, known to be endemic in developing countries. These strains can produce two enterotoxins associated with the manifestation of clinical symptoms that can be used to detect these pathogens. Although several detection tests have been developed, minimally equipped laboratories are still in need of simple and cost-effective methods. With the aim to contribute to the development of such diagnostic approaches, we describe here two mouse hybridoma-derived single chain fragment variable (scFv) that were produced in E. coli against enterotoxins of ETEC strains. Methods and Findings Recombinant scFv were developed against ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin (ST), from previously isolated hybridoma clones. This work reports their design, construction, molecular and functional characterization against LT and ST toxins. Both antibody fragments were able to recognize the cell-interacting toxins by immunofluorescence, the purified toxins by ELISA and also LT-, ST- and LT/ST-producing ETEC strains. Conclusion The developed recombinant scFvs against LT and ST constitute promising starting point for simple and cost-effective ETEC diagnosis."

https://openalex.org/W1530638878,"Temperature is a predominant environmental factor affecting grass germination and distribution. Various thermal-germination models for prediction of grass seed germination have been reported, in which the relationship between temperature and germination were defined with kernel functions, such as quadratic or quintic function. However, their prediction accuracies warrant further improvements. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative prediction accuracies of genetic algorithm (GA) models, which are automatically parameterized with observed germination data. The seeds of five P. pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass, KB) cultivars were germinated under 36 day/night temperature regimes ranging from 5/5 to 40/40°C with 5°C increments. Results showed that optimal germination percentages of all five tested KB cultivars were observed under a fluctuating temperature regime of 20/25°C. Meanwhile, the constant temperature regimes (e.g., 5/5, 10/10, 15/15°C, etc.) suppressed the germination of all five cultivars. Furthermore, the back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) algorithm was integrated to optimize temperature-germination response models from these observed germination data. It was found that integrations of GA-BP-ANN (back propagation aided genetic algorithm artificial neural network) significantly reduced the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values from 0.21~0.23 to 0.02~0.09. In an effort to provide a more reliable prediction of optimum sowing time for the tested KB cultivars in various regions in the country, the optimized GA-BP-ANN models were applied to map spatial and temporal germination percentages of blue grass cultivars in China. Our results demonstrate that the GA-BP-ANN model is a convenient and reliable option for constructing thermal-germination response models since it automates model parameterization and has excellent prediction accuracy."
