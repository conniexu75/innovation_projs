https://openalex.org/W2087704839,"Paralysis following spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other disorders can disconnect the brain from the body, eliminating the ability to perform volitional movements. A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals."

https://openalex.org/W2091023923,"Updating the Triode with Graphene In early electronics, the triode—a vacuum device that combined a diode and an electrical grid—was used to control and amplify signals, but was replaced in most applications by solid-state silicon electronics. One characteristic of silicon-metal interfaces is that the Schottky barrier created—which acts as a diode—does not change with the work function of the metal—the Fermi level is pinned by the presence of surface states. Yang et al. (p. 1140 , published online 17 May) now show that for a graphene-silicon interface, Fermi-level pinning can be overcome and a triode-type device with a variable barrier, a “barristor,” can be made and used to create devices such as inverters."

https://openalex.org/W2052029379,"The opioid receptor family comprises three members, the µ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors, which respond to classical opioid alkaloids such as morphine and heroin as well as to endogenous peptide ligands like endorphins. They belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, and are excellent therapeutic targets for pain control. The δ-opioid receptor (δ-OR) has a role in analgesia, as well as in other neurological functions that remain poorly understood. The structures of the µ-OR and κ-OR have recently been solved. Here we report the crystal structure of the mouse δ-OR, bound to the subtype-selective antagonist naltrindole. Together with the structures of the µ-OR and κ-OR, the δ-OR structure provides insights into conserved elements of opioid ligand recognition while also revealing structural features associated with ligand-subtype selectivity. The binding pocket of opioid receptors can be divided into two distinct regions. Whereas the lower part of this pocket is highly conserved among opioid receptors, the upper part contains divergent residues that confer subtype selectivity. This provides a structural explanation and validation for the 'message-address' model of opioid receptor pharmacology, in which distinct 'message' (efficacy) and 'address' (selectivity) determinants are contained within a single ligand. Comparison of the address region of the δ-OR with other GPCRs reveals that this structural organization may be a more general phenomenon, extending to other GPCR families as well."
https://openalex.org/W2090643737,"The crystal structure of the human nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptor in complex with the peptide mimetic antagonist compound-24 is determined, with potential importance for the development of new therapeutic agents. Four papers in this issue of Nature present the long-awaited high-resolution crystal structures of the four known opioid receptors in ligand-bound conformations. These G-protein-coupled receptors are the targets of a broad range of drugs, including painkillers, antidepressants, anti-anxiety agents and anti-addiction medications. Brian Kobilka’s group reports the crystal structure of the µ-opioid receptor bound to a morphinan antagonist and the δ-opioid receptor bound to naltrindole. Raymond Stevens’ group reports on the κ-opioid receptor bound to the selective antagonist JDTic, and the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor bound to a peptide mimetic. In an associated News and Views, Marta Filizola and Lakshmi Devi discuss the implications of these landmark papers for research on the mechanisms underlying receptor function and drug development. Members of the opioid receptor family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are found throughout the peripheral and central nervous system, where they have key roles in nociception and analgesia. Unlike the ‘classical’ opioid receptors, δ, κ and μ (δ-OR, κ-OR and μ-OR), which were delineated by pharmacological criteria in the 1970s and 1980s, the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide receptor (NOP, also known as ORL-1) was discovered relatively recently by molecular cloning and characterization of an orphan GPCR1. Although it shares high sequence similarity with classical opioid GPCR subtypes (∼60%), NOP has a markedly distinct pharmacology, featuring activation by the endogenous peptide N/OFQ, and unique selectivity for exogenous ligands2,3. Here we report the crystal structure of human NOP, solved in complex with the peptide mimetic antagonist compound-24 (C-24) (ref. 4), revealing atomic details of ligand–receptor recognition and selectivity. Compound-24 mimics the first four amino-terminal residues of the NOP-selective peptide antagonist UFP-101, a close derivative of N/OFQ, and provides important clues to the binding of these peptides. The X-ray structure also shows substantial conformational differences in the pocket regions between NOP and the classical opioid receptors κ (ref. 5) and μ (ref. 6), and these are probably due to a small number of residues that vary between these receptors. The NOP–compound-24 structure explains the divergent selectivity profile of NOP and provides a new structural template for the design of NOP ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2100128206,"Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is an often fatal disease that affects pregnant women who are near delivery, and it occurs more frequently in women with pre-eclampsia and/or multiple gestation. The aetiology of PPCM, and why it is associated with pre-eclampsia, remain unknown. Here we show that PPCM is associated with a systemic angiogenic imbalance, accentuated by pre-eclampsia. Mice that lack cardiac PGC-1α, a powerful regulator of angiogenesis, develop profound PPCM. Importantly, the PPCM is entirely rescued by pro-angiogenic therapies. In humans, the placenta in late gestation secretes VEGF inhibitors like soluble FLT1 (sFLT1), and this is accentuated by multiple gestation and pre-eclampsia. This anti-angiogenic environment is accompanied by subclinical cardiac dysfunction, the extent of which correlates with circulating levels of sFLT1. Exogenous sFLT1 alone caused diastolic dysfunction in wild-type mice, and profound systolic dysfunction in mice lacking cardiac PGC-1α. Finally, plasma samples from women with PPCM contained abnormally high levels of sFLT1. These data indicate that PPCM is mainly a vascular disease, caused by excess anti-angiogenic signalling in the peripartum period. The data also explain how late pregnancy poses a threat to cardiac homeostasis, and why pre-eclampsia and multiple gestation are important risk factors for the development of PPCM."

Even so, it has been challenging to get a handle on the preferred arrangement adopted by just six water molecules. Interdependent theoretical and spectroscopic studies have narrowed down the lowest-energy hexamer structures to three isomers—respectively designated the cage, the book, and the prism—but their relative energies remain uncertain. Now, Pérez et al.

https://openalex.org/W1981693548,"Copy number variants (CNVs) are major contributors to genetic disorders. We have dissected a region of the 16p11.2 chromosome--which encompasses 29 genes--that confers susceptibility to neurocognitive defects when deleted or duplicated. Overexpression of each human transcript in zebrafish embryos identified KCTD13 as the sole message capable of inducing the microcephaly phenotype associated with the 16p11.2 duplication, whereas suppression of the same locus yielded the macrocephalic phenotype associated with the 16p11.2 deletion, capturing the mirror phenotypes of humans. Analyses of zebrafish and mouse embryos suggest that microcephaly is caused by decreased proliferation of neuronal progenitors with concomitant increase in apoptosis in the developing brain, whereas macrocephaly arises by increased proliferation and no changes in apoptosis. A role for KCTD13 dosage changes is consistent with autism in both a recently reported family with a reduced 16p11.2 deletion and a subject reported here with a complex 16p11.2 rearrangement involving de novo structural alteration of KCTD13. Our data suggest that KCTD13 is a major driver for the neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with the 16p11.2 CNV, reinforce the idea that one or a small number of transcripts within a CNV can underpin clinical phenotypes, and offer an efficient route to identifying dosage-sensitive loci."

Johnson et al. (p. 904 ) analyzed CNDD in over 200,000 plots from a database of more than 3 million individuals of 151 species spanning 4 million square kilometers across forests in the eastern United States and found that the strength of CNDD strongly predicted the relative abundance of tree species. Because tree seedlings are unlikely to become established where conspecific adults are common, CNDD may provide a general mechanism maintaining diversity in forests."

https://openalex.org/W2027592332,"Cavity-Induced Minimum Tuning the strength and range of interactions in cold atomic gases is crucial to their role as quantum simulators. Most atom-atom interactions are short-ranged. One way to extend the range is to couple the gas to an optical cavity, which can propagate interactions between atoms, making the interactions effectively long-ranged. This system has been used to observe a transition to a “supersolid” phase characterized by a checkerboard atomic density order. Mottl et al. (p. 1570 , published online 17 May) used Bragg spectroscopy to measure the excitation spectrum of an ultracold gas of Rb-87 atoms as the interaction strength was varied. Consistent with theoretical predictions, a minimum was observed in the excitation energy, similar to that observed in roton excitations of the superfluid helium."
https://openalex.org/W2092224811,"Observational analyses have shown the width of the tropical belt increasing in recent decades as the world has warmed. This expansion is important because it is associated with shifts in large-scale atmospheric circulation and major climate zones. Although recent studies have attributed tropical expansion in the Southern Hemisphere to ozone depletion, the drivers of Northern Hemisphere expansion are not well known and the expansion has not so far been reproduced by climate models. Here we use a climate model with detailed aerosol physics to show that increases in heterogeneous warming agents--including black carbon aerosols and tropospheric ozone--are noticeably better than greenhouse gases at driving expansion, and can account for the observed summertime maximum in tropical expansion. Mechanistically, atmospheric heating from black carbon and tropospheric ozone has occurred at the mid-latitudes, generating a poleward shift of the tropospheric jet, thereby relocating the main division between tropical and temperate air masses. Although we still underestimate tropical expansion, the true aerosol forcing is poorly known and could also be underestimated. Thus, although the insensitivity of models needs further investigation, black carbon and tropospheric ozone, both of which are strongly influenced by human activities, are the most likely causes of observed Northern Hemisphere tropical expansion."

https://openalex.org/W2159713856,"Eubacteria inactivate their ribosomes as 100S dimers or 70S monomers upon entry into stationary phase. In Escherichia coli, 100S dimer formation is mediated by ribosome modulation factor (RMF) and hibernation promoting factor (HPF), or alternatively, the YfiA protein inactivates ribosomes as 70S monomers. Here, we present high-resolution crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome in complex with each of these stationary-phase factors. The binding site of RMF overlaps with that of the messenger RNA (mRNA) Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which prevents the interaction between the mRNA and the 16S ribosomal RNA. The nearly identical binding sites of HPF and YfiA overlap with those of the mRNA, transfer RNA, and initiation factors, which prevents translation initiation. The binding of RMF and HPF, but not YfiA, to the ribosome induces a conformational change of the 30S head domain that promotes 100S dimer formation."
https://openalex.org/W2167182428,"Religion, in promoting outlandish beliefs and costly rituals, increases ingroup trust but also may increase mistrust and conflict with outgroups. Moralizing gods emerged over the last few millennia, enabling large-scale cooperation, and sociopolitical conquest even without war. Whether for cooperation or conflict, sacred values, like devotion to God or a collective cause, signal group identity and operate as moral imperatives that inspire nonrational exertions independent of likely outcomes. In conflict situations, otherwise mundane sociopolitical preferences may become sacred values, acquiring immunity to material incentives. Sacred values sustain intractable conflicts that defy “business-like” negotiation, but also provide surprising opportunities for resolution."

(p. 922 ) discovered that oxygen occurred for tens of meters into the sediment. The bacteria living in these sediments were respiring the oxygen but at a slower rate than the supply of organic material dropping out of the water column, allowing these ancient deep marine sediments to remain oxygenated. Modeling showed that the rate of respiration of specific carbon decreased as a function of sediment depth, that is, its age. Thus aerobic metabolism can persist in deep marine sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2099844292,"The view of humans as violent war-prone apes is poorly supported by archaeological evidence and only partly supported by the behavior of our closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos. Whereas the first species is marked by xenophobia, the second is relatively peaceful and highly empathic in both behavior and brain organization. Animal empathy is best regarded as a multilayered phenomenon, built around motor mirroring and shared neural representations at basal levels, that develops into more advanced cognitive perspective-taking in large-brained species. As indicated by both observational and experimental studies on our closest relatives, empathy may be the main motivator of prosocial behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2069846572,"Cells promote polarized growth by activation of Rho-family protein Cdc42 at the cell membrane. We combined experiments and modeling to study bipolar growth initiation in fission yeast. Concentrations of a fluorescent marker for active Cdc42, Cdc42 protein, Cdc42-activator Scd1, and scaffold protein Scd2 exhibited anticorrelated fluctuations and oscillations with a 5-minute average period at polarized cell tips. These dynamics indicate competition for active Cdc42 or its regulators and the presence of positive and delayed negative feedbacks. Cdc42 oscillations and spatial distribution were sensitive to the amounts of Cdc42-activator Gef1 and to the activity of Cdc42-dependent kinase Pak1, a negative regulator. Feedbacks regulating Cdc42 oscillations and spatial self-organization appear to provide a flexible mechanism for fission yeast cells to explore polarization states and to control their morphology."

We previously found that PAD4 functions as a corepressor of p53 and cooperates with a histone deacetylase HDAC2 to repress the expression of tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p21/CDKN1A and GADD45) (24.Li P.

Moreover, PAD4 was recently reported to cooperate with Elk-1 to facilitate c-fos expression. As such, PAD4 can positively and negatively regulate transcription in a promoter context-dependent manner (14.Zhang X. Gamble M.J. Stadler S. Cherrington B.D. Causey C.P. Thompson P.R. Roberson M.S.

The tumor suppressor p53 protein functions as a central hub and key transcription factor of many cellular signaling pathways (26.Kruse J.P. Gu W. Modes of p53 regulation.Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, starvation, and stress signals, p53 regulates the expression of many genes that in turn relay the upstream signal to determine whether a cell undergoes cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, etc. (27.Crighton D.

Genome-wide mapping efforts have identified several hundred potential p53 target genes (31.Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. Liu J. Zhao X.D.

A global map of p53 transcription factor binding sites in the human genome.Cell. 2006; 124: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar); many of these p53 target genes are effector proteins or proteins that regulate p53 functions in various positive and negative feedback loops (32.Harris S.L. Levine A.J. The p53 pathway: positive and negative feedback loops.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Sestrin 2 (SESN2) is a recently identified p53 target gene that regulates aging and induces autophagy by inhibiting the mTORC1 signaling pathway via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and TSC1/2 signal cascade (33.Budanov A.V.

Stimulation of autophagy by the p53 target gene Sestrin2.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PAD4 was also recently identified as a p53 target gene, suggesting that PAD4 is a component of the intricate p53 signaling network (19.Tanikawa C. Espinosa M. Suzuki A. Masuda K. Yamamoto K. Tsuchiya E. Ueda K. Daigo Y. Nakamura Y. Matsuda K. Regulation of histone modification and chromatin structure by the p53-PADI4 pathway.Nat.

Regulation of protein Citrullination through p53/PADI4 network in DNA damage response.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 8761-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting that PAD4 likely regulates p53 function via a negative feedback loop. Macroautophagy (hereafter referred as autophagy) is a catabolic cellular process wherein a large number of cytoplasmic components and organelles are engulfed by a membrane structure termed the phagophore to form autophagosomes, which in turn fuse with lysosomes to form autophagolysosomes for bulk degradation to remove damaged cellular organelles or regenerate metabolites during the cellular response to starvation (36.Mizushima N.

Mammalian autophagy: core molecular machinery and signaling regulation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Autophagy is an important cellular process for organism health, and its deregulation has been linked with the progression of many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers (36.Mizushima N. Levine B. Cuervo A.M. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy fights disease through cellular self-digestion.Nature. 2008; 451: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (5144) Google Scholar, 39.Mathew R. Karantza-Wadsworth V. White E. Role of autophagy in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Many autophagy regulatory factors are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) Ser/Thr kinase-containing mTORC1 protein complex, which senses growth factors and nutrient abundance to control the rate of protein synthesis and the flux of autophagy (38.Yang Z. Klionsky D.J. Mammalian autophagy: core molecular machinery and signaling regulation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 40.Dunlop E.A. Tee A.R. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1: signaling inputs, substrates, and feedback mechanisms.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The Yin-Yang balance of autophagy flux is key to maintaining the homeostasis between cell survival and cell death. The metabolites recycled through autophagy can sustain cell survival and contribute to chemotherapy resistance (41.Amaravadi R.K. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yin X.M. Weiss W.A. Takebe N. Timmer W. DiPaola R.S. Lotze M.T. White E. Principles and current strategies for targeting autophagy for cancer treatment.Clin. Cancer Res. 2011; 17: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). On the other hand, under circumstances of excessive degradation of cellular components, autophagy can result in cell death (42.Berardi D.E. Campodónico P.B. Díaz Bessone M.I. Urtreger A.J. Todaro L.B. Autophagy: friend or foe in breast cancer development, progression, and treatment.Int. J. Breast Cancer. 2011; 2011: 595092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, both inducers and inhibitors of autophagy are of potential value for cancer treatment by regulating the autophagy flux rate. Under physiological conditions, PAD4 is mainly expressed in peripheral blood neutrophils. We have previously found that PAD4 plays an antibacterial innate immune function through regulating the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (43.Li P. Li M. Lindberg M.R. Kennett M.J. Xiong N. Wang Y. PAD4 is essential for antibacterial innate immunity mediated by neutrophil extracellular traps.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PAD4 is markedly overexpressed in a majority of cancers of various tissue origins in pathology studies with a large cohort of human patient samples (21.Chang X. Han J. Pang L. Zhao Y. Yang Y. Shen Z. Increased PADI4 expression in blood and tissues of patients with malignant tumors.BMC Cancer. 2009; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), suggesting that PAD4 may play a role in tumorigenesis. Currently, it remains unknown whether PAD4 can be pharmacologically targeted for cancer treatment. Cl-amidine is a benzoyl-arginine-derived and mechanism-based pan PAD inhibitor that shows inhibitory effects to several PAD family members (44.Luo Y. Arita K. Bhatia M. Knuckley B. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. Sato M. Thompson P.R.

Synthesis and screening of a haloacetamidine containing library to identify PAD4 selective inhibitors.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, this compound causes cancer cell growth inhibition at ∼150–200 μm concentration in cultured cells (24.Li P. Yao H. Zhang Z. Li M. Luo Y. Thompson P.R. Gilmour D.S. Wang Y. Regulation of p53 target gene expression by peptidylarginine deiminase 4.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 4745-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25.Li P. Wang D. Yao H. Doret P. Hao G.

The relatively low potency of Cl-amidine limits its preclinical exploration in cancer study and treatment. We have tested the idea that efficient small molecule PAD inhibitors can epigenetically activate tumor suppressor genes, thereby offering new avenues for cancer research and treatment. Our results showed that the lead compound YW3-56 activates a cohort of p53 target genes, including SESN2, which in turn inhibits the mTORC1 signaling pathway, thereby perturbing autophagy and inhibiting cancerous cell growth. The method for chemical synthesis of novel PAD4 inhibitors was done largely following a method described previously (44.Luo Y. Arita K. Bhatia M. Knuckley B. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. Sato M. Thompson P.R. Inhibitors and inactivators of protein arginine deiminase 4: functional and structural characterization.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11727-11736Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The colorimetric PAD4 assay method is described in detail in the supplemental material. Human osteosarcoma U2OS and mouse sarcoma S-180 cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator. Early passage cells were used to minimize passage deviations. U2OS p53-shRNA and U2OS Ctrl-shRNA cells were generated essentially as described previously (25.Li P. Wang D. Yao H. Doret P. Hao G. Shen Q. Qiu H. Zhang X. Wang Y. Chen G. Coordination of PAD4 and HDAC2 in the regulation of p53 target gene expression.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Concentrations and duration of YW3-56 treatment were performed as specified in the figure legends and text of the current study. For the starvation assay, U2OS cells were first cultured in serum-free DMEM for 16 h and then in 10% fetal bovine serum, then different concentrations of YW3-56 were added back, and cells were further incubated for 8 h before additional analyses. SESN2 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and GFP siRNA (Dharmacon Inc.) were transfected into U2OS cells using the X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science). Cells were incubated in the presence of the siRNA for 48 h before adding YW3-56 and further incubated for 8 h before analyses. Details of MTT and flow cytometry assays can be found in the supplemental material. U2OS Cells were treated with 6 μm YW3-56 for 24 h and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Transmission electron microscopy analyses of U2OS cell morphology were performed using the service of the Penn State Electron Microscopy Facility. A VistaVision invert microscope (VWR International, LLC) equipped with a SPOT Insight digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) and a 10× phase contrast lens were used to analyze cell growth and morphology in phase contrast microscopy analyses. Details of these methods can be found in the supplemental material. Western blot and immunostaining were performed essentially as described previously (25.Li P. Wang D. Yao H. Doret P. Hao G. Shen Q. Qiu H. Zhang X. Wang Y. Chen G. Coordination of PAD4 and HDAC2 in the regulation of p53 target gene expression.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in Western blot were anti-p53 (Sigma, BP53-12), anti-PAD4 (custom-made), anti-H3Cit (Abcam, ab5103), anti-H3 (Abcam, ab1791), anti-p21 (Sigma, P1484), anti-PUMA (Calbiochem, PC686), anti-SESN2 (Abcam, ab57810), anti-p70S6K (Cell Signaling, 9202), anti-p70S6K-pT389 (Cell Signaling, 9205), anti-LC3B (Cell Signaling, 2775), anti-p62/SQSTM1 (Bethyl Laboratories, A302-855A), and anti-β-actin (Sigma, A1978) at the appropriate dilutions. Anti-LC3B antibody (Cell Signaling, 2775) was used for immunostaining. DNA was stained by the DNA dye Hoechst. For subcellular localization of YW3-56, U2OS cells were treated with YW3-56 for 12 h and then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4. Nuclear DNA was visualized by TOPRO3 staining and captured using an Olympus BX61 microscope at excitation 647 nm/emission 665 nm. Images of YW3-56 subcellular distribution were captured at excitation 359 nm/emission 461 nm. ChIP experiments were carried out essentially as described previously (14.Zhang X. Gamble M.J. Stadler S. Cherrington B.D. Causey C.P. Thompson P.R. Roberson M.S. Kraus W.L. Coonrod S.A. Genome-wide analysis reveals PADI4 cooperates with Elk-1 to activate c-Fos expression in breast cancer cells.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in ChIP were: anti-p53 (Sigma, BP53-12), anti-PAD4 (custom-made), anti-H3Cit (Abcam, ab5103), and anti-H3R17Me (Abcam, ab8284). Primers used in quantitative ChIP-qPCR for +733 are listed in supplemental Table S2. Other primers are available upon request. S-180 ascites tumor cells were used to form solid tumors after subcutaneous injection essentially as described previously (46.Wang W. Zhao M. Wang Y. Liu J. Wu J. Kang G.

Biosyst. 2011; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More details are available in the supplemental material. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical University and performed by accepted veterinary standards. To develop more potent inhibitors for PAD4 inhibition and cancer cell killing, we carried out an extensive structure-and-activity relationship study based on the Cl-amidine blueprint (Fig. 1A). The Nα and Cα of the ornithine backbone were engineered with different structural motifs or tethered within a ring scaffold via the standard amide- and ester-coupling chemistry to generate 23 new compounds in four synthesis, evaluation, and redesign cycles (supplemental Fig. S1). Cl-amidine is a very hydroscopic compound, which readily dissolves in water-based solutions and likely has low cell membrane permeation ability. Therefore, one of the design schemes was to optimize the hydrophobicity and bioavailability of the new compounds. The 23 compounds were first used at 20 μm to measure their cell-killing efficacy in osteosarcoma U2OS cells by MTT assays (supplemental Fig. S2). Several potent inhibitors (e.g. YW3-56, YW4-03, and YW4-15) were selected to measure their IC50 in cell killing by MTT assays and PAD4 inhibition by a colorimetric method (47.Boyde T.R. Rahmatullah M. Optimization of conditions for the colorimetric determination of citrulline, using diacetyl monoxime.Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3). Inhibitors with low micromolar IC50 values, including YW4-03 and YW3-56, were successfully developed (Fig. 1B). When compared with Cl-amidine, YW3-56 showed >60-fold increase in cell growth inhibition efficacy (IC50 about 2.5 μm) but only ∼5-fold increase in PAD4 inhibition (IC50 about 1–5 μm) (Fig. 1B). We postulated that the dimethyl-amide-naphthalene moiety at the Nα position and a phenyl ring at the Cα position increase the hydrophobicity of YW3-56, thereby enhancing its membrane permeability and cancer cell killing. To test this idea, flow cytometry analyses were performed to evaluate cellular uptake of YW3-56 using the intrinsic fluorescent signal generated by the naphthalene moiety in YW3-56 (Fig. 1C). Fluorescent signals were greatly increased in all cells after YW3-56 treatment when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1C). To further test the importance of membrane permeation in cell killing, a bulky and hydrophilic biotin moiety was added on the para position of the Cα benzyl ring of YW3-56 to generate YW4-15. This biotin moiety greatly decreased the cellular uptake of YW4-15 in flow cytometry analyses (Fig. 1C). As a consequence of poor membrane penetration, although YW4-15 has a PAD4 inhibition efficacy similar to YW3-56, its cancer cell killing ability was greatly decreased when compared with YW3-56 (Fig. 1B). Taken together, the above results indicate that YW3-56 has an improved efficacy in PAD4 inhibition and cell membrane penetration and thereby kills cancer cells with high efficacy. Based on the above results, we chose YW3-56 as the lead compound for further detailed biological analyses. Taking advantage of the fluorescent naphthalene moiety, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of YW3-56 and found that it is mainly concentrated in the nucleus, with a certain degree of enrichment in the nucleolus to form punctate structures (Fig. 2A). Because PAD4 is a nuclear protein, the nuclear localization of YW3-56 indicates that it is i"

Among the proteins required for PEL polysaccharide production, PelD has been identified as a membrane-bound c-di-GMP-specific receptor. In this work, we present the x-ray crystal structure of a soluble cytoplasmic region of PelD in its apo and c-di-GMP complexed forms.

Structural studies of NEMO provided a rationale for the specific binding between the UBAN (ubiquitin binding in ABIN and NEMO) domain of NEMO and linear (Met-1-linked) di-ubiquitin chains. Full-length NEMO can also interact with Lys-11-, Lys-48-, and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains of varying length in cells. Here, we show that purified full-length NEMO binds preferentially to linear ubiquitin chains in competition with lysine-linked ubiquitin chains of defined length, including long Lys-63-linked deca-ubiquitins. Linear di-ubiquitins were sufficient to activate both the IKK complex in vitro and to trigger maximal NF-κB activation in cells. In TNFα-stimulated cells, NEMO chimeras engineered to bind exclusively to Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains mediated partial NF-κB activation compared with cells expressing NEMO that binds to linear ubiquitin chains. We propose that NEMO functions as a high affinity receptor for linear ubiquitin chains and a low affinity receptor for long lysine-linked ubiquitin chains. This phenomenon could explain quantitatively distinct NF-κB activation patterns in response to numerous cell stimuli.Background: Binding of NEMO to ubiquitin chains is essential for the activation of NF-κB.Results: Full-length NEMO preferentially binds linear ubiquitin chains in competition with lysine-linked ubiquitin chains. NEMO binding linear di-ubiquitin is sufficient for full NF-κB activation.Conclusion: NEMO is a high affinity receptor for linear ubiquitin chains and a low affinity receptor for long lysine-linked ubiquitin chains.Significance: Ubiquitin binding selectivity of NEMO is crucial for understanding the NF-κB activation pathways.

Here, we show that purified full-length NEMO binds preferentially to linear ubiquitin chains in competition with lysine-linked ubiquitin chains of defined length, including long Lys-63-linked deca-ubiquitins. Linear di-ubiquitins were sufficient to activate both the IKK complex in vitro and to trigger maximal NF-κB activation in cells. In TNFα-stimulated cells, NEMO chimeras engineered to bind exclusively to Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains mediated partial NF-κB activation compared with cells expressing NEMO that binds to linear ubiquitin chains. We propose that NEMO functions as a high affinity receptor for linear ubiquitin chains and a low affinity receptor for long lysine-linked ubiquitin chains. This phenomenon could explain quantitatively distinct NF-κB activation patterns in response to numerous cell stimuli. Background: Binding of NEMO to ubiquitin chains is essential for the activation of NF-κB. Results: Full-length NEMO preferentially binds linear ubiquitin chains in competition with lysine-linked ubiquitin chains. NEMO binding linear di-ubiquitin is sufficient for full NF-κB activation. Conclusion: NEMO is a high affinity receptor for linear ubiquitin chains and a low affinity receptor for long lysine-linked ubiquitin chains. Significance: Ubiquitin binding selectivity of NEMO is crucial for understanding the NF-κB activation pathways. NF-κB transcription factors play a crucial role during development as well as in various biological functions including innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation, and cell survival (1Wertz I.E.

The IKK complex consists of two kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit called NEMO (3Häcker H. Karin M. Regulation and function of IKK and IKK-related kinases.Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). It has been shown that NEMO is a critical component for cell survival and activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway (4Yamaoka S.

These ubiquitin signals are transmitted by proteins containing ubiquitin binding domains, which directly interact with mono- or polyubiquitin chains (7Dikic I. Wakatsuki S. Walters K.J.

NEMO is readily precipitated in protein complexes containing highly Lys-63-polyubiquitylated substrates (18Wu C.J. Conze D.B. Li T. Srinivasula S.M. Ashwell J.D. Sensing of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination by NEMO is a key event in NF-κB activation [corrected].Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar); however, these complexes involved multiple interaction surfaces, and it was not clear whether interactions between NEMO and long Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are direct. More recent structural and functional studies indicate that the isolated NEMO UBAN domain preferentially binds to linear ubiquitin chains, but it can also bind with lower affinity to other types of ubiquitin chains including Lys-11, Lys-48, and Lys-63, presumably when they form longer chains (10Dynek J.N.

Specific recognition of linear ubiquitin chains by NEMO is important for NF-κB activation.Cell. 2009; 136: 1098-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that in addition to the linkage type also the length of the chains might be a critical determinant in NF-κB activation (19Ikeda F. Crosetto N. Dikic I. What determines the specificity and outcomes of ubiquitin signaling?.Cell. 2010; 143: 677-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To address these issues we have undertaken a systematic and thorough biochemical approach by purifying full-length NEMO and analyzing its binding to ubiquitin chains with different linkages and length. In addition, by utilizing engineered NEMO chimeras that recognize exclusively Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains as well as NEMO that is permanently linearly ubiquitylated we have tested the contribution of the linkage and length of specific ubiquitin chains in the activation of the NF-κB pathway upon TNFα stimulation in vivo. To generate linear ubiquitin-fused NEMO constructs the ORF of Arabidopsis ubiquitin, whose Gly-75 and Gly-76 were replaced by Val (ubiquitin-VV) to create an MluI site, was generated by PCR. Two to seven tandem uncleavable ubiquitin cDNAs were prepared by inserting the mutant ubiquitin encoding MluI∼BssHI into the MluI site of ubiquitin-VV. The whole nucleotide sequence was verified, and the respective tandem ubiquitin cDNA was ligated into FLAG-His6-human NEMO in pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Full-length murine NEMO and human IκBα-WT (amino acids 1–54) and IκBα-AA (amino acid 1–54 S34A/S36A) were cloned into pMAL-C2x (New England Biolabs). Full-length murine NEMO was cloned into pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare) using a standard PCR method. Human TBL2-NZF was swapped with NEMO UBAN (amino acids 250–339) or ZnF (amino acids 388–412), in the full-length NEMO cloned into pBABE (described in Ref. 14Rahighi S. Ikeda F. Kawasaki M. Akutsu M.

Mega-mutagenesis primers were produced by PCR using the human Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domain as template (amino acids 663–693) with oligonucleotides that contain the complementary sequence flanking the site of insertion. F305A and F312A mutations in mouse and human NEMO, respectively, were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis.

Some N-1 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml human TNF-α (Promega) for 6 h before harvest. Recombinant E1, UbcH5c, His6-HOIP-HOIL-1L-Myc-SHARPIN complex, and Myc-IKKα-His6-IKKβ-FLAG-NEMO complex were prepared as described (13Tokunaga F. Nakagawa T. Nakahara M. Saeki Y. Taniguchi M.

The MBP-fused IκBα (amino acids 1–54), IκBα-AA (amino acids 1–54, S32A/S36A), and NEMO (expression in Escherichia coli BL21 containing pRARE) were expressed in E. coli and purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Lys-63- and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains were prepared as described previously (22Komander D. Lord C.J. Scheel H. Swift S. Hofmann K. Ashworth A. Barford D.

For the preparation of linear ubiquitin chains, GST-di-, tri-, or tetra-ubiquitin was expressed in E. coli BL21, purified, and cleaved with thrombin protease (biotinylated thrombin kit; Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thrombin buffer was exchanged with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Other GST-fused proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 containing pRARE and induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μm) at 16 °C overnight, and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). HeLa S-100 fraction II was prepared according to the method of Hershko and co-workers (23Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A.

Briefly, crude HeLa cell extracts in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) were lysed by a Dounce homogenizer, and a cytosolic fraction was prepared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant (S-100) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column. The bound fraction (fraction II), which excludes endogenous ubiquitin, was eluted with a buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF), and dialyzed with a re-equilibrated buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). GST- or MBP-fused proteins immobilized with Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 μg of indicated ubiquitin chains in pulldown buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mg/ml BSA) at 4 °C for 16 h on a rotator, or FLAG-tagged proteins were expressed in HEK293-T cells, which were lysed 24 h after transfection and incubated with GST-proteins at 4 °C for 16 h on a rotator. The beads were washed three times with pulldown buffer without BSA. The proteins were then eluted with SDS-sample buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 1 min. The samples were separated on a 12% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. A total of 30 μl of samples containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 2 mg/ml HeLa-S-100 fraction II, 250 μg/ml ubiquitin, 20 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (Boston Biochem), 100 ng of E1, 200 ng of UbcH5c, 2 μg of LUBAC, and 100 ng of MBP-IκBα or MBP-IκBα-AA were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Effects of di-ubiquitins on IKK activation were examined in total 20 μl of samples containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 100 ng of IKK complex, 100 ng of MBP-IκBα or MBP-IκBα-AA, and increasing amounts (0.1, 0.3, and 1 μg) of linear-, Lys-63-, and Lys-48-di-ubiquitins. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. RNA was isolated from MEFs using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). mRNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using random primer. Quantitative PCR was performed using SensiMix SYBR and Fluorescein kit (Bioline) and primer pairs specific for mouse A20 (forward primer, ctccagcctcacttccagta; reverse primer, aatacatgcagccagctttc) or mouse actin (forward primer, tgttaccaactgggacgaca; reverse primer, ggggtgttgaaggtctcaaa). Cells were first lysed in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF), left on ice for 2 min, and centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic fraction. Pellet was resuspended in 3 × pellet volume of hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF), kept on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Student's t test was performed using GraphPad Prism software. We have shown previously that linear di-ubiquitin binds to NEMO UBAN domain, whereas Lys-63-linked di-ubiquitin could not be detected in GST binding assays (14Rahighi S. Ikeda F. Kawasaki M.

Ubiquitin binding mediates the NF-κB inhibitory potential of ABIN proteins.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, it was proposed that the C terminus of NEMO, comprising the UBAN and the ZnF, has a higher affinity toward Lys-63- and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains consisting of three or more ubiquitin moieties (25Laplantine E. Fontan E. Chiaravalli J. Lopez T. Lakisic G. Véron M. Agou F. Israël A. NEMO specifically recognizes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains through a new bipartite ubiquitin-binding domain.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2885-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To elucidate the ubiquitin binding preferences of full-length NEMO we performed in vitro binding studies with bacterially purified recombinant full-length NEMO and ubiquitin chains of different linkage types and lengths. Purified NEMO was incubated with equal concentrations of different ubiquitin chain types in the same tube, and binding of NEMO was monitored by washing off unbound chains and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). Because ubiquitin chains of the same length but with different linkage display different mobility on SDS gels, it is possible to distinguish the different types of chains by using the same anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 1). We first examined the binding preference of full-length MBP-tagged NEMO toward Lys-11-, Lys-63- and linear-tri-ubiquitin (Fig. 1A). Incubation of MBP-NEMO with these different chain types led to a selective binding of linear tri-ubiquitin in competition with the other chain types (Fig. 1A). We have shown previously that only tetra- and longer ubiquitin chains of Lys-63 linkage could be involved in binding to NEMO, and mutational analysis indicated that they bind only to distal patches on the NEMO UBAN domain compared with longitudinal arrangement of linear chains that recognizes both proximal and distal patches (14Rahighi S. Ikeda F. Kawasaki M. Akutsu M. Suzuki N. Kato R. Kensche T. Uejima T. Bloor S. Komander D. Randow F. Wakatsuki S. Dikic I. Specific recognition of linear ubiquitin chains by NEMO is important for NF-κB activation.Cell. 2009; 136: 1098-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence NEMO binding to linear and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains is competitive, and it is not possible that both are bound to NEMO at the same time. In accordance, we observed that linear tetra-ubiquitin was able to block binding of Lys-63-linked tetra-ubiquitin with GST-NEMO or MBP-NEMO in vitro (supplemental Fig. S1 and Fig. 1, B and F). In contrast to NEMO, receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) selectively bound to Lys-63-linked tetra-ubiquitin (Fig. 1C). This is in accordance with a previous study showing that the two ubiquitin interacting motif domains of RAP80 as a unit selectively bind Lys-63-linked but not Lys-48- or linearly linked di-ubiquitin (26Sato Y. Yoshikawa A. Mimura H. Yamashita M. Yamagata A. Fukai S. Structural basis for specific recognition of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains by tandem UIMs of RAP80.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2461-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because the length of ubiquitin chains might influence the affinity toward NEMO, we set out to analyze the binding of Lys-63-linked hexa- or hepta-ubiquitin to NEMO, in competition with linear tetra-ubiquitin (Fig. 1D). In both cases we found that NEMO selectively bound to linear tetra-ubiquitin compared with the binding to hexa- or to hepta-Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains. Comparing the ubiquitin binding preference of NEMO with a mixture of long Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains revealed that NEMO did not pull down Lys-63-linked chains up to at least deca-ubiquitin in the presence of linear tetra-ubiquitin (Fig. 1E). Chains that were longer than deca-ubiquitin showed interaction with NEMO despite the presence of linear tetra-ubiquitin, but because ubiquitin chains longer than deca-ubiquitin were not separated, it is not clear what size of Lys-63-linked chains was necessary for binding and also whether this precipitation of high molecular mass ubiquitin chains is a specific interaction. To get more detailed information about the ubiquitin binding preference of NEMO, we incubated 1 μg of Lys-63-linked tetra-ubiquitin together with different amounts of linearly linked tetra-ubiquitin (Fig. 1F). Interaction of NEMO with linear tetra-ubiquitin alone is rather weak (Fig. 1F). In contrast, already the addition of 20 ng of linear tetra-ubiquitin leads to a strong linear chain binding, emphasizing the high binding preference of NEMO to linear chains. The increase of binding of NEMO to linear chains correlates strongly with an increasing input where already 100 ng of linear ubiquitin chains shows a much stronger binding than Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, of which 1 μg was used. Moreover, the linear chains compete out the binding toward Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, clearly visible by a decreased Lys-63-linked chain binding, already in the presence of only 200 ng of linear ubiquitin chains.

We investigated obestatin effects in vitro, on adipocyte function, and in vivo, on insulin resistance and inflammation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Obestatin effects on apoptosis, differentiation, lipolysis, and glucose uptake were determined in vitro in mouse 3T3-L1 and in human subcutaneous (hSC) and omental (hOM) adipocytes. In vivo, the influence of obestatin on glucose metabolism was assessed in mice fed an HFD for 8 wk. 3T3-L1, hSC, and hOM preadipocytes and adipocytes secreted obestatin and showed specific binding for the hormone. Obestatin prevented apoptosis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by increasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling. In both mice and human adipocytes, obestatin inhibited isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, promoted AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, induced adiponectin, and reduced leptin secretion. Obestatin also enhanced glucose uptake in either the absence or presence of insulin, promoted GLUT4 translocation, and increased Akt phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein expression. Inhibition of SIRT1 by small interfering RNA reduced obestatin-induced glucose uptake. In HFD-fed mice, obestatin reduced insulin resistance, increased insulin secretion from pancreatic islets, and reduced adipocyte apoptosis and inflammation in metabolic tissues. These results provide evidence of a novel role for obestatin in adipocyte function and glucose metabolism and suggest potential therapeutic perspectives in insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunctions.—Granata, R., Gallo, D., Luque, R.

HRAS-like tumor suppressor 3, a representative member of this group, plays a key role in regulating triglyceride accumulation and energy expenditure in adipocytes and therefore constitutes a novel pharmacological target for treatment of metabolic disorders causing obesity. Here, we delineate a catalytic mechanism common to lecithin:retinol acyltransferase-like proteins and provide evidence for their alternative robust lipid-dependent acyltransferase enzymatic activity. We also determined high resolution crystal structures of HRAS-like tumor suppressor 2 and 3 to gain insight into their active site architecture. Based on this structural analysis, two conformational states of the catalytic Cys-113 were identified that differ in reactivity and thus could define the catalytic properties of these two proteins. Finally, these structures provide a model for the topology of these enzymes and allow identification of the protein-lipid bilayer interface. This study contributes to the enzymatic and structural understanding of HRAS-like tumor suppressor enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2105185838,"Developmental endothelial cell locus-1 (Del-1) glycoprotein is secreted by endothelial cells and a subset of macrophages. Del-1 plays a regulatory role in vascular remodeling and functions in innate immunity through interaction with integrin αVβ3. Del-1 contains 3 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and 2 discoidin-like domains. An Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif in the second EGF domain (EGF2) mediates adhesion by endothelial cells and phagocytes. We report the crystal structure of its 3 EGF domains. The RGD motif of EGF2 forms a type II' β turn at the tip of a long protruding loop, dubbed the RGD finger. Whereas EGF2 and EGF3 constitute a rigid rod via an interdomain calcium ion binding site, the long linker between EGF1 and EGF2 lends considerable flexibility to EGF1. Two unique O-linked glycans and 1 N-linked glycan locate to the opposite side of EGF2 from the RGD motif. These structural features favor integrin binding of the RGD finger. Mutagenesis data confirm the importance of having the RGD motif at the tip of the RGD finger.

In this study, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging was used to examine uterine hemodynamics and vessels associated with uterine blood flow in cynomolgus macaque.The uterus of a female cynomolgus macaque was cut from the vaginal canal to mimic a situation during trachelectomy or uterine transplantation surgery in which uterine perfusion is maintained only with uterine and ovarian vessels. Intraoperative uterine hemodynamics was observed using ICG fluorescence imaging under conditions in which various nutrient vessels were selected by clamping of blood vessels. A time-intensity curve was plotted using imaging analysis software to measure the T(max) of uterine perfusion for selected blood vessel patterns. Open surgery was performed with the uterus receiving nutritional support only from uterine vessels on one side. The size of the uterus after surgery was monitored using transabdominal ultrasonography.The resulting time-intensity curves displayed the average intensity in the regions of the uterine corpus and uterine cervix, and in the entire uterus. Analyses of the uterine hemodynamics in the cynomolgus macaque showed that uterine vessels were significantly related to uterine perfusion (P=0.008), whereas ovarian vessels did not have a significant relationship (P=0.588). When uterine vessels were clamped, ovarian vessels prolonged the time needed to reach perfusion maximum. Postoperative transabdominal ultrasonography showed that the size of the uterus was not changed 2 months after surgery, with recovery of periodic menstruation. The cynomolgus macaque has got pregnant with favorable fetus well-being.Uterine vessels may be responsible for uterine blood flow, and even one uterine vessel may be sufficient to maintain uterine viability in cynomolgus macaque.

We previously exploited the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) transcriptional repressor domain, present in hundreds of vertebrate-specific zinc finger proteins, to assess the effect of its binding to gene bodies. These experiments revealed that the ectopic and doxycycline (dox)-controlled tet repressor KRAB fusion protein (tTRKRAB) can induce reversible and long-range silencing of cellular promoters. Here, we extend this system to in vivo applications and use tTRKRAB to achieve externally controllable repression of an endogenous mouse locus. We employed lentiviral-mediated transgenesis with promoterless TetO-containing gene traps to engineer a mouse line where the endogenous kinesin family member 2A (Kif2A) promoter drives a YFP reporter gene. When these mice were crossed to animals expressing the TetO-binding tTRKRAB repressor, this regulator was recruited to the Kif2A locus, and YFP expression was reduced. This effect was reversed when dox was given to embryos or adult mice, demonstrating that the cellular Kif2A promoter was only silenced upon repressor binding. Molecular analyses confirmed that tTRKRAB induced transcriptional repression through the spread of H3K9me3-containing heterochromatin, without DNA methylation of the trapped Kif2A promoter. Therefore, we demonstrate that targeting of tTRKRAB to a gene body in vivo results in reversible transcriptional repression through the spreading of facultative heterochromatin. This finding not only sheds light on KRAB-mediated transcriptional processes, but also suggests approaches for the externally controllable and reversible modulation of chromatin and transcription in vivo."

These observations suggest that in the presence of a limited number of RNases, M. genitalium RNase R may have acquired a unique exonucleolytic tRNA 3′-processing function. To carry out tRNA 3′-maturation, M. genitalium RNase R must be able to recognize pre-tRNA and precisely remove the trailer sequences to form the mature 3′-end. Several sequence and structural features of tRNA have been previously shown to be important for tRNA 3′-processing by other enzymes. For instance, the E. coli tRNA 3′-maturation exoribonuclease RNase T is strongly inhibited by C residues in the 3′-CCA sequence, suggesting a role for these C residues in stopping digestion of tRNA by this enzyme once the mature 3′-end is generated (14Zuo Y.

However, its activity is inhibited if a C residue is present immediately downstream of the discriminator base (7Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. Endonucleolytic processing of CCA-less tRNA precursors by RNase Z in Bacillus subtilis.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that the terminal double-stranded stem structure present in the precursors of many stable RNA species is essential for exonucleolytic processing to stop correctly at the mature 3′-end (15Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. 3′-Exoribonucleolytic trimming is a common feature of the maturation of small, stable RNAs in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this work, we report that M. genitalium RNase R demonstrates novel specificity for the nucleotide sequence and structure of a pre-tRNA, enabling tRNA 3′-maturation by one-step exonucleolytic removal of a relatively long 3′-trailer. This represents a unique mechanism of tRNA 3′-maturation by which organisms of minimal genome employ only a single exoribonuclease. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). [α-32P]UTP was purchased from GE Healthcare.

Briefly, pETmgR was transformed into Rosetta-gami 2(DE3)(rnb,rnr)pLysS. Transformed cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6, followed by induction using 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at room temperature.

Purified RNase R was at least 99% pure based on an SDS-PAGE analysis. The activity of the purified RNase R protein was confirmed by poly(A) degradation assays (11Lalonde M.S. Zuo Y. Zhang J. Gong X.

The PCR product encoding the precursor to tRNA1Gly under the control of a T7 promoter was generated using Taq DNA polymerase, M. genitalium genomic DNA template, and primers.

In vitro transcribed pre-tRNAs were purified using the RNeasy® MinElute® cleanup kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). nucleotide. In vitro transcribed pre-tRNAs containing 5′-triphosphate were treated with RNA 5′-polyphosphatase, which sequentially removes γ- and β-phosphates and produces 5′-monophosphate. Reactions were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 5 μg of pre-tRNA transcript was incubated with 30 units of RNA 5′-polyphosphatase and 20 units of RNase inhibitor at 37 °C for 30 min. Treated RNA was purified using RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit. In vitro tRNA processing was carried out as described (11Lalonde M.S. Zuo Y. Zhang J. Gong X. Wu S. Malhotra A. Li Z. Exoribonuclease R in Mycoplasma genitalium can carry out both RNA processing and degradative functions and is sensitive to RNA ribose methylation.RNA. 2007; 13: 1957-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 5 or 30 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 volumes of loading buffer (96% formamide and 1 mm EDTA). The products were separated on an 8% urea-polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The products in the gel were detected by autoradiography. Alternatively, the products were detected using a Personal Molecular ImagerTM system (Bio-Rad) and quantified using the accompanying Quantity One® software. The 95-nt pre-tRNA1Gly construct starts with triphosphate at the mature 5′-end of the tRNA and contains a 21-nt trailer sequence with an –OH group at the 3′-end. Upon incubation with RNase R purified from M. genitalium, a 74-nt product corresponding to the size of the mature tRNA1Gly was produced after 5 min and increased at 30 min (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). This product terminates at the mature 3′-end of tRNA1Gly because it comigrated with the 74-nt transcript of the same tRNA (Fig. 1A, lane 7), and the 3′-terminal sequence was previously confirmed by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (11Lalonde M.S. Zuo Y. Zhang J. Gong X. Wu S. Malhotra A. Li Z. Exoribonuclease R in Mycoplasma genitalium can carry out both RNA processing and degradative functions and is sensitive to RNA ribose methylation.RNA. 2007; 13: 1957-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation with buffer alone did not cause any change to the pre-tRNA (supplemental Fig. S1, lanes 1 and 2). Formation of the mature tRNA by RNase R demonstrates that this enzyme alone is able to remove the entire 3′-trailer by an exonucleolytic action. A 77-nt product was present in small amounts in some pre-tRNA1Gly preparations (Fig. 1A, lane 4), presumably due to pre-termination of T7 RNA polymerase. This 77-nt product was also generated by incubation with RNase R, suggesting that it is a true processing intermediate of RNase R. In addition, a 72-nt product corresponding to tRNA lacking the terminal CA residues at the 3′-end was also produced by RNase R (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that this exoribonuclease is capable of removing nucleotide residues from the mature 3′-end. We have also incubated the 74-nt transcript with RNase R. Interestingly, this RNA form was not digested by RNase R even after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). This result suggests that the 72-nt product from pre-tRNA1Gly (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3) was probably generated from a longer 3′ terminus by processive exonucleolytic action of RNase R. Once the tRNA with a mature 3′-end is released from RNase R, it may become resistant to further trimming by the enzyme. tRNA normally contains a 5′-monophosphate. To examine whether the 5′-triphosphate present in the in vitro transcript affects 3′-processing by RNase R, the pre-tRNA was treated with RNA 5′-polyphosphatase to generate a 5′-monophosphate (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Polyphosphatase treatment also produced a major 72-nt product along with some other minor products, probably due to contamination by a nuclease activity. When the 5′-monophosphate pre-tRNA1Gly was treated with RNase R, the 77-, 74-, and 72-nt products were produced (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6) in a manner similar to those from the pre-tRNA with 5′-triphosphate, suggesting that the 5′-triphosphate does not have a detectable effect on RNase R-mediated 3′-processing. Pre-tRNA constructs containing 5′-triphosphate were used in the subsequent experiments. Stable bacterial RNA species that undergo 3′-exonucleolytic processing share a common feature of having a stable double-stranded stem formed between the 5′ and 3′ termini, followed by 2–4 unpaired nucleotides at the mature 3′-end (15Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. 3′-Exoribonucleolytic trimming is a common feature of the maturation of small, stable RNAs in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This feature supports the notion that stable stems function as “rulers” to stop exonucleolytic trimming at the downstream mature 3′-ends. Being a processing exoribonuclease, M. genitalium RNase R may recognize the same terminal stem to stop at the mature 3′-end of tRNA. To test this idea, a pre-tRNA construct (DS+3) containing a 3-bp extension in the acceptor stem (Fig. 2A) was treated with RNase R. This construct would produce a tRNA of 80 nt if RNase R stops 4 nt downstream of the stem. As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 5 and 6), the expected 80-nt RNA and a minor 82-nt product formed after 5 min of incubation with RNase R and became more abundant after 30 min. Therefore, RNase R stops at similar distances downstream of the acceptor stem of DS+3 and pre-tRNA1Gly. The lack of the 2-nt shorter product from DS+3 is probably due to a higher stability of the extended stem and the presence of a new adenine discriminator in this construct (see below). Similar behavior was observed previously when a pre-tRNA containing 2 extra bp in the acceptor stem was treated with RNase R (18Lalonde M.S. Characterization of RNase R in Mycoplasma genitalium and Study of Its Possible Role in tRNA Processing.M.S. thesis. Florida Atlantic University, 2006Google Scholar). If the acceptor stem impedes RNase R digestion, disruption of the stem may fail to stop RNase R. This idea is well supported by the results in Fig. 2. Incubation of a 2-bp disruption construct (DS−2) with RNase R resulted in complete degradation of the pre-tRNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 9), demonstrating an essential role for a stable acceptor stem in stopping RNase R at the CCA terminus. Fig. 2C further demonstrates that base pair disruption at different positions in the acceptor stem resulted in different products, all at much reduced levels. Treatment of DS−1A (Fig. 2A) produced only the 72-nt product (Fig. 2C, lane 6), indicating that the terminal base pair is important for preventing the CCA terminus from being trimmed by RNase R. Similarly, a 73-nt RNA was generated at trace levels from DS−1C (Fig. 2C, lane 12), which lacks the middle base pair, probably due to a lowered stability of the stem. Disruption of the base paring distal from the CCA terminus in DS−1B caused the least degradation and the formation of 74-nt RNA, albeit at a low level (Fig. 2C, lane 10). Apparently, 1-bp disruptions caused partial degradation and altered the positions where RNase R trimming stopped. The discriminator base has been recognized as an important determinant for charging tRNA with its cognate amino acid (19Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Universal rules and idiosyncratic features in tRNA identity.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and for maturation of the 5′-end by RNase P (20Kikovska E. Brännvall M. Kufel J. Kirsebom L.A. Substrate discrimination in RNase P RNA-mediated cleavage: importance of the structural environment of the RNase P cleavage site.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2012-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we attempted to investigate the possible role of the discriminator residue in tRNA 3′-processing by RNase R. Fig. 3 shows the processing products of pre-tRNA constructs with the four different discriminators. Variations in the discriminator base caused a major change in the ratios of the 74- and 72-nt products and slightly affected the production of these products in combination from the pre-tRNAs. Pre-tRNA1Gly containing the encoded discriminator U yielded a major 74-nt mature tRNA and a less abundant 72-nt RNA after incubation with RNase R (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). Substitution of the discriminator U with A or G increased the amount of mature tRNA (Fig. 3, lanes5, 6, 8, and 9). In contrast, replacement of U with C produced increased levels of the shorter 72-nt product (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12). These results indicate that purines are the preferred discriminator bases to prevent the digestion of the CCA terminus by RNase R. Because the 3′-terminal CCA sequence has been implicated in tRNA 3′-maturation under a number of circumstances and because the trimming of CCA by RNase R was observed in this work, we studied whether the CCA sequence is a determinant for RNase R-mediated tRNA processing. As shown in Fig. 4A (lanes 6 and 12), substitution of one or both C residues with A or G increased production of the 72-nt product. Substitution of the first C had more effect than that of the second C on conversion of 74-nt RNA to 72-nt RNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Notably, substitution of both C residues with purines resulted in a 10-fold increase in the 72-nt product (Fig. 4A, lanes 12 and 15). In contrast, substitution of these cytidines with uridines caused little change in the relative amount of mature and 2-nt shorter products, although a moderate increase in the 72-nt product was observed by substitution at the first position (Fig. 4B). A similar effect of U substitutions was also observed when the pre-tRNA containing an A discriminator was treated with RNase R (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, pre-tRNAs containing G, C, or U at the 3′ terminus generated more 74-nt RNA than the parent pre-tRNA1Gly (Fig. 4C), suggesting that A is not the preferred nucleotide at the mature 3′-end for RNase R to stop correctly. On the basis of the above observations, we also studied if the CCA sequence per se impedes RNase R degradation by examining pre-tRNA1Gly derivatives with additional CCA sequences in the 3′-trailer (Fig. 5A). None of these constructs formed a predicted stable structure in the 3′-trailer. In all cases, the mature 74-nt tRNA and the 72-nt form were the main products (Fig. 5B), showing little variation among the pre-tRNAs. The downstream CCA sequences did not stop RNase R at their respective specific locations. However, a +15-nt RNA was produced from constructs harboring one or two separated CCA sequences (Fig. 5B, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9), and a +5-nt RNA formed from constructs with one or two tandem CCA sequences (lanes 11, 14, and 15). Interestingly, the +15- and +5-nt products terminate at the 3′-end of C-rich regions in these constructs, suggesting a possible role for C-rich sequence in resisting RNase R digestion. We have shown that the sole exoribonuclease identified in M. genitalium, RNase R, is able to generate mature tRNA from a transcript that contains a relatively long 3′-trailer sequence. The results in this study demonstrate a delicate mechanism of tRNA 3′-maturation by which the entire 3′-trailer is removed in a single-step exonucleolytic action (Fig. 6). It is likely that RNase R acts processively on tRNA precursors. The precise removal of the 3′-trailer appears to depend on the ability of RNase R to recognize several sequence and structural features of the tRNA. RNase R processing activity is strongly inhibited by the aminoacyl-acceptor stem, stopping mainly 4 nt downstream of the stem to form the mature 3′-end. The discriminator residue and the terminal CCA sequence also play important roles in preventing further trimming of the mature 3′-end by RNase R. These findings suggest that RNase R is able to carry out tRNA 3′-maturation in M. genitalium. However, the results do not rule out the possibility that other factors may also play a role in tRNA 3′-end processing in vivo. This unique mode of action of RNase R distinguishes this enzyme from exoribonucleases participating in tRNA processing in other bacteria (1Condon C. RNA processing and degradation in Bacillus subtilis.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Li Z. Gong X. Joshi V.H. Li M.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2004Google Scholar). In E. coli, for example, the shortening of the long 3′-trailer in a tRNA precursor and the generation of the mature 3′-end are carried out by different RNases. The endoribonuclease RNase E and the processive exoribonucleases RNase II and polynucleotide phosphorylase can efficiently remove the long 3′-trailer, leaving a few extra residues at the 3′-end (3Li Z. Deutscher M.P. RNase E plays an essential role in the maturation of Escherichia coli tRNA precursors.RNA. 2002; 8: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The last few 3′ extra residues are removed by any of the five exoribonucleases RNases T, PH, D, II, and BN, with T and PH being the most efficient enzymes. RNases T, PH, D, and BN are highly specific for 3′-processing of tRNA and other stable RNA species, and they are inactive on most other RNA substrates (16Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Curtiss R.W. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2004Google Scholar). Importantly, M. genitalium RNase R is able to carry out both shortening of the long 3′-trailer and generation of the mature 3′-end. This represents a novel mechanism for tRNA 3′-maturation that has not been found in other organisms (Fig. 6) (2Li Z. Gong X. Joshi V.H. Li M. Co-evolution of tRNA 3′-trailer sequences with 3′-processing enzymes in bacteria.RNA. 2005; 11: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). M. genitalium RNase R and its E. coli homologues RNases R and II are members of the RNR exoribonuclease family (9Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Exoribonuclease superfamilies: structural analysis and phylogenetic distribution.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In contrast to M. genitalium RNase R, E. coli RNase R completely degrades a tRNA precursor, whereas RNase II generates the mature 3′-end of tRNA at very low efficiency (5Li Z. Deutscher M.P.

Deutscher M.P. Curtiss R.W. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2004Google Scholar). Such functional differences may be explained by their different sensitivities to higher order structures in RNA. RNase II degrades single-stranded RNA efficiently but stalls at RNA duplex regions (21Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Overexpression, purification, and properties of Escherichia coli ribonuclease II.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1048-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A clamp-like assembly in the RNA-binding domain of RNase II possibly allows single-stranded RNA 3′-ends to enter the catalytic center and blocks double-stranded RNA. During RNA digestion in vitro, RNase II progressively slows down at double-stranded structures, resulting in products that usually contain an average 7–9-nt single-stranded overhang at the 3′-end (22Zuo Y. Vincent H.A. Zhang J. Wang Y. Deutscher M.P. Malhotra A. Structural basis for processivity and single-strand specificity of RNase II.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to RNase II, E. coli RNase R is able to degrade double-stranded RNA effectively starting from a single-stranded 3′-overhang. E. coli RNase R binds single-stranded RNA tightly within the nuclease domain channel. This helps the separation of the double-stranded RNA region immediately outside of the channel and leads the resulting single-stranded RNA to the channel for degradation (13Vincent H.A. Deutscher M.P. Insights into how RNase R degrades structured RNA: analysis of the nuclease domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). E. coli RNase R also possesses a RNA helicase activity in its CsdA domain that contributes to the degradation of double-stranded RNA (23Awano N. Rajagopal V. Arbing M. Patel S. Hunt J. Inouye M. Phadtare S. Escherichia coli RNase R has dual activities, helicase and RNase.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). M. genitalium RNase R is able to degrade highly structured rRNA; however, it is sensitive to the aminoacyl-acceptor stem of tRNA and to RNA 2′-O-methylation (Ref. 11Lalonde M.S. Zuo Y. Zhang J. Gong X. Wu S. Malhotra A. Li Z. Exoribonuclease R in Mycoplasma genitalium can carry out both RNA processing and degradative functions and is sensitive to RNA ribose methylation.RNA. 2007; 13: 1957-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and this work). The structural features of M. genitalium RNase R responsible for its selective sensitivity to different RNA structures remain to be elucidated. M. genitalium RNase R has some interesting properties that are similar to those of E. coli RNase T with respect to tRNA 3′-maturation reactions. First, M. genitalium RNase R stops at the mature 3′-end of tRNA most efficiently when the terminal sequence is RCCN. Alterations of the discriminator and CCA sequences may result in removal of the 3′-terminal CA residues by this enzyme. Second, RNase R appears to be sensitive to C-rich sequences (Fig. 5B), which may help it to stop at the 3′-CCA end. Interestingly, E. coli RNase T is also able to remove part of the terminal CCA sequence in tRNA, demonstrates similar sensitivity to C-rich sequences, and prefers a CCN terminus for 3′-maturation of tRNA (14Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Mechanism of action of RNase T. I. Identification of residues required for catalysis, substrate binding, and dimerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50155-50159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RNase T is also able to trim residues that are immediately downstream of a stem structure in stable RNAs (15Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. 3′-Exoribonucleolytic trimming is a common feature of the maturation of small, stable RNAs in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, unlike M. genitalium RNase R, E. coli RNase T does not degrade long 3′-trailer sequences in tRNA precursors (5Li Z.

Processing of the Escherichia coli leuX tRNA transcript, encoding tRNALeu5, requires either the 3′ → 5′ exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase or RNase P to remove the Rho-independent transcription terminator.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Maes A. Gracia C. Hajnsdorf E. Régnier P. Search for poly(A) polymerase targets in E. coli reveals its implication in surveillance of Glu-tRNA processing and degradation of stable RNAs.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 83: 436-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The preference of a purine discriminator for tRNA 3′-maturation seems to be unique for M. genitalium RNase R because this has not been shown for any other exoribonucleases. It should be noted that 31 of 36 M. genitalium tRNAs contain an A or a G discriminator (unpublished observations). RNase R may have evolved to recognize a 3′-terminal RCCN sequence for more efficient processing of most tRNA species in M. genitalium. Recognition of the same sequence has been described for the 5′-end processing enzyme RNase P in E. coli (20Kikovska E. Brännvall M. Kufel J. Kirsebom L.A. Substrate discrimination in RNase P RNA-mediated cleavage: importance of the structural environment of the RNase P cleavage site.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2012-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The RNA subunit of RNase P contains a UGG sequence in its P15 loop that forms perfect base pairing with the RCC sequence for correct cleavage at the 5′-end. Strikingly, M. genitalium RNase P also contains the same UGG motif, which presumably recognizes the RCC sequence in its pre-tRNA substrates. Therefore, it is likely that both RNases P and R of M. genitalium have evolved to make use of the same RCCN sequence in a pre-tRNA for maturation. In this work, we observed that pre-tRNAs with altered acceptor stems and 3′-terminal sequences are partially or completely degraded by RNase R. This suggests a possible role for this enzyme in the quality control of tRNA. In summary, M. genitalium RNase R has a combination of properties found in several other exoribonucleases, making it a unique RNase that may carry out diverse reactions in tRNA processing, RNA degradation, and quality control. This multifunctional enzyme is extremely important for RNA metabolism in M. genitalium because of its limited genome size. It remains to be determined if RNase R has a broad role in RNA processing and degradation in M. genitalium and other related bacteria. We thank Arun Malhotra and Brad Schmier (University of Miami) for help with purification of M. genitalium RNase R. We are grateful to Keith Brew for assistance with proofreading.

We demonstrate that these differences are in part explained by differences in the structures of the N-terminal regions 1.1 and 1.2 of the E. coli σ70 and T. aquaticus σA subunits. In particular, region 1.1 and, to a lesser extent, region 1.2 of the E. coli σ70 subunit determine higher promoter complex stability of E. coli RNAP. On the other hand, nonconserved amino acid substitutions in region 1.2, but not region 1.1, contribute to the differences in promoter opening between E. coli and T. aquaticus RNAPs, likely through affecting the σ subunit contacts with DNA nucleotides downstream of the −10 element. At the same time, substitutions in σ regions 1.1 and 1.2 do not affect promoter escape by E. coli and T. aquaticus RNAPs. Thus, evolutionary substitutions in various regions of the σ subunit modulate different steps of the open promoter complex formation pathway, with regions 1.1 and 1.2 affecting promoter complex stability and region 1.2 involved in DNA melting during initiation.Background: RNA polymerases (RNAPs) from Thermus aquaticus and Escherichia coli differ in many aspects of transcription initiation.Results: Regions 1.1 and 1.2 of the σ subunit determine instability and cold sensitivity of promoter complexes of T. aquaticus RNAP.Conclusion: Substitutions in σ regions 1.1 and 1.2 modulate RNAP-promoter interactions.Significance: Evolutionary changes in the σ subunit determine functional differences between bacterial RNAPs during transcription initiation.

Based on genetic, biochemical, and structural studies, the σ regions were assigned various functions in transcription initiation. In particular, regions 4.2, 2.3–2.4, and 3.0 were implicated in recognition of the −35, −10, and TG (extended −10) promoter elements, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A.

The DNA binding activity of primary σ subunits is inhibited in free σs, in part because of the presence of a weakly conserved region 1.1 at their N terminus. Removal of this region in Eco σ70 increases specific interactions of σ70 with promoters (22Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A.

Although the structures of regions 1.1 in Eco and Taq σ subunits remain unknown, the structure of region 1.1 from T. maritima was solved by NMR showing that it folds into three α helixes and possesses a negative electrostatic potential on its surface (supplemental Fig. S1) (24Schwartz E.C.

The presence of a high number of negatively charged amino acids is also a characteristic feature of region 1.1 in other primary σ subunits, including Taq and T. thermophilus σA subunits that have highly divergent region 1.1 sequences (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to the proposed functions in preventing interactions of free σ with DNA, region 1.1 likely plays an important role in holoenzyme assembly and open complex formation (25Wilson C.

Although a wealth of biochemical and genetic data on promoter recognition and transcription initiation were accumulated for Eco RNAP, most structural information on the mechanisms of bacterial transcription was obtained for RNAPs from thermophilic Taq and T. thermophilus that are distantly related to Eco.

In particular, Taq RNAP has a higher temperature optimum of activity than the Eco RNAP and is inactive at low and moderate temperatures. These differences were shown to be associated with the catalytic properties of Taq core RNAP and with the properties of the Taq σA subunit that is unable to induce promoter DNA melting at temperatures below 45 °C (36Kulbachinskiy A.

The cold sensitivity of promoter opening by the Taq σA subunit in comparison with the Eco σ70 subunit was explained by substitutions of nonconserved amino acids in region 2 and by differences in the structures of the N-terminal parts of these σ subunits (36Kulbachinskiy A.

A characteristic feature of most studied promoter complexes of Eco RNAP is their very high stability in vitro, with half-lives ranging from tens of minutes to hours. In contrast, promoter complexes of Taq RNAP were shown to be intrinsically unstable and to dissociate within seconds (10Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I.

The structural features of Taq RNAP that can explain the low stability of promoter complexes formed by this RNAP remain unidentified. In this work we extended analysis of functional differences between Eco and Taq RNAPs in transcription initiation, with particular emphasis on the roles of regions 1.1 and 1.2 of the σ70 and σA subunits in promoter complex formation. We demonstrated that both regions 1.1 and 1.2 of the σA subunit determine the low stability of promoter complexes of Taq RNAP, whereas substitutions in region 1.2 of σA contribute to the cold sensitivity of promoter opening by Taq RNAP, suggesting possible functions of these regions at different steps of the open complex formation pathway. Wild-type Eco and Taq core RNAPs were purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells overproducing all four core RNAP subunits from plasmids pVS10 and pET28ABCZ, respectively, as described previously (35Kuznedelov K.

The T7A1, T7A1cons, and T7A1_TGcons promoters (positions from −85 to +53 nucleotides relative to the starting point of transcription) were obtained by PCR from synthetic oligonucleotide templates. The lacUV5 promoter (positions −59 to +58) was obtained as described in Ref. 21Zenkin N. Kulbachinskiy A. Yuzenkova Y. Mustaev A. Bass I. Severinov K. Brodolin K.

The λPR promoter fragment (positions −81 to +54) was obtained by PCR from plasmid pIA226. The sequences of all promoters are shown on Fig. 1C. Transcription assays were performed in transcription buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Holoenzyme RNAPs were prepared by incubating core RNAP (final concentration, 100 nm) and either the wild type or mosaic σ subunits (500 nm) in the transcription buffer for 5 min at 25 °C. DNA template was added (10–30 nm), and the samples were incubated for 3–5 min at desired temperatures (45 °C for holoenzymes containing Eco core RNAP and 55 °C for holoenzymes containing Taq core RNAP in most experiments). For analysis of promoter complex stabilities on T7A1 and λPR promoters, heparin was added to 10 μg/ml. Following incubation of the samples for different time intervals at the same temperatures, transcription reactions were initiated by the addition of dinucleotide primer CpA (25 μm) and UTP (10 μm, with the addition of [α-32P]UTP). The reactions were stopped after 1 min by the addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 8 m urea and 20 mm EDTA; the 3-nucleotide RNA products were analyzed by 23% denaturing PAGE followed by phosphorimaging. For analysis of temperature dependence of transcription on the lacUV5 promoter, reactions were performed in the presence of trinucleotide primer ApApU and UTP (with the addition of [α-32P]UTP); the samples were transferred to desired temperatures 5 min prior to addition of nucleotide substrates. For analysis of promoter escape, the reactions were performed in transcription buffer containing 100 mm KCl; all four nucleotide substrates were added (100 μm of ATP, CTP, and GTP and 10 μm of UTP with the addition of [α-32P]UTP), either in the absence or in the presence of the CpA primer (25 μm). The transcription reactions were stopped after 5 min, and RNA products were separated by 20% denaturing PAGE. For the KMnO4 footprinting experiments, the lacUV5 promoter was labeled at the 3′-end of the template DNA strand with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP as described in Refs. 36Kulbachinskiy A.

https://openalex.org/W2088593314,"DNA primases catalyze the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides required for the initiation of lagging strand DNA synthesis. Prokaryotic primases consist of a zinc-binding domain (ZBD) necessary for recognition of a specific template sequence and a catalytic RNA polymerase domain. Interactions of both domains with the DNA template and ribonucleotides are required for primer synthesis. Five tryptophan residues are dispersed in the primase of bacteriophage T7: Trp-42 in the ZBD and Trp-69, -97, -147, and -255 in the RNA polymerase domain. Previous studies showed that replacement of Trp-42 with alanine in the ZBD decreases primer synthesis, whereas substitution of non-aromatic residues for Trp-69 impairs both primer synthesis and delivery. However, the roles of tryptophan at position 97, 147, or 255 remain elusive. To investigate the essential roles of these residues, we replaced each tryptophan with the structurally similar tyrosine and examined the effect of this subtle alteration on primer synthesis. The substitution at position 42, 97, or 147 reduced primer synthesis, whereas substitution at position 69 or 255 did not. The functions of the tryptophans were further examined at each step of primer synthesis. Alteration of residue 42 disturbed the conformation of the ZBD and resulted in partial loss of the zinc ion, impairing binding to the ssDNA template. Replacement of Trp-97 with tyrosine reduced the binding affinity to NTP and the catalysis step. The replacement of Trp-147 with tyrosine also impaired the catalytic step. Therefore, Trp-42 is important in maintaining the conformation of the ZBD for template binding; Trp-97 contributes to NTP binding and the catalysis step; and Trp-147 maintains the catalysis step.Background: What are the essential roles of five tryptophans in the T7 primase?Results: Replacement of Trp-42, -97, or -147 with the structurally similar tyrosine disturbs the conformation of the ZBD and reduces NTP binding and the catalysis step.Conclusion: Trp-42, -97, and -147 contribute to template binding, NTP binding, and the catalysis step.Significance: Trp-42, -97, and -147 play different but essential roles in T7 DNA primase.
