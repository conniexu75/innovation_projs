constraints on the constitution of the earth's interior."
https://openalex.org/W2039745694,"A dramatic shift in the genetics of host-parasite interaction and balance occurred in the U.S. corn crop in the 1970 growing season. Southern corn leaf blight incited by Helminthosporium maydis Nisikado & Miyake evolved from a minor disease that causes an average annual loss of less than 1 percent, to one that caused more than the 12 percent average expected from all diseases of corn in the United States. In 1970 the losses to corn leaf blight approaches 710 million bushels. Reserves of corn and other grains ease the impact on the economy and food supplies but there are important domestic and foreign effects of the loss. The epidemic illustrates the vulnerability of our food crops to pests. Sources of genetic resistance to the new race of Helminthosporium maydis are available. The seed industry estimates that for 1971 enough resistant and partially resistant seed to plant about one-half of the crop may be available. Adequate supplies are expected in 1972. Sustained research programs are essential in protecting our food supplies from potential losses of catastrophe magnitude. Several professional groups, including the American Phytopathological Society and the Entomological Society of America, have urged that a program and facilities be established for the study of exotic pests that threaten our agriculture so that controls may be found before the pests are here. Such a program would be desirable but covers only one aspect of the problem. What is really needed is an overall strengthening of research on crop pests."
https://openalex.org/W1968907552,"If a mixture of types of corn pollen, identified by genetic markers, is applied to the silks of other inbred lines, the rate of pollen tube growth often varies with type of pollen. This gametophytic differential is correlated with a sporophytic differential—relatively heavier seeds in seed mixtures result from fertilization by gametes from faster growing tubes. The increased seed weight is due to greater competitive ability of the zygotes thus formed."
https://openalex.org/W2000857307,The responses of an intertidal amphipod indicate an ability to perceive rapid pressure changes of less than 0.01 atm. The interaction of rate of change of pressure and total difference in pressure implies a rapid accommodation as well as a threshold. Evidence suggests that the sensory mechanism may not involve compressibility of a gas.
https://openalex.org/W203138401,"Airborne debris from nuclear weapons tests has been collected since 1955 and examined for radioactivity. The debris was collected on glass-fiber paper with a sampling device carried by an aircraft at altitudes up to about 10 miles. Part of the filter paper is used for spectrometric determination of a number of gamma -emitting nuclides, from which an age determination can be made. The remainder of the filter is radioautographed on photographic film. From the radioautograms it is possible to determine the activity of the individual particles and to locate their positions on the filter. Measurements were made of the size of radioactive particles. The particles were examined microscopically. Data are presented graphically on the activity of 950 particles of various sizes. Characteristics are described for debris from the Soviet test series of Sept. and Oct. 1959. (C.H.)"

https://openalex.org/W2026946608,An extract from lyophilized tissue of flowering Xanthium (cocklebur) plants initiates floral development when applied to Xanthium test plants maintained on long-day photoperiodic conditions. Details of the preparation of the extract are described.
https://openalex.org/W2027355960,"All known species of the genera Bracteacoccus, Spongiochloris, and Dictyochloris, and some of the species of Neochloris and Spongiococcum are capable of growing heterotrophically in darkness in a glucose-salts medium. In contrast, all known species of Chlorococcum are obligate photoautotrophs. Possible relationships between these results and certain morphological characteristics are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1994889702,"Fishes and benthic invertebrates discovered frozen in situ and exposed at the ablation surface of the McMurdo ice shelf provide evidence both for the occurrence of a fauna, including large fishes, under the permanent ice shelf and for Debenham's hypothesis of the nourishment of an ice shelf by the freezing of sea water on its bottom."
https://openalex.org/W2015140241,"Spheniscus predemersus, new species, from the late Pliocene of Langebaanweg, Cape Province, is the first fossil penguin to be described from Africa. It is closely related and possibly ancestral to the living species, Spheniscus demersus, of southern and southwestern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2008956002,"Estimates of paleotemperatures, based upon paleoecological analysis of planktonic foraminiferal thanatocoenoses of three piston cores from Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas, indicate a maximum mean variation between Late Pleistocene glacial and nonglacial stages of 3.6 degrees C. The data also indicate that the Early Wisconsin glacial stage was 0.7 degrees C warmer than the Late Wisconsin glacial stage."

https://openalex.org/W2039282740,Recent theoretical and experimental investigations of the periods of free spheroidal oscillation of the earth have shown good agreement. These data are used to determine group and phase velocities for Rayleigh waves of period greater than 380 seconds. The velocities so obtained are compared with those determined from analysis of progressive waves. It is concluded that group and phase velocities determined by either of the two methods are in agreement.
