https://openalex.org/W2171746332,"Independent component analysis (ICA) and blind source separation (BSS) methods are increasingly used to separate individual brain and non-brain source signals mixed by volume conduction in electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological recordings. We compared results of decomposing thirteen 71-channel human scalp EEG datasets by 22 ICA and BSS algorithms, assessing the pairwise mutual information (PMI) in scalp channel pairs, the remaining PMI in component pairs, the overall mutual information reduction (MIR) effected by each decomposition, and decomposition 'dipolarity' defined as the number of component scalp maps matching the projection of a single equivalent dipole with less than a given residual variance. The least well-performing algorithm was principal component analysis (PCA); best performing were AMICA and other likelihood/mutual information based ICA methods. Though these and other commonly-used decomposition methods returned many similar components, across 18 ICA/BSS algorithms mean dipolarity varied linearly with both MIR and with PMI remaining between the resulting component time courses, a result compatible with an interpretation of many maximally independent EEG components as being volume-conducted projections of partially-synchronous local cortical field activity within single compact cortical domains. To encourage further method comparisons, the data and software used to prepare the results have been made available (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BSSComparison)."
https://openalex.org/W2083855314,"Skeletal muscle plays important roles in whole-body glucose and fatty acid metabolism. However, muscle also secretes cytokines and growth factors (collectively termed myokines) that can potentially act in an autocrine, a paracrine, and/or an endocrine manner to modulate metabolic, inflammatory, and other processes. Here, we report the identification and characterization of myonectin, a novel myokine belonging to the C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) family. Myonectin transcript was highly induced in differentiated myotubes and predominantly expressed by skeletal muscle. Circulating levels of myonectin were tightly regulated by the metabolic state; fasting suppressed, but refeeding dramatically increased, its mRNA and serum levels. Although mRNA and circulating levels of myonectin were reduced in a diet-induced obese state, voluntary exercise increased its expression and circulating levels. Accordingly, myonectin transcript was up-regulated by compounds (forskolin, epinephrine, ionomycin) that raise cellular cAMP or calcium levels. In vitro, secreted myonectin forms disulfide-linked oligomers, and when co-expressed, forms heteromeric complexes with other members of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. In mice, recombinant myonectin administration reduced circulating levels of free fatty acids without altering adipose tissue lipolysis. Consistent with this, myonectin promoted fatty acid uptake in cultured adipocytes and hepatocytes, in part by up-regulating the expression of genes (CD36, FATP1, Fabp1, and Fabp4) that promote lipid uptake. Collectively, these results suggest that myonectin links skeletal muscle to lipid homeostasis in liver and adipose tissue in response to alterations in energy state, revealing a novel myonectin-mediated metabolic circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2050834222,"Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process regulating turnover of cytoplasmic proteins via a lysosome-dependent pathway. Here we show that kidneys from mice deficient in autophagic protein Beclin 1 exhibited profibrotic phenotype, with increased collagen deposition. Reduced Beclin 1 expression, through genetic disruption of beclin 1 or knockdown by specific siRNA in primary mouse mesangial cells (MMC), resulted in increased protein levels of type I collagen (Col-I). Inhibition of autolysosomal protein degradation by bafilomycin A1 also increased Col-I protein levels and colocalization of Col-I with LC3, an autophagy marker, or LAMP-1, a lysosome marker, whereas treatment with TFP, an inducer of autophagy, resulted in decreased Col-I protein levels induced by TGF-β1, without alterations in Col-I α1 mRNA. Heterozygous deletion of beclin 1 increased accumulation of aggregated Col-I under nonstimulated conditions, and stimulation with TGF-β1 further increased aggregated Col-I. These data indicate that Col-I and aggregated, insoluble procollagen I undergo intracellular degradation via autophagy. A cytoprotective role of autophagy is implicated in kidney injury, and we demonstrate that low-dose carbon monoxide, shown to exert cytoprotection against renal fibrosis, induces autophagy to suppress accumulation of Col-I induced by TGF-β1. We also show that TGF-β1 induces autophagy in MMC via TAK1-MKK3-p38 signaling pathway. The dual functions of TGF-β1, as both an inducer of Col-I synthesis and an inducer of autophagy and Col-I degradation, underscore the multifunctional nature of TGF-β1. Our findings suggest a novel role of autophagy as a cytoprotective mechanism to negatively regulate and prevent excess collagen accumulation in the kidney.

Its relentless production and progressive accumulation are hallmarks of renal fibrosis in progressive kidney disease. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is well known as a potent inducer of kidney fibrosis that leads to end stage renal disease (ESRD) (1Border W.A. Noble N.A.

TGF-β1 induces production of ECM proteins including fibronectin and collagens and inhibits degradation of ECM proteins mainly by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (3Vu T.H. Werb Z.

Collagens are the main components of the ECM in the kidney and type I collagen (Col-I) produced by mesangial cells is the major type associated with disease states (6Yoshioka K. Tohda M. Takemura T.

Besides the MMPs, recently emerging evidence suggests another mechanism that may promote collagen degradation. In heat shock protein 47 (Hsp47)-null cells, the deletion of collagen-specific molecular chaperone Hsp47 results in misfolded type I procollagens that are subjected to intracellular degradation via autophagy (9Ishida Y. Yamamoto A. Kitamura A. Lamandé S.R. Yoshimori T. Bateman J.F. Kubota H. Nagata K.

Furthermore, enhanced degradation of Col-I correlated with increase in autophagy when the β2-adrenergic receptor is activated in cardiac fibroblasts (10Aránguiz-Urroz P. Canales J. Copaja M.

Macroautophagy, commonly referred to as autophagy is a fundamental cellular homeostatic process that cells use to degrade and recycle cellular proteins and remove damaged organelles. The process of autophagy involves the formation of double membrane bound vesicles called autophagosomes that envelope and sequester cytoplasmic components, including macromolecular aggregates and cellular organelles for bulk degradation by a lysosomal degradative pathway (11Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Autophagy can be up-regulated in response to both external and intracellular factors, including amino acid starvation (12Ecker N. Mor A. Journo D. Abeliovich H. Induction of autophagic flux by amino acid deprivation is distinct from nitrogen starvation-induced macroautophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), growth factor withdrawal (13Liang J.

Physiological functions of autophagy.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2009; 335: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To date, more than 30 genes whose products are involved in autophagy have been identified in yeast, and these have been termed autophagy-related genes (Atg) (20Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. A unified nomenclature for yeast autophagy-related genes.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). To initiate autophagy in mammalian cells, two different protein complexes, namely Ulk1/mAtg13/FIP200 complex and the orthologues of yeast vesicular protein-sorting protein (Vps34)/Beclin 1 complex, are required. However, it is still unclear if these complexes act independently in parallel or act together in tandem. Pro-autophagy signals such as amino acid withdrawal lead to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) synthesis by Vps34, which is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PI3P-rich membrane structures called omegasomes are formed at subdomains of the ER membrane (21Axe E.L. Walker S.A. Manifava M. Chandra P. Roderick H.L. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Ktistakis N.T. Autophagosome formation from membrane compartments enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and dynamically connected to the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Autophagosomes are formed within the omegasomes, and eventually exit omegasomes and fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, in which the sequestered contents are degraded by proteases and acidification of lysosomal lumen (22Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy in yeast demonstrated with proteinase-deficient mutants and conditions for its induction.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 23Nakamura N. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Acidification of vacuoles is required for autophagic degradation in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Beclin 1, encoded by beclin 1 gene, is the mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg6 that is required for the initiation of autophagy through its interaction with Vps34 (24Burman C. Ktistakis N.T. Autophagosome formation in mammalian cells.Semin. Immunopathol. 2010; 32: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Homozygous deletion of beclin 1 (beclin 1−/−) exhibits early embryonic lethality (25Yue Z. Jin S. Yang C. Levine A.J. Heintz N. Beclin 1, an autophagy gene essential for early embryonic development, is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15077-15082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), while heterozygous deletion (beclin 1+/−) results in increased incidence of spontaneous tumorigenesis (26Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.L. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Cattoretti G. Levine B.

Masliah E. Britschgi M. Lucin K. Narasimhan R. Jaeger P.A. Small S. Spencer B. Rockenstein E. Levine B. Wyss-Coray T. The autophagy-related protein beclin 1 shows reduced expression in early Alzheimer disease and regulates amyloid β accumulation in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2190-2199PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that heterozygous inactivation of beclin 1 resulted in a 3-fold increase in interstitial fibrosis in a model of severe form of desmin-related cardiomyopathy induced by a missense mutation in the αB-crystallin (CryAB) gene (29Tannous P. Zhu H. Johnstone J.L. Shelton J.M. Rajasekaran N.S. Benjamin I.J. Nguyen L. Gerard R.D. Levine B. Rothermel B.A. Hill J.A. Autophagy is an adaptive response in desmin-related cardiomyopathy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9745-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast to Beclin 1, the mammalian orthologue of Atg8 comprised by a family of proteins known as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) functions, at least in part, as a structural component in the formation of autophagosomes (30Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. The pre-autophagosomal structure organized by concerted functions of APG genes is essential for autophagosome formation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). LC3B (herein referred to as LC3) is the best characterized form and the most widely used as an autophagic marker. An increasing body of evidence supports the notion that autophagy can promote cell survival and the accumulation of autophagosomes may signify a survival response intended to get rid of misfolded proteins or damaged organelles in cells (9Ishida Y. Yamamoto A. Kitamura A. Lamandé S.R. Yoshimori T. Bateman J.F. Kubota H. Nagata K. Autophagic elimination of misfolded procollagen aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum as a means of cell protection.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2744-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Indeed, autophagy is implicated in the protective mechanism against the progression of certain human diseases, including cancer, muscular disorders, and neurodegeneration, such as Huntington, Alzheimer, and Parkinson diseases (18Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Autophagy also plays an important role in cellular defense mechanism to certain pathogenic bacteria and viruses. In the kidney, a recent report has shown that autophagy decreases renal tubular cell apoptosis induced by cisplatin (31Periyasamy-Thandavan S. Jiang M. Wei Q. Smith R. Yin X.M. Dong Z. Autophagy is cytoprotective during cisplatin injury of renal proximal tubular cells.Kidney Int. 2008; 74: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) or cyclosporine (32Pallet N. Bouvier N. Legendre C. Gilleron J. Codogno P. Beaune P. Thervet E. Anglicheau D. Autophagy protects renal tubular cells against cyclosporine toxicity.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) suggesting the potential protective role of autophagy in cytotoxic injury. However, the role of autophagy in kidney fibrosis, which ultimately leads to ESRD, remains largely unknown. We have previously reported that TGF-β1 induces autophagy in primary mouse mesangial cells (MMC) through activation of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and protects cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (33Ding Y. Kim J.K. Kim S.I. Na H.J. Jun S.Y. Lee S.J. Choi M.E. TGF-β1 protects against mesangial cell apoptosis via induction of autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 37909-37919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the functional role of autophagy in the regulation of Col-I induced by TGF-β1. We also explored the role of autophagy in reducing Col-I expression by treatment with low-dose carbon monoxide (CO) which we have previously shown to exert anti-fibrotic effects in a model of kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) (34Wang L. Lee J.Y. Kwak J.H. He Y. Kim S.I. Choi M.E. Protective effects of low-dose carbon monoxide against renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F508-F517Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the induction of autophagy promotes intracellular degradation of Col-I and that the autophagic process may serve as a cytoprotective mechanism to maintain cellular homeostasis.

The PCR primer sets for mouse Col-I α1: (forward) 5′-GACGCCATCAAGGTCTACTG-3′, (reverse) 5′-ACGGGAATCCATCGGTCA-3′ and mouse GAPDH: (forward) 5′-GCATTGTGGAAGGGCTCA-3′; (reverse) 5′-GGGTAGGAACACGGAAGG-3′. For real-time PCR, 7900 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) with SYBR green PCR reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Triplicate samples were run at each time, and detected levels of target mRNAs were calculated using the ΔΔCt method and normalized to GAPDH in arbitrary units. For low-dose CO exposure, cells were incubated with 250 ppm concentration of exogenous CO along with 5% CO2 in humidified modular chambers maintained at 37 °C, and CO levels in the chambers were monitored as described previously (34Wang L. Lee J.Y. Kwak J.H. He Y. Kim S.I. Choi M.E. Protective effects of low-dose carbon monoxide against renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F508-F517Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In CO donor experiments, MMC were incubated in media containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h with various concentrations of CORM-2 (0 to 20 mm). The cell lysates were subsequently analyzed with antibodies against Col-I, Beclin 1, and LC3. For in vivo CO exposures, 1% CO mixed with room air (RA; 21% oxygen) was directed into a 3.7-ft3 glass exposure chamber at a flow rate of 121/min, as described previously (34Wang L. Lee J.Y. Kwak J.H. He Y. Kim S.I. Choi M.E. Protective effects of low-dose carbon monoxide against renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F508-F517Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To maintain the CO level at 250 ppm in the chamber, a CO analyzer (Interscan, Chartsworth, CA) was used. The mice were exposed to 250 ppm concentration of CO for the indicated time periods and mice not undergoing CO exposures were maintained in normal RA. After exposure for the indicated times, the animals (n = 3 for each group of animals) were sacrificed, and the kidneys were harvested for histology and Western blot analysis. Statistical significance of the experimental data from three independent experiments was derived by the Student's t test or ANOVA, and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. All of the experiments were performed at least three times. Densitometric analysis for the quantitation of Western blot and RT-PCR data were carried out by using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. Although the homozygous beclin 1−/−-null mice are not viable, the heterozygous beclin 1+/− mice exhibit ∼50% reduction in autophagic capacity (26Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.L. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Cattoretti G. Levine B. Promotion of tumorigenesis by heterozygous disruption of the beclin 1 autophagy gene.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) and reduced basal autophagic flux compared with beclin 1+/+ littermates (39Haspel J. Shaik R.S. Ifedigbo E. Nakahira K.

To evaluate our hypothesis that autophagy is a process that promotes collagen degradation, we first examined whether a reduction in autophagic activity led to increased collagen deposition in the kidney of mice with heterozygous deletion of beclin 1. As shown in Fig. 1A, Masson's trichrome staining revealed increased collagen deposition in the kidneys from beclin 1+/− mice compared with beclin 1+/+ mice. We also analyzed the total kidney tissue lysates by Western blotting for Col-I. As shown in Fig. 1B, ∼2.4-fold increase in Col-I protein expression was observed in the kidneys from beclin 1+/− mice compared with beclin 1+/+ mice. We confirmed by immunoblotting that Beclin 1 protein expression was decreased in the kidneys of beclin 1+/− mice. These data show that reduced Beclin 1 expression leads to increased collagen levels, suggesting that Beclin 1 functions to prevent an excess deposition of collagen in the kidney. We next determined whether reduction of Beclin 1 expression leads to increased Col-I levels. Cell lysates of MMC obtained from the kidneys of beclin 1+/+ and beclin 1−/− mice were analyzed for Col-I and Beclin 1 expression by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, MMC from beclin 1+/− mice, with reduced Beclin 1 expression, exhibited high basal level of Col-1 compared with MMC from beclin 1+/+ mice (lane 1 versus lane 6).

https://openalex.org/W2047150475,"The white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is a wide-ranging apex predator in the northeastern Pacific (NEP). Electronic tagging has demonstrated that white sharks exhibit a regular migratory pattern, occurring at coastal sites during the late summer, autumn and early winter and moving offshore to oceanic habitats during the remainder of the year, although the purpose of these migrations remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to use stable isotope analysis (SIA) to provide insight into the trophic ecology and migratory behaviors of white sharks in the NEP. Between 2006 and 2009, 53 white sharks were biopsied in central California to obtain dermal and muscle tissues, which were analyzed for stable isotope values of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N). We developed a mixing model that directly incorporates movement data and tissue incorporation (turnover) rates to better estimate the relative importance of different focal areas to white shark diet and elucidate their migratory behavior. Mixing model results for muscle showed a relatively equal dietary contribution from coastal and offshore regions, indicating that white sharks forage in both areas. However, model results indicated that sharks foraged at a higher relative rate in coastal habitats. There was a negative relationship between shark length and muscle δ(13)C and δ(15)N values, which may indicate ontogenetic changes in habitat use related to onset of maturity. The isotopic composition of dermal tissue was consistent with a more rapid incorporation rate than muscle and may represent more recent foraging. Low offshore consumption rates suggest that it is unlikely that foraging is the primary purpose of the offshore migrations. These results demonstrate how SIA can provide insight into the trophic ecology and migratory behavior of marine predators, especially when coupled with electronic tagging data."

We recently reported that miR-203 is down-regulated, and its exogenous expression inhibits cell growth in canine oral malignant melanoma tissue specimens as well as in canine and human malignant melanoma cells. A microRNA target database predicted E2F3 and ZBP-89 as putative targets of microRNA-203 (miR-203). The expression levels of E2F3a, E2F3b, and ZBP-89 were markedly up-regulated in human malignant melanoma Mewo cells compared with those in human epidermal melanocytes. miR-203 significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of reporter plasmids containing the 3′-UTR sequence of either E2F3 or ZBP-89 complementary to miR-203. The ectopic expression of miR-203 in melanoma cells reduced the levels of E2F3a, E2F3b, and ZBP-89 protein expression. At the same time, miR-203 induced cell cycle arrest and senescence phenotypes, such as elevated expression of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma and other markers for senescence. Silencing of E2F3, but not of ZBP-89, inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest and senescence.

Electrophysiological experiments showed that six of seven scorpion toxins inhibited ∼50–80% of Kv1.3 channel currents at a concentration of 1 μm. The exception was rBmKTT-3, which had weak activity. The IC50 values of rBmKTT-1, rBmKTT-2, and rHg1 for Kv1.3 channels were ∼129.7, 371.3, and 6.2 nm, respectively. Further pharmacological experiments indicated that rHg1 was a highly selective Kv1.3 channel inhibitor with weak affinity for other potassium channels. Different from classical Kunitz-type potassium channel toxins with N-terminal regions as the channel-interacting interfaces, the channel-interacting interface of Hg1 was in the C-terminal region.

Until now, the potential potassium channel inhibitory activity of scorpion Kunitz-type toxin has not been determined. To identify novel peptide inhibitors specific for Kv1.3 channels, we screened scorpion Kunitz-type toxins and evaluated their pharmacological activities for potassium channels. By cDNA cloning, bioinformatic analyses, and functional evaluations, we identified the first scorpion Kunitz-type potassium channel toxin family composed of four new members (LmKTT-1c, BmKTT-1, BmKTT-2, and BmKTT-3) and three known members (LmKTT-1a, LmKTT-1b, and Hg1) (26Zhao R.

In addition to their functions as trypsin inhibitors, six of the recombinant scorpion Kunitz-type toxins also block 50–80% of Kv1.3 currents at a concentration of 1 μm. The exception was rBmKTT-3, which had weak activity. Among these peptides, a specific Kv1.3 inhibitor Hg1 was discovered with an IC50 value of ∼6.2 ± 1.2 nm. Significantly different from classical Kunitz-type potassium channel toxins with the N-terminal region as the channel-interacting interface, Hg1 adopted the C-terminal region as the main channel-interacting interface. Our results describe the first scorpion Kunitz-type potassium channel toxin family, and the identification of the specific Kv1.3 inhibitor Hg1. Kunitz-type toxins are a new group of toxins that can be used to screen and design potential peptides for diagnosing and treating Kv1.3-mediated autoimmune diseases. Venom gland cDNA libraries of scorpion Buthus martensii, Isometrus maculates, Lychas mucronatus, Heterometrus spinifer, Scorpiops tibetanus, and Scorpiops jendeki were constructed as described in our previous work (26Zhao R.

Sequences were identified for open reading frames using the ORF finder program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/). After excluding the signal peptides, the similarity was annotated by searching against the GenBankTM NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) using BLAST algorithms. Three known genes encoding Kunitz-type toxins Hg1, SdPI, and SdPI-2, and four new genes encoding Kunitz-type toxins, BmKTT-1, BmKTT-2, BmKTT-3, and LmKTT-1c were chosen.

We used the cDNA sequences of LmKTT-1a, LmKTT-1b, and LmKTT-1c from Lychas mucronatus venom gland cDNA libraries and BmKTT-1, BmKTT-2, and BmKTT-3 from scorpion B. martensii cDNA libraries as the templates for PCR to generate respective fragments (27Schwartz E.F. Diego-Garcia E. Rodríguez de la Vega R.C. Possani L.D.

The PCR product of Hg1 was generated by overlapping PCR. All PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and inserted into expression vector pET-28a. After confirmation by sequencing, the plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) were used for generating the mutants based on the wild-type plasmid pET-28a-Hg1. All mutant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing before expression. Kunitz-type toxins and mutants were expressed according to our previous protocol (26Zhao R. Dai H. Qiu S. Li T. He Y. Ma Y. Chen Z. Wu Y. Li W. Cao Z. SdPI, the first functionally characterized Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor from scorpion venom.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e27548Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For example, the recombinant LmKTT-1a was found to accumulate exclusively in inclusion bodies and was refolded in vitro. Renatured protein was finally purified by HPLC on a C18 column (10 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm Dalian Elite). Peaks were detected at 230 nm. The fraction containing recombinant LmKTT-1a was eluted at 20–21 min and further analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS (Voyager-DESTR, Applied Biosystems). The secondary structures of scorpion Kunitz-type toxins and mutants with a control peptide BPTI were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. All samples were dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C from 250 to 190 nm with a scan rate of 50 nm/min, on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Analytical Instruments, Easton, MD). The CD spectra were collected from averaging three scans after subtracting the blank spectrum of water. The three-dimensional structure of Hg1 was modeled using BPTI (PDB 4The abbreviation used is: PDBProtein Data Bank. code 6PTI) as a template through the SWISS-MODEL server as we have described previously (28Yi H. Cao Z. Yin S. Dai C. Wu Y. Li W. Interaction simulation of hERG K+ channel with its specific BeKm-1 peptide: Insights into the selectivity of molecular recognition.J.

Molecular docking of Hg1 interacting with the Kv1.3 channel was carried our as previous computational approaches (13Han S. Yi H. Yin S.J. Chen Z.Y. Liu H. Cao Z.J. Wu Y.L. Li W.X.

First, the structure of the Kv1.3 channel was modeled using KcsA (PDB code 1K4C) as a template. Second, molecular docking was performed on the modeled Hg1 peptide and Kv1.3 channels using the ZDOCK program (30Chen R. Li L. Weng Z. ZDOCK: An initial stage protein-docking algorithm.Proteins. 2003; 52: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), and the docking results were then filtered by scoring combined with detailed mutagenesis information; Finally, a reasonable Hg1-Kv1.3 complex that was consistent with the experimental alanine-scanning mutagenesis was screened out. The inhibitory activities of seven Kunitz-type toxins were tested in the presence of serine proteases as described previously (26Zhao R. Dai H. Qiu S. Li T. He Y. Ma Y. Chen Z. Wu Y. Li W. Cao Z. SdPI, the first functionally characterized Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor from scorpion venom.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e27548Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Trypsin (bovine pancreatic trypsin; EC 3.4.21.4), α-chymotrypsin (bovine pancreatic α-chymotrypsin; EC 3.4.21.1), elastase (porcine pancreatic elastase; EC 3.4.21.36), and their respective chromogenic substrates, Na-benzoyl-l-arginine, 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride, N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide, were purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich). Trypsin was incubated with various amounts of rHg1 (100 to 400 nm) for 30 min at a final concentration of 400 nm. The reactions were initiated by adding varying concentrations of substrate, ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mm. The initial rate of p-nitroanilide formation was monitored continuously at 405 nm for 5 min at 25 °C. The inhibitory activity of rHg1 was estimated by setting the initial velocity obtained with only protease as 100%. The inhibitory constant (Ki) of the trypsin-inhibitor complex was determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots and further slope replotting. The methods for chymotrypsin and elastase assay were the same, except the final concentration of chymotrypsin was 100 nm. The cDNAs encoding mKv1.1, hKv1.2, mKv1.3, and hSKCa3 were provided generously by professor Stephan Grissmer (University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany) and professor George Chandy (University of California, Irvine, CA). We saved the mBKCa channel. All of the channels were subcloned into the pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and transformed into HEK293 cells. The whole-cell patch clamp was used to measure and record the channel currents according to a previously described procedure (13Han S. Yi H. Yin S.J. Chen Z.Y. Liu H. Cao Z.J. Wu Y.L. Li W.X.

Peptides were dissolved in stock solutions containing 1% BSA and diluted into solutions containing 0.01% BSA for toxin application in electrophysiological experiments. Results are shown as mean ± S.E., with n being the number of experiments. The significance between two means was calculated with the Student's t test using Origin software (version 6.0, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Differences in the mean values were considered significant at probability <0.05. Using IGOR software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), concentration versus response relationships were fitted according to the modified Hill equation: Itoxin/Icontrol = 1/1 + ([toxin]/IC50), where I is the peak current, and [toxin] is the concentration of toxin. The parameters to be fitted were concentration at half-maximal effect (IC50). On the basis of our cDNA libraries and further random sequencing, four new genes encoding Kunitz-type toxins were obtained. Three were isolated from scorpion B. martensii, which were named BmKTT-1, BmKTT-2, and BmKTT-3, and one was isolated from scorpion L. mucronatus and named LmKTT-1c. Combined with the three known Kunitz-type toxins, Hg1, LmKTT-1a, and LmKTT-1b (26Zhao R. Dai H. Qiu S. Li T. He Y. Ma Y. Chen Z. Wu Y. Li W. Cao Z.

Hg1 and BmKTT-3 belong to the first group, which adopted classical disulfide pairings similar to HWTX-XI toxin from spider (20Yuan C.H. He Q.Y. Peng K. Diao J.B. Jiang L.P. Tang X. Liang S.P.

Cloning and functional expression of dendrotoxin K from black mamba, a K+ channel blocker.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5692-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and APEKTx1 from sea anemone (23Peigneur S. Billen B. Derua R. Waelkens E. Debaveye S. Béress L. Tytgat J. A bifunctional sea anemone peptide with Kunitz type protease and potassium channel inhibiting properties.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2011; 82: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). LmKTT-1a, LmKTT-1b, LmKTT-1c, and BmKTT-1 belong to the second group, which adopted a unique cystine framework that we described in our previous work (26Zhao R. Dai H. Qiu S. Li T. He Y. Ma Y. Chen Z. Wu Y. Li W. Cao Z. SdPI, the first functionally characterized Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor from scorpion venom.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e27548Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These toxins lack the normal CysII–CysIV disulfide bonds present in BmKTT-3 from group I but contain two new cysteine residues near the C terminus of the mature peptide. Different from all known Kunitz-type toxins from various animals, BmKTT-2 in the third group has eight cysteine residues, which may adopt novel disulfide bonds (17You D. Hong J. Rong M. Yu H.

Our findings demonstrate the molecular diversity of scorpion Kunitz-type toxins. To evaluate the function of scorpion Kunitz-type toxins, we obtained seven recombinant toxins as described previously (26Zhao R. Dai H. Qiu S. Li T. He Y. Ma Y. Chen Z. Wu Y. Li W. Cao Z.

Expression and purification of LmKTT-1a toxin were as follows. A His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site were fused to LmKTT-1a at the N terminus. Inclusion bodies of LmKTT-1a fusion peptide were suspended in LB medium and refolded successfully in vitro. The soluble protein was further separated by RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). By MALDI-TOF MS, the molecular weight was 8657.8 Da, which is in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 8658.6 Da (supplemental Fig. S1C). BPTI is a classical Kunitz-type peptide (33Lancelin J.M. Foray M.F. Poncin M. Hollecker M. Marion D. Proteinase inhibitor homologues as potassium channel blockers.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By circular dichroism spectroscopy, all seven recombinant scorpion Kunitz-type toxins were found to have similar secondary structures to BPTI (supplemental Fig. S2), which suggests the conserved structures of Kunitz-type peptides. Based on the conserved structures of scorpion Kunitz-type toxins, they were assayed for inhibitory activity against trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase. All seven recombinant toxins exhibited apparent inhibitory effects on trypsin (Fig. 2), but no inhibitory effect on chymotrypsin or elastase, even at higher concentrations. Recombinant LmKTT-1a, LmKTT-1b, LmKTT-1c, BmKTT-1, and Hg1 could completely inhibit the trypsin activity at the ratio of 1:1 with a dissociation constant of 140, 160, 124, 136, and 107 nm, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3). The rBmKTT-2 could completely inhibit the trypsin activity at a ratio of ∼1.5:1, with a dissociation constant of 420 nm, and rBmKTT-3 could inhibit ∼85% of the trypsin activity at a ratio of ∼4:1, with a dissociation constant of 760 nm (Table 1).TABLE 1Kunitz-type potassium channel toxins from animal venomsNameSourceTrypsin activityChannel activityRef.nmnmHg 1Scorpion1076.2 (Kv1.3)Ref. 26"

Ca2+ oscillations are particularly important in this respect and are based on positive and negative [Ca2+]i feedback on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs). Connexin hemichannels are Ca2+-permeable plasma membrane channels that are also controlled by [Ca2+]i. We aimed to investigate how hemichannels may contribute to Ca2+ oscillations. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing connexin-32 (Cx32) and Cx43 were exposed to bradykinin (BK) or ATP to induce Ca2+ oscillations. BK-induced oscillations were rapidly (minutes) and reversibly inhibited by the connexin-mimetic peptides 32Gap27/43Gap26, whereas ATP-induced oscillations were unaffected. Furthermore, these peptides inhibited the BK-triggered release of calcein, a hemichannel-permeable dye. BK-induced oscillations, but not those induced by ATP, were dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Alleviating the negative feedback of [Ca2+]i on InsP3Rs using cytochrome c inhibited BK- and ATP-induced oscillations. Cx32 and Cx43 hemichannels are activated by <500 nm [Ca2+]i but inhibited by higher concentrations and CT9 peptide (last 9 amino acids of the Cx43 C terminus) removes this high [Ca2+]i inhibition. Unlike interfering with the bell-shaped dependence of InsP3Rs to [Ca2+]i, CT9 peptide prevented BK-induced oscillations but not those triggered by ATP. Collectively, these data indicate that connexin hemichannels contribute to BK-induced oscillations by allowing Ca2+ entry during the rising phase of the Ca2+ spikes and by providing an OFF mechanism during the falling phase of the spikes. Hemichannels were not sufficient to ignite oscillations by themselves; however, their contribution was crucial as hemichannel inhibition stopped the oscillations.

We demonstrate that, unlike H2O2-stimulated increases in IL-6 mRNA, neither calcimycin- nor EPS-induced IL-6 mRNA expression is under the transcriptional control of NFκB. Rather, we show that EPS increased the phosphorylation of JNK and the reporter activity of the downstream transcription factor AP-1. Furthermore, JNK inhibition abolished the EPS-induced increase in IL-6 mRNA and protein expression. Finally, we observed an exercise-induced increase in both JNK phosphorylation and IL-6 mRNA expression in the skeletal muscles of mice after 30 min of treadmill running. Importantly, exercise did not increase IL-6 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle-specific JNK-deficient mice.

https://openalex.org/W1976550852,"The regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) during endochondral bone formation is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the cross-talk between HIF-1α and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in the growth plate. Runx2 caused the accumulation of HIF-1α protein in ATDC5 chondrocytes and HEK293 cells under normoxic conditions. Runx2 also increased the nuclear translocation of HIF-1α when coexpressed in HEK293 cells and interacted with HIF-1α at the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD). In addition, Runx2 competed with von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein by directly binding to ODDD-HIF-1α and significantly inhibited the ubiquitination of HIF-1α, even though Runx2 did not change the hydroxylation status of HIF-1α. Furthermore, overexpression of Runx2 resulted in the significant enhancement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter reporter activity and protein secretion. Runx2 significantly increased angiogenic activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. In wild-type mice, HIF-1α and Runx2 were colocalized in hypertrophic chondrocytes in which the cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) protein was expressed at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5). In contrast, the expression of HIF-1α was markedly reduced in areas of CD31 expression in Runx2(-/-) mice. These results suggest that Runx2 stabilizes HIF-1α by binding to ODDD to block the interaction between von Hippel-Lindau protein and HIF-1α. In conclusion, Runx2, HIF-1α, and VEGF may regulate vascular angiogenesis spatially and temporally in the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate during endochondral bone formation."

https://openalex.org/W1964660710,"Background Colombia and Brazil are affected by severe cases of scorpionism. In Colombia the most dangerous accidents are caused by Tityus pachyurus that is widely distributed around this country. In the Brazilian Amazonian region scorpion stings are a common event caused by Tityus obscurus. The main objective of this work was to perform the molecular cloning of the putative Na+-channel scorpion toxins (NaScTxs) from T. pachyurus and T. obscurus venom glands and to analyze their phylogenetic relationship with other known NaScTxs from Tityus species. Methodology/Principal Findings cDNA libraries from venom glands of these two species were constructed and five nucleotide sequences from T. pachyurus were identified as putative modulators of Na+-channels, and were named Tpa4, Tpa5, Tpa6, Tpa7 and Tpa8; the latter being the first anti-insect excitatory β-class NaScTx in Tityus scorpion venom to be described. Fifteen sequences from T. obscurus were identified as putative NaScTxs, among which three had been previously described, and the others were named To4 to To15. The peptides Tpa4, Tpa5, Tpa6, To6, To7, To9, To10 and To14 are closely related to the α-class NaScTxs, whereas Tpa7, Tpa8, To4, To8, To12 and To15 sequences are more related to the β-class NaScTxs. To5 is possibly an arthropod specific toxin. To11 and To13 share sequence similarities with both α and β NaScTxs. By means of phylogenetic analysis using the Maximum Parsimony method and the known NaScTxs from Tityus species, these toxins were clustered into 14 distinct groups. Conclusions/Significance This communication describes new putative NaScTxs from T. pachyurus and T. obscurus and their phylogenetic analysis. The results indicate clear geographic separation between scorpions of Tityus genus inhabiting the Amazonian and Mountain Andes regions and those distributed over the Southern of the Amazonian rainforest. Based on the consensus sequences for the different clusters, a new nomenclature for the NaScTxs is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2060005696,"The present experiment tested three hypotheses regarding the function and organization of lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). The first account (the information cascade hypothesis) suggests that the anterior-posterior organization of lateral PFC is based on the timing with which cue stimuli reduce uncertainty in the action selection process. The second account (the levels-of-abstraction hypothesis) suggests that the anterior-posterior organization of lateral PFC is based on the degree of abstraction of the task goals. The current study began by investigating these two hypotheses, and identified several areas of lateral PFC that were predicted to be active by both the information cascade and levels-of-abstraction accounts. However, the pattern of activation across experimental conditions was inconsistent with both theoretical accounts. Specifically, an anterior area of mid-dorsolateral PFC exhibited sensitivity to experimental conditions that, according to both accounts, should have selectively engaged only posterior areas of PFC. We therefore investigated a third possible account (the adaptive context maintenance hypothesis) that postulates that both posterior and anterior regions of PFC are reliably engaged in task conditions requiring active maintenance of contextual information, with the temporal dynamics of activity in these regions flexibly tracking the duration of maintenance demands. Activity patterns in lateral PFC were consistent with this third hypothesis: regions across lateral PFC exhibited transient activation when contextual information had to be updated and maintained in a trial-by-trial manner, but sustained activation when contextual information had to be maintained over a series of trials. These findings prompt a reconceptualization of current views regarding the anterior-posterior organization of lateral PFC, but do support other findings regarding the active maintenance role of lateral PFC in sequential working memory paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W2074951455,"The explosive epidemicity of amoebiasis caused by the facultative gastrointestinal protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica is a major public health problem in developing countries. Multidrug resistance and side effects of various available antiamoebic drugs necessitate the design of novel antiamobeic agents. The cysteine biosynthetic pathway is the critical target for drug design due to its significance in the growth, survival and other cellular activities of E. histolytica. Here, we have screened 0.15 million natural compounds from the ZINC database against the active site of the EhOASS enzyme (PDB ID. 3BM5, 2PQM), whose structure we previously determined to 2.4 Å and 1.86 Å resolution. For this purpose, the incremental construction algorithm of GLIDE and the genetic algorithm of GOLD were used. We analyzed docking results for top ranking compounds using a consensus scoring function of X-Score to calculate the binding affinity and using ligplot to measure protein-ligand interactions. Fifteen compounds that possess good inhibitory activity against EhOASS active site were identified that may act as potential high affinity inhibitors. In vitro screening of a few commercially available compounds established their biological activity. The first ranked compound ZINC08931589 had a binding affinity of ∼8.05 µM and inhibited about 73% activity at 0.1 mM concentration, indicating good correlation between in silico prediction and in vitro inhibition studies. This compound is thus a good starting point for further development of strong inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2087078313,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome harbors an unusually large number of toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules. Curiously, over half of these are VapBC (virulence-associated protein) family members. Nonetheless, the cellular target, precise mode of action, and physiological role of the VapC toxins in this important pathogen remain unclear. To better understand the function of this toxin family, we studied the features and biochemical properties of a prototype M. tuberculosis VapBC TA system, vapBC-mt4 (Rv0596c-Rv0595c). VapC-mt4 expression resulted in growth arrest, a hallmark of all TA toxins, in Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and M. tuberculosis. Its expression led to translation inhibition accompanied by a gradual decrease in the steady-state levels of several mRNAs. VapC-mt4 exhibited sequence-specific endoribonuclease activity on mRNA templates at ACGC and AC(A/U)GC sequences. However, the cleavage activity of VapC-mt4 was comparatively weak relative to the TA toxin MazF-mt1 (Rv2801c). Unlike other TA toxins, translation inhibition and growth arrest preceded mRNA cleavage, suggesting that the RNA binding property of VapC-mt4, not RNA cleavage, initiates toxicity. In support of this hypothesis, expression of VapC-mt4 led to an increase in the recovery of total RNA with time in contrast to TA toxins that inhibit translation via direct mRNA cleavage. Additionally, VapC-mt4 exhibited stable, sequence-specific RNA binding in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Finally, VapC-mt4 inhibited protein synthesis in a cell-free system without cleaving the corresponding mRNA. Therefore, the activity of VapC-mt4 is mechanistically distinct from other TA toxins because it appears to primarily inhibit translation through selective, stable binding to RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2156366033,"The multimeric scaffolding protein gephyrin forms post-synaptic clusters at inhibitory sites, thereby anchoring inhibitory glycine (GlyR) and subsets of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. Gephyrin is composed of three domains, the conserved N-terminal G- and C-terminal E-domain, connected by the central (C-) domain. In this study we investigated the oligomerization, folding and stability, GlyR β-loop binding, and phosphorylation of three gephyrin splice variants (Geph, Geph-C3, Geph-C4) after expression and purification from insect cells (Sf9). In contrast to Escherichia coli-derived trimeric gephyrin, we found that Sf9 gephyrins form hexamers as basic oligomeric form. In the case of Geph and Geph-C4, also high-oligomeric forms (∼900 kDa) were isolated. Partial proteolysis revealed a compact folding of the Gephyrin G and C domain in one complex, whereas a much lower stability for the E domain was found. After GlyR β-loop binding, the stability of the E domain increased in Geph and Geph-C4 significantly. In contrast, the E domain in Geph-C3 is less stable and binds the GlyR β-loop with one order of magnitude lower affinity. Finally, we identified 18 novel phosphorylation sites in gephyrin, of which all except one are located within the C domain. We propose two models for the domain arrangement in hexameric gephyrin based on the oligomerization of either the E or C domains, with the latter being crucial for the regulation of gephyrin clustering."
https://openalex.org/W1968528634,"During development, Dlx3 is expressed in ectodermal appendages such as hair and teeth. Thus far, the evidence that Dlx3 plays a crucial role in tooth development comes from reports showing that autosomal dominant mutations in DLX3 result in severe enamel and dentin defects leading to abscesses and infections. However, the normal function of DLX3 in odontogenesis remains unknown. Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate that the absence of Dlx3 in the neural crest results in major impairment of odontoblast differentiation and dentin production. Mutant mice develop brittle teeth with hypoplastic dentin and molars with an enlarged pulp chamber and underdeveloped roots. Using this mouse model, we found that dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp), a major component of the dentin matrix, is strongly down-regulated in odontoblasts lacking Dlx3. Using ChIP-seq, we further demonstrate the direct binding of Dlx3 to the Dspp promoter in vivo. Luciferase reporter assays determined that Dlx3 positively regulates Dspp expression. This establishes a regulatory pathway where the transcription factor Dlx3 is essential in dentin formation by directly regulating a crucial matrix protein."
https://openalex.org/W2006212129,"Species of the genus Aeromonas are native inhabitants of aquatic environments and have recently been considered emerging human pathogens. Although the gastrointestinal tract is by far the most common anatomic site from which aeromonads are recovered, their role as etiologic agents of bacterial diarrhea is still disputed. Aeromonas-associated diarrhea is a phenomenon occurring worldwide; however, the exact prevalence of Aeromonas infections on a global scale is unknown.The prevalence and virulence potential of Aeromonas in patients suffering from diarrhea in Israel was studied using molecular methods. 1,033 diarrheal stools were sampled between April and September 2010 and Aeromonas species were identified in 17 (∼2%) patients by sequencing the rpoD gene. Aeromonas species identity and abundance was: A. caviae (65%), A. veronii (29%) and Aeromonas taiwanensis (6%). This is the first clinical record of A. taiwanensis as a diarrheal causative since its recent discovery from a wound infection in a patient in Taiwan. Most of the patients (77%) from which Aeromonas species were isolated were negative for any other pathogens. The patients ranged from 1 to 92 years in age. Aeromonas isolates were found to possess different virulence-associated genes: ahpB (88%), pla/lip/lipH3/apl-1 (71%), act/hlyA/aerA (35%), alt (18%), ast (6%), fla (65%), lafA (41%), TTSS ascV (12%), TTSS ascF-ascG (12%), TTSS-dependent ADP-ribosylating toxins aexU (41%) and aexT (6%) in various combinations. Most of the identified strains were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics but susceptible to third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics.Aeromonas may be a causative agent of diarrhea in patients in Israel and therefore should be included in routine bacteriological screenings."
https://openalex.org/W2048721534,"p38 MAPK has been strongly implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, but its role in cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages and formation of foam cells, an early step in the development of atherosclerosis, has not been investigated. We addressed this issue and made some brand new observations. First, elevated intracellular cholesterol level induced by the exposure to LDL-activated p38 MAPK and activation of p38 MAPK with anisomycin increased the ratio of cholesterol esters over free cholesterol, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 or siRNA reduced the LDL loading-induced intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol and cholesterol esters in macrophages. Second, exposure to LDL cholesterol inhibited autophagy in macrophages, and inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine increased intracellular accumulation of cholesterol (free cholesterol and cholesterol esters), whereas activation of autophagy with rapamycin decreased intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol and cholesterol esters induced by the exposure to LDL cholesterol. Third, LDL cholesterol loading-induced inhibition of autophagy was prevented by blockade of p38 MAPK with SB203580 or siRNA. Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase was co-localized with autophagosomes. Finally, LDL cholesterol loading and p38 activation suppressed expression of the key autophagy gene, ulk1, in macrophages. Together, our results provide brand new insight about cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages and foam cell formation."
https://openalex.org/W2088697866,"Glypicans are a family of cell-surface proteoglycans that regulate Wnt, hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein, and fibroblast growth factor signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in glypican core proteins and in glycosaminoglycan-synthesizing enzymes have revealed that glypican core proteins and their glycosaminoglycan chains are important in shaping animal development. Glypican core proteins consist of a stable α-helical domain containing 14 conserved Cys residues followed by a glycosaminoglycan attachment domain that becomes exclusively substituted with heparan sulfate (HS) and presumably adopts a random coil conformation. Removal of the α-helical domain results in almost exclusive addition of the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate, suggesting that factors in the α-helical domain promote assembly of HS. Glypican-1 is involved in brain development and is one of six members of the vertebrate family of glypicans. We expressed and crystallized N-glycosylated human glypican-1 lacking HS and N-glycosylated glypican-1 lacking the HS attachment domain. The crystal structure of glypican-1 was solved using crystals of selenomethionine-labeled glypican-1 core protein lacking the HS domain. No additional electron density was observed for crystals of glypican-1 containing the HS attachment domain, and CD spectra of the two protein species were highly similar. The crystal structure of N-glycosylated human glypican-1 core protein at 2.5 Å, the first crystal structure of a vertebrate glypican, reveals the complete disulfide bond arrangement of the conserved Cys residues, and it also extends the structural knowledge of glypicans for one α-helix and two long loops. Importantly, the loops are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrate glypican-1, and one of them is involved in glycosaminoglycan class determination."
https://openalex.org/W2087448760,"Evidence that infectious diseases cause wildlife population extirpation or extinction remains anecdotal and it is unclear whether the impacts of a pathogen at the individual level can scale up to population level so drastically. Here, we quantify the response of a Common eider colony to emerging epidemics of avian cholera, one of the most important infectious diseases affecting wild waterfowl. We show that avian cholera has the potential to drive colony extinction, even over a very short period. Extinction depends on disease severity (the impact of the disease on adult female survival) and disease frequency (the number of annual epidemics per decade). In case of epidemics of high severity (i.e., causing >30% mortality of breeding females), more than one outbreak per decade will be unsustainable for the colony and will likely lead to extinction within the next century; more than four outbreaks per decade will drive extinction to within 20 years. Such severity and frequency of avian cholera are already observed, and avian cholera might thus represent a significant threat to viability of breeding populations. However, this will depend on the mechanisms underlying avian cholera transmission, maintenance, and spread, which are currently only poorly known."
https://openalex.org/W2028080161,"Here, Drs2p, a yeast lipid translocase that belongs to the family of P(4)-type ATPases, was overexpressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae together with Cdc50p, its glycosylated partner, as a result of the design of a novel co-expression vector. The resulting high yield allowed us, using crude membranes or detergent-solubilized membranes, to measure the formation from [γ-(32)P]ATP of a (32)P-labeled transient phosphoenzyme at the catalytic site of Drs2p. Formation of this phosphoenzyme could be detected only if Cdc50p was co-expressed with Drs2p but was not dependent on full glycosylation of Cdc50p. It was inhibited by orthovanadate and fluoride compounds. In crude membranes, the phosphoenzyme formed at steady state at 4 °C displayed ADP-insensitive but temperature-sensitive decay. Solubilizing concentrations of dodecyl maltoside left this decay rate almost unaltered, whereas several other detergents accelerated it. Unexpectedly, the dephosphorylation rate for the solubilized Drs2p·Cdc50p complex was inhibited by the addition of phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine exerted its anticipated accelerating effect on the dephosphorylation of Drs2p·Cdc50p complex only in the additional presence of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. These results explain why phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate tightly controls Drs2p-catalyzed lipid transport and establish the functional relevance of the Drs2p·Cdc50p complex overexpressed here."
https://openalex.org/W2025069371,"Talin, which is composed of head (THD) and rod domains, plays an important role in cell adhesion events in diverse species including most metazoans and Dictyostelium discoideum. Talin is abundant in the cytosol; however, it mediates adhesion by associating with integrins in the plasma membrane where it forms a primary link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Cells modulate the partitioning of talin between the plasma membrane and the cytosol to control cell adhesion. Here, we combine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with subcellular fractionation to characterize two distinct THD-rod domain interactions that control the interaction of talin with the actin cytoskeleton or its localization to the plasma membrane. An interaction between a discrete vinculin-binding region of the rod (VBS1/2a; Tln1(482–787)), and the THD restrains talin from interacting with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that vinculin binding to VBS1/2a results in talin recruitment to the plasma membrane.

Here we have combined nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with subcellular fractionation to map the THD-rod domain interactions that regulate subcellular localization of talin. We report that THD associates with the plasma membrane to a much greater extent than FL talin. We characterize two distinct THD-rod domain interactions that control the interaction of talin with the actin cytoskeleton or localization to the plasma membrane. We find that five acidic residues within Domain E (Tln1(1655–1822)) of the rod that make electrostatic interactions with the F3 domain of THD (37Goult B.T. Bate N. Anthis N.J. Wegener K.L.

NMR analysis revealed a second inter-domain interaction between THD and a pair of vinculin-binding α-helical bundles in the talin rod termed VBS1/2a (Tln1(482–787)); mutations that disrupt the VBS1/2a-F2F3 interaction led to plasma membrane localization of talin.

HA-tagged mouse THD (Tln1(1–433)) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the mammalian expression pcDNA3-HA vector. cDNAs encoding mouse talin1 truncation mutants 465 (Tln1(1–465)), Tln1(1–787), Tln1(1–1654), Tln1(1–1822), and Tln1(1–2298) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. Each truncation mutant carries a stop codon immediately after the indicated residue number; e.g. Tln1(1–465) has a stop codon at residue 466. Residue numbers correspond to those of NP_035732.2 in the NCBI Protein database. The 5′-primer was designed to introduce an N-terminal HA tag during expression in mammalian cells. Deletion of Domain E (Tln1(1655–1822)) in FL talin was introduced by PCR using a fragment of FL talin flanked by PmlI restriction enzyme sites as a template. When the deletion was confirmed, the PmlI fragment carrying the Domain E deletion was ligated back into the PmlI site of FL talin to produce FL ΔE.

Point mutation in VinHD-A50I was introduced using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene with VinHD as a template and with mutagenic primers.

A5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum. A5 cells, transiently transfected with the indicated cDNAs for 24 h, were subjected to subcellular fractionation as described before (17Han J. Lim C.J. Watanabe N. Soriani A. Ratnikov B.

In brief, cells were harvested in fractionation buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, and Complete mini protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Bioscience)) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Swollen cells were disrupted by shearing through 27-gauge needles, and a fraction of the total cell lysate was saved for analysis of total protein expression. The remaining lysates were centrifuged at 425 × g for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge model 5417R to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,817 × g for 30 min to precipitate the membrane- and cytoskeleton-containing fraction, denoted here as “high-speed pellet.” The high-speed pellet was washed and then solubilized in fractionation buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 on ice. Each sample was then mixed with 5× sample buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 95 ºC for 5 min. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), and expression of talin in total lysates, cytosolic, and high-speed pellet fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Integrin αIIb-specific Rb2308 and anti-RhoGDI antibodies were used as membrane and cytosolic markers, respectively. The bands corresponding to the high-speed pellet and cytosolic fractions were scanned and quantified with Odyssey infrared imaging system from Li-Cor Biosciences, and represented as percent of total (cytosolic + high-speed pellet). Twenty four h after transfection with the indicated cDNAs, A5 cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA/PBS and subjected to surface biotinylation with 3 mm EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, for 30 min. Cells were then washed extensively with PBS and subjected to subcellular fractionation as described above. The sedimented high-speed pellet was then resuspended in fractionation buffer and incubated with BcMagTM Streptavidin Magnetic Beads (Bioclone Inc., San Diego, CA) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. The beads were magnetically captured and washed to separate the plasma membrane from intracellular organelle membranes. Whole cell, nuclear/intact cell, cytosolic, high-speed pellet, and plasma membrane fractions (WCL, N/IC, C, P, and PM, respectively) were saved for subsequent Western blot analysis. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels, and expression of recombinant HA-talin in each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Endogenous FL talin was detected with anti-talin 8D4 antibody. RIAM176-CAAX was detected by anti-GFP antibody. Integrin αIIb-specific Rb2308, anti-calnexin, anti-lamin A/C, anti-LAMP1, and anti-RhoGDI antibodies were used as plasma membrane, ER membrane, nuclear membrane, lysosomal membrane, and cytosolic markers, respectively. The bands corresponding to talin in each fraction were scanned and quantified with the Odyssey infrared imaging system from Li-Cor Biosciences, and talin associated with the plasma membrane (PM) fraction was represented as percent of total (cytosolic + high-speed pellet). Recombinant DNase I from bovine pancreas (Roche Applied Bioscience) was treated with 2 mm PMSF in fractionation buffer for 1 h prior to use. To depolymerize F-actin, we incubated homogenized cell lysates with DNase I at a final concentration of 3 mg/ml for 2 h (48Painter R.G. Gaarde W. Ginsberg M.H.

The specifics of the cross-talk are, however, unclear. In a current model, “ligand occupancy” of αvβ3 (i.e. the binding of extracellular matrix proteins) enhances signaling induced by IGF1 binding to IGF1R. We recently reported that IGF1 directly binds to αvβ3 and induces αvβ3-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation. Consistently, the integrin binding-defective IGF1 mutant (R36E/R37E) is defective in inducing ternary complex formation and IGF signaling, but it still binds to IGF1R. Like αvβ3, integrin α6β4 is overexpressed in many cancers and is implicated in cancer progression. Here, we discovered that α6β4 directly bound to IGF1, but not to R36E/R37E. Grafting the β4 sequence WPNSDP (residues 167–172), which corresponds to the specificity loop of β3, to integrin β1 markedly enhanced IGF1 binding to β1, suggesting that the WPNSDP sequence is involved in IGF1 recognition. WT IGF1 induced α6β4-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation, whereas R36E/R37E did not. When cells were attached to matrix, exogenous IGF1 or α6β4 expression had little or no effect on intracellular signaling. When cell-matrix adhesion was reduced (in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-coated plates), IGF1 induced intracellular signaling and enhanced cell survival in an α6β4-dependent manner. Also IGF1 enhanced colony formation in soft agar in an α6β4-dependent manner. These results suggest that IGF binding to α6β4 plays a major role in IGF signaling in anchorage-independent conditions, which mimic the in vivo environment, and is a novel therapeutic target.

It has been well established that integrin αvβ3 plays a critical role in regulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) 2The abbreviations used are: IGF1insulin-like growth factor-1IGF1RIGF1 receptorpolyHEMApoly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)MTS3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoliumANOVAanalysis of variance. signaling (1Clemmons D.R. Modifying IGF1 activity: an approach to treat endocrine disorders, atherosclerosis, and cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). IGF1 is a polypeptide hormone that has a high degree of structural similarity to human proinsulin. IGF1 acts through binding to the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), a receptor tyrosine kinase. IGF1 is involved in cell growth, and consequently, IGF1 inhibition is being pursued as a potential measure for treating and preventing cancer. Ligand binding induces phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues of IGF1R. These phosphotyrosines then bind to adaptor molecules such as Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1. Phosphorylation of these proteins leads to activation of PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways (2Clemmons D.R. Maile L.A. Interaction between insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor- and αvβ3 integrin-linked signaling pathways: cellular responses to changes in multiple signaling inputs.Mol.

Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Many cancer cells secrete abnormally high levels of IGF1 and IGF2. Once released by cancer cells, both growth factors bind and activate IGF1R on their surface. This autocrine receptor activation causes the release of intracellular signals that are strongly anti-apoptotic, notably through their ability to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. IGF1 thereby confers resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Several strategies to target IGF1 signaling have been developed, including siRNA and monoclonal antibodies for IGF1R and kinase inhibitors to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the receptor (1Clemmons D.R. Modifying IGF1 activity: an approach to treat endocrine disorders, atherosclerosis, and cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In a current model, “ligand occupancy” of αvβ3 (i.e. the binding of extracellular matrix proteins such as vitronectin to αvβ3) enhances signaling induced by IGF1 binding to IGF1R (1Clemmons D.R. Modifying IGF1 activity: an approach to treat endocrine disorders, atherosclerosis, and cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Indeed, antagonists to αvβ3 block IGF1 signaling. Anti-αvβ3 mAb and echistatin, a snake venom disintegrin that specifically inhibits αvβ3, block IGF1-induced cell migration (3Jones J.I. Doerr M.E. Clemmons D.R. Cell migration: interactions among integrins, IGFs and IGFBPs.Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 319-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Also, echistatin blocks IGF1-stimulated DNA synthesis and insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation and attenuates IGF1R-linked downstream signaling events such as activation of PI3K and ERK1/2 (4Zheng B.

We recently discovered that IGF1 directly and specifically binds to αvβ3, and we generated an integrin binding-defective mutant (R36E/R37E) of IGF1 (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 24106-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). R36E/R37E is defective in inducing cell survival and IGF signaling, although the mutant still binds to IGF1R (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y.

This suggests that the direct binding of integrins to IGF1 is critical for IGF signaling and a potential mechanism of integrin-IGF1R cross-talk. In this study, we discovered that another integrin, α6β4, which is overexpressed in many cancers, is involved in IGF1 signaling. We demonstrated that α6β4 directly bound to IGF1, suggesting that this integrin plays a role in cancer progression and invasiveness though IGF signaling. WT IGF1 induced α6β4-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation, but R36E/R37E did not. Notably, we demonstrated that α6β4 mediated IGF signaling in anchorage-independent conditions in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (polyHEMA)-coated plates and in three-dimensional culture in soft agar. These results suggest that IGF signaling requires direct integrin IGF1 interaction in anchorage-independent conditions. Recombinant WT IGF1 and R36E/R37E were synthesized as described (5Saegusa J.

Signaling assays were performed as described above, except that the cells were serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM without FCS. α6β4-CHO or β1-4-1-CHO cells were treated with WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E (100 ng/ml) for 15–30 min. We immunopurified β4 or β1-4-1 with anti-β4 or anti-β1 antibodies from cell lysates and analyzed the immunoprecipitated materials with antibodies specific to IGF1R, β1, or β4 by Western blotting as described above. We immobilized WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E (at a coating concentration of 20 μg/ml) onto wells of 96-well microtiter plates in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and blocked the remaining protein-binding sites by incubation with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Recombinant soluble α6β4 in HEPES/Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mm MnCl2, MgCl2, CaCl2, or EDTA was added to the wells, followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing the wells to remove unbound proteins, we measured bound α6β4 using anti-Velcro antibody, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and a substrate of HRP (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) (6Nishiuchi R.

Swapping the specificity loop of β1 with the corresponding sequence of β4 was performed by site-directed mutagenesis as described (13Takagi J. Isobe T. Takada Y. Saito Y.

We replaced the CTSEQNCTS sequence of β1 (residues 187–195) with WPNSDP and generated -AKLRP(β1)(WPNSDP(β4))(β1)PFSYKN sequence using oligonucleotide 5′-gctaagctcaggaacccttggccaaacagcgaccccccatttagctacaaaaat-3′ (designated the β1-4-1 mutant). The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. We transfected the β1-4-1 mutant in the pBJ-1 vector together with the pFneo vector into CHO cells by electroporation and selected for stable transfectants with G418 as described (13Takagi J.

Soft agar colony formation assays were performed as described previously (14Stephenson J.R. Axelrad A.A. McLeod D.L. Shreeve M.M.

Integrin αvβ3, which is overexpressed in cancer and implicated in cancer progression, directly binds to IGF1, and this interaction plays a role in IGF1 signaling because the integrin binding-defective mutant (R36E/R37E) of IGF1 is defective in inducing intracellular signaling, but it binds to IGF1R (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The direct binding of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to integrin αvβ3 is involved in IGF-1 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24106-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). WT IGF1 induces αvβ3-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation, whereas R36E/R37E is defective in this function, suggesting that direct binding of IGF1 to αvβ3 and subsequent ternary complex formation are critical for IGF signaling. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which are widely used for studying IGF signaling, express little or no αvβ3 (17Doerr M.E. Jones J.I. The roles of integrins and extracellular matrix proteins in the insulin-like growth factor-1-stimulated chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2443-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because α6β4 is overexpressed in many cancer cell types (18Lipscomb E.A. Mercurio A.M. Mobilization and activation of a signaling-competent α6β4 integrin underlies its contribution to carcinoma progression.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2005; 24: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), like αvβ3, we hypothesized that α6β4 is involved in IGF signaling in this cell type. To determine whether integrin α6β4 directly interacts with IGF1, we used CHO cells expressing human α6β4 (designated α6β4-CHO cells) by cotransfecting human α6 and β4. Cells stably expressing α6β4 were cloned to obtain high expressers. The α6β4-CHO cells we used clonally expressed human α6 and β4 (Fig. 1a). We discovered that α6β4-CHO cells adhered to IGF1 better than β1-CHO cells (Fig. 1b). We confirmed that WT IGF1 and R36E/R37E (both His6-tagged) were coated onto plastic at an equal density using anti-His5 tag antibody (data not shown). Interestingly, α6β4-CHO cells did not adhere to R36E/R37E, suggesting that α6β4 binds to IGF1 in a manner similar to αvβ3 (Fig. 1c). Because antibodies against α6 (G0H3) and β4 (439-9B) did not effectively block adhesion of α6β4-CHO cells to IGF1 (data not shown), we tested if recombinant soluble α6β4 bound to IGF1 in ELISA-type assays. The soluble α6β4 we used contains only the extracellular domains of α6 and β4 and has been purified to homogeneity (6Nishiuchi R. Takagi J. Hayashi M. Ido H. Yagi Y. Sanzen N. Tsuji T. Yamada M. Sekiguchi K. Ligand-binding specificities of laminin-binding integrins: a comprehensive survey of laminin-integrin interactions using recombinant α3β1, α6β1, α7β1, and α6β4 integrins.Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We found that soluble α6β4 bound to IGF1, but not well to R36E/R37E (Fig. 1d). Because only purified soluble α6β4 and IGF1 were present in the assay system, we concluded that α6β4 directly interacts with IGF1. We also tested if IGF1 is a cation-dependent ligand of α6β4, as are other known integrin ligands. The data suggest that interaction is cation-dependent: manganese, magnesium, and calcium supported the binding in this order, but EDTA did not, suggesting that IGF1 is similar to other known integrin α6β4 ligands in cation requirement. We localized the IGF1-binding site in β4. We previously reported that the disulfide-linked loop in the β3 subunit plays a role in recognizing IGF1 in β3 (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The direct binding of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to integrin αvβ3 is involved in IGF-1 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24106-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The disulfide-linked specificity loop is not present in β4 and is replaced with remnant residues (Fig. 2a) (13Takagi J. Isobe T. Takada Y. Saito Y. Structural interlock between ligand-binding site and stalk-like region of β1 integrin revealed by a monoclonal antibody recognizing conformation-dependent epitope.J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that IGF1 binds to the β4 sequence that corresponds to the specific loop in β3. To test this hypothesis, we generated a β1 mutant in which the CTSEQNCTS sequence of β1 that contains the specificity loop was replaced with the corresponding WPNSDP sequence of β4 (designated the β1-4-1 mutant). The β1-4-1 mutant was stably expressed in CHO cells (designated β1-4-1-CHO cells) and further cloned to obtain high expressers. In β1-CHO and β1-4-1-CHO cells, β1 and β1-4-1 were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 2b). We found that β1-4-1-CHO cells adhered to WT IGF1 at a level comparable with α6β4 (Fig. 1b), and inhibitory anti-human β1 mAb AIIB2 suppressed the adhesion of β1-4-1-CHO cells to WT IGF1 (Fig. 2c). (Note that β1-4-1 is >99% integrin β1.) However, β1-4-1-CHO cells only weakly bound to R36E/R37E (Fig. 2d) using β3-CHO cells as controls. This suggests that the conserved Lys residues at positions 36 and 37 of IGF1 are involved in α6β4 binding, as in αvβ3 binding. These results suggest that the region of β4 that corresponds to the specificity loop is involved in α6β4 binding to WT IGF1. Integrin α6β4 is a receptor for laminins, and thus, it is unclear if α6β4 is involved in IGF1 signaling through direct binding to IGF1, indirectly through adhesion to the extracellular matrix, or both. We studied the effect of IGF stimulation in CHO cells in regular tissue culture conditions. IGF1 induced ERK1/2 activation in α6β4-CHO and CHO cells to a similar extent (Fig. 3a), and the effect of the R36E/R37E mutation on IGF1-induced ERK1/2 activation was not clear (Fig. 3b). Also, the effect of R36E/R37E on IGF1-induced cell survival was not clear (Fig. 3c). This is in contrast to IGF signaling in non-transformed cells (e.g. NIH 3T3 and C2C12), in which IGF1 induced robust intracellular signaling, and the effect of the R36E/R37E mutation was detected (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The direct binding of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to integrin αvβ3 is involved in IGF-1 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24106-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been reported that cell-matrix adhesion masks growth factor signaling in cancer cells (19Mizushima H. Wang X. Miyamoto S. Mekada E. Integrin signal masks growth promotion activity of HB-EGF in monolayer cell cultures.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 4277-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that IGF signaling in regular tissue culture conditions is not dependent on α6β4 expression, but may be dependent on α6β4-IGF interaction in anchorage-independent conditions in CHO cells. To address this hypothesis, we studied IGF signaling in CHO cell lines in polyHEMA-coated plates, which have been widely used to suppress cell-matrix adhesion (12Fukazawa H. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. A microplate assay for quantitation of anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells.Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Folkman J. Moscona A. Role of cell shape in growth control.Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). We detected the effect of α6β4 expression on IGF signaling in polyHEMA-coated plates: WT IGF1 induced ERK1/2 and AKT activation in α6β4-CHO cells in polyHEMA-coated plates, whereas WT IGF1 induced only weak ERK1/2 and AKT activation and the signals were quickly reduced in β1-CHO cells (Fig. 4a) and parent CHO cells (supplemental Fig. S1). WT IGF1 enhanced cell survival in α6β4-CHO cells, whereas it had a negligible effect on cell survival in CHO and β1-CHO cells (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that IGF signaling is dependent on α6β4 expression in polyHEMA-coated plates, but not in regular tissue culture conditions. We found that WT IGF1 induced coprecipitation of IGF1R and integrin β4 in α6β4-CHO cells, whereas R36E/R37E was much less effective in this function (Fig. 4c). This suggests that α6β4 binding to IGF1 is involved in the ternary complex formation in α6β4-CHO cells in a manner that is similar to αvβ3 (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The direct binding of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to integrin αvβ3 is involved in IGF-1 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24106-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the idea that integrin α6β4 is involved in IGF signaling. Although β1-4-1-CHO cells adhered to IGF1 much better than β1-CHO cells (at a level comparable with α6β4-CHO cells), it is unclear if the ability of β1-4-1-CHO cells to bind to IGF1 has any effect on IGF1 signaling. We found that IGF1 induced stronger ERK1/2 and AKT activation in β1-4-1-CHO cells than in β1-CHO cells in polyHEMA-coated plates (Fig. 5a). Also, IGF1 enhanced cell survival in β1-4-1-CHO cells, but only weakly in β1-CHO cells in polyHEMA-coated plates (Fig. 5b). Anti-β1 mAb AIIB2 suppressed IGF1-induced cell survival of β1-4-1-CHO cells, suggesting that IGF1-induced signaling is specific to β1-4-1 (Fig. 5c). Also, WT IGF1 induced coprecipitation of β1-4-1 and IGF1R, whereas R36E/R37E was defective in this function (Fig. 5d). Thus, the ability of β1-4-1 to bind to IGF1 is directly related to enhanced IGF signaling. These results suggest that β1-4-1 mimics β4 in IGF1 binding and signaling and that grafting the WPNSDP sequence of β4 to β1 dramatically changes the phenotype of β1. Because the β1-4-1 mutant does not contain the long cytoplasmic domain of β4, it is likely that the β1 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for mediating IGF signaling. Our results so far suggested that the contribution of integrin α6β4 to IGF signaling in regular tissue culture is masked by massive signals from cell adhesion and detected in polyHEMA-coated plates, which suppress cell adhesion. It was still unclear if direct integrin binding to IGF1 is involved in IGF signaling in three-dimensional culture, which mimics in vivo cell growth. To address this question, we tested if WT IGF1 and R36E/R37E affect the growth of CHO cells in soft agar. Parent CHO cells do not express α6β4 and are therefore suitable for testing the role of this integrin in IGF signaling. We stably expressed WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E in α6β4-CHO or CHO cells in the pSec-TagB secretion vector. Transfected cells secreted WT IGF1 and R36E/R37E at comparable levels (Fig. 6a). We used cells stably secreting WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E without further selection. The cells were cultured in soft agar for 3 weeks, and the number of colonies was counted. We found that WT IGF1 markedly enhanced colony formation in α6β4-CHO cells (Fig. 6b), but not in CHO cells (Fig. 6c). These findings suggest that the enhancing effect of WT IGF1 is dependent on α6β4 expression in three-dimensional culture. We used CHO cells to study the role of integrins in IGF signaling. CHO cells express IGF1R, but do not express αvβ3 or α6β4. CHO cells only weakly respond to WT IGF1 in anchorage-independent conditions, but CHO cells that express αvβ3 (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The direct binding of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to integrin αvβ3 is involved in IGF-1 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24106-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or α6β4 (this study) robustly respond to WT IGF1. However, the contribution of integrins to IGF signaling may be specific to CHO cells. We thus tested if integrin binding to IGF1 is involved in anchorage-independent cell growth in MCF-7 cells and Met-1 mouse breast cancer cells. We found that WT IGF1 markedly enhanced colony formation in MCF-7 (Fig. 6d) and Met-1 (Fig. 6e) cells in soft agar, whereas the integrin binding-defective R36E/R37E mutant did not. Thus, these results suggest that direct binding of integrins to IGF1 is critical for IGF signaling in these cells in anchorage-independent conditions, whereas it is unclear which integrins are involved in these cells at this poin"
https://openalex.org/W2001349029,"Amyloid fibrils contained in semen, known as SEVI, or semen-derived enhancer of viral infection, have been shown to increase the infectivity of HIV dramatically. However, previous work with these fibrils has suggested that extensive time and nonphysiologic levels of agitation are necessary to induce amyloid formation from the precursor peptide (a proteolytic cleavage product of prostatic acid phosphatase, PAP(248-286)). Here, we show that fibril formation by PAP(248-286) is accelerated dramatically in the presence of seminal plasma (SP) and that agitation is not required for fibrillization in this setting. Analysis of the effects of specific SP components on fibril formation by PAP(248-286) revealed that this effect is primarily due to the anionic buffer components of SP (notably inorganic phosphate and sodium bicarbonate). Divalent cations present in SP had little effect on the kinetics of fibril formation, but physiologic levels of Zn(2+) strongly protected SEVI fibrils from degradation by seminal proteases. Taken together, these data suggest that in the in vivo environment, PAP(248-286) is likely to form fibrils efficiently, thus providing an explanation for the presence of SEVI in human semen."

We have examined whether glutathionylation depends on the conformational changes in the Na+-K+ pump cycle as described by the Albers-Post scheme. We measured β1 subunit glutathionylation and function of Na+-K+-ATPase in membrane fragments and in ventricular myocytes.

Inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity after exposure to ONOO− was greater when the enzyme had been in the E1Na3 than the E2 conformation. We exposed myocytes to different extracellular K+ concentrations to vary the membrane potential and hence voltage-dependent conformational poise. K+ concentrations expected to shift the poise toward E2 species reduced glutathionylation, and ouabain eliminated a ONOO−-induced increase.

https://openalex.org/W2072467567,"DNA Polymerase δ (Pol δ) and the Werner syndrome protein, WRN, are involved in maintaining cellular genomic stability. Pol δ synthesizes the lagging strand during replication of genomic DNA and also functions in the synthesis steps of DNA repair and recombination. WRN is a member of the RecQ helicase family, loss of which results in the premature aging and cancer-prone disorder, Werner syndrome. Both Pol δ and WRN encode 3' → 5' DNA exonuclease activities. Pol δ exonuclease removes 3'-terminal mismatched nucleotides incorporated during replication to ensure high fidelity DNA synthesis. WRN exonuclease degrades DNA containing alternate secondary structures to prevent formation and enable resolution of stalled replication forks. We now observe that similarly to WRN, Pol δ degrades alternate DNA structures including bubbles, four-way junctions, and D-loops. Moreover, WRN and Pol δ form a complex with enhanced ability to hydrolyze these structures. We also present evidence that WRN can proofread for Pol δ; WRN excises 3'-terminal mismatches to enable primer extension by Pol δ. Consistent with our in vitro observations, we show that WRN contributes to the maintenance of DNA synthesis fidelity in vivo. Cells expressing limiting amounts (∼10% of normal) of WRN have elevated mutation frequencies compared with wild-type cells. Together, our data highlight the importance of WRN exonuclease activity and its cooperativity with Pol δ in preserving genome stability, which is compromised by the loss of WRN in Werner syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2130223518,"Regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2) is a GTPase-activating protein for G(q/11)α and G(i/o)α subunits. RGS2 deficiency is linked to hypertension in mice and humans, although causative mechanisms are not understood. Because endothelial dysfunction and increased peripheral resistance are hallmarks of hypertension, determining whether RGS2 regulates microvascular reactivity may reveal mechanisms relevant to cardiovascular disease. Here we have determined the effects of systemic versus endothelium- or vascular smooth muscle-specific deletion of RGS2 on microvascular contraction and relaxation. Contraction and relaxation of mesenteric resistance arteries were analyzed in response to phenylephrine, sodium nitroprusside, or acetylcholine with or without inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase or K(+) channels that mediate endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-dependent relaxation. The results showed that deleting RGS2 in vascular smooth muscle had minor effects. Systemic or endothelium-specific deletion of RGS2 strikingly inhibited acetylcholine-evoked relaxation. Endothelium-specific deletion of RGS2 had little effect on NO-dependent relaxation but markedly impaired EDHF-dependent relaxation. Acute, inducible deletion of RGS2 in endothelium did not affect blood pressure significantly. Impaired EDHF-mediated vasodilatation was rescued by blocking G(i/o)α activation with pertussis toxin. These findings indicated that systemic or endothelium-specific RGS2 deficiency causes endothelial dysfunction resulting in impaired EDHF-dependent vasodilatation. RGS2 deficiency enables endothelial G(i/o) activity to inhibit EDHF-dependent relaxation, whereas RGS2 sufficiency facilitates EDHF-evoked relaxation by squelching endothelial G(i/o) activity. Mutation or down-regulation of RGS2 in hypertension patients therefore may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and defective EDHF-dependent relaxation. Blunting G(i/o) signaling might improve endothelial function in such patients."

The histidine decarboxylation pathway of Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524 was functionally expressed in the heterologous host Lactococcus lactis NZ9000, and the benefits of the newly acquired pathway for the host were analyzed. During growth in M17 medium in the pH range of 5–6.5, a small positive effect was observed on the biomass yield in batch culture, whereas no growth rate enhancement was evident. In contrast, a strong benefit for the engineered L. lactis strain was observed in acid stress survival. In the presence of histidine, the pathway enabled cells to survive at pH values as low as 3 for at least 2 h, conditions under which the host cells were rapidly dying. The flux through the histidine decarboxylation pathway in cells grown at physiological pH was under strict control of the electrochemical proton gradient (pmf) across the membrane. Ionophores that dissipated the membrane potential (ΔΨ) and/or the pH gradient (ΔpH) strongly increased the flux, whereas the presence of glucose almost completely inhibited the flux. Control of the pmf over the flux was exerted by both ΔΨ and ΔpH and was distributed over the transporter HdcP and the decarboxylase HdcA. The control allowed for a synergistic effect between the histidine decarboxylation and glycolytic pathways in acid stress survival. In a narrow pH range around 2.5 the synergism resulted in a 10-fold higher survival rate.

In bacteria, decarboxylation of amino acids is part of simple catabolic pathways in which a precursor amino acid is taken up from the medium, decarboxylated in the cytoplasm, and excreted into the medium as its amine derivative. In the decarboxylation reaction, a proton is consumed, and CO2 is released. The precursor uptake and excretion of the product across the membrane is mediated via an exchange mode of transport that is electrogenic. The excreted product carries one more positive charge than the precursor (1Molenaar D. Bosscher J.S. ten Brink B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N.

In Escherichia coli, four amino acid decarboxylation systems involved in acid stress resistance have been described, termed AR2, AR3, AR4, and AR5, constituting glutamate/γ-amino butyric acid, arginine/agmatine, lysine/cadaverine, and ornithine/putrescine pathways, respectively (7Zhao B.

The physiological benefit of the newly acquired pathway for the receiving host, essential for maintenance of the gene cluster, will depend on the metabolic capacity and robustness of the host and the habitat in which the host must survive. Once a function is established, further evolution of the genes and gene cluster will optimize the integration of the pathway in the host organism. Here, we mimic the horizontal gene transfer event, the first step in the successful acquisition of new functionality in this evolutionary process, by introducing the histidine decarboxylation pathway of the yoghurt bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524 (16Calles-Enríquez M.

The gene cluster encoding the pathway consists of the histidine decarboxylase gene hdcA, the histidine/histamine exchanger gene hdcP, and the HdcA maturation factor gene hdcB and is transcribed as one mRNA, thus forming one operon (16Calles-Enríquez M.

Cells were grown at 30 °C in M17 broth supplied with 25 mm glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol unless stated otherwise. For expression of hdcAPB from pNZ-hdcAPB, cells grown to mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.6) were induced by addition of 5 ng/ml nisin and left to grow for another hour. Cells expressing the hdcAPB operon were washed and loaded with 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein as described (30Molenaar D. Abee T. Konings W.N.

B Biol. 1990; 4: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 3,3′-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine was added to the cell suspensions at a concentration of 2 μm, after which the suspension was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C under continuous stirring. Fluorescence was monitored in an SLM Aminco Bowman series 2 spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 625 nm (bandwidth 8) and 690 nm (bandwidth 8), respectively. Cells expressing hdcAPB from pNZ-hdcAPB were washed in 100 mm KPi buffer (pH 5) and resuspended to an A600 of 1 in 100 mm KPi (pH 5.0) unless stated otherwise. At t = 0, l-histidine was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. Glucose was added to 10 mm final concentration unless stated otherwise. Valinomycin, nigericin, and CCCP were added to 1 μm, 1 μm, and 25 μm final concentrations, respectively. Cells were permeabilized by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min prior to the start of the experiment. For experiments at pH values below 5, 100 mm KPi/citrate buffer was used instead of 100 mm KPi. Samples were taken at the indicated time points. Cells were spun down immediately, and the supernatants were incubated at 95 °C to stop any remaining histidine decarboxylation activity. HdcP was expressed from pNZ-hdcP (28Trip H. Mulder N.L. Rattray F.P. Lolkema J.S. HdcB, a novel enzyme catalysing maturation of pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in an L. lactis strain derived from NZ9000, in which the lysQ gene, encoding a histidine transporter, was deleted (unpublished data). Cells were washed twice in 100 mm KPi (pH 6.0) and resuspended to an A600 of 2.0 in 100 mm KPi (pH 6.0). The cells were loaded with histamine by incubation in the presence of 10 mm glucose and 5 mm histamine for 20 min at room temperature, after which the cells were put on ice until use. External histamine was removed by washing the cells three times in 200 mm KPi (pH 6.0). The cells were resuspended to an A600 of 2.0, and 100-μl aliquots were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with constant stirring. At time zero, L-[U-14C]histidine (PerkinElmer) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 μm. Uptake was stopped at t = 10, 30, or 60 s by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m LiCl, followed by filtration through a 0.45-μm-pore size nitrocellulose filter ((BA 85, Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany). The filter was washed once with 2 ml of 0.1 m LiCl and submerged in Emulsifier Scintillator Plus scintillation fluid (Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT), and radioactivity was measured in a Tri-Carb 2000CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instruments). Histamine concentrations were determined in a two enzyme-based fluorimetric assay as described (32Matsumoto T. Furuta T. Nimura Y. Suzuki O. 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid as a new fluorogenic reagent for amine oxidase assays.Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assay mixture contained 100 μl of 0.5 m KPi (pH 7.0), 100 μl of diamine oxidase (0.7 units/ml, from porcine kidney, Sigma), 10 μl of horseradish peroxidase (100 units/ml), 100 μl of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (1 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich), and 190 μl H2O. Aliquots of 100 μl of the supernatant diluted to a concentration within the linear range of the assay (0–75 μm histamine) was added to the assay mixture. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, 2.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH was added. Fluorescence of the oxidation product 2,2′-dihydroxybiphenyl-5,5′-dipropionic acid was measured as emission at 410 nm with excitation at 320 nm (bandwidths 5 nm) using an SLM Aminco Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer. Histamine concentrations were calculated using a standard curve derived from histamine solutions of known concentration. Glucose consumption was measured either directly by measuring the glucose concentration or indirectly by measuring L-lactate produced in the supernatants. Glucose concentrations were measured in a similar assay as described above using glucose oxidase (from Aspergillus niger, type VII, Sigma) instead of diamine oxidase, added to 0.025 units/ml final concentration. Lactate concentrations were determined using an enzymatic assay in which lactate was oxidized by lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of NAD+ to form pyruvate and NADH. A high pH buffer (pH 9) and hydrazine, which reacts with pyruvate to give hydrazone, were used to allow the reaction to run to complete oxidation of lactate. A reaction mix was prepared consisting of 0.5 m glycine and 0.4 m hydrazine sulfate and adjusted to pH 9 with NAOH, to which 2.5 mm NAD+ and 2 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase were added. 20 μl of sample was added to 200 μl of the reaction mix in 96-wells microtiter plates. After 1 h of incubation at 25 °C, NADH was measured at 340 nm. Lactate concentrations were calculated using a standard curve derived from lactate solutions of known concentration (0–2 mm). Cells were grown to stationary phase (pNZ-PhdcAPB) or to A600 = 0.6 and induced for 1 h with nisin (pNZ-hdcAPB and pNZ-hdcAS82-PB). Following harvesting and washing, cells were resuspended in M17 medium containing 10 mm glucose and 10 mm histidine as indicated and adjusted to the desired pH using HCl as indicated. The suspensions were incubated for the indicated time, after which cell survival was determined by plating 10 μl droplets of serial dilutions of samples on GM17 medium and counting colonies after overnight incubation at 30 °C. The histidine decarboxylation gene cluster of S. thermophilus CHCC1524, encoding histidine decarboxylase HdcA, the histidine/histamine exchanger HdcP, and the HdcA maturation enzyme HdcB, was functionally expressed in L. lactis NZ9000. Resting cells expressing the pathway were resuspended at an A600 of 1.0 in 100 mm potassium phosphate (KPi) (pH 5.0) buffer. In the presence of 5 mm histidine, the cells produced histamine at a constant rate of ∼18 μm/min for at least 40 min (Fig. 1A). The histidine decarboxylation pathway generates pmf by electrogenic histidine/histamine exchange (membrane potential, ΔΨ), catalyzed by HdcP and proton consumption in the decarboxylation of histidine in the cytoplasm (pH gradient, ΔpH) by HdcA. The observed flux through the pathway generated a pH gradient of 0.5 units as measured by the increase of the internal pH monitored by the fluorescent probe 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (Fig. 2A) and a significant membrane potential reported by the fluorescent probe 3,3′-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine (Fig. 2B). In the presence of 25 μm of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) that completely dissipated both components of the pmf (not shown), a 3- to 4-fold increase in histamine production rate was observed (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in the presence of 10 mm glucose, which resulted in a significantly higher pH gradient of 1 unit (Fig. 2A), the histamine production rate decreased 4-fold (Fig. 1A). The opposite effects of CCCP and glucose on the histamine production rates demonstrate that under the conditions of the experiment, the flux through the histidine decarboxylation pathway is under control of the electrochemical proton gradient. The two components of the pmf may affect different parts of the pathway. The membrane potential ΔΨ may affect the exchanger HdcP, and the pH gradient ΔpH may affect both HdcP and the decarboxylase HdcA, the latter indirectly via changes in the cytoplasmic pH. Valinomycin is a K+-ionophore that selectively dissipates ΔΨ in high K+-buffers (Fig. 2B). In the presence of 1 μm valinomycin, the rate of histamine production by resting cells of L. lactis expressing the HDC pathway in 200 mm KPi (pH 5) buffer containing 5 mm histidine increased almost 2-fold (Fig. 1B). When instead of valinomycin 1 μm of nigericin, a K+/H+ exchanging ionophore that selectively dissipates ΔpH (Fig. 2A), was included, the histamine production rate increased ∼3.5-fold. Adding both ionophores at the same time, which dissipates the complete pmf, resulted in an even higher rate of histamine production that was comparable with the rate in the presence of the protonophore CCCP (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the effects of valinomycin and nigericin were additive. The results show that dissipation of both components of the pmf, i.e. membrane"

Because the phosphatidylinositol 5'-phosphatase OCRL dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P(2) and to a lesser extent PI(3,4,5)P(3), we investigated whether this phosphatase modulates cell invasion by L. monocytogenes. Inactivation of OCRL by small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to an increase in the internalization levels of L. monocytogenes in HeLa cells. Interestingly, OCRL depletion does not increase but rather decreases the surface expression of the receptor Met, suggesting that OCRL controls bacterial internalization by modulating signaling cascades downstream of Met. Immuno-fluorescence microscopy reveals that endogenous and overexpressed OCRL are present at L. monocytogenes invasion foci; live-cell imaging additionally shows that actin depolymerization coincides with EGFP-OCRL-a accumulation around invading bacteria. Together, these observations suggest that OCRL promotes actin depolymerization during L. monocytogenes infection; in agreement with this hypothesis, OCRL depletion leads to an increase in actin, PI(4,5)P(2), and PI(3,4,5)P(3) levels at bacterial internalization foci. Furthermore, in cells knocked down for OCRL, transfection of enzymatically active EGFP-OCRL-a (but not of a phosphatase-dead enzyme) decreases the levels of intracellular L. monocytogenes and of actin associated with invading bacteria. These results demonstrate that through its phosphatase activity, OCRL restricts L. monocytogenes invasion by modulating actin dynamics at bacterial internalization sites."

The mechanisms underlying ACTN4 mutant-associated FSGS are not completely understood. Although α-actinins are better known to cross-link actin filaments and modulate cytoskeletal organization, we have previously shown that ACTN4 interacts with transcription factors including estrogen receptor and MEF2s and potentiates their transcriptional activity. Nuclear receptors including retinoic acid receptor (RAR) have been proposed to play a protective role in podocytes. We show here that ACTN4 interacts with and enhances transcriptional activation by RARα. In addition, FSGS-linked ACTN4 mutants not only mislocalized to the cytoplasm, but also lost their ability to associate with nuclear receptors. Consequently, FSGS-linked ACTN4 mutants failed to potentiate transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptors in podocytes. In addition, overexpression of these mutants suppressed the transcriptional activity mediated by endogenous wild-type ACTN4 possibly by a cytoplasmic sequestration mechanism.

Intracellular myo-inositol is generated by de novo synthesis from glucose 6-phosphate or is provided from the environment via myo-inositol symporters. We show that in Trypanosoma brucei, the causative pathogen of human African sleeping sickness and nagana in domestic animals, myo-inositol is taken up via a specific proton-coupled electrogenic symport and that this transport is essential for parasite survival in culture. Down-regulation of the myo-inositol transporter using RNA interference inhibited uptake of myo-inositol and blocked the synthesis of the myo-inositol-containing phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol and inositol phosphorylceramide; in contrast, it had no effect on glycosylphosphatidylinositol production. This together with the unexpected localization of the myo-inositol transporter in both the plasma membrane and the Golgi demonstrate that metabolism of endogenous and exogenous myo-inositol in T. brucei is strictly segregated."
https://openalex.org/W2007629261,"In most organisms, DNA replication is initiated by DNA primases, which synthesize primers that are elongated by DNA polymerases. In this study, we describe the isolation and biochemical characterization of the DNA primase complex and its subunits from the archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis. The T. kodakaraensis DNA primase complex is a heterodimer containing stoichiometric levels of the p41 and p46 subunits. The catalytic activity of the complex resides within the p41 subunit. We show that the complex supports both DNA and RNA synthesis, whereas the p41 subunit alone marginally produces RNA and synthesizes DNA chains that are longer than those formed by the complex. We report that the T. kodakaraensis primase complex preferentially interacts with dNTP rather than ribonucleoside triphosphates and initiates RNA as well as DNA chains de novo. The latter findings indicate that the archaeal primase complex, in contrast to the eukaryote homolog, can initiate DNA chain synthesis in the absence of ribonucleoside triphosphates. DNA primers formed by the archaeal complex can be elongated extensively by the T. kodakaraensis DNA polymerase (Pol) B, whereas DNA primers formed by the p41 catalytic subunit alone were not.

In general, DNA primases initiate replication by synthesizing small RNA primers on both leading and lagging strands that are used by replicative Pols for subsequent elongation events. In Escherichia coli, DNA primase consists of a single subunit, the DnaG protein, that associates with both the replicative helicase (DnaB) and the replicative Pol (Pol III). In eukaryotes, DNA primase is a heterodimer containing a catalytic p48 subunit that associates tightly with a noncatalytic regulatory subunit (p58), which stabilizes and modulates the activity of the p48 subunit (1.Kuchta R.D. Stengel G. Mechanism and evolution of DNA primases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This heterodimer is found complexed to the other proteins, the Pol α catalytic (180 kDa) and B (70 kDa) subunits, that collectively form the Pol α-primase complex (2.Wang T.S. Eukaryotic DNA polymerases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Typically, in the presence of single-stranded DNA templates, the primase complex synthesizes relatively short oligoribonucleotides 10–15 nucleotides (nt) in length that are elongated by the Pol α complex, generating covalently linked RNA-DNA oligonucleotide chains ∼30–40 nt long (3.Waga S. Stillman B. The DNA replication fork in eukaryotic cells.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). These short chains are recognized by the clamp loader RFC, which loads PCNA onto a primer-template junction that tethers the replicative Pol δ and Pol ϵ, which catalyze the synthesis of lagging and leading strands, respectively (4.Nick McElhinny S.A.

Archaea have been shown to contain both the DnaG and the eukaryotic-type DNA primases. The DnaG-like primase was reported to play a role in RNA degradation rather than DNA replication (5.Walter P.

Biol. 2007; 374: 1172-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The archaeal primase contains a two-subunit structure with significant homology to the eukaryotic p58 and p48 subunits. To date, homologues corresponding to the eukaryotic Pol α (180 kDa) or B subunits have not been detected in archaeal genomes (8.Lao-Sirieix S.H. Pellegrini L. Bell S.D. The promiscuous primase.Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 568-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similar to the eukaryotic primase heterodimer, the archaeal p41 subunit contains DNA primase activity, and the p46 subunit appears to alter its primase activity as well as influence its properties (9.Liu L.

However, the properties of DNA primase complexes isolated from different archaea vary widely. Studies with the heterodimeric DNA primase complex isolated from Pyrococcus furiosus revealed that the catalytic p41 subunit alone preferentially utilized dNTPs and formed DNA chains de novo that were extended up to several kilobases (9.Liu L.

However, the P. furiosus two-subunit p41-p46 complex synthesized shorter DNA chains than the catalytic subunit alone and was also capable of synthesizing RNA chains. Furthermore, in vitro replication of M13 DNA by the P. furiosus complex was stimulated by ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP was reported to start DNA chains (9.Liu L. Komori K. Ishino S. Bocquier A.A. Cann I.K.

In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of the primase complex and its individual subunits from Thermococcus kodakaraensis and show that it initiates oligonucleotide chains de novo from either rNTPs or dNTPs. We show that oligonucleotide chains initiated by the two-subunit primase complex on M13 DNA can be extended to full-length products by T. kodakaraensis PolB. Using a small (200 nt) primed circular DNA, we have devised a rolling circle assay by coupling T. kodakaraensis primase activity with the T. kodakaraensis proteins, PolB, MCM helicase, RFC, and PCNA and demonstrate that this system supports the synthesis of both leading and lagging strands. The genes encoding PolB (TK0001) and the large subunit of primase (PriL, TK1790, p46), the large and small subunits of RFC (RFC-L, TK2219, and RFC-S, TK2218, respectively) were amplified using PCR from the T. kodakaraensis genomic DNA and cloned into pET-21a (Novagen). The gene encoding the small primase subunit (PriS, TK1791, p41) was amplified using PCR from the T. kodakaraensis genomic DNA and cloned into pET-28a (Novagen). All constructs, except for RFC-S, encode proteins containing an in-frame His6 tag at the C terminus. The two inteins found in the gene encoding PolB and the single intein found in the gene encoding RFC-S were removed using the PCR-based approach as described previously (17.Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Melamud E. Kelman Z. Biochemical characterization of the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase N-terminal domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28358-28366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A variant form of PriS in which the conserved Asp-97 and Asp-99 were replaced by Ala (D97A/D99A) was generated using QuikChange (Stratagene). This variant is referred to as mutant (m) p41, and the T. kodakaraensis primase complex (p41-p46) containing this variant is referred to as the mutant complex (m p41-p46). A vector that expressed both subunits of RFC, RFC-L and RFC-S, was generated as follows. A pET-21a vector containing the gene encoding RFC-S was digested with BglII and BamHI, resulting in a fragment that contained the entire coding region and the upstream regulatory sequences (the T7 promoter and the ribosome binding sites). The fragment was cloned into the BglII site on the pET21 construct containing the His-tagged RFC-L. The resulting construct expressed both subunits of RFC, but only the large subunit contained a His6 tag at the C terminus. The cloning of the genes encoding T. kodakaraensis PCNA (TK0535) and MCM (TK1361) proteins was previously described (18.Ladner J.E. Pan M. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z.

Thermococcus kodakarensis encodes three MCM homologs, but only one is essential.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 9671-9680Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For protein expression, plasmids encoding the various proteins were transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 Rosetta cells (Invitrogen). Expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the culture reach an A600 of ∼0.6 followed by incubation for 16 h at 16 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol, and incubated at 55 °C for 30 min, followed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and loaded onto a Ni2+ column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The His6-tagged proteins were eluted from the column with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 250 mm imidazole. Proteins were stored at −80 °C. The purification of PCNA and MCM proteins was previously described (18.Ladner J.E. Pan M. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z.

The PriS-PriL (p41-p46) complex was made as follows. Thirty mg of purified PriS (or PriS D97A/D99A) were incubated with 36 mg of purified PriL (resulting in 1:1 molar ratio) at 25 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, the mixture was dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. An aliquot of the complex (200 μg in 200 μl) was subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration analysis. More than 90% of the proteins were isolated as the stoichiometric p41-p46 complex. A circular 200-nt ssDNA (containing only C, A, and G) was prepared as follows. Two reactions (30 μl) each containing 1 nmol of the 100-nt oligonucleotides A or B (sequences in supplemental Table 1) were incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (40 units, New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm, 350 cpm/pmol) for 1 h at 37 °C. The phosphorylated oligonucleotides A and B were combined and mixed with 5 nmol of the oligonucleotide bridges AB and BA in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl in a total volume of 100 μl, and the mixture was heated to 100 °C for 10 min and then cooled slowly to 22 °C. Ligation of the oligonucleotides was carried out in reactions (525 μl) containing T4 DNA ligase (8000 units), T4 DNA ligase buffer (New England Biolabs), and 1 mm ATP at 16 °C for 14 h. The ligation reaction was monitored with ExoI and ExoIII (New England Biolabs). Following complete ligation, the products were subjected to 8 m urea-10% PAGE separation in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA at 15 watts for 75 min; the region of the gel containing the circular 200-nt ssDNA was excised, and the DNA was eluted with 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA. After ethanol precipitation, the circular 200-nt ssDNA was resuspended in 30 μl of 1× Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, and the solution was passed through an S300 mini column filter (GE Healthcare). The procedure yielded ∼20% of the input oligonucleotide as the circular 200-nt ssDNA. A linear 140-nt oligonucleotide (5′ T40-linked to an 100-mer containing only G, T, and C), complementary to a portion of the 200-nt circle, was prepared as follows. A reaction (20 μl) containing the linear oligonucleotide (140-nt) was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, as described above. The labeled oligonucleotide II (1 nmol) was annealed to oligonucleotide I (0.9 nmol) and 5 nmol of the oligonucleotide bridge I-II. The ligation reaction (300 μl) was carried out by incubating T4 DNA ligase (6000 units) with 1 mm ATP in T4 DNA ligase buffer (New England Biolabs) at 16 °C for 14 h. The ligation product was isolated as described above with a yield of 40%, based on the amount of oligonucleotide I added. The primed rolling circle substrate was prepared by annealing the 200-nt circle and the linear 140-nt (as above) at a molar ratio of 1:1 followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the preparation of the primed 200-mer circle are shown in supplemental Table 1. Unless indicated, reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm DTT, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 4 mm MnCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA, dNTPs and rNTPs (as indicated), single-stranded (ss) M13 DNA, and T. kodakaraensis DNA primase fractions (diluted with a solution containing 50% glycerol, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml BSA) were incubated at 60 °C for 20 min. Aliquots were treated with an equal volume of a solution containing 95% formamide, 0.1× Tris-borate-EDTA, 10 mm EDTA and heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then subjected to electrophoretic separation through a 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel run in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA for 2.5 h at 300 V. Gels were visualized by autoradiography or phosphorimaging. Reaction conditions and enzymes used were as described in the figure legends. The purified T. kodakaraensis DNA primase complex and the catalytic subunit were assayed at various temperatures in reactions containing ssM13 DNA as the template. Although isolated from a thermophile, the enzyme was substantially active at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). For this reason, the T. kodakaraensis primase activity was coupled with the Klenow Pol, an assay initially used to measure DNA primase activity (20.Conaway R.C. Lehman I.R. A DNA primase activity associated with DNA polymerase α from Drosophila melanogaster embryos.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this assay, which is carried out in the presence of poly(dT) as the template, short oligonucleotides synthesized de novo by the primase are elongated by the Klenow Pol, which in the absence of a primer is inactive. As shown in Table 1, the DNA primase complex supported extensive dATP incorporation that was increased by higher levels of the primase complex (Wild-type complex (p41-p46) rows). In contrast, the primase complex containing the m p41 catalytic subunit was devoid of activity (Mutant complex (m p41-p46) rows), as was the p46 subunit alone (p46 row). The p41 subunit alone was poorly active (WT p41 rows), but this activity was increased by the addition of the p46 subunit (WT p41 + p46 (50 fmol) rows). Reactions with m p41 subunit alone (Mutant p41 row), as well as those supplemented with the p46 subunit (Mutant p41 + p46 (50 fmol) row), were inactive. Thus, under the conditions used, primer formation and its ability to support extensive poly(dA) synthesis with the Klenow Pol required an active catalytic p41 subunit as well as the p46 subunit. As these reactions were carried out in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, the only added nucleotide, de novo initiation of polynucleotide chains appeared to occur solely with dATP. In contrast to the archaeal primase, the eukaryotic DNA primase complex does not initiate DNA chains with dNTPs (1.Kuchta R.D. Stengel G. Mechanism and evolution of DNA primases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hence, the synthesis of poly(dA) was not observed when the purified human DNA primase complex was used in place of the T. kodakaraensis primase complex in reactions containing only dATP. The addition of ATP to such reactions, however, resulted in DNA replication (Human primase complex +ATP/−ATP rows). Collectively, these findings indicate that T. kodakaraensis primase complex initiates DNA primer synthesis with dATP in the absence of ATP.TABLE 1Coupling of T. kodakaraensis DNA Primase activity with Klenow PolAdditionsProtein addeddAMP incorporatedfmolpmolWild-type complex (p41-p46)40684472.80.410.4Mutant complex (m p41-p46)40<14<1WT p41403146.4p4650<1WT p41 + p46 (50 fmol)40692474.80.47.6Mutant p4140<1Mutant p41 + p46 (50 fmol)40<1Human primase complex +ATP70716Human primase complex −ATP70<1 Open table in a new tab The T. kodakaraensis primase complex synthesized oligonucleotide chains with either dNTPs or rNTPs only in the presence of ssM13 DNA (Fig. 1A). In the presence of M13 and dNTPs, DNA chains were produced more extensively at 60 °C (lane 5) than 37 °C (lane 3) or 70 °C (lane 7). Under the conditions used, labeled DNA chains formed, measured by urea-PAGE analysis, varied from ∼50 nt to >90 nt in length. The amount of labeled RNA chains synthesized in the presence of rNTPs at 70 °C was lower than that formed at 37 or 60 °C, and their size varied from ∼10 to ∼75 nt. Oligonucleotide synthesis with rNTPs or dNTPs was substantially higher with the primase complex than with the catalytic subunit alone (compare lanes 8 and 9 with lanes 5 and 7; compare lane 16 with lane 13). Two products, migrating in urea-PAGE as ∼16 and ∼25 nt oligonucleotides, were observed with dNTPs (lanes 2–9) but not with rNTPs. Their synthesis did not require M13 DNA, and they were formed with both the catalytic subunit alone and the primase complex. As discussed in more detail in the accompanying article (21.Chemnitz Galal W. Pan M. Giulian G. Yuan W. Li S. Edwards J.L. Marino J.P. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Formation of dAMP-glycerol and dAMP-Tris derivatives by the Thermococcus kodakaraensis DNA primase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (March 16): 16220-16229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), these products were identified as dAMP covalently linked to glycerol and to Tris and are not oligonucleotides. The findings summarized in Fig. 1A indicate that the T. kodakaraensis primase complex utilizes dNTPs as well as rNTPs to form polynucleotide chains. The size distribution of the labeled DNA products formed in M13 reactions was analyzed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). Products formed with the primase complex were shorter in length than those produced with the T. kodakaraensis p41 subunit alone (∼0.5 and ∼2 kb, respectively). Thus, the data presented in Fig. 1 indicate that in the absence of the p46 subunit, the p41 subunit forms longer DNA products and little RNA, whereas the complex forms shorter DNA products and supports more extensive RNA synthesis. These findings were not affected by variations in the level of added DNA. These are similar to those reported previously for the P. furiosus (9.Liu L. Komori K. Ishino S. Bocquier A.A. Cann I.K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. The archaeal DNA primase: biochemical characterization of the p41-p46 complex from Pyrococcus furiosus.J. Biol.

Querellou J. Raffin J.P. The heterodimeric primase from the euryarchaeon Pyrococcus abyssi: a multifunctional enzyme for initiation and repair?.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 1172-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Studies with the P. abyssi complex revealed that Mn2+ increased the level of RNA synthesis and decreased the length of RNA chains. RNA synthesis with the T. kodakaraensis primase complex was stimulated about 2-fold by the presence of Mn2+, whereas the size of RNA chains was marginally affected. In contrast, DNA synthesis was slightly inhibited by Mn2+ (data not presented). The labeled products formed by the primase complex in reactions containing M13 DNA and the four dNTPs or the four rNTPs were analyzed. Following incubation, reaction mixtures were digested with proteinase K, extracted with phenol and CHCl3, and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Urea-PAGE analysis of the products before and after isopropyl alcohol precipitation revealed that the prominent ∼16- and ∼25-nt bands formed with dNTPs were not recovered following isopropyl alcohol precipitation (data not presented). The isolated DNA products were subjected to digestion with pancreatic DNase I, RNase A, nuclease P1, and calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (Fig. 2A). Urea-PAGE analysis revealed that the DNA products were degraded by DNase I and nuclease P1 but unaffected by RNase A and CIP treatment. Digestion of the isolated RNA products revealed that they were degraded by RNase A and nuclease P1 and resistant to DNase I (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that dNTPs and rNTPs supported the synthesis of DNA and RNA chains, respectively. We examined the template activity of the four homo-oligodeoxynucleotides, 30 nt in length, using the T. kodakaraensis primase complex. As shown in Fig. 3, oligo(dC)30 was the most effective template (compare panel A with panels B–D), supporting extensive DNA synthesis with dGTP (lanes 5 and 7). Under the conditions used, dGTP incorporation exceeded the level of oligo(dC)30 template added, and the lengths of DNA chains, determined by urea-PAGE analyses, were >100 nt. Extensive RNA synthesis of a more homogeneous size (∼50 nt) than DNA was observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 8). (It should be noted that the autoradiogram presented in Fig. 3A was exposed for 25 min at −80 °C, whereas all other autoradiograms shown in Fig. 3 were exposed for 1 h at −80 °C.) Like oligo(dC)30, oligo(dT)30 supported extensive DNA and RNA synthesis (Fig. 3B). However, oligo(dT)30 supported the synthesis of shorter RNA chains than those formed in the presence of oligo(dC)30 (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8) as well as the production of higher levels of RNA than DNA (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 3 and 4). In the presence of oligo(dA)30 (Fig. 3C) or oligo(dG)30 (Fig. 3D), DNA synthesis was detected with the former but barely discernable with the latter, whereas RNA synthesis with these purine oligonucleotide templates was not observed. Thus, like eukaryotic DNA primases, the T. kodakaraensis primase complex prefers pyrimidine templates (1.Kuchta R.D. Stengel G. Mechanism and evolution of DNA primases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). DNA products formed in reactions containing oligo(dC)30 or oligo(dT)30 and the p41 subunit in lieu of the complex were similar to those shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. The level of incorporation with the catalytic subunit alone was 20–30% lower than that detected with the complex. When M13 DNA was used in lieu of the short homopolymers (in reactions containing all four rNTPs or the four dNTPs), all labeled rNTPs and dNTPs supported RNA and DNA synthesis, respectively (data not presented). As shown in Fig. 3, DNA products formed with some of the 30-nt oligonucleotide templates were longer in length than the template added. This discrepancy could arise by mechanisms that minimally include slippage, displacement synthesis, and primer-template reannea"

Samples were evaluated for variants to 0.4% levels. 36 VF subjects were evaluated by UDS; 24 had UDS for PI and RT DRMs. Of these 24, 19 (79.2%) had any DRM by UDS. The most common UDS-detected DRM were NRTI in 18 subjects: M184V/I (11), TAMs(7) & K65R(4); PI DRMs were detected in 9 subjects: M46I/V(5), F53L(2), I50V(1), D30N(1), and N88S(1). The remaining 12 subjects, all with VLs<10,000, had protease gene UDS, and 4 had low-level PI DRMs: F53L(2), L76V(1), I54S(1), G73S(1). Overall, 3/36(8.3%) subjects had DRMs identified with Stanford-HIVdb weights >12 for ATV or LPV: N88S (at 0.43% level-mutational load 1,828) in 1 subject on ATV; I50V (0.44%-mutational load 110) and L76V (0.52%-mutational load 20) in 1 subject each, both on LPV. All VF samples remained phenotypically susceptible to the treatment PI/r.Among persons experiencing VF without PI DRMs with standard genotyping on an initial PI/r regimen, low-level variants possessing major PI DRMs were present in a minority of cases, occurred in isolation, and did not result in phenotypic resistance. NRTI DRMs were detected in a high proportion of subjects. These data suggest that PIs may remain effective in subjects experiencing VF on a PI/r-based regimen when PI DRMs are not detected by standard or UDS genotyping."
https://openalex.org/W1976906930,"MitoNEET (mNT) is the founding member of the recently discovered CDGSH family of [2Fe-2S] proteins capable of [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer to apo-acceptor proteins. It is a target of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of anti-diabetes drugs whose binding modulate both electron transfer and cluster transfer properties. The [2Fe-2S] cluster in mNT is destabilized upon binding of NADPH, which leads to loss of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to the solution environment. Because mNT is capable of transferring [2Fe-2S] clusters to apo-acceptor proteins, we sought to determine whether NADPH binding also affects cluster transfer. We show that NADPH inhibits transfer of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to an apo-acceptor protein with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 200 μm, which reflects that of NADPH concentrations expected under physiological conditions. In addition, we determined that the strictly conserved cluster interacting residue Asp-84 in the CDGSH domain is necessary for the NADPH-dependent inhibition of [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer. The most critical cellular function of NADPH is in the maintenance of a pool of reducing equivalents, which is essential to counteract oxidative damage. Taken together, our findings suggest that NADPH can regulate both mNT [2Fe-2S] cluster levels in the cell as well as the ability of the protein to transfer [2Fe-2S] clusters to cytosolic or mitochondrial acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2054720349,"Epigenetic factor CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) plays important roles in the genetic control of cell fate. Previous studies found that CTCF is positively and negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and ultraviolet (UV) stimulation, respectively. However, it is unknown whether other stresses modify the CTCF protein. Here, we report that regulation of CTCF by de-SUMOylation is dependent upon hypoxic and oxidative stresses. We found that stimulation of human corneal epithelial cells with hypoxic stress suppressed a high molecular mass form of CTCF (150 kDa), but not a lower molecular weight form of CTCF (130 kDa). Further investigation revealed that the hypoxic stress-suppressed 150-kDa CTCF was a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)ylated form of the protein. Hypoxic stress-induced de-SUMOylation of human CTCF was associated with lysine 74 and 689 residues, but not to the phosphorylation of CTCF. Overexpression of SENP1 induced de-SUMOylation of CTCF. However, knockdown of SENP1 could not rescue hypoxic stress-induced CTCF de-SUMOylation. Overexpression of SUMO1 and SUMO2 increased SUMOylation of CTCF and partially blocked hypoxic stress-induced CTCF de-SUMOylation, suggesting that free cellular SUMO proteins play roles in regulating hypoxia-induced CTCF de-SUMOylation. In addition, hypoxic stress significantly inhibited PAX6 mRNA and protein expressions by suppression of PAX6-P0 promoter activity. The result was further supported by data showing that knockdown of CTCF significantly enhanced expression of PAX6 and abolished hypoxia-induced suppression of PAX6. Thus, we conclude that hypoxic stress induces de-SUMOylation of CTCF to functionally regulate CTCF activity."

Using cultures of cerebellar granule neurons, we show that expression of TLE1 is reduced in neurons primed to die. Reestablishment of elevated TLE1 levels by ectopic expression protects neurons from death, whereas suppression of TLE1 expression in otherwise healthy neurons induces cell death. These results show that TLE1 is necessary for the maintenance of neuronal survival.

Whereas Drosophila produces a single Groucho protein, several TLE/Grg proteins are expressed in mammals, which, based on their size, can be subdivided into two groups. The larger TLE proteins act as transcriptional corepressors. Although lacking in DNA binding activity of their own, these proteins are recruited to gene promoters through interaction with a number of repressors belonging to different protein families and including the HES class of basic helix-loop-helix proteins, the LEF-1/TCF transcription factors, Runt homology domain proteins, the homeodomain transcription factor Engrailed, and the winged helix domain protein FoxG1 (1Buscarlet M.

A second subgroup of TLE/Grg proteins has been identified in mammals that are truncated versions of the TLE proteins described above. Two members of this subgroup are amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES)/Grg5 and TLE6/Grg6. AES contains only the amino-terminal region of larger TLE proteins and lacks the carboxyl-terminal half, including the WD40-repeat region (Fig. 1). On the other hand, TLE6/Grg6 displays a high degree of similarity with the carboxyl terminus of the TLE proteins but lacks much of the amino-terminal region that the larger TLE proteins possess (Fig. 1). The physiological significance of these two smaller proteins is not well understood. AES can heteromerize with the larger TLE/Grg proteins, antagonizing their functions in a dominant negative manner; however, Grg6 cannot heteromerize with TLE1 (10Jan Y. Matter M. Pai J.T. Chen Y.L.

We recently described evidence indicating that TLE1 contributes to the survival of postmitotic neurons (11Zhang X. Chen H.M. Jaramillo E. Wang L. D'Mello S.R. Histone deacetylase-related protein inhibits AES-mediated neuronal cell death by direct interaction.J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 2423-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, we described that a down-regulation of TLE1 expression precedes neuronal death and that reestablishing an elevated level of TLE1 expression maintains neuronal survival even under apoptotic conditions (11Zhang X. Chen H.M. Jaramillo E. Wang L. D'Mello S.R. Histone deacetylase-related protein inhibits AES-mediated neuronal cell death by direct interaction.J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 2423-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which TLE1 promotes neuronal survival. We report that the survival-promoting effect of TLE1 is mediated through interaction with FoxG1, another transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of neurogenesis during early brain development. As described in the context of neurodevelopment, TLE1 and FoxG1 physically interact in mature neurons. Mutant forms of TLE1 that are unable to promote neuronal survival block FoxG1-mediated survival of neurons, whereas mutant forms of FoxG1 block the survival-promoting effect of TLE1, indicating that these two transcription factors function together. We report that activities of both CK2 and the PI3K-Akt pathway are necessary for TLE1- and FoxG1-mediated survival. Unless indicated otherwise, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 18–22 h after plating to prevent replication of non-neuronal cells. Cultures were maintained for 6–7 days prior to experimental treatments. For treatment, the cells were rinsed once and then maintained in low potassium (LK) medium (serum-free BME medium, 5 mm KCl) or high potassium (HK) medium (serum-free BME medium, supplemented with 20 mm KCl). Treatment of cultures with pharmacological inhibitors was initiated at the time of switching the medium to HK or LK unless specified otherwise. Embryonic cortical cultures were prepared from embryonic day 17 rat pups as described previously (17Dastidar S.G. Landrieu P.M. D'Mello S.R. FoxG1 promotes the survival of postmitotic neurons.J.

The cortical cultures were grown in DMEM + Glutamax-I medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). About 26 h after plating, the cultures were treated with 15 μg/ml 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine and 35 μg/ml uridine to prevent mitotic cell proliferation. RNA was extracted from cultured neurons or HT22 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was normalized, and complementary DNA was made from 5 μg of RNA using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Briefly, 3 μg/well of DNA was precipitated by the calcium phosphate method for 5 min at room temperature. Cell culture medium of neurons was changed to DMEM without l-glutamine after one wash. Precipitated DNA was added to the cell culture medium for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with DMEM without l-glutamine medium and placed in their original medium. 8 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed once and then maintained in serum-free BME medium containing either 5 mm KCl (LK) or 25 mm KCl (HK). Pharmacological inhibitors (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) were added in the HK or LK condition at the time of treating.

The proportion of successfully transfected cells (identified by immunocytochemistry) that displayed condensed or fragmented nuclei (visualized by DAPI) was quantified. In each individual experiment, more than 100 transfected cells were counted for each treatment or condition. Unless otherwise stated, cell viability data are presented as mean values ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments. Statistical significance was determined by using Student's t test. p values of <0.05 were deemed significant. Transfections of cortical neurons were performed on 2–3-day-old cultures as described above for cerebellar granule neurons. When used, homocysteic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at a 1 mm concentration 8 h after transfection for 15–18 h. Viability of successfully transfected cells was quantified following immunocytochemistry and DAPI staining. Two shRNA constructs against TLE1 and a control shRNA construct were purchased from Origene. These HuSH shRNA plasmids from Origene were designated as sh1 (catalog no. TG511107,34), sh2 (catalog no. TG511107,37), and control shRNA (catalog no. TR30007). The ability of these shRNAs to suppress TLE1 expression was evaluated in HEK293T and HT22 cells. Briefly, the cells were transiently transfected at around 85% confluence with the shRNA plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. A day after transfection, the cells were passaged using fresh medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin; this helps to enrich cells that are transfected with the shRNA plasmids. 72 h later, the cells were lysed using 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling), and the protein lysate was harvested after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 12 min in 4 °C. Eastman Kodak Co. 1D software was used for densitometric analysis. For statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance was performed using Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests. CGNs were transfected on day 4 with control shRNA or sh1 and sh2. Two days later, the neurons were treated with HK/LK for 24 h, after which the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline). Viability of the GFP-expressing cells was quantified by DAPI staining. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 1× cell lysis buffer (1% Triton, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 protease inhibitor mixture). Protein concentrations were measured and normalized using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Following normalization, 40–80 μg of protein was subjected to Western blotting. Immunoreactivity was examined by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation experiments, cultured cells were treated accordingly and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by lysis in lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein concentration of supernatant fractions was determined and normalized using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were incubated overnight with 1 μg of primary antibody at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with 20 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. Bead complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 1× cell lysis buffer. Pellets were then resuspended in 30 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and subjected to Western blotting. Approximately 5–10% of the whole cell lysate was used as input to check for the expression of either overexpressed proteins or endogenous proteins. CGNs undergo apoptosis when switched from medium containing depolarizing levels of potassium (HK) to medium containing lower and non-depolarizing levels of potassium (LK) (22D'Mello S.R. Galli C.

This work studied the material composition and the fabrication of cricket silk for the first time. We examined silk-webs produced in captivity, which comprised cylindrical fibers and flat films. Spectra obtained from micro-Raman experiments indicated that the silk is composed of protein, primarily in a beta-sheet conformation, and that fibers and films are almost identical in terms of amino acid composition and secondary structure. The primary sequences of four silk proteins were identified through a mass spectrometry/cDNA library approach. The most abundant silk protein was large in size (300 and 220 kDa variants), rich in alanine, glycine and serine, and contained repetitive sequence motifs; these are features which are shared with several known beta-sheet forming silk proteins. Convergent evolution at the molecular level contrasts with development by crickets of a novel mechanism for silk fabrication. After secretion of cricket silk proteins by the labial glands they are fabricated into mature silk by the labium-hypopharynx, which is modified to allow the controlled formation of either fibers or films. Protein folding into beta-sheet structure during silk fabrication is not driven by shear forces, as is reported for other silks."
https://openalex.org/W1975613084,"The p14(ARF) tumor suppressor plays a central role in regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We reported previously that p14(ARF) is capable of triggering apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. However, the mechanism remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the p53-independent activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by p14(ARF) is primarily mediated by the pro-apoptotic Bax-homolog Bak. Expression of p14(ARF) exclusively triggers a N-terminal conformational switch of Bak, but not Bax, which allows for mitochondrial permeability shift, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases, and subsequent fragmentation of genomic DNA. Although forced expression of Bak markedly sensitizes toward p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis, re-expression of Bax has no effect. Vice versa, knockdown of Bak by RNA interference attenuates p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of Bax has no effect. Bak activation coincides with a prominent, caspase-independent deprivation of the endogenous Bak inhibitors Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L). In turn, mitochondrial apoptosis is fully blocked by overexpression of either Mcl-1 or Bcl-x(L). Taken together, these data indicate that in the absence of functional p53 and Bax, p14(ARF) triggers mitochondrial apoptosis signaling by activating Bak, which is facilitated by down-regulating anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L). Moreover, our data suggest that the simultaneous inhibition of two central endogenous Bak inhibitors, i.e. Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L), may be sufficient to activate mitochondrial apoptosis in the absence of BH3-only protein regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2134522277,"Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in the antiviral immune response. Whereas the C proteins of wild-type human parainfluenza virus type 1 (WT HPIV1) inhibit both IFN-β induction and signaling, a HPIV1 mutant encoding a single amino acid substitution (F170S) in the C proteins is unable to block either host response. Here, signaling downstream of the type 1 IFN receptor was examined in Vero cells to define at what stage WT HPIV1 can block, and F170S HPIV1 fails to block, IFN signaling. WT HPIV1 inhibited phosphorylation of both Stat1 and Stat2, and this inhibition was only slightly reduced for F170S HPIV1. Degradation of Stat1 or Stat2 was not observed. The HPIV1 C proteins were found to accumulate in the perinuclear space, often forming large granules, and co-localized with Stat1 and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) that is a marker for late endosomes. Upon stimulation with IFN-β, both the WT and F170S C proteins remained in the perinuclear space, but only the WT C proteins prevented Stat1 translocation to the nucleus. In addition, WT HPIV1 C proteins, but not F170S C proteins, co-immunoprecipitated both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Stat1. Our findings suggest that the WT HPIV1 C proteins form a stable complex with Stat1 in perinuclear granules that co-localize with M6PR, and that this direct interaction between the WT HPIV1 C proteins and Stat1 is the basis for the ability of HPIV1 to inhibit IFN signaling. The F170S mutation in HPIV1 C did not prevent perinuclear co-localization with Stat1, but apparently weakened this interaction such that, upon IFN stimulation, Stat1 was translocated to the nucleus to induce an antiviral response."

https://openalex.org/W2042443456,"Accumulation of the neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide in the brain is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Aβ is derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages by β- and γ-secretases, and the production of Aβ is greatly affected by the subcellular localization of these factors. CUTA, the mammalian CutA divalent cation tolerance homolog (E. coli), has been proposed to mediate acetylcholinesterase activity and copper homeostasis, which are important in Alzheimer disease pathology. However, the exact function of CUTA remains largely unclear. Here we show that human CUTA has several variants that differ in their N-terminal length and are separated as heavy (H) and light (L) components. The H component has the longest N terminus and is membrane-associated, whereas the L component is N-terminally truncated at various sites and localized in the cytosol. Importantly, we demonstrate that the H component of CUTA interacts through its N terminus with the transmembrane domain of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the putative β-secretase, mainly in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network. Overexpression and RNA interference knockdown of CUTA can reduce and increase BACE1-mediated APP processing/Aβ secretion, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2047815912,"Although HPV16 transforms infected epithelial tissues to cancer in the presence of several co-factors, there is insufficient molecular evidence that poor nutrition has any such role. Because physiological folate deficiency led to the intracellular homocysteinylation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP-E1) and activated a nutrition-sensitive (homocysteine-responsive) posttranscriptional RNA operon that included interaction with HPV16 L2 mRNA, we investigated the functional consequences of folate deficiency on HPV16 in immortalized HPV16-harboring human (BC-1-Ep/SL) keratinocytes and HPV16-organotypic rafts. Although homocysteinylated hnRNP-E1 interacted with HPV16 L2 mRNA cis-element, it also specifically bound another HPV16 57-nucleotide poly(U)-rich cis-element in the early polyadenylation element (upstream of L2L1 genes) with greater affinity. Together, these interactions led to a profound reduction of both L1 and L2 mRNA and proteins without effects on HPV16 E6 and E7 in vitro, and in cultured keratinocyte monolayers and HPV16-low folate-organotypic rafts developed in physiological low folate medium. In addition, HPV16-low folate-organotypic rafts contained fewer HPV16 viral particles, a similar HPV16 DNA viral load, and a much greater extent of integration of HPV16 DNA into genomic DNA when compared with HPV16-high folate-organotypic rafts. Subcutaneous implantation of 18-day old HPV16-low folate-organotypic rafts into folate-replete immunodeficient mice transformed this benign keratinocyte-derived raft tissue into an aggressive HPV16-induced cancer within 12 weeks. Collectively, these studies establish a likely molecular linkage between poor folate nutrition and HPV16 and predict that nutritional folate and/or vitamin-B(12) deficiency, which are both common worldwide, will alter the natural history of HPV16 infections and also warrant serious consideration as reversible co-factors in oncogenic transformation of HPV16-infected tissues to cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1971053167,"Background and Aims Although terlipressin (TP) may improve renal function in cirrhotic patients, its use in sepsis remains controversial due to concerns about regional ischemia. We investigated the effects of TP on regional hemodynamics and kidney function in experimental hyperdynamic sepsis. Methods We studied thirteen merino ewes in a university physiology laboratory using a randomized controlled cross over design. We implanted flow probes around the pulmonary, circumflex coronary, superior mesenteric, renal and iliac arteries. We injected live Escherichia coli and induced hyperdynamic sepsis. We treated animals with either bolus vehicle or a single dose of TP (sTP = 1 mg). In a second group, after 1 mg of TP, two additional bolus injections (mTP) of 0.5 mg were given at 2 hourly intervals. Main Results sTP (1 mg) significantly increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) (74 to 89 mmHg; P<0.0001) creatinine clearance (31 to 85 mL/min; P<0.0001) and urine output (24 to 307 mL/hr) (P<0.0001). However, it decreased CO (5.7 to 3.9 L/min; p<0.0001), coronary blood flow (CBF) (43 to 32 mL/min; p<0.0001) and mesenteric blood flow (MBF) (944 to 625 mL/min; p = 0.004) and increased blood lactate (2.1 to 4.0 mmol/L; p<0.0001). Extra doses of TP caused little additional effect. Conclusions In hyperdynamic sepsis, bolus TP transiently improves MAP and renal function, but reduces CO, CBF and MBF, and increases blood lactate. Caution should be applied when prescribing bolus TP in septic patients at risk of coronary or mesenteric ischemia."

Here, we provide evidence that HGF-β binds to a new receptor other than MET for promoting a host cell clearance system. By an affinity cross-linking, radiolabeled HGF-β was bound to liver non-parenchymal cells, particularly to Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells, but not to parenchymal hepatocytes. The cross-linked complex was immunoprecipitated by anti-HGF antibody, but not anti-MET antibody, implying that HGF-β binds to non-parenchymal cells at a site distinct from MET. Mass spectrometric detection of the ligand receptor complex revealed that the binding site of HGF-β was the mannose receptor (MR). Actually, an ectopic expression of MR in COS-7 cells, which express no endogenous MR or MET, enabled HGF-β to bind these cells at a KD of 89 nm, demonstrating that MR is the new receptor for HGF-β. Interaction of HGF-β and MR was diminished by EGTA, and by an enzymatic digestion of HGF-β sugar chains, suggesting that MR may recognize the glycosylation site(s) of HGF-β in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. Notably, HGF-β, but not other MR ligands, enhanced the ingestion of latex beads, or of apoptotic neutrophils, by Kupffer cells, possibly via an F-actin-dependent pathway. Thus, the HGF-β·MR complex may provide a new pathway for the enhancement of cell clearance systems, which is associated with resolution of inflammation. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a heterodimer composed of the α-chain and β-chain, exerts multifunctional actions for tissue repair and homeostasis via its receptor, MET. HGF is cleaved by proteases secreted from inflammatory cells, and NK4 and β-chain remnant (HGF-β) are generated. Here, we provide evidence that HGF-β binds to a new receptor other than MET for promoting a host cell clearance system.

Thus, the HGF-β·MR complex may provide a new pathway for the enhancement of cell clearance systems, which is associated with resolution of inflammation. Inflammation is one of the host defense systems that removes damaged tissue or harmful foreign substances, and is required for inducing proper tissue regeneration. On the other hand, proteolytic enzymes released from inflammatory cells, such as neutrophil elastase, elicit apoptotic events in functional cells, thus indicating a dual role for controlling or accelerating inflammation (1Lungarella G. Cavarra E. Lucattelli M. Martorana P.A. The dual role of neutrophil elastase in lung destruction and repair.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These proteases modulate tissue repair processes by degrading active cytokines, creating active growth factor from its precursor, and regulating the activity of the cell surface receptor of these cytokines (2Pandiella A.

Sometimes, proteolytic fragments of growth factors may display unique activities distinct from the original functions. For example, fragments of VEGF elicit inflammatory cell infiltration by interacting with their non-cognate receptors (4Kurtagic E. Jedrychowski M.P.

Developmental roles of HGF/SF and its receptor, the c-Met tyrosine kinase.Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). HGF is a heterodimer composed of a 69-kDa α-chain and 34-kDa β-chain linked by a disulfide bond that contains one N-terminal hairpin domain (N) and four kringle domains (K1–K4) in the α-chain, and one serine protease-like domain in the β-chain. The HGF β-chain is structurally analogous to serine proteases, but the catalytic triad essential for serine protease activity is mutated and shows no enzyme activity. The α-chain of HGF has a high affinity for MET, but activation of MET is dependent on the subsequent binding of the β-chain (11Matsumoto K. Kataoka H. Date K. Nakamura T. Cooperative interaction between α- and β-chains of hepatocyte growth factor on c-Met receptor confers ligand-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and multiple biological responses.J. Biol.

HGF is synthesized and secreted as a single chain pro-HGF, and converted into the active form by a proteolytic cleavage at Arg494–Val495 (12Mizuno K. Takehara T. Nakamura T. Proteolytic activation of a single-chain precursor of hepatocyte growth factor by extracellular serine protease.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proteolytic conversion by proteases also occurs at different regions of HGF. Indeed, elastase cleaves HGF between Val478 and Asp479, resulting in the generation of NK4, a fragment of the α-chain N-terminal hairpin and K1–K4 domains, and the β-chain containing the C-terminal 16 residues of the α-chain linked by a disulfide bond, designated “HGF-β” (13Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. HGF/NK4 is a specific antagonist for pleiotrophic actions of hepatocyte growth factor.FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). NK4 can bind to MET without its activation, and thus NK4 acts as a full antagonist of HGF (14Nakamura T. Sakai K. Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Anti-cancer approach with NK4. Bivalent action and mechanisms.Anticancer Agents Med. Chem. 2010; 10: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NK4 can inhibit FGF2- or VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation (15Kuba K. Matsumoto K. Date K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. HGF/NK4, a four-kringle antagonist of hepatocyte growth factor, is an angiogenesis inhibitor that suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in mice.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6737-6743PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting the presence of a functional receptor other than MET. We recently reported that NK4 interacts with perlecan, resulting in the inhibition of surface fibronectin assembly and integrin-dependent endothelial growth (16Sakai K. Nakamura T. Matsumoto K.

Cruz A.C. Caughey G.H. Mast cell and neutrophil peptidases attack an inactivation segment in hepatocyte growth factor to generate NK4-like antagonists.J. Biol.

In contrast to the unique functions of NK4, it is still unknown whether another HGF fragment, HGF-β, has a biological function(s). Purified HGF-β is reported to bind to “soluble” MET by bridging to the Sema-domain of MET in a direct interaction (19Kirchhofer D. Yao X. Peek M. Eigenbrot C. Lipari M.T. Billeci K.L. Maun H.R. Moran P. Santell L. Wiesmann C. Lazarus R.A. Structural and functional basis of the serine protease-like hepatocyte growth factor β-chain in Met binding and signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39915-39924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, HGF-β alone (i.e. absent of another partner, NK4) may not bind to the “cell surface-anchored” MET (11Matsumoto K. Kataoka H. Date K. Nakamura T.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This background prompted us to hypothesize that HGF-β exerts a biological function via a MET-independent mechanism(s), as did NK4 (15Kuba K. Matsumoto K. Date K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. HGF/NK4, a four-kringle antagonist of hepatocyte growth factor, is an angiogenesis inhibitor that suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in mice.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6737-6743PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sakai K.

Chem. 2009; 284: 22491-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we attempted to identify a functional receptor of HGF-β by mass spectrometry. Herein, we provide evidence that HGF-β enhances phagocytosis via a mannose receptor (MR)-dependent pathway. We discuss the significance of the HGF-derived fragment receptor identification for understanding a cell clearance system. Human recombinant HGF was purified from a medium of CHO cells transfected with human HGF cDNA (11Matsumoto K. Kataoka H. Date K. Nakamura T.

HGF/NK4 is a specific antagonist for pleiotrophic actions of hepatocyte growth factor.FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Human recombinant NK4 was also purified from cultured medium of CHO cells (13Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. HGF/NK4 is a specific antagonist for pleiotrophic actions of hepatocyte growth factor.FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-MET (number sc-8057, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-SE-1 (number 10078, IBL, Gunma, Japan), anti-MR (number ab64693, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-ED2 (number MCA342R, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), and anti-β-actin (number A1978, Sigma). Anti-human HGF rabbit antibody was prepared in our laboratory (21Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Kiritoshi A. Tano Y. Nakamura T.

Mucin type III from porcine stomach, thyroid stimulating hormone from bovine pituitary, and thyroglobulin from bovine thyroid were purchased from Sigma. Heparin and cytochalasin-D were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) were isolated by in situ perfusion of the liver with collagenase, and separated by differential centrifugation. The liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) were purified by centrifugation of NPCs through a two-step Percoll gradient (22Tokairin T. Nishikawa Y. Doi Y. Watanabe H. Yoshioka T. Su M. Omori Y. Enomoto K. A highly specific isolation of rat sinusoidal endothelial cells by the immunomagnetic bead method using SE-1 monoclonal antibody.J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 725-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and LSECs were further purified by a magnetic bead-based method using anti-SE-1 IgG, as described (22Tokairin T. Nishikawa Y. Doi Y. Watanabe H. Yoshioka T. Su M. Omori Y. Enomoto K. A highly specific isolation of rat sinusoidal endothelial cells by the immunomagnetic bead method using SE-1 monoclonal antibody.J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 725-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To separate hepatic stellate cells, NPCs were fractionated on the gradient of Nycodenz, according to a previous method (23Schäfer S. Zerbe O. Gressner A.M. The synthesis of proteoglycans in fat-storing cells of rat liver.Hepatology. 1987; 7: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). TMNK-1 and COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Rat MR cDNA was amplified from NPCs by PCR using primers mrc1-F (5′-AGA CTC TAG ACA ATG GAA CAC ACA CTC TGG GC-3′) and mrc1-R (5′-CGC GGA ATT CTA AAT GAC CGC ATG CTC ATT CTG TTC G-3′), and cloned into pcDNA 3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were transfected with the vector encoding rat mrc1 or empty vector, using Lipofectamine 2000® reagent (Invitrogen) for 24 h. Exogenously produced protein was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MR IgG as the primary antibody. HGF was digested with porcine pancreatic elastase (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 5 h at 37 °C. The digested material was applied onto a Hi-Trap heparin column (GE Healthcare), and an eluted peak corresponding to HGF-β was detected during the purification with a Hi-Trap benzamidine FF column (GE Healthcare). The purified β-chain (i.e. HGF-β) seemed to contain the first 16 amino acids of an α-chain C terminus linked by a disulfide bond, as reported (11Matsumoto K. Kataoka H. Date K. Nakamura T. Cooperative interaction between α- and β-chains of hepatocyte growth factor on c-Met receptor confers ligand-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and multiple biological responses.J. Biol.

HGF/NK4 is a specific antagonist for pleiotrophic actions of hepatocyte growth factor.FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). HGF-β was radiolabeled with Na125I using IODO-GEN (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The radioactivity of 125I-HGF-β was 120–180 μCi/μg of protein. Dose-dependent binding of 125I-HGF-β and Scatchard analysis were performed using LSECs or COS-7 cells, as reported (8Higuchi O. Mizuno K. Vande Woude G.F. Nakamura T. Expression of c-met proto-oncogene in COS cells induces the signal transducing high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor.FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with the binding buffer consisting of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 0.2% BSA and equilibrated in the same buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Binding buffer containing increasing concentrations of 125I-HGF-β, with or without 50 times excess unlabeled HGF-β, was added and incubated at 4 °C for 5 h. Cultures were washed 5 times, and the count of bound radiolabeled ligand was measured. Specific binding of 125I-HGF-β was calculated by subtracting the amount of nonspecific binding (in the presence of an excess unlabeled ligand) from total binding. All experiments were done in triplicate. Cultured cells were equilibrated with binding buffer for 30 min and then the 125I-HGF-β (5 nm) was added. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, these cells were washed and incubated with the cross-linking reagent BS3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h. The reaction was then quenched with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The cells were solubilized with the lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The lysates were incubated overnight with antibodies and the antibody complex was precipitated by Protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed and boiled in SDS sample preparation buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography, as reported (11Matsumoto K. Kataoka H. Date K. Nakamura T. Cooperative interaction between α- and β-chains of hepatocyte growth factor on c-Met receptor confers ligand-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and multiple biological responses.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22913-22920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Biotinylated HGF-β with Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the NPCs at a concentration of 40 nm and incubated. The bound ligands on the cells were then cross-linked with BS3. After washing, these cells were solubilized with lysis buffer. The biotinylated materials in the lysate were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma). The beads were washed, and bound cross-linked complex was eluted by 0.5 m DTT (supplemental Fig. S2). Eluted proteins were concentrated by Microcon YM-50® (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then visualized by silver staining. After tryptic digestion, the peptides were extracted, separated by liquid chromatography (Prominence nano; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (4700 Proteomics Analyzer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Three types of siRNA oligonucleotides for rat mrc1 (Stealth Select RNAi siRNA) were obtained from Invitrogen (catalog numbers: RSS306981 for siMR1, RSS306982 for siMR2, and RSS306983 for siMR3). NPCs were transfected with each RNAi at a concentration of 50 nm, using Lipofectamine 2000® reagent. The Stealth RNAi for GFP (Invitrogen) was used as a negative control. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using ISOGEN® (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The amount of target cDNA was normalized by comparison with the amplification of the β-actin gene. Primer sequence were as follows: rat mrc1 sense, 5′-CAA GGA AGG TTG GCA TTT GT-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGA ACG TGT GCT CTG AGT TG-3′, and rat β-actin sense, 5′-AGT GTG ACG TTG ACA TCC GTA-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCC AGA GCA GTA ATC TCC TTC T-3′. The Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) was used for the amplification and detection of rat MR mRNA. Male SD rats (Japan Slc, Hamamatsu, Japan) were administered with a single dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (1.0 ml/kg, intraperitoneally). After 0, 3, 6, and 9 days of CCl4 administration, the NPCs of rats were enriched from the total liver cell population by removing hepatocytes through differential centrifugation. The cell suspension of NPC (≥95% purity) was plated in a 96-well plate at 2 × 105 cells/well, and the binding of 5 nm 125I-HGF-β was analyzed by the method described above. The fold-changes in the amount of specific binding after CCl4 treatment were measured. In addition, the changes in MR protein and mRNA levels in NPCs were determined by Western blotting and real-time PCR analysis, as mentioned above, respectively. KCs were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS (Sigma, O111 B4) in the presence or absence of HGF-β for 16 h. For the latex bead ingestion assay, KCs were washed and incubated with medium containing fluorescence-conjugated latex beads (0.5 μm, Invitrogen) for 1 h. After washing, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-ED2 IgG. Fluorescent signals in KCs were observed under a confocal microscope LSM-PASCAL (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Cells that ingested ≥10 latex beads were regarded as positive cells, as reported (24Kyo E. Uda N. Kasuga S. Itakura Y. Immunomodulatory effects of aged garlic extract.J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 1075S-1079SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bead-positive KCs were also analyzed by FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience). For the phagocytosis assay of neutrophils, rat bone marrow-derived neutrophils were separated by Percoll gradient centrifugation (25Kumar S. Jyoti A. Keshari R.S. Singh M. Barthwal M.K. Dikshit M. Functional and molecular characterization of NOS isoforms in rat neutrophil precursor cells.Cytometry A. 2010; 77: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 30 min at 37 °C. The CFSE-labeled neutrophils led to apoptosis after cultivation for 1 day (not shown) and then incubated with KCs for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescent signals in KCs were observed under the confocal microscope, and the phagocytic index was calculated, as reported (26Roszer T. Menéndez-Gutiérrez M.P. Lefterova M.I. Alameda D. Núñez V. Lazar M.A. Fischer T. Ricote M. Autoimmune kidney disease and impaired engulfment of apoptotic cells in mice with macrophage peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ or retinoid X receptor α deficiency.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. In brief, phagocytic index = {(number of 1 CFSE-labeled cell-ingested KCs) × 1 + (number of 2 CFSE-labeled cell-ingested KCs) × 2 + (number of 3 CFSE-labeled cell-ingested KCs) × 3 + (number of 4 labeled cell-ingested KCs) × 4 + (number of more than 5 CFSE-labeled cell-ingested KCs) × 5}/total number of KCs counted. The fluorescent positive signals in KCs were also evaluated by FACS, as reported (27Hart S.P. Dransfield I. Rossi A.G. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.Methods. 2008; 44: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student's t test for comparison between two groups, with Stat View statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Statistical significance was accepted for p < 0.05. HGF-β and NK4 were prepared from recombinant HGF by elastase digestion and purified using a heparin affinity column (13Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. HGF/NK4 is a specific antagonist for pleiotrophic actions of hepatocyte growth factor.FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). During these steps, NK4 began to be degraded, especially from 120 min post-digestion, although HGF-β seemed to be unchanged up to 6 h (Fig. 1A, left). The prolonged incubation correlated with the decreased amounts of NK4 and the increased production of low molecular weight fragments, indicates that NK4 is unstable under long-term exposure to elastases (Fig. 1A, middle). In contrast, HGF-β was resistant to elastase exposure for at least 360 min (Fig. 1A, right). Similar proteolytic resistance of HGF-β was also seen during digestion with cathepsin-G, another protease released from inflammatory leukocytes such as neutrophils and mast cells (Fig. 1B). These results prompted us to investigate whether HGF-β exerts biological actions, possibly via binding to its “orphan” receptor. To identify HGF-β-targeted cells, we performed a binding assay for a variety of cell types, using radioiodinated HGF-β (125I-HGF-β). As a result, most cell lines and primary hepatocytes tested in this study showed little binding to HGF-β, except for TMNK-1, a cell line of human liver endothelial cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, KCs and LSECs in the NPCs strongly bound to HGF-β (Fig. 2A). It is important to note that radiolabeled HGF-β did not bind to MET-positive cells, such as hepatocytes and A549 lung carcinoma. Indeed, HGF-β did not bind to BaF3-hMet cells (i.e. MET-positive control cells) regardless of high doses, whereas HGF bound to the MET-positive cells in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast, purified HGF-β and soluble MET likely form a tight complex under cell-free conditions (19Kirchhofer D. Yao X. Peek M. Eigenbrot C. Lipari M.T. Billeci K.L. Maun H.R. Moran P. Santell L. Wiesmann C. Lazarus R.A. Structural and functional basis of the serine protease-like hepatocyte growth factor β-chain in Met binding and signaling.J. Biol.

The difficulty in the binding of HGF-β to MET on living cells might be due to a structural interference by other surface molecules, which are known to bind to MET (28Trusolino L. Bertotti A.

Next, we examined the binding kinetics of HGF-β to LSECs, which have high-affinity binding sites for HGF-β. Specific HGF-β binding to LSECs was seen in a saturable manner (Fig. 2B, left). Scatchard analysis showed that the KD value of HGF-β in LSECs was 85.7 nm, and the number of binding sites (Bmax) was 31,700 sites/cell (Fig. 2B, right). To detect the complex formation between HGF-β and its receptor, we carried out affinity cross-linking experiments in hepatic cells. After cross-linking with 125I-HGF-β to total NPCs, the ligand-receptor complex was precipitated with anti-HGF antibody. As a result, the HGF-β cross-linked complexes were detected as an apparent molecular mass of ∼230 and 460 kDa, and these specifici"
https://openalex.org/W2065179535,"C1 domains, the recognition motif of the second messenger diacylglycerol and of the phorbol esters, are classified as typical (ligand-responsive) or atypical (not ligand-responsive). The C1 domain of Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, plays a critical role in regulation of Vav activity through stabilization of the Dbl homology domain, which is responsible for exchange activity of Vav. Although the C1 domain of Vav1 is classified as atypical, it retains a binding pocket geometry homologous to that of the typical C1 domains of PKCs. This study clarifies the basis for its failure to bind ligands. Substituting Vav1-specific residues into the C1b domain of PKCδ, we identified five crucial residues (Glu(9), Glu(10), Thr(11), Thr(24), and Tyr(26)) along the rim of the binding cleft that weaken binding potency in a cumulative fashion. Reciprocally, replacing these incompatible residues in the Vav1 C1 domain with the corresponding residues from PKCδ C1b (δC1b) conferred high potency for phorbol ester binding. Computer modeling predicts that these unique residues in Vav1 increase the hydrophilicity of the rim of the binding pocket, impairing membrane association and thereby preventing formation of the ternary C1-ligand-membrane binding complex. The initial design of diacylglycerol-lactones to exploit these Vav1 unique residues showed enhanced selectivity for C1 domains incorporating these residues, suggesting a strategy for the development of ligands targeting Vav1."

They are, therefore, major elements in intercellular communication processes. The addition of Sia to glycoconjugates requires metabolic activation to CMP-Sia, catalyzed by CMP-Sia synthetase (CMAS). This highly conserved enzyme is located in the cell nucleus in all vertebrates investigated to date, but its nuclear function remains elusive. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of two Cmas enzymes in Danio rerio (dreCmas), one of which is exclusively localized in the cytosol. We show that the two cmas genes most likely originated from the third whole genome duplication, which occurred at the base of teleost radiation. cmas paralogues were maintained in fishes of the Otocephala clade, whereas one copy got subsequently lost in Euteleostei (e.g. rainbow trout). In zebrafish, the two genes exhibited a distinct spatial expression pattern. The products of these genes (dreCmas1 and dreCmas2) diverged not only with respect to subcellular localization but also in substrate specificity. Nuclear dreCmas1 favored N-acetylneuraminic acid, whereas the cytosolic dreCmas2 showed highest affinity for 5-deamino-neuraminic acid. The subcellular localization was confirmed for the endogenous enzymes in fractionated zebrafish lysates. Nuclear entry of dreCmas1 was mediated by a bipartite nuclear localization signal, which seemed irrelevant for other enzymatic functions.

With the current demonstration that in zebrafish two subfunctionalized cmas paralogues co-exist, we introduce a novel and unique model to detail the roles that CMAS has in the nucleus and in the sialylation pathways of animal cells. Sialic acids (Sia), a family of nine carbon α-keto acids, are mostly found as terminal sugars on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Due to their exposed position and negative charge, Sia influence numerous cell interaction and cell recognition processes by charge repulsion or by acting as part of recognition structures (1Cohen M. Varki A. The sialome: far more than the sum of its parts.OMICS. 2010; 14: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In mice, interference with Sia biosynthesis has been shown to be lethal before embryonic day 10 (2Schwarzkopf M. Knobeloch K.P. Rohde E. Hinderlich S. Wiechens N. Lucka L. Horak I. Reutter W.

In addition to the mouse model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been introduced as a valuable system to study the biological significance of sialylation in vertebrates, particularly of linkage-specific sialyltransferases. Mass spectrometry studies revealed that N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the major Sia derivatives in zebrafish (3Guérardel Y. Chang L.Y. Maes E. Huang C.J.

Dual function of polysialic acid during zebrafish central nervous system development.Development. 2001; 128: 4949-4958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of polySia during embryonic development is catalyzed by polysialyltransferase ST8Sia2 (7Marx M. Rivera-Milla E. Stummeyer K. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bastmeyer M.

ST8Sia4, the second polysialyltransferase identified in zebrafish, is generally capable of adding polySia to Ncam1a and Ncam1b but is not involved in polysialylation in the embryo (6Langhauser M.

A prerequisite for the formation of sialoglycoconjugates is the activation of Sia to its cytidine monophosphate diester (CMP-Sia), which is catalyzed by one of the key enzymes of the sialylation pathway, CMP-Sia synthetase (CMAS or CSS, EC 2.7.7.43). Only activated sugars are transported into the Golgi apparatus, where they serve as a substrate for sialyltransferases. Interference with the activation reaction abolishes sialylation on the cell surface (9Potvin B. Raju T.S. Stanley P.

In contrast to all other sugar-activating enzymes analyzed to date, the vertebrate CMAS is localized in the cell nucleus (11Kean E.L. Münster-Kühnel A.K. Gerardy-Schahn R.

This unusual intracellular localization was first recognized in the lens epithelial layer by E. L. Kean in 1969 (12Kean E.L. Sialic acid activating enzyme in ocular tissue.Exp. Eye Res. 1969; 8: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and later confirmed in a variety of biochemical studies using different tissues and species (11Kean E.L. Münster-Kühnel A.K.

Although the nuclear localization signals have been identified in recombinant mouse and rainbow trout CMAS (14Munster A.K. Weinhold B. Gotza B. Muhlenhoff M. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

The rainbow trout CMP-sialic acid synthetase utilizes a nuclear localization signal different from that identified in the mouse enzyme.Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the biological relevance of this unusual intracellular localization still remains an enigma. In this study, we identified and cloned two distinct cmas genes in zebrafish. We purified the recombinant proteins and demonstrated that both dreCmas enzymes assemble into tetramers and are enzymatically active in vitro as well as in cellular systems. Remarkably, however, the dreCmas enzymes showed significant differences not only in terms of substrate specificity but also with respect to their subcellular localization and spatial expression. Although dreCmas1 was transported to the nuclear compartment by a bipartite nuclear localization signal, dreCmas2, in contrast to all other vertebrate CMAS analyzed thus far, remained in the cytoplasm. Two cmas homologues were identified in the zebrafish genome using known vertebrate Cmas sequences in BLAST searches. Sequences of cmas homologues of other species (supplemental Table 1) were obtained from ENSEMBL and GenBankTM databases or by using BLASTP or TBLASTN algorithms applied to protein, mRNA, and EST databases. In the latter case, overlapping ESTs were downloaded, aligned, and sorted for each species according to sequence identities. Regions of unsure sequencing were deleted, and consensus sequences were inferred manually. For phylogenetic analyses, nucleotide sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW implemented in MEGA (16Tamura K. Peterson D. Peterson N. Stecher G. Nei M. Kumar S. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods.Mol Biol. Evol. 2011; 28: 2731-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34843) Google Scholar). The maximum likelihood tree was constructed using Mega5 and tested by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications. The ambiguously aligned N-terminal and C-terminal codons were excluded from analysis, resulting in a 1221-bp-long (407 amino acids) alignment. All sites in triplets were used, and missing data and alignment gaps were deleted in pairwise comparisons. We used the general time-reversible model of substitutions and uniform rates of substitutions among sites. The tree was inferred using the nearest neighbor interchange maximum likelihood heuristic method. The programs EBI-ClustalW (17Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A.

Prediction of putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences was performed by eye and by use of PsortII and PredictNLS. Structure prediction was done using Phyre (18Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar). Blocks of synteny were determined with the help of the Synteny database (19Catchen J.M. Conery J.S. Postlethwait J.H. Automated identification of conserved synteny after whole genome duplication.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or on sight using the latest versions of genome projects provided by ENSEMBL database. In the latter case, chromosomal location and orientation of orthologues of up to 10 genes upstream and downstream of the cmas genes of zebrafish were searched for in other species. Only the relative chromosomal position was taken into consideration. We included species abbreviations in the gene names (e.g. dreCmas). For hemichordates and fish, we used the nomenclature recommended for zebrafish (gene, cmas; protein, Cmas); for vertebrates in general, we used the mouse nomenclature (gene, Cmas; protein, CMAS). Total RNA was isolated from pooled 24 and 35 h post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated using the SuperScriptTM II cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Full open reading frames of drecmas1 and drecmas2 were amplified using specific primers (supplemental Table 2) and Phusion DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes). PCR products were subcloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Their identities were confirmed by sequencing. We subcloned drecmas1 and drecmas2 cDNAs into a modified pET22b-Strep vector allowing the expression of N-terminally Strep II-tagged (IBA) proteins. Primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 2. Recombinant dreCmas1 and dreCmas2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) at 15 °C in Power Broth (AthenaES) and purified by Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography (IBA). Peak fractions were desalted (HiPrep 26/10, GE Healthcare) and concentrated to 1–2 mg ml−1 in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Purified protein samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until required. Protein concentrations were determined using the absorption at 280 nm and the specific extinction coefficient calculated using the ProtParam tool. Size exclusion chromatography was performed as described previously using the abovementioned buffer (20Oschlies M. Dickmanns A. Haselhorst T. Schaper W. Stummeyer K. Tiralongo J. Weinhold B.

Following purification and size exclusion chromatography, Western blots were stained with Strep-Tactin-alkaline phosphate (AP) conjugate (IBA).

CTP, UTP, ATP, or GTP was used at final concentration 1000 μm, and Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, or KDN was used at 4000 μm. We subcloned drecmas1 and drecmas2 cDNAs into two different modified pcDNA3 vectors allowing the expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged or C-terminally Myc-V5-tagged proteins (supplemental Table 2). Deletion mutants were generated using overlap extension PCR (21Heckman K.L. Pease L.R. Gene splicing and mutagenesis by PCR-driven overlap extension.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) and Phusion Polymerase (Finnzymes) and subsequently cloned in the pcDNA3 vector with C-terminal Myc and V5 tag. Deletion primers were designed to delete nucleotide triplets encoding selected amino acids (supplemental Table 3). The functionality of wild-type and mutant dreCmas was analyzed in complementation studies using CHO LEC29.Lec32 cells as described previously (14Munster A.K. Weinhold B. Gotza B. Muhlenhoff M.

Transfected cells were harvested and subdivided into two aliquots, which were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in either the absence or the presence of 100 ng of endosialidase E to remove polySia. Equal protein amounts were separated by 7 and 10% SDS-PAGE, respectively. PolySia and dreCmas expression was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-polySia mAb 735 (5 μg/ml) (22Frosch M. Görgen I.

Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA using 3 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Diagnostics). The next day, cells were fixed in 80% acetone at −20 °C for 10 min (23Heppell J. Lorenzen N. Armstrong N.K. Wu T.

Accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract from isolated mammalian nuclei.Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). The extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies that were originally derived against murine CMAS and that specifically recognize the distinct dreCmas enzymes. 3M. Sellmeier, W. Schaper, B. Weinhold, R. Gerardy-Schahn, and A.-K. Münster-Kühnel, manuscript in preparation. Whole mount in situ hybridization of digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes was carried out according to standard protocols (27Schulte-Merker S. Ho R.K. Herrmann B.G. Nüsslein-Volhard C.

Thisse B. High-resolution in situ hybridization to whole mount zebrafish embryos.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). To generate specific probes, the 3′ regions of drecmas1 and drecmas2 were amplified by RT-PCR with specific primers (supplemental Table 2) and cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen). Antisense and sense (control) riboprobes were synthesized from linearized plasmids using the digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Pictures were taken using a Zeiss SteREO Lumar.V12 equipped with an AxioCam HRc camera. Images were edited with Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe). Analyses of the completely sequenced genome of D. rerio revealed two homologues of the cmas gene. The first is located on chromosome 4 (drecmas1). According to the current version of the D. rerio genome assemblage, the second gene (drecmas2) is split into two fragments situated on different strands but in direct proximity to each other on chromosome 25. These fragments covered a large portion of the cmas gene including the N-terminal and C-terminal portions, but with a gap of about 135 bp. As both fragments were found on different contigs, we hypothesized that they may represent an intact but incorrectly assembled gene. Indeed, we were able to amplify cDNAs of both drecmas genes by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers. The amplified drecmas1 cDNA encoded a protein of 430 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 48.2 kDa and was identical to that previously reported (accession number CAK18993). The amplified drecmas2 contained an open reading frame (ORF) that encoded a protein of 423 amino acids (calculated molecular mass of 47.7 kDa). At the primary sequence level, both proteins shared 56% identity. An alignment of D. rerio Cmas amino acid sequences with those of Mus musculus (mmuCMAS) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (omyCmas, rainbow trout) is presented in Fig. 1A and highlights identical residues in black and conserved residues in gray. Like all other known CMAS enzymes, both dreCmas sequences harbored five conserved primary sequence motifs (motifs I to V) in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1A). In line with other vertebrate CMAS enzymes, dreCmas1 and dreCmas2 possessed an additional C-terminal domain (Fig. 1A) composed of 173 and 175 amino acids, respectively. When compared with the N-terminal domains, the C-terminal domains showed less homology to the primary sequences of mmuCMAS and omyCmas. Protein structure prediction revealed homology to phosphatases of the haloacid dehalogenase family. However, phosphatase activity was not observed for either of the dreCmas enzymes in vitro (data not shown). Next, we addressed the question whether other fish species also possess two paralogues of the cmas gene. Analyses of the latest fish genome assemblages as well as of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) fish EST database did not give evidence for two different intact cmas genes in any of the species belonging to Euteleostei (as defined by Li et al.

In contrast, consistent with zebrafish, two sequence variants were found among ESTs of species belonging to the Otocephala clade, namely catfish (Ictalurus furcatus, Ictalurus punctatus) and the fathead minnow (P. promelas). The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree demonstrates that fish cmas genes segregated into two distinct clusters comprising cmas1 and cmas2, respectively (Fig. 1B). Both clades have a monophyletic origin and putatively originate from the ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) that occurred in Teleostei. To further specify the phylogenetic relationship between Cmas genes, we analyzed the syntenic organization of surrounding genomic regions. Within vertebrates, we found traces of conserved synteny surrounding the Cmas1 genes between zebrafish chromosome 4 and chicken chromosome 1 despite numerous translocations and inversions that presumably occurred in both lineages (Fig. 2A, left). A significant intragenomic synteny between zebrafish chromosomes 4 and 25 corroborated that both cmas genes were paralogues resulting from the WGD (Fig. 2A, right). In Euteleostei, cmas1 was excised from a homologue of the D. rerio chromosome 4 and transferred to a foreign location, whereas cmas2 was excised from the homologue of D. rerio chromosome 25 and lost (probably during translocation) (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 1). In summary, the two cmas genes most likely originated from the third WGD at the base of teleost radiation. During evolution, one cmas copy got lost in Euteleostei (e.g. rainbow trout), whereas both paralogues were maintained in fishes of the Otocephala clade (e.g. zebrafish).FIGURE 1Relations between selected vertebrate CMAS sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2054183206,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is essential for ensuring the proper attachment of kinetochores to the spindle and, thus, the precise separation of paired sister chromatids during mitosis. The SAC proteins are recruited to the unattached kinetochores for activation of the SAC in prometaphase. However, it has been less studied whether activation of the SAC also requires the proteins that do not localize to the kinetochores. Here, we show that the nuclear protein RED, also called IK, a down-regulator of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) II, interacts with the human SAC protein MAD1. Two RED-interacting regions identified in MAD1 are from amino acid residues 301-340 and 439-480, designated as MAD1(301-340) and MAD1(439-480), respectively. Our observations reveal that RED is a spindle pole-associated protein that colocalizes with MAD1 at the spindle poles in metaphase and anaphase. Depletion of RED can cause a shorter mitotic timing, a failure in the kinetochore localization of MAD1 in prometaphase, and a defect in the SAC. Furthermore, the RED-interacting peptides MAD1(301-340) and MAD1(439-480), fused to enhanced green fluorescence protein, can colocalize with RED at the spindle poles in prometaphase, and their expression can abrogate the SAC. Taken together, we conclude that RED is required for kinetochore localization of MAD1, mitotic progression, and activation of the SAC."

PTPα−/− mice have more oligodendrocyte lineage cells in embryonic forebrain and delayed OPC maturation. On the molecular level, PTPα-deficient mouse OPCs and rat CG4 cells have decreased Fyn and increased Ras, Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho activities, and reduced expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1. Moreover, Fyn was required to suppress Ras and Rho and for p27Kip1 accumulation, and Rho inhibition in PTPα-deficient cells restored expression of p27Kip1. We propose that PTPα-Fyn signaling negatively regulates OPC proliferation by down-regulating Ras and Rho, leading to p27Kip1 accumulation and cell cycle exit.

Receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) is a widely expressed transmembrane protein with two intracellular catalytic domains.

This raises the question of whether PTPα regulates other processes that appropriately position OPCs to differentiate, such as cell cycle exit. Indeed, PTPα has been shown to have positive and negative roles in growth control, which apparently depend on cell context. For example, PTPα overexpression activates Src and confers tumorigenic properties on fibroblasts (11Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J.

In OPCs, PTPα regulates Fyn activation and signaling during differentiation (21Wang P.S. Wang J. Xiao Z.C. Pallen C.J.

Fyn is reported to not be required for PDGF-mediated proliferation nor to be activated by FGF or PDGF treatment of OPCs (24Colognato H. Ramachandrappa S. Olsen I.M. ffrench-Constant C.

CG4 cells were seeded in CG4 proliferation medium (3 × 104/cm2). After overnight attachment, cells were incubated with 20 nm siRNA and Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen Canada) in OPTI-MEM I (Cat. 31985, Invitrogen) for 16–18 h followed by incubation in CG4 proliferation medium for indicated times. Ras activity was measured by GST-Raf1 RBD (Ras-binding domain) pull-down assays performed using the Ras Activation Assay Kit (Upstate, Temecula, CA). Rho activity was measured by GST-RhBD (Rhotekin-binding domain) pull-down assays performed using the Rho Activation Assay Kit (Upstate). Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were measured by GST-PBD (PAK-binding domain) pull-down assays (29Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. A brain serine/threonine protein kinase activated by Cdc42 and Rac1.Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed on ice by adding RIPA lysis buffer directly onto the cells. Cell lysates (50–100 μg) were incubated with 10 μg of GST-PBD bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Samples were washed with lysis buffer and then immunoblotted with anti-Rac1 and Cdc42 antibodies. Lysates were directly immunoblotted to determine the total amount of Ras, Rho, Rac1, or Cdc42 proteins. Levels of active Ras, Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 were normalized to those of total Ras, Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42. Densitometric quantification of immunoblots and cell differentiation data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA (single factor). Data obtained from three independent experiments are expressed as the mean ± S.D. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. Cell proliferation and differentiation are highly coordinated processes during development. If cells persist in the cell cycle, they do not differentiate properly. We used cultured primary OPCs isolated from WT and PTPα-null (PTPα−/−) mouse embryos to investigate the function of PTPα in progenitor cells as a regulator of proliferation, cell cycle exit, and survival. We first examined the growth of WT and PTPα−/− OPCs as oligospheres. Dissociated oligospheres (OPCs) were cultured in OPC proliferation medium for 5 days, and the newly formed oligospheres were examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, PTPα−/− oligospheres were larger than WT oligospheres. The oligospheres were counted and their size was measured, revealing that PTPα−/− cells formed more oligospheres, and that large (>100 μm) oligospheres comprised a significantly higher proportion of the total PTPα−/− oligosphere population than of the WT oligosphere population, suggesting that loss of PTPα may increase OPC self-renewal capability. The original oligospheres were derived from dissociated neurospheres, and neurospheres are motile and aggregate in culture (30Singec I. Knoth R. Meyer R.P. Maciaczyk J. Volk B. Nikkhah G. Frotscher M. Snyder E.Y. Defining the actual sensitivity and specificity of the neurosphere assay in stem cell biology.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the larger PTPα−/− oligospheres resulted from enhanced aggregation, or from the association of larger sized but similar numbers of individual cells, WT and PTPα−/− oligospheres were collected and dissociated, and total cell numbers were counted. The total cell number obtained from the dissociated PTPα−/− oligosphere population was higher than that obtained from the total WT oligosphere population (Fig. 1A), indicating a faster rate of PTPα−/− cell growth. To verify that PTPα−/− OPCs also grow faster than WT OPCs in adherent culture, oligospheres were dissociated and seeded on PDLO-coated dishes in OPC proliferation medium for 2 weeks. PTPα−/− OPCs grew to a higher density and formed larger colonies compared with WT OPCs (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the growth rate of PTPα−/− OPCs is faster than WT OPCs. The best-characterized mitogens for OPCs are PDGF and bFGF (1Baron W. Metz B. Bansal R. Hoekstra D. de Vries H.

Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 314-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and both PDGF and bFGF are survival factors for OPCs (2Barres B.A. Hart I.K. Coles H.S. Burne J.F. Voyvodic J.T.

In the oligosphere culture system, cells undergo self-renewing cell division in OPC proliferation medium, which contains PDGF and bFGF. We determined if PTPα−/− OPCs are hypersensitive to PDGF/bFGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1C, WT and PTPα−/− OPCs cannot form new spheres in the absence of these growth factors, but PTPα−/− OPCs can form more and larger new spheres at lower concentrations of growth factors than WT OPCs. This indicates that PTPα−/− OPCs are hypersensitive to PDGF/bFGF, but that PTPα loss did not render oligosphere formation growth factor-independent. The accumulation of large numbers of PTPα−/− OPCs may result from an increase in cell proliferation, a decrease in cell cycle exit and/or a decrease in cell death. To address which mechanism is affected by PTPα to regulate OPC growth, we assessed these parameters in WT and PTPα−/− OPCs. WT and PTPα−/− oligospheres were dissociated and seeded on PDLO-coated chamber slides in proliferation medium for 2 days followed by culture in fresh medium with or without PDGF/bFGF for another 24 h. BrdU incorporation was significantly increased in PTPα−/− OPCs compared with WT OPCs in the presence or absence of PDGF/bFGF (Fig. 2A). Ki-67 is a protein associated with proliferation that is present in cells that are within the cell cycle but not in cells that have exited the cell cycle. To address whether PTPα regulates cell cycle exit, immunofluorescent staining with antibody against Ki-67 was performed. This demonstrated that more PTPα−/− cells than WT cells are in the cell cycle in the presence of PDGF/bFGF (Fig. 2B). In addition, the percentage of Ki-67-positive WT cells decreased by 19.1% when the cells were cultured in the absence of PDGF/bFGF, while the percentage of Ki-67-positive PTPα−/− cells only decreased by 4.7% when these growth factors were absent (Fig. 2B). This indicates that PTPα−/− cells are more resistant to PDGF/bFGF withdrawal-induced cell cycle exit. We next determined if PDGF/bFGF-mediated survival is altered in PTPα−/− OPCs. For this, apoptosis was induced by withdrawal of supplement (including insulin) for 24 h while maintaining PDGF/bFGF, and the cells were labeled with the apoptosis marker, cleaved caspase-3. While the percentages of apoptotic cells in WT and PTPα−/− OPCs cultured under normal conditions (with supplement) showed a significant but small difference (WT, 26%; PTPα−/−, 21%), the withdrawal of supplement differentially enhanced apoptosis in the two cell types. The percentage of apoptotic WT OPCs increased to 45%, while the percentage of apoptotic PTPα−/− OPCs rose to only 25% (Fig. 2C). Therefore, PDGF/bFGF-mediated survival is increased in PTPα−/− OPCs. The inhibitory effect of PTPα on OPC proliferation raised the question of how early PTPα is expressed during development and whether it regulates the proliferation and cell cycle exit of cells at an earlier stage of differentiation. It has been shown that PTPα mRNA is not detectable in undifferentiated mouse embryonic pluripotent stem cells (P19 embryonic carcinoma cells), but is expressed in neuroectoderm-like cells (retinoic acid-treated P19 derivatives) (12den Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. Receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase α activates pp60c-src and is involved in neuronal differentiation.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression of PTPα protein in neurospheres composed of neural stem/progenitor cells was determined and compared with that in oligospheres composed of OPCs. PTPα protein and its potential substrate Fyn were detectable in neurospheres, but at lower levels than in oligospheres (3.3-fold less PTPα, 1.9-fold less Fyn; n = 2) (Fig. 3A). We next examined the expression of the proliferation marker PCNA in WT and PTPα−/− neurospheres and oligospheres. As shown in Fig. 3B, in contrast to the different expression levels of PCNA in WT and PTPα−/− oligospheres, PCNA expression levels are similar in WT and PTPα−/− neurospheres, suggesting that PTPα does not have a significant role in regulating proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells in response to EGF/bFGF. This finding was confirmed by determining BrdU incorporation and Ki-67 positivity, revealing that PTPα ablation does not significantly affect proliferation and cell cycle exit of neural stem/progenitor cells (Fig. 3C). Activation of PDGFRα promotes proliferation and inhibits premature differentiation of OPCs (5Raff M.C. Lillien L.E. Richardson W.D. Burne J.F.

No difference in PDGFRα expression was detected between PTPα−/− and WT oligospheres or OPCs (data not shown). Ras proteins are important downstream effectors of growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (31Karnoub A.E. Weinberg R.A. Ras oncogenes: split personalities.Nat. Rev. Mol.

We found that Ras activities were increased in both PTPα−/− oligospheres and OPCs compared with the WT cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that PTPα negatively regulates Ras activity in OPCs. Ras can activate at least three types of downstream effectors/signaling pathways; the Rho family small GTPases, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways (35Zhu Y. Parada L.F. The molecular and genetic basis of neurological tumours.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We next determined which of these were affected by PTPα ablation.

Syk binds to the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex and transduces the TCR-mediated signal in the cell more efficiently than the canonical CD3ζ chain. The reasons for the increased expression of Syk are unclear. In the present study, we found that Syk is regulated by the transcription factor c-Jun in cooperation with Ets2. c-Jun and Ets2 bound to the SYK promoter in close proximity and increased the promoter activity in a specific manner. Disruption of c-Jun and Ets2 expression by siRNA resulted in decreased expression of Syk. Overexpression of c-Jun but not Ets2 resulted in increase in Syk protein. c-Jun and Ets2 co-immunoprecipitated and had an additive effect on Syk expression. c-Jun-driven SYK promoter activation showed a similar pattern in B cells; however, as expected, basal promoter activity was much higher in B cells as compared with T cells. Overexpression of c-Jun led to increase in intracytoplasmic calcium flux following TCR stimulation. Moreover, we found that SLE T cells had increased levels of c-Jun at baseline and phosphorylated c-Jun upon activation. Finally, disruption of c-Jun and Ets2 in SLE T cells resulted in a decrease in calcium flux upon TCR stimulation. In conclusion, c-Jun in cooperation with Ets2 increases the expression of Syk and contributes to Syk-mediated heightened calcium responses in SLE T cells."
