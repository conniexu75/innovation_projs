These findings suggest that the pan-cultural element in facial displays of emotion is the association between facial muscular movements and discrete primary emotions, although cultures may still differ in what evokes an emotion, in rules for controlling the display of emotion, and in behavioral consequences."

Recall of immediately following events is not affected. This retrograde interference is time dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2012851697,"Four forms of mole rats with diploid numbers of chromosomes of 52, 54, 58, and 60, respectively, were found in Israel and the vicinity. The differences between the chromosome sets are due to whole-arm (Robertsonian) changes and pericentric inversions. The geographic distribution of the different forms is contiguous. Only a few hybrid individuals have been discovered. These chromosome forms are tentatively considered as sibling species, almost completely isolated by cytogenetic and possibly ethological mechanisms. The weak dispersal powers of mole rats may have contributed to a rapid fixation of adaptive homozygous chromosomal changes."

Brain tissue from the patient, in contrast to normal brain tissue, contained essentially no thiamine triphosphate, although thiamine and its other phosphate esters were present in normal concentrations. These findings suggest a relation between this disease and thiamine triphosphate."

Recruitment efficiency increases as odor of the food source accumulates in the hive, from hour to hour and from day to day. Flight patterns, landing patterns, bee odor, and Nassanoff secretion apparently do not aid in recruitment of bees."

https://openalex.org/W1545845876,"Alkali ion complex formation by the cyclic depsipeptide, valinomycin, has been studied by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Characteristic perturbations of the positions and fine structures of the resonances of the protons of specific groups were observed upon complextion of the valinomycin with KCNS and CsCNS in CDCI3. Small amounts of water did not affect the structure of the complexes as judged by nuclear magnetic resonance spectral criteria. Preliminary studies were carried out on the rates of complexation and decomplexation using the broadening of the lactate methyl proton resonances. A measurable rate of transfer of the complexed cation between valinomycin molecules in 80% CH3OH, 20% CDCl3, was observed while no measurable exchange rate was observed in pure CDCl3. These results are consistent with valinomycin functioning as a mobile ion carrier in biological membrane systems."

https://openalex.org/W1496853746,"Abstract β-1,4-Oligoglucan:orthophosphate glucosyltransferase from Clostridium thermocellum has been purified nearly 450-fold by a procedure which removes all known interfering enzymes. The enzyme catalyzes the phosphorolysis of cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and cellohexaose. Although cellobiose is an excellent glucosyl acceptor, the enzyme is unable to catalyze either the synthesis or the phosphorolysis of this disaccharide. The product formed in a reaction mixture with α-d-glucose-1-P as the glucosyl donor and cellobiose as the glucosyl acceptor has been isolated and identified as cellotriose. The enzyme is active on the following glucosyl acceptors: cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, cellohexaose, cellobiitol, 4-O-β-d-glucosyl-d-altrose, 4-O-β-d-glucosyl-2-deoxy-d-glucose, 4-O-β-d-glucosyl-d-mannose, 4-O-β-d-glucosyl-d-xylose, and laminaritriose. The enzyme catalyzes the arsenolysis of cellotriose; however, no exchange occurs between glucose-1-P and Pi or arsenate. The apparent Km values are 1.2 mm for cellobiose and 4.7 mm for glucose-1-P. The apparent Km value is about 1.0 mm for cellotriose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose, and the apparent Km value is 0.37 mm for cellohexaose. The apparent Km value for Pi, determined during the phosphorolysis of different cellodextrins, is 0.13 mm with cellotriose, 0.19 mm with cellotetraose, 0.24 mm with cellopentaose, and 0.26 mm with cellohexaose. The pH optimum for the synthesis of cellotriose is about 7.5. The purified enzyme is inactive in the absence of thiol compounds such as cysteine or dithiothreitol. Sodium sulfite activates the enzyme, but it is not as effective as cysteine or dithiothreitol. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate, adenine nucleotides, sugar phosphates, and d-glucose had no effect on the activity of the enzyme. There appears to be no requirement for any dissociable cofactors."

https://openalex.org/W1604395889,"Deuterated and tritiated ethanolamine and H218O were used to study the mechanism of the conversion of ethanolamine to acetaldehyde and ammonia catalyzed by ethanolamine deaminase, a coenzyme-B12-dependent enzyme. An isotope effect of 6.8 was shown in the deamination of deuterated ethanolamine, indicating that the rate-limiting step involves the transfer of hydrogen. However, the fact that the tritium isotope effect was only 5.8 in the face of the deuterium isotope effect of 6.8 suggested the possibility of a large secondary isotope effect in the reactions conducted with deuterated substrate. The conversion of ethanolamine to acetaldehyde was shown to take place with the transfer of hydrogen from the carbinol carbon to the amino carbon without exchange with water. Both intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer appear to take place. Moreover, it was shown that, in carrying out this transfer, the enzyme was capable of distinguishing between the 2 hydrogen atoms on the carbinol carbon. Experiments with deuterated ethanolamine confirmed the previous observation that the carbinol carbon of the substrate becomes the carbonyl carbon of acetaldehyde. Experiments conducted in H218O showed that the oxygen atom of the substrate is retained in the product."

https://openalex.org/W2037814086,"BECAUSE most of the previous work published on aromatic amines in relation to Parkinson's disease was on either dopamine1–8, tyramine9,10 or tryptamine11, and was only qualitative or semi-quantitative, we thought it would be of value to carry out a quantitative analysis of all three amines in the urine of normal and Parkinsonian patients. Because of the different aetiologies, we restricted our study to the idiopathic type of the disease—paralysis agitans. Our methods were chiefly fluorimetric and the results were reproducible. Dopamine was measured by a slightly modified method of Sourkes and Murphy12, tryptamine by the method of Sjoerdsma et al.13 and free tyramine by ethyl acetate extraction of alkaline urine, followed by paper chromatography, location, extraction of the area of paper and nitroso-naphthol fluorescence read spectrophotofluorimetrically."

The purified polypeptide appears to be homogeneous by the criteria of electrophoresis on paper and starch gel, column and paper chromatography, ultracentrifugation, and amino acid analysis. It consists of 89 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 9170. The purified peptide contains all of the usual amino acids except histidine and tryptophan. There are 14 glycyl, 13 glutamyl, 7 seryl, 7 alanyl, 7 leucyl, 6 prolyl, 6 cystinyl, 5 argininyl, 5 aspartyl, 3 phenylalanyl, and 1 or 2 of each of the other residues. Its isoelectric point is estimated to be about pH 5.8. It is devoid of pressor and oxytocic activity but has the ability to bind lysine vasopressin, oxytocin, and synthetic analogues of oxytocin. However, the performic acid-oxidized polypeptide fails to bind either lysine vasopressin or oxytocin."
https://openalex.org/W2093239717,"Rabbits treated with LSD 25 exhibit characteristic signs of hyper-excitability, increased peripheral sympathetic activity, and hyperthermia. When the rabbits received prior treatment with DL-(alpha)-methyl-p-tyrosine, the excitation and sympathetic actions of LSD 25 were abolished or attenuated, but the hyperthermia was unchanged from that of the controls. Concentrations of norepinephrine in brain stems of treated rabbits were greatly decreased. The excitation of central nervous system and sympathomimetic actions of LSD 25 in the rabbit are apparently mediated by norepinephrine, whereas the hyperthermic action functions. through a nonadrenergic mechanism."

This suggests that the adenosine triphosphate concentration is one of the factors involved in the control of ribonucleic acid biosynthesis in infant and adult rat brain. Acetoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate is about 70 percent as effective as glucose, with both infant and adult brain, for the promotion of ribonucleic acid biosynthesis. but they are considerably mnore effective than succinate in infant brain than in adult brain."
