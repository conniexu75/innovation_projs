https://openalex.org/W1976292067,"Carbon, nutrient, and water balance as well as key plant and soil processes were simultaneously monitored for humid tropical plant communities treated with CO(2)-enriched atmospheres. Despite vigorous growth, no significant differences in stand biomass (of both the understory and overstory), leaf area index, nitrogen or water consumption, or leaf stomatal behavior were detected between ambient and elevated CO(2) treatments. Major responses under elevated CO(2) included massive starch accumulation in the tops of canopies, increased fine-root production, and a doubling of CO(2) evolution from the soil. Stimulated rhizosphere activity was accompanied by increased loss of soil carbon and increased mineral nutrient leaching. This study points at the inadequacy of scaling-up from physiological baselines to ecosystems without accounting for interactions among components, and it emphasizes the urgent need for whole-system experimental approaches in global-change research."
https://openalex.org/W2057349631,"Laser vaporization experiments with graphite in a supersonic cluster beam apparatus indicate that the smallest fullerene to form in substantial abundance is C(28). Although ab initio quantum chemical calculations predict that this cluster will favor a tetrahedral cage structure, it is electronically open shell. Further calculations reveal that C(28) in this structure should behave as a sort of hollow superatom with an effective valence of 4. This tetravalence should be exhibited toward chemical bonding both on the outside and on the inside of the cage. Thus, stable closed-shell derivatives of C(28) with large highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps should be attainable either by reacting at the four tetrahedral vertices on the outside of the C(28) cage to make, for example, C(28)H(4), or by trapping a tetravalent atom inside the cage to make endothedral fullerenes such as Ti@C(28). An example of this second, inside route to C(28) stabilization is reported here: the laser and carbon-arc production of U@C(28)."

The resulting increase of internal pressure is manifested by the sustained streams of bubbles (up to 37 percent methane and 6 percent carbon dioxide) that escape when emerging leaves are torn in the spring. Methane continues to enter the roots and rhizome during summer, rapidly moves up the petioles, and passes out through the emergent leaves into the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2097784196,"Galileo images of Gaspra reveal it to be an irregularly shaped object (19 by 12 by 11 kilometers) that appears to have been created by a catastrophic collisional disruption of a precursor parent body. The cratering age of the surface is about 200 million years. Subtle albedo and color variations appear to correlate with morphological features: Brighter materials are associated with craters especially along the crests of ridges, have a stronger 1-micrometer absorption, and may represent freshly excavated mafic materials; darker materials exhibiting a significantly weaker 1-micrometer absorption appear concentrated in interridge areas. One explanation of these patterns is that Gaspra is covered with a thin regolith and that some of this material has migrated downslope in some areas."
https://openalex.org/W2053512144,Some Rhizobium strains synthesize a unidirectional hydrogenase system in legume nodule bacteroids; this system participates in the recycling of hydrogen that otherwise would be lost as a by-product of the nitrogen fixation process. Soybeans inoculated with Rhizobium japonicum strains that synthesized the hydrogenase system fixed significantly more nitrogen and produced greater yields than plants inoculated with strains lacking hydrogen-uptake capacity. Rhizobium strains used as inocula for legumes should have the capability to synthesize the hydrogenase system as one of their desirable characteristics.
https://openalex.org/W2032225896,"A new formulation of the current within the London approximation allows the calculation of ring currents in topologically complex molecules. Application of this theory to C(60) demonstrates the existence of remarkable pi electron ring currents. Paramagnetic currents, in size comparable to the ones in benzene, flow within the pentagons, whereas weaker diamagnetic currents flow all around the C.(60) molecule. The overall vanishing ring-current magnetic susceptibility results from a cancellation of diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions. The presence of ring currents significantly affects chemical shifts as measured in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. In contrast to the magnetic susceptibility, which is a property of the molecule as a whole, chemical shifts are sensitive to the local magnetic field and the effect of ring currents does not vanish."
https://openalex.org/W2011800427,"The hypothesis is made that rapid depressurization of hot, saturated liquids may result in an explosion. The temperature of the hot liquid must, however, be above the superheat limit temperature at 1 atmosphere, and the drop in tank pressure must be very rapid. Two examples of large-scale pressure-letdown explosions are cited and possible preventative measures suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2059633391,"An in situ Upper Permian fossil forest in the central Transantarctic Mountains near the Beardmore Glacier includes 15 permineralized trunks in growth position; the paleolatitude of the site was approximately 80 degrees to 85 degrees south. Numerous leaves of the seed fern Glossopteris are present in the shale in which the trunks are rooted. The trunks are permineralized and tree rings reveal that the forest was a rapidly growing and young forest, persisting in an equable, strongly seasonal climate-a scenario that does not fit with some climate reconstructions for this time period."
https://openalex.org/W2094898133,"Ammonia release by plants growing in normal air is reported. Contrary to observations made at high ambient ammonia concentrations, corn plants did not absorb ammonia in normal air but released it as they senesced, even while photosynthesizing actively."
https://openalex.org/W2047978614,"The tropopause can be detected and its altitude determined routinely with the use of meter-wavelength, very-high-frequency radar. At meter wavelengths and at vertical incidence, the tropopause is revealed by partial specular reflection from stable atmospheric layers. The echoes received at vertical incidence as a result of partial specular reflection are greatly enhanced over echoes received at oblique incidence arising from turbulent scatter. Very-high-frequency radars utilizing partial specular reflection promise a major advance in the remote sensing of the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2021350880,"Rock art is seldom recovered from sealed archeological contexts and is therefore difficult to date or integrate with other artifactual assemblages. South African engravings, found on low rocks at open-air sites, exemplify the problem. Multiscale spatial study of technique, thematic variation, faunal content, geoarcheological paterning, settlement history, and ethno-archeological setting provides coherent information on environment, time, and group identity. The major periods of naturalistic animal engravings coincide with wetter and warmer climates abot 3200 to 2500 and 2250 to 1800 years before present, but the earliest engravings may be older than 4000 years. Geometric designs were favored after 1300 years before present, when climate was drier and when one identity-conscious population of Bushman engravers first encountered domesticated animals."
https://openalex.org/W2004809321,"The Quelccaya Ice Cap in the easternmost glaciated mountain chain of the Peruvian Andes has been studied in four recentfield seasons. Ice cores to a depth of 15 meters have been retrieved at the summit dome (elevation, 5650 meters) and two other locations and used for microparticle, isotope, and beta radioactivity measurements. A concurrent study of the present climate and the heat and mass budgets is being made to permit a paleoclimatic interpretation of deep core records. The results indicate the need for a revision of the isotope ""thermometry"" for application in the tropics. However, the seasonality of the beta radioactivity, microparticle content, and isotope ratios offers the prospect of a mass balance chronology. This is important in that precipitation is believed to be a more indicative paleoclimatic parameter than temperature in the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W1998446550,Remeasurement of a triangulation network in the southern part of the New Madrid seismic zone with the Global Positioning System has revealed rapid crustal strain accumulation since the 1950s. This area experienced three large (moment magnitudes >8) earthquakes in 1811 to 1812. The orientation and sense of shear is consistent with right-lateral strike slip motion along a northeast-trending fault zone (as indicated by current seismicity). Detection of crustal strain accumulation may be a useful discriminant for identifying areas where potentially damaging intraplate earthquakes may occur despite the absence of large earthquakes during historic time.
https://openalex.org/W1990912201,"Before the launch of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), the only source of >100-megaelectron volt (MeV) gamma radiation known outside our galaxy was the quasar 3C 273. After less than a year of observing, 13 other extragalactic sources have been discovered with the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on CGRO, and it is expected that many more will be found before the full sky survey is complete. All 14 sources show evidence of blazar properties at other wavelengths; these properties include high optical polarization, extreme optical variability, flat-spectrum radio emission associated with a compact core, and apparent superluminal motion. Such properties are thought to be produced by those few, rare extragalactic radio galaxies and quasars that are favorably aligned to permit us to look almost directly down a relativistically outflowing jet of matter expelled from a supermassive black hole. Although the origin of the gamma rays from radio jets is a subject of much controversy, the gamma-ray window probed by CGRO is providing a wealth of knowledge about the central engines of active galactic nuclei and the most energetic processes occurring in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2092161357,"When two bodies of liquid merge, their interfaces must also rupture and rearrange into one. Virtually no information is available concerning the small-scale dynamics of this process. Molecular dynamics simulations of coalescence in systems of about 10,000 Lennard-Jones particles have been performed, arranged so as to mimic laboratory experiments on dense liquids. The coalescence event begins when molecules near the boundary of one liquid body thermally fluctuate into the range of attraction of the other, forming a string of mutually attracting molecules. These molecules gradually thicken into a tendril, which continues to thicken as the bodies smoothly combine in a zipper-like merger."
https://openalex.org/W1988345239,"The economic feasibility in 1977 and 1978 of solar water and combined water and space heating is analyzed for single-family detached residences and multi-family apartment buildings in four representative U.S. cities: Boston, Massachusetts; Washington, D.C.; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Los Angeles, California. Three economic decision criteria are utilized: payback period, years to recovery of down payment, and years to net positive cash flow. The cost competitiveness of the solar systems compared to heating systems based on electricity, fuel oil, and natural gas is then discussed for each city, and the impact of the federal tax credit for solar energy systems is assessed. It is found that even without federal incentives some solar water and space heating systems are competitive. Enactment of the solar tax credit, however, greatly enhances their competitiveness. The implications of these findings for government tax and energy pricing policies are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2129275894,"Earth's climate system has ridden a slow roller coaster for the past 60 million years. It warmed gradually until about 53 million years ago, reaching a peak that brought crocodiles to northern Canada; then it entered a long, undulating downgrade toward the ice-age world of the past few million years. Because the same span of time brought major evolutionary changes, including the rise of modern mammals, paleontologists have long assumed that these slow temperature changes helped spur the processes of evolution. But recent findings have suggested that another, more potent mechanisms was also at work: Abrupt climate excursions, superimposed on these long-term trends, have now been linked to rapid periods of mammal evolution. The evidence for short, sharp evolutionary shocks comes from studies of a pair of mirror-image climate shifts at opposite ends of the Eocene epoch, 55 million and 33.5 million years ago. In both cases, researchers studying the record of climate preserved in sea-floor sediments have found that a gradual climate change-warming in the first case, cooling in the second - suddenly steepened into a short-lived pulse of extreme warming or cooling. The short time scale of these events and their clear coincidence with turning points in themore » evolution of mammals are providing the tightest links yet between global climate change and evolution on land.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1987046974,"Exsolution between orthorhombic and monoclinic amphibole has been postulated for many years on the basis of crystal-chemical and structural differences. Transmission and analytical electron microscope examination of calium-rich gedrite specimens from southwestern New Hampshire has now revealed evidence for exsolution of calcic clinoamphibole (hornblende) from ferromagnesian orthoamphibole. Analytical electron microscopy data suggests that calcium has a low solubility limit in the orthoamphibole structure. The hornblende lamellae range from only a few unit cells in thickness to about 80 nanometers. The formation of the calcic amphibole lamellae resulted from heterogeneous nucleation and growth along pre-existing (100) stacking faults. Thus, the deformation processes producing the stacking faults played a key role in preparing the sites for exsolution."
