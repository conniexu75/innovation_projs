https://openalex.org/W1673932087,"The distribution of coenzyme A and carnitine between the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments was determined in rat heart ventricular muscle. The CoA and carnitine levels of homogenate, mitochondrial, and postmitochondrial fractions were determined in nonperfused hearts and in hearts that were perfused under control and ischemic conditions. Using the mitochondrial marker enzymes, citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase, the cellular content of mitochondrial protein was determined to be 53 +/- 1.0 (nonperfused), 53.5 +/- 1.5 (control), and 58.1 +/- 2.2 (ischemic) mg/g of wet heart muscle. These values were used to calculate the contribution of the CoA and carnitine located in the mitochondrial compartment to the total cellular levels of CoA and carnitine. Under both control and ischemic conditions, approximately 95% of the cellular CoA was mitochondrial. The percentage of the total cellular carnitine associated with the mitochondria increased from 8 to 9% in nonperfused and control hearts to 25% during ischemia, indicating that a net transfer of carnitine occurred from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1580002784,"Superoxide anion, generated by xanthine oxidase within vesicles formed from washed erythrocyte ghosts, crosses the vesicle membrane to reduce cytochrome c in the medium (Lynch, R. E., and Fridovich, I. (1978) J. Biol. Chem, 253, 1838-1845). To determine whether O2- could travel through the membrane in the channel for the exchange of stable anions, the effects of two specific inhibitors of anion exchange, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano-2,2' disulfonic acid stilbene (SITS) and 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2' disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS), on the escape of O2- from vesicles were studied. The reduction of external cytochrome c, caused by O2- produced by the enzymic turnover of internal xanthine oxidase, was 85 to 90% inhibited by SITS and DIDS. If SITS impeded the egress of O2- from vesicles, it should enhance the internal effects of O2- and antagonize the inhibition of these effects by external superoxide dismutase. External superoxide dismutase inhibited the lysis of vesicles containing xanthine oxidase. SITS (60 micron) partially reversed this inhibition. It appears that O2- can cross the membrane of the erythrocyte in the anion channel."
https://openalex.org/W2093581903,"By means of antiserum (purified by affinity chromatography) directed against adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) 11-24, cell bodies and beaded axons were visualized in rat brain. The ACTH-like immunoreactivity (ACTH-LI) was primarily located in the hypothalamus (cells and axons). Fibers were scattered throughout thalamus, amygdala, periaqueductal gray area, and reticular formation. There was no change in the distribution of ACTH-LI in rats that had been subjected to hypophysectomy. This distribution of ACTH-LI parallels that of beta-lipotropin and is altered by specific lesions in a similar fashion. The presence of ACTH-LI in cells and beaded axons in brain raises the possibility that it is a neuroregulator functioning as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, or neurohormone."

https://openalex.org/W1591104929,"The steroidogenic pathway in normal and gonadotropin-desensitized Leydig cells was analyzed by radioimmunoassay of steroid intermediates during hormonal stimulation in vitro to characterize the block in steroid biosynthesis caused by intravenous injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (1 to 10 cg). Such cells exhibit dose-dependent loss of receptors after gonadotropin treatment, and a simultaneous defect in steroidogenesis that prevents maximum testosterone production during subsequent hormone stimulation. In normal cells pregnenolone was metabolized to androstenedione as the major precursor for testosterone. In the presence of cyanoketone, pregnenolone metabolism was diverted through the As pathway to form androstenediol. This sequence could be prevented by addition of spironolactone to inhibit 17a-hydroxylation, and quantitative assays of pregnenolone formation were performed in cells incubated with cyanoketone and spironolactone. The sensitivity of the pregnenolone response to gonadotropin in vitro was similar to that of testosterone (EDso = 0.2 PM hCG), but the kinetics of pregnenolone formation were more rapid. The inhibitory effects of cycloheximide and actinomycin D on gonadotropin-induced testosterone production were also evident when pregnenolone production was measured, locating the inhibitor-sensitive step at the earliest portion of the steroidogenic pathway. In gonadotropin-desensitized Leydig cells, the extent and nature of the block in steroidogenesis was correlated with hCG dose and the subsequent degree of receptor loss. After treatment with 1 pg of hCG, leading to loss of 70% of the receptors, testosterone production during stimulation by hCG, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3’:5’-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and choleragen was reduced by 60%, and pregnenolone formation was normal or elevated. Therefore, the steroidogenic block was beyond pregnenolone synthesis, and was not dependent on impairment of cyclic AMP formation and availability. After treatment with 10 pg of hCG, leading to 90% receptor loss, testosterone production was correspondingly low, and pregnenolone formation was reduced by 50%. More extensive receptor loss (-99%) produced by higher hCG doses was accompanied by abolition of both testosterone and pregnenolone responses to hormone. In the presence of cyanoketone, desensitized cells with up to 70% receptor loss formed pregnenolone and 17a-hydroxypregnenolone during hormone stimulation, whereas progesterone and 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, pregnenolone, and 17a-hydroxypregnenolone"

https://openalex.org/W2017592191,"The replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is inhibited by tunicamycin (TM), an antibiotic that blocks the formation of N-acetylglucosaminelipid intermediates. We had shown previously that the viral glycoprotein (G) synthesized in cells treated with TM is not glycosylated and is not found on the outer surface of the cell plasma membrane. In this report, we shown that cells exposed to TM produce a low yield of infectious particles. The yield is increased when the temperature during infection is lowered from 37 to 30 degrees C. At 30 degrees C in the presence of TM, both wild-type VSV and the temperature-sensitive mutant ts045 produce particles that do not bind to concanavalin A Sepharose and contain only the nonglycosylated form of G. These particles have a specific infectivity (pfu/cpm) comparable to that of VSV containing glycosylated G."

The leader is transcribed from DNA between 0.723 and 0.762 map units while the VP1 coding transcript is copied from DNA from 0.94 to 0.17 map units. The leader sequence joins the transcript of the coding region at a position 42 nucleotides upstream from the initiator codon for VP1 by a 3':5'-phosphodiester linkage. Longer leader sequences also occur in a portion of SV40 late mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2140317621,"Abstract Infection of chicken fibroblasts with avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) strain ES4 or with avian myelocytomatosis virus strain MC29 leads to a rapid morphological transformation of most cells. AEV-transformed fibroblasts are similar to Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-transformed fibroblasts in that they exhibit microvilli at their surface, show a disappearance of actin cables, are agglutinable by lectins, and show a decrease in LETS protein and an increase in the rate of hexose uptake. They also elicit slightly increased levels of cell-associated proteolytic activity, but show no increase in the fibrinolytic activity of the harvest fluids. In addition, as shown previously, they are capable of anchorage-independent growth and of sarcoma induction. In contrast, MC29-transformed fibroblasts express a different pattern of transformation parameters. They are similar to both RSV- and AEV-transformed fibroblasts in that they are morphologically transformed, show a disappearance of actin cables and are agglutinable by lectins. They also elicit surface alterations which consist of bleb-like protrusions rather than of microvilli, and are capable of anchorage-independent growth. They are strikingly different from RSV- and AEV-transformed cells, however, in that they express normal levels of LETS protein and elicit no increase in the rate of hexose uptake or in proteolytic activity. They are not sarcomagenic although they show an accelerated growth rate in culture. In conjunction with the finding that MC29 and AEV do not contain sequences related to the fibroblast-transforming src gene of RSV, these results raise the possibility that MC29 and perhaps also AEV transform fibroblasts by a mechanism different from RSV."

MV12/28, which overproduced the dnaB gene product 10-fold (Wickner, S. H., Wickner, R. B., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1976) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 70, 389-396) and by taking advantage of the enzyme's high affinity for both DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose. The most highly purified fractions gave a single stained band on native, polyacrylamide gels and dnaB enzymatic activity was coincident with this band. On denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, a single band was observed corresponding to a molecular weight of 48,000 +/- 2,000. The native molecular weight of 290,000 +/- 12,000 was calculated from determinations of the sedimentation coefficient, which was 11.3 S, and the Stokes radius, which was 60 A. Cross-linking the protein with dimethyl suberimidate yielded six bands. We conclude that the enzyme consists of six identical subunits. The apparent pI was 4.9 and the amino acid composition was typical except for the absence of cysteine."

https://openalex.org/W1492788909,"The deoxyribonuclease induced in KB cells by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2 has been purified. Both enzymes are able to completely degrade single- and double-stranded DNA yielding 5'-monophosphonucleotides as the sole products. A divalent cation, either Mg2+ or Mn2+, is an absolute requirement for catalysis and a reducing agent is necessary for enzyme stability. The maximum rate of reaction is achieved with 5 mM MgCl2 for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNase. The optimum concentration for Mn2+ is 0.1 to 0.2 mM and no exonuclease activity is observed when the concentration of Mn2+ is greater than 1 mM. The rate of reaction at the optimal Mg2+ concentration is 3- to 5-fold greater than that at the optimal Mn2+ concentration. In the presence of Mg2+, the enzymes are inhibited upon the addition of Mn2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+. The enzymatic reaction is also inhibited by spermine and spermidine, but not by putrescine. Crude and purified HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNase can degrade both HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA, but native HSV-1 DNA is hydrolyzed at only 22% of the rate and HSV-2 DNA at only 32% of the rate of Escherichia coli DNA. Although HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNase were similar, minor differences were observed in most other properties such as pH optimum, inhibition by high ionic strength, activation energy, and sedimentation coefficient. However, the enzymes differ immunologically."
https://openalex.org/W1992010441,"Laying hens maintained on 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as their sole source of vitamin D produce eggs which appear normal but which produce embryos having a defective upper mandible and which die at 18 to 19 days of embryonic life. Hens maintained on 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, on the other hand, produce normal embryos. Hens fed a vitamin D deficient diet produce eggs which develop the same embryonic defect. Injection of the affected eggs from the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 fed hens with vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 greatly increases the percentage of normal embryos. It therefore appears that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is not transferred from hen to egg in sufficient amounts to support embryonic development and that vitamin D or its metabolites, or both, are necessary for normal chick embryo development."

https://openalex.org/W2086752273,"When dUTP replaced dTTP during polyoma DNA replication in isolated cell nuclei, radioactivity from labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates was almost exclusively recovered in very short Okazaki fragments and incorporation ceased after a short time. Addition of uracil, a known inhibitor of the enzyme uracil-DNA glycosidase (Lindahl et al., 1977), increased total synthesis and shifted the incorporation to longer progeny strands. The presence of as little as 2.5% of dUTP in a dTTP-containing system gave a distinct increase in isotope incorporation into Okazaki pieces accompanied by a corresponding decrease in longer strands. This effect was reversed completely by uracil. The short strands formed from dUTP could be chased efficiently into long strands. Our results suggest that dUTP can be incorporated in place of dTTP into polyoma DNA, and that polyoma-infected nuclei, similar to E. coli (Tye et al., 1977), contain an excision-repair system which by removal of uracil causes strand breakage and under certain circumstances may contribute to the formation of Okazaki fragments."
https://openalex.org/W66521737,"We have developed a rapid autoradiographic screening assay for detecting diglyceride kinase in colonies of Escherichia coli and have isolated four strains lacking this enzyme. The gene (designated dgk) which is altered in these mutants is cotransduceable with the malB locus, near minute 90 on the chromosome. The membranes of strain RZ60 (which carries the dgk-6 lesion) contain substantial amounts of 1,2-diglyceride, representing approximately 8% of the total lipid. In contrast, wild type cells of E. coli (dgk+) only contain about 0.5% 1,2-diglyceride. The phospholipid composition of these mutants is not dramatically altered, and they are not temperature sensitive for growth. However, strains bearing the dgk-6 mutation do not grow well on nutrient media of low osmolarity. This can be corrected by the inclusion of 1% NaCl or 0.5 M sucrose. These results suggest that 1,2-diglyceride is the true substrate for the kinase in vivo and that the kinase functions as a minor route for phosphatidic acid synthesis. Genetic modification of the diglyceride content of the E. coli membrane has not been reported previously."

One of the cell lines is able to complement the functional defect found in two temperature-sensitive mutants of HSV 1, and reversion of the cells to a thymidine kinase-negative phenotype results in the loss of this capability. The HSV thymidine kinase gene can also be introduced into LMTK- cells using DNA extracted from transformed cells, and the high efficiency of this procedure suggests that the state of the virus DNA in transformed cells is different from that of DNA in virus particles."

Two cytochrome c oxidase-less nuclear mutants previously described from this laboratory each lack one or more mitochondrially synthesized cytochrome c oxidase subunits while possessing all four cytoplasmically synthesized subunits of that enzyme. The subunits remaining in these mutants were not assembled with each other; the cytoplasmically made subunits IV and VI could be released from the mitochondria by sonic oscillation, in contrast to the situation in wild type cells. No electrophoretically detectable alterations were found in any of the cytochrome c oxidase subunits present in the mutants. Nuclear mutations may thus cause both a loss as well as a defective assembly of mitochondrially made cytochrome c oxidase subunits."

Purine ribonucleoside triphosphates were the preferred substrates, but all ribonucleoside triphosphates were cleaved at the gamma position to yield ribonucleoside diphosphates and Pi. The enzyme required Mg2+, which could be replaced by Mn2+ but with lower activity. The pH optimum was 7.5 in either Tris-HCl or phosphate buffer. The Km for MgATP was 0.59 mM and the Vmax was 8.7 nmol/min/microgram of protein at 30 degrees. The DNA requirement was best satisfied with either fd or phiX174 single-stranded DNA (Km 0.033 mM nucleotides); maximal rate of nucleoside diphosphate formation occurred with 1 dnaB molecule/fd or phiX174 single-stranded DNA molecule. The dnaB gene product was found to have hysteretic properties and the hysteresis appeared to be due to a dissociation and reassociation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2042525775,"A new class of endogenous primate type C virus has been isolated from a continuous tissue culture line of Macaca arctoides cells by co-cultivation with a human cell line. The virus, designated MAC-1, can be transmitted to human and feline cells in tissue culture, and is unrelated, by immunological and nucleic acid hybridization criteria, to previously characterized retroviral isolates of primates. In particular, MAC-1 shows no detectable homology to the baboon type C viruses, even though viral genes related to the latter group are readily detected in M. arctoides cellular DNA. Viral gene sequences related to the MAC-1 genome are present in multiple copies (50-150 per haploid genome) in Old World primates, and are expressed in the cellular RNAs of uninfected and ""virus-free"" primate cells and tissues. Thus there are at least two distinct sets of genetically transmitted Old World primate type C viral genes, each of which is found in multiple copies in normal primate cellular DNA. With the description of this new retrovirus, there are now a minimum of five distinct genetically transmitted viruses of primates, three type C and type D, each represented in multiple copies in the normal cellular DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1509641857,"An inhibitor protein of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase is demonstrated in bovine brain extract and separated from modulator binding protein, a recently discovered inhibitory factor of phosphodiesterase. The new inhibitor protein is similar to the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor from bovine retina (Dumler, I. L., and Etingof, F. N. 1976) Biochim. Biophys, Acta 429, 474-484) in its heat stability: it retains full activity upon heating in a boiling water bath for 2 min. The new inhibitor protein counteracts the activation of the Ca2+-activatable cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase by the Ca2+-dependent modulator protein without affecting the basal activity of the enzyme. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase by the inhibitor can be reversed by high concentrations of modulator protein but is not influenced by a 20-fold increase in Ca2+ concentration. In contrast, a Ca2+-independent form of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase is not inhibited by the inhibitor protein. These results suggest that the heat-stable inhibitor protein is specific against the action of the Ca2+-dependent modulator protein. Gel filtration analyses on Sephadex G-75 and G-100 columns have shown that the inhibitor protein and the modulator protein may associate in the presence of Ca2+. The molecular weights determined by the gel filtration for the free inhibitor protein and the complex of the inhibitor and modulator protein are about 70,000 and 85,000, respectively."

Furthermore, chicken fibroblasts as well as hematopoietic cells, infected and transformed with these viruses, show no enhanced level of transcription of the cellular nucleotide sequences related to the src gene of avian sarcoma viruses. These two viruses may thus contain their own transforming gene(s) or induce cellular genes unrelated to the src-like cellular sequences."

https://openalex.org/W46808462,"Extensive investigations of the unfolding equilibria and kinetics of oxidized and reduced cytochromes c are reported. It is found that all cytochromes c have similar unfolding free energies (deltaGD = 7 +/- 1 kcal/mol). Differences among species do not correlate in any way with the metabolic differences among species. The stabilization of cytochrome c on reduction is estimated at 1.1 kcal/mol. Stability differences among species are mirrored in their denaturation kinetics. For cytochrome c (III), the unfolding exhibits multiple phases. The rate constants for the two observable phases both change by a factor of 3 between horse cytochrome c (III) and cow cytochrome c (III). On reduction, all unfolding appears to occur in a single step. The rate of this unfolding still varies between species, however, the results can be accommodated to a sequential model, with some assumptions. The observations are consistent with chain reversal occurring at an early stage in the reaction and suggest that previously observed rapid processes may be ligand exchange processes."

In order to study the oxygen-induced formation of this hemoprotein, extracts of anaerobic and aerobic yeast cells were resolved by one- and two-dimensional acrylamide gel electrophoresis and the separated polypeptides were then checked for comigration with radiolabeled purified cytochrome c peroxidase from aerobic cells or for reaction with cytochrome c peroxidase antiserum. Both types of extracts contained roughly equal amounts of a polypeptide which was indistinguishable from apocytochrome c peroxidase with respect to antigenicity, isoelectric point, and apparent molecular weight in three different gel systems. In confirmation of an earlier report by Sels. A.A., and Cocriamont, C. (1968) (Biochem. Biophus. Res. Commun. 32, 192-198) the oxygen-induced formation of cytochrome c peroxidase was insensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis and could be mimicked by the addition of heme to extracts of anaerobic cells. We conclude that the oxygen-induced formation of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase involves the addition of heme to the apoenzyme which is already present in the anaerobically grown cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981769078,"Viable variants of simian virus 40 (SV40) have been constructed which contain two functional origins of DNA replication (Or). The variants were made by introducing, at 0.175 on the SV40 map, a segment of DNA containing the viral Or. Two types of experiments demonstrate that the second Or is functional. First, the distribution of radioactivity in pulse-labeled SV40 (I) DNA is dramatically altered in the variants when compared with the parental virus. Second, electron microscopic examination of viral replicative intermediates indicates that while there is one initiation site for DNA synthesis in the parental genome, there are two sites in the variant. It was possible to introduce a deletion which inactivated the original Or at 0.67 map units in this variant. The resulting mutant could be propagated, and its DNA replication originated at the site of the newly inserted Or."

This protein was not found in cells infected by trnasformation-defective mutants with either a partial or complete deletion of the src gene, nor in cells infected by a nontransforming avian leukosis virus. The 56,000 dalton molecular weight protein was found to be synthesized at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures in cells infected by either of two conditionallethal mutants that are temperature-sensitive in cell transformation. The amount of this protein, however, accumulated in cells infected by these temperature-sensitive mutants, relative to the structural polypeptides, differed significnatly from that seen with the nondefective virus. Pulsechase experiments indicate that the protein is extremely unstable, with a half-life of about 20 min, and does not serve as a precursor to any of the detectable virion polypeptides. Furthermore, incubation of the rat antiserum with purified, disrupted virus did not affect its immunoreactivity to this particular protein. We conclude that this 56,000 dalton molecular weight protein is a nonstructural protein specific to cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus."

Noncompetitive inhibition with regards to activation by ATP and p-nitrophenyl phosphate was indicated by altered Vmax values with no change in Km values.

However, the proportion of phosphatase activity inhibited by EDTA was markedly and rapidly (15 s) increased following glucagon or cAMP administration. Epinephrine administration did not alter the proportion of activity inhibited by EDTA. Glucose administration rapidly (2 min) reduced the proportion of synthase phosphatase activity inhibitable by EDTA. That is, the effect of glucose was just the opposite of that produced by glucagon or cAMP. Insulin administration had no effect on phosphatase activity. Synthase phosphatase activity assayed in the absence of EDTA was similar in all groups except for a moderate increase after glucose administration. Addition of Mg2+ completely reversed EDTA inhibition. Phosphorylase phosphatase activity in each group was not modified by addition of EDTA, although the percentage of phosphorylase in the alpha form was higher in glucagon-treated and lower in the glucose-treated animals as expected. These data suggest the presence of rapidly interconvertible forms of either synthase phosphatase or its substrate synthase D, detectable as a change in EDTA inhibitability and subject to glucose and glucagon control."

Effects of a selected number of steroids (progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, aldosterone, estriol, corticosterone, deoxycorticosterone, hydrocortisone, and cortisone) on the binding isotherm of the monoanionic spin label binding to serum albumin have been determined. At the steroid/albumin ratio of 0.5 to 1, progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol enhance binding of the spin label at all concentrations studied. However, the remaining steroids exert an inhibitory effect at low spin label/albumin ratios and an enhancement effect at high spin label/albumin ratios. Progesterone and cortisone effects on the resonance spectra of the spin label bound to serum albumin confirm the enhancement and displacement properties of these ligands. Thus, like fatty acids, steroids may bind to either the primary or secondary bilirubin binding sites and also allosterically perturb the binding properties of serum albumin. The in vivo importance of the steroid-albumin interaction is discussed."
