https://openalex.org/W2125147395,Many studies have supported a genetic etiology for autism. Here we report mutations in two X-linked genes encoding neuroligins NLGN3 and NLGN4 in siblings with autism-spectrum disorders. These mutations affect cell-adhesion molecules localized at the synapse and suggest that a defect of synaptogenesis may predispose to autism.
https://openalex.org/W1964049915,"A large body of evidence has implicated Abeta peptides and other derivatives of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) as central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functional relationship of APP and its proteolytic derivatives to neuronal electrophysiology is not known. Here, we show that neuronal activity modulates the formation and secretion of Abeta peptides in hippocampal slice neurons that overexpress APP. In turn, Abeta selectively depresses excitatory synaptic transmission onto neurons that overexpress APP, as well as nearby neurons that do not. This depression depends on NMDA-R activity and can be reversed by blockade of neuronal activity. Synaptic depression from excessive Abeta could contribute to cognitive decline during early AD. In addition, we propose that activity-dependent modulation of endogenous Abeta production may normally participate in a negative feedback that could keep neuronal hyperactivity in check. Disruption of this feedback system could contribute to disease progression in AD."

https://openalex.org/W2092599690,"Using natural killer T (NKT) cell-deficient mice, we show here that allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a cardinal feature of asthma, does not develop in the absence of V(alpha)14i NKT cells. The failure of NKT cell-deficient mice to develop AHR is not due to an inability of these mice to produce type 2 T-helper (Th2) responses because NKT cell-deficient mice that are immunized subcutaneously at non-mucosal sites produce normal Th2-biased responses. The failure to develop AHR can be reversed by the adoptive transfer of tetramer-purified NKT cells producing interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 to Ja281(-/-) mice, which lack the invariant T-cell receptor (TCR) of NKT cells, or by the administration to Cd1d(-/-) mice of recombinant IL-13, which directly affects airway smooth muscle cells. Thus, pulmonary V(alpha)14i NKT cells crucially regulate the development of asthma and Th2-biased respiratory immunity against nominal exogenous antigens. Therapies that target V(alpha)14i NKT cells may be clinically effective in limiting the development of AHR and asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2164649534,"The pyramidal neuron is the principal cell type in the mammalian forebrain, but its function remains poorly understood. Using a detailed compartmental model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell, we recorded responses to complex stimuli consisting of dozens of high-frequency activated synapses distributed throughout the apical dendrites. We found the cell's firing rate could be predicted by a simple formula that maps the physical components of the cell onto those of an abstract two-layer ""neural network."" In the first layer, synaptic inputs drive independent sigmoidal subunits corresponding to the cell's several dozen long, thin terminal dendrites. The subunit outputs are then summed within the main trunk and cell body prior to final thresholding. We conclude that insofar as the neural code is mediated by average firing rate, a two-layer neural network may provide a useful abstraction for the computing function of the individual pyramidal neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2018974184,"Studies on postmortem brains from Parkinson's patients reveal elevated iron in the substantia nigra (SN). Selective cell death in this brain region is associated with oxidative stress, which may be exacerbated by the presence of excess iron. Whether iron plays a causative role in cell death, however, is controversial. Here, we explore the effects of iron chelation via either transgenic expression of the iron binding protein ferritin or oral administration of the bioavailable metal chelator clioquinol (CQ) on susceptibility to the Parkinson's-inducing agent 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrapyridine (MPTP). Reduction in reactive iron by either genetic or pharmacological means was found to be well tolerated in animals in our studies and to result in protection against the toxin, suggesting that iron chelation may be an effective therapy for prevention and treatment of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2122298493,"fMRI was used to investigate the neural substrates supporting implicit and explicit sequence learning, focusing especially upon the role of the medial temporal lobe. Participants performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT). For implicit learning, they were naive about a repeating pattern, whereas for explicit learning, participants memorized another repeating sequence. fMRI analyses comparing repeating versus random sequence blocks demonstrated activation of frontal, parietal, cingulate, and striatal regions implicated in previous SRTT studies. Importantly, mediotemporal lobe regions were active in both explicit and implicit SRTT learning. Moreover, the results provide evidence of a role for the hippocampus and related cortices in the formation of higher order associations under both implicit and explicit learning conditions, regardless of conscious awareness of sequence knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2171553829,"KCNQ channels belong to a family of potassium ion channels with crucial roles in physiology and disease. Heteromers of KCNQ2/3 subunits constitute the neuronal M channels. Inhibition of M currents, by pathways that stimulate phospholipase C activity, controls excitability throughout the nervous system. Here we show that a common feature of all KCNQ channels is their activation by the signaling membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate (PIP2). We show that wortmannin, at concentrations that prevent recovery from receptor-mediated inhibition of M currents, blocks PIP2 replenishment to the cell surface. Moreover, we identify a C-terminal histidine residue, immediately proximal to the plasma membrane, mutation of which renders M channels less sensitive to PIP2 and more sensitive to receptor-mediated inhibition. Finally, native or recombinant channels inhibited by muscarinic agonists can be activated by PIP2. Our data strongly suggest that PIP2 acts as a membrane-diffusible second messenger to regulate directly the activity of KCNQ currents."
https://openalex.org/W2000509838,"The rules of synaptic integration in pyramidal cells remain obscure, in part due to conflicting interpretations of existing experimental data. To clarify issues, we developed a CA1 pyramidal cell model calibrated with a broad spectrum of in vitro data. Using simultaneous dendritic and somatic recordings and combining results for two different response measures (peak versus mean EPSP), two different stimulus formats (single shock versus 50 Hz trains), and two different spatial integration conditions (within versus between-branch summation), we found that the cell's subthreshold responses to paired inputs are best described as a sum of nonlinear subunit responses, where the subunits correspond to different dendritic branches. In addition to suggesting a new type of experiment and providing testable predictions, our model shows how conclusions regarding synaptic arithmetic can be influenced by an array of seemingly innocuous experimental design choices."
https://openalex.org/W2113686815,"Green tea extract and its main polyphenol constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) possess potent neuroprotective activity in cell culture and mice model of Parkinson's disease. The central hypothesis guiding this study is that EGCG may play an important role in amyloid precursor protein (APP) secretion and protection against toxicity induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta). The present study shows that EGCG enhances (approximately 6-fold) the release of the non-amyloidogenic soluble form of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) into the conditioned media of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. sAPPalpha release was blocked by the hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor Ro31-9790, which indicated mediation via alpha-secretase activity. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) with the inhibitor GF109203X, or by down-regulation of PKC, blocked the EGCG-induced sAPPalpha secretion, suggesting the involvement of PKC. Indeed, EGCG induced the phosphorylation of PKC, thus identifying a novel PKC-dependent mechanism of EGCG action by activation of the non-amyloidogenic pathway. EGCG is not only able to protect, but it can rescue PC12 cells against the beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, administration of EGCG (2 mg/kg) to mice for 7 or 14 days significantly decreased membrane-bound holoprotein APP levels, with a concomitant increase in sAPPalpha levels in the hippocampus. Consistently, EGCG markedly increased PKCalpha and PKC in the membrane and the cytosolic fractions of mice hippocampus. Thus, EGCG has protective effects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and regulates secretory processing of non-amyloidogenic APP via PKC pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2011603170,"Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrades proteins with aberrant conformations, is associated with autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP). The molecular basis of selective neuronal death in AR-JP is unknown. Here we show in an organismal system that panneuronal expression of Parkin substrate Pael-R causes age-dependent selective degeneration of Drosophila dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Coexpression of Parkin degrades Pael-R and suppresses its toxicity, whereas interfering with endogenous Drosophila Parkin function promotes Pael-R accumulation and augments its toxicity. Furthermore, overexpression of Parkin can mitigate alpha-Synuclein-induced neuritic pathology and suppress its toxicity. Our study implicates Parkin as a central player in the molecular pathway of Parkinson's disease (PD) and suggests that manipulating Parkin expression may provide a novel avenue of PD therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2129071654,"We have combined functional maps of retinotopy (eccentricity and meridian mapping), object category, and motion in a group of subjects to explore the large-scale topography of higher-order object areas. Our results reveal seven consistent category-related entities situated in the occipito-temporal cortex adjoining early visual areas. These include two face-related regions, three object-related regions, and two building-related regions. Interestingly, this complex category-related pattern is organized in a large-scale dorso-ventral mirror symmetry of object category. Furthermore, correlating this pattern to the map of visual field eccentricity, we found that the entire network of areas could be related to a single and unified eccentricity map. We hypothesize that this large-scale organization points to a possible development of high-order object areas through extension and specialization of a single proto-representation."
https://openalex.org/W2084687782,"Previous work has shown that guidance cues trigger rapid changes in protein dynamics in retinal growth cones: netrin-1 stimulates both protein synthesis and degradation, while Sema3A elicits synthesis, and LPA induces degradation. What signaling pathways are involved? Our studies confirm that p42/44 MAPK mediates netrin-1 responses and further show that inhibiting its activity blocks cue-induced protein synthesis. Unexpectedly, p38 MAPK is also activated by netrin-1 in retinal growth cones and is required for chemotropic responses and translation. Sema3A- and LPA-induced responses, by contrast, require a single MAPK, p42/p44 and p38, respectively. In addition, we report that caspase-3, an apoptotic protease, is rapidly activated by netrin-1 and LPA in a proteasome- and p38-dependent manner and is required for chemotropic responses. These findings suggest that the apoptotic pathway may be used locally to control protein levels in growth cones and that the differential activation of MAPK pathways may underlie cue-directed migration."
https://openalex.org/W2053412247,"Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western world. Poor glycemic control contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy, but the mechanisms underlying high glucose-induced tissue injury are not fully understood. In the present study, the effect of high glucose on a proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTEC) line was investigated. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using the fluorescent probes dichlorofluorescein diacetate, dihydrorhodamine 123, and 2,3-diaminonapthalene. Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) generation and nitrite concentrations were increased after 24 h of high glucose treatment (P<0.05). LLC-PK1 cells exposed to high D-glucose (25 mM) for up to 48 h had increased DNA fragmentation (P<0.01), caspase-3 activity (P<0.001), and annexin-V staining (P<0.05) as well as decreased expression of XIAP when compared with controls (5 mM D-glucose). The ONOO- scavenger ebselen reduced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity as well as the high glucose-induced nitrite production and DCF fluorescence. High glucose-induced DNA fragmentation was completely prevented by an inhibitor of caspase-3 (P<0.01) and a pan-caspase inhibitor (P<0.001). Caspase inhibition did not affect ROS generation. This study, in a PTEC line, demonstrates that high glucose causes the generation of ONOO-, leading to caspase-mediated apoptosis. Ebselen and a caspase-3 inhibitor provided significant protection against high glucose-mediated apoptosis, implicating ONOO- as a proapoptotic ROS in early diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2127236047,"Mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS) is expressed constitutively, although it might be induced. Nitric oxide (NO) is a physiological regulator of mitochondrial respiration. Melatonin prevents mitochondrial oxidative damage and inhibits iNOS expression induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The loss of melatonin with age may be related to the age-dependent mitochondrial damage. Thus, we examined the protective role of melatonin against the effects of LPS on mtNOS and on respiratory complexes activity in liver and lung mitochondria from young and old rats. The activity of mtNOS in control lung was low and did not change with age. LPS administration (10 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly increased mtNOS expression and activity and NO production in lung mitochondria, and the effect was greater in old rats. LPS administration also reduced the age-dependent decrease of the respiratory complexes I and IV. Melatonin administration (60 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the LPS toxicity, decreasing mitochondrial NOS activity and NO production. Melatonin also counteracted LPS-induced inhibition of complexes I and IV. In general, the actions of melatonin were stronger in older animals than in younger ones. The results suggest that an inducible component of mtNOS, together with mitochondrial damage, occurs during sepsis, and melatonin prevents the mitochondrial failure that occurs during endotoxemia."

In this study, we genetically introduced a His tag and a biotin tag onto the c and G subunits, respectively, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae V-ATPase. Using this engineered enzyme, we observed directly the continuous counter-clockwise rotation of an actin filament attached to the G subunit when the enzyme was immobilized on a glass surface through the c subunit. V-ATPase generated essentially the same torque as the F-ATPase (ATP synthase). The rotation was inhibited by concanamycin and nitrate but not by azide. These results demonstrated that the V- and F-ATPase carry out a common rotational catalysis.

The same enzyme is localized in the plasma membranes of specialized mammalian cells including osteoclasts and kidney intercalated cells (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol.

V-ATPase is a multisubunit complex composed of two functional sectors, V1 and V0; membrane peripheral V1 is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and integral V0 for proton translocation. In yeast, V1 and V0 are composed of eight (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H) and five (a, c, c′, c″, and d) subunits, respectively (5Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Google Scholar). The structure and function of the yeast enzyme are conserved by those of animals because yeast mutants are complemented by the animal counterparts including those of human (6Imai-Senga Y. Sun-Wada G.-H. Wada Y. Futai M. Gene. 2002; 289: 7-12Google Scholar), mouse (7Sun-Wada G.-H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. Hirata T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

The general structure of V-ATPase is similar to that of F-ATPase (ATP synthase), which consists of the F1 (α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ) and F0 (a, b, and c) sectors. The structure, function, and mechanism of F-ATPase have been studied extensively (11Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar, 12Noji H. Yasuda R.

Futai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 499-505Google Scholar). The binding change mechanism suggests that the three catalytic sites of F-ATPase alternate during ATP synthesis and that the ATP releasing step requires energy (16Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Google Scholar). Protons are transported through a transmembrane pathway formed from the single a subunit and a ring of multiple c subunits. The F-ATPase can also hydrolyze ATP and forms an electrochemical proton gradient. We (13Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Google Scholar) and Junge and co-workers (17Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Google Scholar) showed continuous rotation of a complex of γ and the c ring (c10∼14) of purified F-ATPase when the α3β3 hexamer was immobilized (13Sambongi Y. Iko Y.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Google Scholar). On the contrary, the α3β3 hexamer could rotate when the c ring, either purified (18Tanabe M. Nishio K. Iko Y. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15269-15274Google Scholar) or embedded in membranes (14Nishio K. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13448-13452Google Scholar), was immobilized. Finally, rotation of the a subunit relative to the c ring has been shown in membranes (14Nishio K. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13448-13452Google Scholar). V-ATPase has five more subunits than the basic F-ATPase of bacteria. On the basis of the results of chemical cross-linking studies (19Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Google Scholar–21) and limited sequence homology (A to β, B to α, G to b, and c to c, V- to F-ATPase), the V-ATPase subunits correspond to those of the F-ATPase (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Google Scholar, 4Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar). Although the structure is conserved between A and β and B and α, there are still significant differences between the two enzymes: G does not have the hydrophobic segment that b has, and the V-ATPase c and c' subunits are the duplicated form of F-ATPase c (22Hanada H. Hasebe M. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1062-1067Google Scholar); V0 has three hydrophobic proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″) (23Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar), whereas F0 has only one (c). Negatively stained images of bovine coated vesicle V-ATPase revealed a more complicated structure of the secondary stalk connecting V1 and V0 (24Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Google Scholar), possibly consistent with the presence of V-ATPase subunits for which homologues were not found in F-ATPase. V-ATPase shows lower catalytic cooperativity (25Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 873-878Google Scholar) and a lower ratio of H+ transported per ATP hydrolyzed (26Turina P. Samoray D. Gräber P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 418-426Google Scholar, 27Davies J.M. Hunt I. Sanders D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8547-8551Google Scholar) when compared with F-ATPase. Thus, the two proton pumps should have unique structures and mechanisms for their distinct physiological roles. Although the physiological role and structure of the two enzymes are different, it has been proposed that V-ATPase has a rotary mechanism similar to that of F-ATPase (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we first focused on the V-ATPase G subunit because various lines of evidence suggested that the G subunit is located at the peripheral stalk region of the enzyme. The G subunit exhibits homology (∼24% identity) with F-ATPase b (28Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Google Scholar), which rotates relative to the c ring. Recently, it has been reported that the G subunit may correspond to the δ subunit of F-ATPase (20Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Google Scholar, 21Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Google Scholar). Assuming that the G subunit rotates relative to the c ring of V-ATPase, we introduced a His tag and a biotin-binding domain to c and G, respectively, of the yeast enzyme. Upon ATP hydrolysis, we observed continuous counter-clockwise rotation of an actin filament connected to the G subunit of V-ATPase.

J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Google Scholar), were converted into vesicles in 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, containing 25 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation, the vesicles were suspended in the same buffer with 20% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. For solubilization of V-ATPase, the vacuolar vesicles were suspended in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. Zwitterionic detergent ZW 3-14 was slowly added to the vacuolar vesicle suspension (5 mg protein/ml) to give a final concentration of 14 mm. After a 10-min incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and then the supernatant was rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use.

After electrophoresis and blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the following antibodies were used for immunological detection: anti-H+-ATPase 69-kDa subunit mouse monoclonal antibody clone 8B1 (1:100 dilution, obtained from Molecular Probe); mouse monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody clone His-1 (1:100 dilution, Sigma); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution, Jackson ImmnoResearch Laboratories). Antibodies were used after dilution in TBST (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk, except that TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin was used for the anti-polyhistidine antibody. Signals were detected with an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The biotin-tagged G subunit was probed with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Novagen). Measurement of ATPase Activities and Proton Translocation— ATPase activity and protein concentrations were determined as described previously (7Sun-Wada G.-H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. Hirata T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18098-18105Google Scholar). The formation of an electrochemical proton gradient in vacuolar vesicles (3 μg of protein) was assayed in the buffer used for ATPase with 1 μm 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine as a fluorescence probe (excitation, 410 nm; emission, 490 nm). Observation of Subunit Rotation—For rotation assay, the solubilized V-ATPase (5 μl of 3 mg/ml protein) was diluted 4-fold with Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, containing 25 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and then introduced into a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-coated glass flow cell at 25 °C (14Nishio K. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13448-13452Google Scholar). After a 5-min incubation, a fluorescent (tetramethyl-rhodamine labeled) actin filament was attached to the G subunit through a biotin tag and streptavidin (14Nishio K. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13448-13452Google Scholar). Immediately after introducing the reaction mixture (5 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml asolectin, 0.01% ZW3–14, 25 mm glucose, 1 μm biotin, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 216 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 36 μg/ml catalase in Buffer A), an 0.6-mm2 area was scanned under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 equipped with a cooled, intensified, charge-coupled device camera (CCD; PentaMax-512EFT, Princeton Instruments) (33Iko Y. Sambongi Y. Tanabe M. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Saito K. Ueda I. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47508-47511Google Scholar). Digital images (0.142 × 0.142 μm/pixel) of an actin filament were acquired at a 10-ms resolution and then subjected to centroid analysis using Winview (Roper Scientific). The rotation angle of a filament (degree) and rotational rate (revolution/s) were calculated from the centroid of the actin filament (34Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Google Scholar). The length of the filament was taken as the average value obtained from 10 independent images processed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp.). Viscous drag was calculated as (4π/3) × η × L3/[ln(L/r) – 0.447], where η is the viscosity of the medium (1.0 × 10–9 pN·s·nm–2), L, the length of the actin filament (700 –1100 nm), and r the radius of the filament (5 nm). Frictional torque (N) was calculated as n = (angular velocity of the filament) × (viscous drag). Angular velocity is equal to 2π × (rotational rate). Continuously rotating filaments, of which the ends were attached to V-ATPase, were used for the torque calculation. Expression of Epitope-tagged Copies of the c and G Subunits in Yeast—The system we used to examine the rotation of V-ATPase is shown schematically in Fig. 1A. We introduced sequences for the His tag and the biotin-binding domain to the yeast chromosomal genes of the c and G subunits, respectively. The biotin-binding domain-containing proteins could be biotinylated in vivo when expressed in yeast cells (30Cronan J.E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Google Scholar). It has been shown that the c or G subunit with an epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus can form a functional V-ATPase (28Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Google Scholar, 35Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous findings, the strain expressing the V-ATPase with the His-tagged c and the biotin-binding domain-fused G could grow at neutral pH similar to the wild type, whereas a null mutant, vma3 (TH57-20A), could not form a colony (Fig. 1B). The stable expression of the two epitope-tagged subunits was examined by Western blot analysis. Solubilized vacuolar proteins were analyzed with anti-His tag antibodies and streptavidin (Fig. 1C). The G subunit with the biotin-binding domain was detected at the position corresponding to a molecular mass of 31 kDa, this value being larger than the predicted value (24 kDa), probably because of the high contents of positively charged residues in the engineered subunit (lysine and arginine, 16.5% of total residues). A signal corresponding to a molecular mass of 18 kDa was detected with anti-His tag antibody, consistent with values for the c subunit connected with the His tag. No signals were detected with the solubilized vacuolar vesicles from wild-type cells (TH45-2A). Expression of the A subunit was confirmed in both strains. These results indicate that a fully active V-ATPase complex with tagged subunits was present in the vacuolar membrane. Properties of V-ATPase with Tagged Subunits—We found that the amount of the A subunit in the engineered strain (TH60-4C) was about 20% of that observed in wild-type vacuolar membranes (determined by densitometry (data not shown); similar results were obtained with solubilized vacuolar proteins as shown in Fig. 1C), suggesting that the expression level of engineered V-ATPase was lower than that of the wild type. The ATPase activity of the engineered V-ATPase in vacuolar vesicles was about 20% of that observed for the wild type (Table II). Thus, the engineered cells expressed a smaller number of V-ATPase with wild-type activity. The initial rate of proton pumping (fluorescence quenching) was 11% of that of the wild type, and the coupling efficiency (proton pumping activity/ATPase) was slightly lower for the engineered vesicles (Table II). These results suggest that the engineered V-ATPase does not show severe defects in turnover rate or energy coupling, although its expression level in vacuolar membranes is low.Table IIProperties of vacuole vesicles with the V-ATPase engineered for rotationCellsGrowth at pH 7.5Vacuolar vesiclesATPaseAmount of subunit AΔpH formationCoupling efficiency (ΔpH/ATPase)nmol/mg protein·minarbitrary unitsΔF%/mg protein·minNonengineered+++49510013,80028G biotin tag/cHis tag++10520165016 Open table in a new tab G Subunit Rotation Relative to the c Proteolipid—We observed the rotation of an actin filament connected to the membrane-embedded F-ATPase previously (14Nishio K. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13448-13452Google Scholar). The method used provided an ideal system for studying rotary catalysis in membrane enzyme because it is free from any effect during solubilization and/or purification with a detergent. We examined V-ATPase rotation using vacuolar membrane fragments with or without further sonication. However, the occurrence of rotating filament was significantly low, possibly because of the absence of planar membranes in the preparation. Therefore, we examined the rotation of V-ATPase right after solubilization to avoid possible loss of any subunit(s) from the complex during purification (36Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Google Scholar, 37Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Google Scholar). V-ATPase was introduced into a flow cell and then immobilized on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-coated glass surface through the His tag. An actin filament was attached to the G subunit through the biotin tag and streptavidin. Upon ATP addition, we could readily observe counter-clockwise rotation of the filaments (Fig. 2, A and B). However, no rotating filaments were observed when V-ATPase without the His tag (from strain TH50-5D) or the biotin-binding domain (strain TH44-5D) was introduced into the flow cell (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of Rotation by V-ATPase-specific Inhibitors—V-ATPase shows unique anion sensitivities; nitrate is inhibitory, but chloride has no effect (36Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Google Scholar), whereas both ions have no effect on F-ATPase. The numbers of rotating filaments were calculated in the presence of these ions; the number of rotating filaments decreased with an increase in the nitrate concentration, but chloride had no effect (Fig. 3A). ATPase activity was inhibited similarly with increases in nitrate concentration (Fig. 3B). Azide and concanamycin are widely known specific inhibitors of F- and V-ATPases, respectively (34Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Google Scholar, 38Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Google Scholar). As expected, the rotation of an actin filament connected to the V-ATPase G subunit was not affected by azide (Fig. 4A), but no rotating filament was observed in the presence of concanamycin (Fig. 4B). The actin filament also stopped rotating after the addition of concanamycin (Fig. 4C). The V-ATPase rotation was inhibited possibly because the antibiotic bound to the V0 sector (25Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 873-878Google Scholar, 39Huss M. Ingenhorst G. König S. Gassel M. Dröse S. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Google Scholar). The lag between rotational steps of each filament was variable, as shown by an expanded time scale (Fig. 5A). Thus, we selected linear segments (Fig. 5A, highlighted sections), and average rates were plotted against viscous drag applied to the filaments. Through these calculations, we estimated that V-ATPase rotation generated a frictional torque of 36 ± 4 pN·nm (Fig. 5B). This value is essentially the same as the torque generated in F0F1 (Table III) (13Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M.

Iko Y. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15269-15274Google Scholar). However, detailed analysis, using a probe other than an actin filament, will be necessary to reach a definite conclusion.Table IIIGeneration of torque from rotation in V-ATPase and F-ATPaseExperimental systemTorque generatedRef.pN·nmV-ATPase36 ± 4This studyG biotin tag/cHis tagF-ATPase46 ± 13(13Sambongi Y.

Using a genetically engineered enzyme with a His-tagged proteolipid c subunit and a biotin-binding domain connected to the G subunit, we could observe directly the counter-clockwise rotation of an actin filament attached to the G subunit when the enzyme was immobilized on a glass surface through the His tag. Thus, the rotary mechanism is well conserved in the two enzymes, although V-ATPase shows significant structural and functional differences from F-ATPase including: 1) a distinct subunit composition (3Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Google Scholar); 2) lower catalytic cooperativity (25Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 873-878Google Scholar); and 3) a lower ratio of H+ transported per ATP hydrolyzed (26Turina P. Samoray D. Gräber P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 418-426Google Scholar, 27Davies J.M. Hunt I. Sanders D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8547-8551Google Scholar). We introduced a biotin tag to the G subunit for our rotation assay. Subunit G exhibits homology to F-ATPase subunit b (28Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Google Scholar), which forms a stator (peripheral stalk) together with subunit a, preventing the α3β3 hexamer from rotating when the ϵγc10∼14 complex is rotating. During the study of V-ATPase rotation, Forgac and co-workers (20Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Google Scholar, 21Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Google Scholar) have shown that the G subunit is cross-linked to the residues located at the top portion of the B subunit. Their results suggest that subunits G and E form a peripheral stalk connecting the V1 and V0 sectors and that the G subunit is located near the top of V1 farthest away from the membrane. In F-ATPase, the peripheral stalk contains the δ subunit, which is located near the top of the entire complex (42Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Google Scholar). Thus, the G subunit may correspond to the δ subunit of F1 and the E subunit to the extra membrane domain of the b subunit. Although the x-ray structure of V-ATPase needs to be determined, various lines of evidence have suggested that the G subunit is located at the peripheral stalk of the enzyme. Therefore, it is reasonable that we could observe rotation of the G subunit relative to the c ring by introducing a probe to this subunit. A striking difference between V-ATPase and F-ATPase is the presence of three different proteolipid subunits (Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p for c, c′, and c″, respectively) within the V0 sector compared with a single subunit c in F0. All three proteolipids are required for functional yeast V-ATPase because loss or mutation of any one of them results in a complete loss of V-ATPase activity (23Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar). The specific glutamate residues in the three subunits are essential for proton translocation, similar to Asp-61 of the F-ATPase subunit c (23Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar, 43Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Google Scholar). It has been shown that each V-ATPase complex contains single copies of both Vma11p and Vma16p and multiple copies of Vma3p (35Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Google Scholar). The rotation of an actin filament attached to the V-ATPase was similar to one attached to F-ATPase, and no effect of multiple proteolipids was observed. However, it is possible that the difference between the V0 and F0 was not observed in the rotation because an actin filament was used as a probe in the assay. The rotational rate observed for an actin filament was significantly lower than that estimated from the enzyme without a probe (36Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Google Scholar). Thus, the examination V-ATPase rotation with different probes, including gold particles (44Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Google Scholar), is of interest. Several lines of evidence have indicated that V-ATPase interacts with microfilaments in mammalian cells (45Holliday L.S. Welgus H.G. Hanna J. Lee B.S. Lu M. Jeffrey J.J. Gluck S.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 15: 15Google Scholar, 46Holliday L.S. Lu M. Lee B.S. Nelson R.D. Solivan S. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Google Scholar, 47Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Google Scholar). We have observed that the distribution of the V-ATPase in plasma membrane of osteoclasts was inhibited by cytochalasin D, which is known to depolymerize actin filaments (58Toyomura T. Murata Y. Yamamoto A. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22023-22030Google Scholar). The B1 and B2 isoforms of the B subunit of V-ATPase contain a microfilament binding site in their amino-terminal domain (46Holliday L.S. Lu M. Lee B.S. Nelson R.D. Solivan S. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Google Scholar). In yeast, it has been shown that actin participates in several intracellular trafficking pathways, and Eitzen et al. (48Eitzen G. Wang L. Thorngren N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 669-679Google Scholar) have found that actin, bound to the surface of purified yeast vacuoles in the absence of cytosol or cytoskeleton, regulates the last compartment-mixing stage of homotypic vacuole fusion. Thus, we can assume that the actin filament may be an anchor of the A3B3 hexamer and that the V0c ring rotates together with the central stalk relative to the A3B3 hexamer. Recently, multiple isoforms of V-ATPase subunits in higher eukaryotes have been identified (7Sun-Wada G.-H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. Hirata T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

Because many of them complemented the yeast counterpart, it will be of interest to examine their roles in the rotary mechanism using the present experimental system. Furthermore, the rotation may be affected by mutations causing defective proton translocation (23Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar, 43Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Google Scholar) or ATPase activity (53Curtis K.K. Francis S.A.

Our rotation assay also constitutes an efficient tool for addressing the arrangement and functions of individual subunits in V-ATPase through characterization of the rotatory mechanism with probes attached to different subunits. Most recently, Yokoyama and co-workers (55Imamura H. Nakano M. Nioji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2313-2315Google Scholar) showed the rotation of an isolated peripheral membrane sector of Thermus thermophilus H+-ATPase responsible for ATP synthesis. The bacterial enzyme has been classified into A-type ATPases found in the plasma membranes of most archea and some kinds of eubacteria (for review, see Ref. 56Ihara K. Abe T. Sugimura K.I. Mukohata Y. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 475-485Google Scholar). A-type ATPase is related to V-ATPase but is more similar to F-ATPase (57Yokoyama K. Ohkuma S. Taguchi H. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13955-13961Google Scholar), although the three ATPases are believed to have the same ancestor. Taken together, our present studies on V-ATPase as well as those on F-ATPase (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M.C. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Google Scholar, 13Sambongi Y. Iko Y.

Our findings suggest that BCRP may play a role in the transport of sterols in human, in addition to its ability to transport multiple drugs and toxins. The emergence of multidrug resistant cancer cells is a serious problem in the chemotherapeutic treatment of human tumors. In mammals, multidrug resistance based on the active extrusion of cytotoxic drugs from the cell is mediated by several members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; BCRP, breast cancer resistance protein; FTC, fumitremorgin C; IC50, drug concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of the cellular growth rate; MDR, multidrug resistance; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. superfamily. These include the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1 (also termed ABCB1) and the protein MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, also termed ABCC1) (1Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, also termed MXR, ABCP, or ABCG2) is one of the more recently discovered ABC multidrug transporters in human cancer cells. BCRP confers resistance on cells to (i) toxic ions such as rhodamine 123, (ii) anticancer agents including mitoxantrone and the anthracyclines daunomycin and doxorubicin, and (iii) the camptothecins topotecan and SN-38 (2Doyle L.A.

Recently, fumitremorgin C (FTC), a novel chemosensitizing agent, was identified and shown to reverse drug resistance in human BCRP-expressing cancer cells by inhibiting BCRP-mediated drug transport (12Rabindran S.K. Ross D.D. Doyle L.A. Yang W. Greenberger L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 47-50PubMed Google Scholar). BCRP is a 655-amino acid, 72.1-kDa protein and is the second member of the G subfamily of ABC transporters. Members of the G subfamily are all half-transporters and include among others (i) the Drosophila white, brown, and scarlet proteins, which are involved in the transport of eye pigment (13Dreesen T.D. Johnson D.H. Henikoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); (ii) ABCG1, which is thought to be involved in the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids (14Klucken J. Büchler C. Orsö E.

In contrast to P-glycoprotein MDR1 and MRP1, which are full size transporters, BCRP most likely functions as a homodimer (16Kage K. Tsukahara S. Sugiyama T. Asada S. Ishihawa E. Tsuruo T. Sugimoto Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In normal tissue, high expression of the BCRP is found in stem cells (17Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat.

Skovsgaard T. Bates S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The localization of BCRP suggests that it could have a potential role in protection against toxins. The recent observation in BCRP knock-out mice that BCRP protects against a chlorophyll-derived dietary phototoxin and protoporphyria is consistent with this notion (20Jonker J.W. Buitelaar M. Wagenaar E. van der Valk M.A. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Plösch T. Kuipers F. Oude-Elferink R.P.J. Rosing H. Bejnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15649-15654Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Previously, we have characterized the molecular basis of the drug specificity of LmrA, a half-transporter homologue of human P-glycoprotein MDR1, in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis (21van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Soceneantu L. Sardini A. Konings W.N. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 22van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To allow a detailed comparison of BCRP and LmrA, human BCRP was functionally expressed in L. lactis using the nisin A-induced expression system that is used for the expression of LmrA. BCRP was active as an ATP-dependent multidrug transporter in L. lactis and was able to interact with sterols. We conclude that the substrate specificity of BCRP partly overlaps with that proposed for ABCG1 and ABCG5/ABCG8. Our observations may suggest a physiological role for BCRP in sterol metabolism in human in addition to its role in mediating resistance to xenobiotics and toxins arising from dietary intake and cellular metabolism. L. lactis strains NZ9000 and NZ9700 (23de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% glucose. Chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml) was added where appropriate. The human BCRP gene was amplified from pcDNA3-BCRP (2Doyle L.A. Yang W. Abruzzo L.V. Krogmann T. Gao Y. Rishi A.K. Ross D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15665-15670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar) by PCR using the forward primer 5′-GCCGCTAATACCATGGCTTCCAGTAATGTCG-3′ to introduce an NcoI site at the 5′ end of BCRP and the reverse primer 5′-GCTTGGTACCGAGCTCTCTAGAAATTTAAGAATA-3′ to introduce an XbaI site at the 3′ end of BCRP. The internal NcoI sites in BCRP were removed through silent mutations by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using two internal complementary primer pairs: the forward primer 5′-CTGTAATCTGATTTATTACCGATGGGGATGTTACC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGTAACATCCCCATCGGTAATAAATCAGATAACAG-3′ for C1440G and the forward primer 5′-GCTTATTCAGCCAGTTCGATGGCACTGGCCATAGCAGCAGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTGCTGCTATGGCCAGTGCCATCGAACTGGCTGAATAAGC-3′ for C1566G. The final PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI and cloned into the lactococcal pNZ8048 expression vector (23de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), giving pNZ-BCRP. All PCR-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced to ensure that only the intended changes had been introduced. For the isolation of BCRP-containing and control inside-out membrane vesicles, L. lactis NZ9000 cells harboring pNZ-BCRP or pNZ8048, respectively, were grown at 30 °C to an A660 of ∼0.3. At this density, 0.4% (v/v) of the supernatant of the nisin-producing L. lactis strain NZ9700 (containing about 10 ng/ml of nisin A) was added to the culture to induce transcription of the BCRP gene under control of the nisA promoter. Following the incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at an A660 of ∼0.7–0.9 and washed either with 100 mm KPi (pH 7.0) for transport assays or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for ATPase assays. The cell pellet was resuspended to an A660 of 5 in KPi or Tris buffer supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysozyme was then added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and the suspension was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to digest the cell wall. The cells were lysed by three passages through a Basic Z cell disruptor (Constant Systems, Northants, UK) at 20,000 p.s.i. Subsequently, DNase (10 μg/ml), RNase (2 μg/ml), 10 mm MgSO4, and 15 mm K-EDTA (pH 7.0) were added, and the suspension was further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Inside-out membrane vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C and resuspended in either 50 mm KPi (pH 7.0) or 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% glycerol. The membrane vesicles were stored in 100-μl aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Inside-out membrane vesicles were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electroblotted to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and were detected in the presence of a 1:1000 dilution of the monoclonal anti-BCRP antibody BXP-21 in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations (Signet). Detection of the primary antibody was performed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) as suggested by the manufacturer. L. lactis NZ9000 cells containing pNZ8048 or pNZ-BCRP were grown at 30 °Ctoan A660 of about 0.3 in a 96-well plate. Subsequently, protein expression was induced by the addition of nisin A as described under “Preparation of Inside-out Membrane Vesicles.” Cytotoxic drugs were added to the cell suspensions at a concentration ranging from 0 to 200 μm. The A660 of the cultures were measured every 10 min for 6 h in a VersaMax plate reader (Molecular Devices, CA). The relative growth rates were determined, and the IC50 values were calculated. The data were obtained in duplicate from three independent experiments. Ethidium Bromide Transport—L. lactis NZ9000 cells containing pNZ8048 or pNZ-BCRP were grown at 30 °C to an A660 of about 0.3. Subsequently, protein expression was induced in the presence of nisin A as described under “Preparation of Inside-out Membrane Vesicles.” The cells were washed three times in 50 mm KPi (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm MgSO4. To deprive cells of metabolic energy, the cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm dinitrophenol and washed three times in 50 mm KPi (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm MgSO4. The cell pellet was resuspended to an A660 of 0.5 in 2 ml of the KPi buffer and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in the presence of 25 mm glucose with or without the inhibitor FTC (0.5 μm). Ethidium bromide was added to a final concentration as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2, and its fluorescence was followed at 30 °C in a Perkin-Elmer LS 55B fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 580 nm, respectively, and slit widths of 2.5 nm each. Hoechst 33342 Transport—Inside-out membrane vesicles (1 mg of total membrane protein) were diluted in 2 ml of 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4) supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine. For experiments with the inhibitor, 0.5 μm FTC was added to the buffer. After ∼1 min of incubation at 30 °C, 1 μm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was added, and the binding of the dye to the membrane vesicles was followed by fluorimetry (excitation and emission wavelength of 355 and 457 nm, respectively, and slit widths of 2.5 nm) until a steady state was reached. Subsequently, ATP (or AMP-PNP in the control experiments) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the fluorescence intensity was followed until a new steady state was reached. For the substrate competition studies, estradiol was added to the cuvette at concentrations as indicated in Fig. 6A prior to the addition of Hoechst 33342. The ATPase assay in inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis was based on a colorimetric ascorbic acid/ammonium molybdate assay to measure the liberation of Pi from ATP. Inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from BCRP-expressing and control L. lactis cells were diluted to a protein concentration of ∼1 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm ATP. ATPase assays were performed at 30 °C in a 96-well plate in a reaction volume of 10 μl/well. Lipids and water-insoluble drugs were added as solutions in ethanol to a final solvent concentration below 1% (v/v). Following incubation for 10 min, the ATPase reactions were terminated by the addition of 40 μl of a freshly prepared acidic solution consisting of 0.48% (w/w) ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate, 6.6% (v/v) concentrated sulfuric acid, 0.01% (w/w) potassium antimonyl tartrate, and 0.42% (w/w) ascorbic acid. Following the addition of 150 μl of H2O and 30 min of incubation at 30 °C in the dark, the absorbance of the phosphomolybdate complex formed was measured at 690 nm. ATPase activity measurements in the presence of 1 mm orthovanadate were obtained in parallel and subtracted from the readings. BCRP-expressing and control L. lactis cells were generated as described under “Preparation of Inside-out Membrane Vesicles,” washed three times in 50 mm KPi (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm MgSO4, resuspended in KPi buffer supplemented with 1 mg bovine serum albumin/ml to an A660 of 0.5, and kept on ice until use. Cell suspensions (100-μl aliquots) were preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min in the presence of [2,4,6,7-3H]estradiol (87 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) at a final concentration of 500 nm. Metabolic energy for active transport of estradiol was then generated in the cells through the addition of 25 mm glucose. Following the incubation at the times indicated in Fig. 6B, the cell suspensions were mixed with 3 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgSO4 and rapidly filtered over Whatman GF/G glass fiber filters that were pre-equilibrated overnight at 20 °C in Tris buffer. The filters were washed twice with ice-cold Tris buffer, and radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. All of the data were corrected by subtracting nonspecific binding of [3H]estradiol to the filters, which was usually less than 5–10% of the total radioactivity. Expression of Human BCRP in L. lactis—For expression of human BCRP in L. lactis NZ9000, the human BCRP gene present in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-BCRP was cloned into the lactococcal expression vector pNZ8048 under the control of the nisin A-inducible nisA promoter. This expression system had previously been used for the expression in L. lactis of LmrA, the lactococcal homologue of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1 (24Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The addition of 40 pg/ml nisin A to exponentially growing L. lactis cells harboring pNZ-BCRP resulted in the expression of a 70-kDa polypeptide that could be detected on an immunoblot by using the specific anti-BCRP antibody BXP-21 (Fig. 1). The BXP-21 antibody also showed cross-reactivity with certain constitutively expressed, endogenous membrane proteins in L. lactis. The 70-kDa polypeptide was expressed at a level between 0.5 and 1% of total membrane protein, as determined by densitometric analysis of a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. In the absence of nisin A, an approximately 10-fold lower expression level of the 70-kDa polypeptide was observed in L. lactis cells containing pNZ-BCRP. The 70-kDa polypeptide was undetectable in control cells harboring the pNZ8048 control vector when incubated in the presence of nisin A. Heterologously Expressed BCRP Is Active as a Multidrug Transporter—The drug resistance of L. lactis cells harboring pNZ-BCRP was compared with that of cells harboring the pNZ8048 control vector. The growth rate of the two strains in liquid culture containing 40 pg/ml nisin A was determined at increasing concentrations of ethidium bromide, Hoechst 33342, rhodamine 123, or tetramethylrosamine. The concentrations of drugs necessary to reduce the growth rate of cells by 50% (IC50) are listed in Table I. BCRP expression in L. lactis significantly increased the drug resistance of the organism.Table IDrug survival characteristics of BCRP-expressing L. lactis cells, compared with cells not expressing BCRP (control)DrugIC50aThe values represent the means of three replicate determinations ± S.E.BCRPControlEthidium bromide40 ± 0 μg/ml8 ± 0 μg/mlHoechst 33342>200 μM40 ± 0 μMRhodamine 123>200 μM131 ± 6.6 μMTetramethylrosamine14.4 ± 0.9 μM8.8 ± 0.8 μMa The values represent the means of three replicate determinations ± S.E. Open table in a new tab To test whether drug extrusion from the cell is the underlying mechanism of drug resistance in L. lactis expressing BCRP, ethidium bromide uptake in cells was measured by monitoring the fluorescence of the intracellular ethidium-polynucleotide complex. In the presence of glucose, the uptake of ethidium bromide in cells expressing BCRP was significantly lower than that observed in control cells without BCRP (Fig. 2). This difference in ethidium accumulation between the two cell types reflected a higher ethidium efflux rate in BCRP-expressing cells. Upon the addition of the BCRP-specific inhibitor FTC, the ethidium accumulation in cells expressing BCRP was similar to that observed in control cells in the presence or absence of FTC, pointing to the inhibition of BCRP activity under these conditions. The fluorescent lipophilic dye Hoechst 33342 is transported by BCRP expressed in mammalian cells (19Litman T. Jensen U. Hansen A. Covitz K.-M. Zhan Z. Fetsch P. Abati A. Hansen P.R. Horn T. Skovsgaard T. Bates S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Kim M. Turnquist H. Jackson J. Sgagias M. Yan Y. Gong M. Dean M. Sharp J.G. Cowan K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 22-28PubMed Google Scholar). To further analyze the activity of BCRP in L. lactis, the transport of Hoechst 33342 was studied in L. lactis-derived inside-out membrane vesicles in which the nucleotide-binding domain of BCRP was exposed on the outside surface of the membrane. The addition of Hoechst 33342 to the inside-out membrane vesicles resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence up to a steady state level because of the partitioning of the dye in the hydrophobic environment of the phospholipid bilayer (Fig. 3). The subsequent addition of MgATP resulted in a rapid quenching of the Hoechst 33342 fluorescence in membrane vesicles containing BCRP (Fig. 3A) but not in control membrane vesicles without BCRP (Fig 3B). FTC strongly inhibited the ATP-dependent quenching of Hoechst 33342 fluorescence in membrane vesicles containing BCRP. In contrast, no significant changes in the steady state level of Hoechst 33342 fluorescence were observed in BCRP-containing and control membrane vesicles in the presence of AMP-PNP alone or AMP-PNP plus FTC (Fig. 3). These observations point to the BCRP-dependent transport of Hoechst 33342 from the phospholipid bilayer into the aqueous lumen of the membrane vesicles. Functional studies in membrane vesicles of L. lactis also aimed at the ATPase activity of BCRP. In contrast to control inside-out membrane vesicles, BCRP-containing inside-out membrane vesicles displayed a significant amount of orthovanadate-sensitive ATPase activity that was stimulated up to 5-fold in the presence of daunomycin (Fig. 4A), a substrate of BCRP (2Doyle L.A. Yang W. Abruzzo L.V. Krogmann T. Gao Y. Rishi A.K. Ross D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15665-15670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). The concentration of daunomycin required for half-maximal stimulation (SC50) of the vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity was about 20 μm. FTC significantly reduced the daunomycin-stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity, with an IC50 concentration below 2.5 μm (Fig. 4B). These data strongly suggest that the drug-stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity is associated with BCRP activity. Taken together, the observations of (i) multidrug resistance and reduced ethidium bromide accumulation in cells expressing BCRP, (ii) the ATP-dependent Hoechst 33342 transport and the drug-stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in inside-out membrane vesicles containing BCRP, and (iii) the inhibition of these drug transport and ATPase activities by the BCRP inhibitor FTC demonstrate the functional expression of human BCRP in L. lactis. Interaction of BCRP with Sterols—Although BCRP (ABCG2) was originally identified as a multidrug transporter, other members in the ABCG subfamily (e.g. ABCG1 and ABCG5/G8) have been implicated in the transport of sterols. To explore the interaction of BCRP with sterols, the effect of sterols on the BCRP-associated ATPase activity was examined. Surprisingly, the sterols estradiol and cholesterol both stimulated the BCRP-associated ATPase activity about 4-fold, with SC50 values of about 10 and 8 μm, respectively (Fig. 5A). In addition, the BCRP-associated ATPase activity was stimulated 4-fold by the natural steroid progesterone and 7-fold by testosterone at SC50 values of 5 and 15 μm, respectively, (Fig. 5B). Finally, the estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen (26Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar) stimulated the BCRP-associated ATPase activity almost 3-fold with an SC50 of about 50 μm (Fig. 5C). None of these sterols significantly affected the low level of vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity observed in control membrane vesicles lacking BCRP (Fig. 5). The ability of BCRP expressed in L. lactis to interact with estradiol was further analyzed in Hoechst 33342 transport assays in which estradiol was included as a competing substrate. As shown in Fig. 6A, the presence of estradiol significantly inhibited the BCRP-mediated transport of Hoechst 33342 in inside-out membrane vesicles. The degree of inhibition by estradiol was proportional to the concentration of estradiol used, suggesting that estradiol is a potential transport substrate for BCRP. Estradiol did not affect the fluorescence of Hoechst 33342 in control membrane vesicles without BCRP (data not shown). The ability of BCRP to transport estradiol was directly assessed by measuring the uptake of [3H]estradiol in L. lactis cells. In the presence of glucose, BCRP-expressing cells exhibited a 4-fold lower uptake of [3H]estradiol than the control cells or BCRP-expressing cells in the absence of glucose (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate the BCRP-mediated transport of estradiol in L. lactis. Interestingly, the amount of cell-associated estradiol was not reduced in glucose-energized L. lactis cells expressing LmrA, suggesting the lack of a significant LmrA-mediated transport of estradiol under the experimental conditions (Fig. 6B). ABC transporters are important contributors to cellular lipid transport and homeostasis, and their dysfunction is often associated with human disease phenotypes. For example, P-glycoprotein MDR3 (ABCB4) mediates the transport of phosphatidylcholine across the canalicular membrane during bile formation, and mutations in the MDR3 gene are a cause of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (27Ruetz S.

However, in view of its broad substrate specificity and its presence in tissues producing steroid hormones (18Maliepaard M. Scheffer G.L. Faneyte I.F. van Gastelen M.A. Pijnenborg A.C.

Buitelaar M. Wagenaar E. van der Valk M.A. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Plösch T. Kuipers F. Oude-Elferink R.P.J. Rosing H. Bejnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15649-15654Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). To study sterol transport by human BCRP, we have expressed the protein in L. lactis, a bacterium that is devoid of mammalian sterols but that synthesizes hopanoids to regulate membrane fluidity (36Salton M.R.J. Owen P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30 (37): 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This property gives L. lactis an advantage over insect cells and mammalian cells where the sterol content of the plasma membranes can vary between 5 and 25%, which may hinder direct measurements of sterol transport and sterol-stimulated ATPase activities in the experimental setting. In addition, the expression of BCRP in L. lactis allows a comparison of its substrate specificity with that of the ABC half-transporter LmrA, a lactococcal homologue of P-glycoprotein MDR1. Three lines of experimental evidence suggested that BCRP was functionally expressed in L. lactis. Firstly, BCRP expression conferred multidrug resistance on cells. Secondly, BCRP expression enhanced the efflux of ethidium in cells and the transport of Hoechst 33342 in inside-out membrane vesicles. Both activities were inhibited in the presence of the BCRP-specific modulator FTC. Finally, BCRP-containing inside-out membrane vesicles displayed a vanadate and FTC-sensitive ATPase activity, which was stimulated by drugs (such as daunomycin) that are transported by BCRP. The observation of a BCRP-associated ATPase activity in inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis is consistent with published studies in which a drug-stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in isolated membranes of insect cells (37Özvegy C. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47980-47990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (38Nielsen D. Eriksen J. Maare C. Litman T. Kjaersgaard E. Plesner T. Friche E. Skovsgaard T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was shown to be due to the presence of BCRP. The BCRP-associated ATPase activity in inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis was also significantly stimulated in the presence of sterols, including estradiol, cholesterol, progesterone, testosterone, and tamoxifen. It has been shown for P-glycoprotein MDR1 that the lipid environment can significantly influence the characteristics of purified and functionally reconstituted protein (39Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Hence, the stimulation of the BCRP-associated ATPase activity in inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis by mammalian sterols could reflect a requirement of BCRP for the presence of these sterols in its lipid environment. However, the observations of (i) the efflux of [3H]estradiol in BCRP-expressing L. lactis cells but not LmrA-expressing cells (Fig. 6B) and (ii) the inhibition of BCRP-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport by estradiol (Fig. 6A) at concentrations that stimulate the BCRP-associated ATPase activity (Fig. 5A) imply competition between sterols and drugs for binding to common binding sites in BCRP. These data would also argue against indirect mechanisms of coupling between the estradiol-induced stimulation of BCRP-associated ATPase activity and [3H]estradiol translocation, in which (i) [3H]estradiol transport would represent a secondary flux associated with the active translocation of an endogenous compound (e.g. lipid) by BCRP and (ii) simultaneously, estradiol would interact with an allosteric binding site, rather than a transport site, to enhance the BCRP-associated ATPase activity. Interestingly, as the concentration of daunomycin or sterols increased beyond that which stimulated the BCRP-associated ATPase maximally, the ATPase activity then decreased (Figs. 4 and 5) similar to observations for the P-glycoprotein MDR1 ATPase (34Rebbeor J.F. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1369: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The biphasic pattern of stimulation and inhibition of the drug/sterol stimulated BCRP-associated ATPase activity may depend on the saturation state of BCRP transport sites, with enhanced binding of drug/sterol to transport sites at the inside surface of the membrane at low substrate concentrations and reduced dissociation of these substrates from release sites at the outside surface of the membrane at high substrate concentrations. Alternatively, the inhibition of the BCRP-associated ATPase activity at high drug/sterol concentrations may reflect changes in the lipid environment, i.e. in lateral pressure, that are less optimal for BCRP activity. Altogether the data presented in this paper suggest that human BCRP is able to interact with sterols and that BCRP may play a role in the transport of sterols, steroids, and estrogen receptor antagonists used in the treatment of breast tumors, in addition to its ability to transport chemotherapeutic drugs and cellular toxins.

https://openalex.org/W2124974853,"Endostatin, a proteolytic fragment of collagen XVIII, is an endogenous inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis that also inhibits choroidal neovascularization. In this study, we assessed the effects of increased intraocular expression of endostatin on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced changes in the retina. After subretinal injection of a pair of gutless adenoviral vectors (AGV) designed to provide tamoxifen-inducible expression of endostatin, diffuse endostatin immunoreactivity was induced thoroughout the retina by administration of tamoxifen. Induction of endostatin in double transgenic mice with doxycycline-induced expression of VEGF in the retina resulted in significant suppression of leakage of intravascular [3H]mannitol into the retina. The ability of endostatin to reduce VEGF-induced retinal vascular permeability was confirmed by using [3H]mannitol leakage and two other parameters, fluorescein leakage and retinal thickness, after subretinal injection of a bovine immunodeficiency lentiviral vector coding for endostatin (BIV-vectored endostatin, or BIVendostatin). Subretinal injection of BIVendostatin resulted in more discrete, less intense staining for endostatin in the retina than that seen with the inducible AGV system, which suggested lower levels and allowed visualization of sites where endostatin was concentrated. Endostatin staining outlined retinal blood vessels, which suggested endostatin binding to a component of vessel walls. More prolonged or higher level expression of VEGF in the retina resulted in neovascularization and retinal detachment, both of which were also significantly reduced by BIVendostatin. These data suggest that endostatin may be an endogenous inhibitor of vasopermeability as well as neovascularization. In patients with diabetic retinopathy, endostatin gene transfer may provide a way to decrease the risk of three causes of visual loss: macular edema, neovascularization, and retinal detachment."

Here we demonstrate that overexpression of the sarcoplasmic-reticulum stress-protein Grp94 reduces myocyte necrosis due to calcium overload or simulated ischemia. Selective three- to eightfold Grp94 increase, with no change in Grp78 or calreticulin amount, was achieved by stable transfection of skeletal C2C12 and cardiac H9c2 muscle cells. After exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187, LDH release from five different Grp94-overexpressing clones of either C2C12 and H9c2 origin was significantly lower than that of control ones and [Ca 2+]i increase was significantly delayed. The number of necrotic cells, evaluated by propidium iodide uptake, was reduced when cells from the Grp94-overexpressing H9c2 clone were exposed to conditions simulating ischemia. Experiments performed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes co-transfected with grp94 and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNAs validated the protective effect of Grp94 overexpression. A lower percentage of propidium-iodide positive/GFP-fluorescent myocytes co-expressing exogenous Grp94, with respect to myocytes expressing GFP alone, was observed after exposure to either A23187 (6.6% vs. 14.0%, respectively) or simulated ischemia (8.5% vs. 17.7%, respectively). In conclusion, the selective increase in Grp94 protects cardiomyocytes from both ischemia and calcium overload counteracting [Ca 2+]i elevations."
https://openalex.org/W2049881558,"Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) is a large (520-kDa) complex secretory protein; its secretion is regulated posttranscriptionally by several degradation pathways. The best described of these degradative processes is co-translational ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of nascent apoB, involving the 70- and 90-kDa heat shock proteins and the multiple components of the proteasomal pathway. Ubiquitinylation involves several proteins, including ligases called E3s, that coordinate the covalent binding of ubiquitin to target proteins. The recent discovery that tumor autocrine motility factor receptor, also known as gp78, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated E3, raised the possibility that this E3 might be involved in the ER-associated degradation of nascent apoB. In a series of experiments in HepG2 cells, we demonstrated that overexpression of gp78 was sufficient for increased ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB, with reduced secretion of apoB-lipoproteins. This action of gp78 was specific: overexpression of the protein did not affect secretion of either albumin or apolipoprotein AI. Furthermore, overexpression of a cytosolic E3, Itch, had no effect on apoB secretion. Finally, using an in vitro translation system, we demonstrated that gp78 led to increased ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB48.

Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Google Scholar), and overproduction of these lipoproteins is a common feature of human dyslipidemia (2Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 453-458Google Scholar). Extensive studies of cultured primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells have established that significant control over apoB secretion can be achieved at the post-transcriptional level by degradation. One form of presecretory degradation, namely the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of apoB, is regulated by the availability of newly synthesized core lipids (triglyceride, cholesterol ester) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity (1Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Google Scholar, 3Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Google Scholar, 4Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Google Scholar). When lipid availability or microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity is limited, translocation of apoB is incomplete, and apoB is ubiquitinylated co-translationally and degraded by the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (5Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Google Scholar, 6Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Cytosolic and nuclear proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation by the addition of multi-ubiquitin chains. The specificity of this process is largely conferred by ubiquitin (Ub) protein ligases (E3s) (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar, 11Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Google Scholar, 12Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). E3s interact directly or indirectly with substrate and mediate the transfer of Ub from Ub-conjugating enzymes to target proteins. Two major E3 classes have been identified: HECT domain E3s and RING finger E3s (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar, 11Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Google Scholar, 12Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). HECT domain E3s are homologous to E6-AP C-terminal domain E3s, which accept Ub from Ub-conjugating enzymes, thereby forming thiol-ester intermediates with Ub. The Ub is then transferred to the target protein. In contrast, RING finger E3s bind Ub-conjugating enzymes and apparently mediate the direct transfer of Ub from an Ub-conjugating enzyme to the target protein. Gp78 was originally isolated as a membrane glycoprotein from murine melanoma cells and was implicated in cell migration (13Nabi I.R. Raz A. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 40: 396-402Google Scholar). Subsequently, gp78 was identified as the tumor autocrine motility factor receptor mediating tumor invasion and metastasis (14Nabi I.R. Watanabe H. Silletti S. Raz A. EXS. 1991; 59: 163-177Google Scholar). Recently, we identified the tumor autocrine motility factor receptor gp78 as a RING finger-dependent Ub protein ligase, the first mammalian ER-resident E3 (15Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Google Scholar). This protein localizes primarily to the ER and targets itself, as well as a well-characterized ERAD substrate, the T cell antigen receptor CD3 δ-subunit, for proteasomal degradation. Because of the demonstrated role of gp78 in the ERAD for one target protein, we investigated whether it played a similar role for apoB, a secretory protein. When apoB's “lipid-ligands” are limited, it undergoes extensive degradation by the Ub-proteasome system (1Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Google Scholar). We investigated this role by two approaches: transfection studies in HepG2 cells and co-expression of gp78 and apoB in a cell-free system. Our results with both approaches were consistent with each other and together indicate that gp78 is a bona fide E3 ligase in the apoB ERAD pathway. Reagents—N-Acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal (ALLN), oleic acid, Triton X-100 and protein A-Sepharose CL 4B were purchased from Sigma. ALLN was used at a concentration of 100 μm (40 μg/ml). Sheep anti-human apoB polyclonal antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science. [35S]Methionine/cysteine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. LipofectAMINE was purchased from Invitrogen. Growth of Cells—HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Briefly, cells were maintained at 37 °Cin5%CO2 in 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed every 3 days, and experiments were started after the cells were 70–90% confluent. During the experiments, cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in serum-free minimum essential medium containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin, with the indicated additions or treatments. In transfection experiments, HepG2 cells were treated with LipofectAMINE with or without human gp78 cDNA (15Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Google Scholar) or murine Itch cDNA (15Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Google Scholar). Itch is a cytosolic E3 that is not involved in ERAD (16Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Google Scholar, 17Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Google Scholar). After 36 h, cells were labeled with [35S]Methionine/cysteine in the presence or absence of ALLN. The cell lysates and conditioned medium were analyzed by immunoprecipitation as described below. Immunoprecipitation—Briefly, after samples were incubated on a shaker for 10 h at 4 °C with an excess amount of anti-apoB antiserum, the immune complexes were precipitated by an additional 3-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The samples were analyzed on 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For analysis of ubiquitinylated apoB, cellular immunoprecipitates produced by the addition of anti-ubiquitin antibodies were resolubilized by boiling 4 min in 2% SDS and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB antibody after adjusting the SDS concentration to 0.1%. Cell-free System Studies—The cell-free expression of human apoB48 cDNA in the Promega TnT system was described previously (18Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Google Scholar). Briefly, human apoB48 cDNA (1.5 μg of circular plasmid) was transcribed/translated in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, canine pancreatic microsomes, and 35S protein labeling mix (1000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences); hereafter, this is referred to as the “reaction.” ApoB48 was studied either as translated alone or co-translated with gp78 cDNA (0.5 μg) and either with or without 50 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinal (PSI; proteasome inhibitor obtained from S. Wilk, Mount Sinai School of Medicine) (18Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Google Scholar, 19Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Berg K.A. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1578-1581Google Scholar) dissolved in Me2SO. In the reactions in which PSI was absent, an equivalent volume of Me2SO was substituted. Incubation of the coupled transcription/translation reactions (total volume, 50 μl) was carried out at 30 °C for 1.5 h. Aliquots (25% of the transcription/translation reaction mixture) were taken to isolate microsomes by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The microsomes were then solubilized in gel loading buffer and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (3–17% acrylamide gradient). Fluorography was used to detect the radioactive apoB48 protein bands. The remaining 75% of the reaction mixture was used to study apoB48 ubiquitinylation. A 100× excess of unlabeled Met/Cys was added, and the reaction mixture was composed of 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatinine phosphate, and 100 μg/ml creatine kinase. Then 5 μl of 1 μg/μl hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin (provided by Z. Ronai, Mount Sinai School of Medicine) was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the microsomes were isolated as above. To recover ubiquitinylated ApoB48, the microsomes were then subjected to a two-step immunoprecipitation procedure (first step, 5 μl of monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ); second step, 5 μl of anti-human apoB antibody (Roche Diagnostics)). The final immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as above. We first investigated the effect of overexpression of gp78 in HepG2 cells on the synthesis and secretion of apoB. Itch (16Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Google Scholar, 17Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Google Scholar), a cytosolic E3, was used as a control. Thirty-six hours after transient transfection with cDNAs for gp78 or myc-tagged Itch, HepG2 cells were labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine. After labeling, cellular and medium were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-human apoB, anti-human albumin, or anti-human apolipoprotein AI antibodies. The latter two proteins are not known to be ERAD substrates and served as controls. Specific expression of gp78 was confirmed by Western blotting analysis with an anti-gp78 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1, left). Itch was also highly expressed after transfection, as demonstrated with anti-myc antibody (Fig. 1, right). Note that the lack of signal in control cells implies a low level of expression of each endogenous protein. Overexpression of gp78 had a minimal effect on the level of labeled apoB in the cells (Fig. 1B, left). By contrast, overexpression of gp78 in HepG2 cells resulted in a marked reduction in the secretion of apoB (Fig. 1B, right). When the results of five separate experiments (with two to five wells per transfection per experiment) were pooled, overexpression of gp78 reduced secretion of apoB to 26.0 ± 10.3% of mock transfected cells. Overexpression of Itch cDNA had no overall effect on secreted apoB (94.5 ± 36.5% of mock-transfected cells). Importantly, overexpression of gp78 had no effect on either the synthesis or secretion of either apolipoprotein AI or human albumin, proteins that do not undergo intracellular degradation by the proteasome (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, the decreased secretion of apoB associated with overexpression of gp78 was completely reversed by ALLN, an inhibitor of proteasomal degradation that blocks apoB ERAD in HepG2 cells as effectively as lactacystin (6Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 1, C and D, indicate that the decrease in apoB secretion that resulted from overexpression of gp78 (Fig. 1B) was specific and was most probably caused by increased proteasomal degradation. To extend these findings, we next immunoprecipitated ubiquitinylated apoB molecules in a two-step protocol while the proteasome was inhibited by ALLN. After labeling, cellular lysates were first immunoprecipitated by anti-ubiquitin antiserum; these immunoprecipitates were then denatured and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with the anti-apoB antiserum. Fig. 2 shows that overexpression of gp78 resulted in a significant increase of ubiquitinylated apoB molecules in the cells. Because of the high molecular mass of apoB (∼520 kDa), we typically observe either minimally ubiquitinylated apoB running where native apoB is found on a 4% gel (Fig. 2, Ub-apoB100) or polyubiquitinylated apoB at the very top of the gel (Fig. 2, Ub-apoB). In this experiment, we demonstrated the presence of increased ubiquitinylated apoB in both of these regions of the gel as well as some intermediate sizes of ubiquitinylated apoB represented by the smear between the two clearer bands. Overexpression of Itch (Fig. 2, middle lane) may have resulted in a slight increase in ubiquitinylated apoB compared with control cells. Together, the results depicted in Figs. 1D and 2 indicate that overexpression of gp78 resulted in decreased secretion of apoB via increased ubiquitinylation and targeting of apoB for proteasomal degradation. Because apoB degradation is regulated by lipid availability (1Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Google Scholar, 3Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Google Scholar, 4Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Google Scholar), we next investigated the effect of oleic acid treatment on the secretion of apoB in gp78-transfected HepG2 cells. Thirty-six hours after being transiently transfected with gp78, HepG2 cells were labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine in the presence of ALLN. The labeling medium was then washed out and cells were first incubated for an additional 15 min in new medium without ALLN. After the first 15-min chase, medium was changed again to fresh medium with or without oleic acid (0.4 mm), and the cells were incubated for 15, 30, or 60 min. Chase medium was collected at each time point and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB antibody. Fig. 3 shows that oleic acid significantly increased apoB secretion in HepG2 cells overexpressing gp78 compared with gp78-transfected cells incubated without OA (Fig. 3, compare lanes 12–14 (+OA) with lanes 9–11 (–OA)). This is consistent with our previous observations that oleic acid, either by stimulating core lipid synthesis (20Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Google Scholar, 21Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Google Scholar) or acting via some other pathway (22Pan M. Liang J.-S. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4413-4421Google Scholar), can target apoB away from ERAD and toward secretion. Furthermore, these results are concordant with those of our previous study, in which oleic acid blocked the inhibition of apoB secretion by herbimycin, which increases expression of the 70-kDa heat shock protein and facilitates ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB (6Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Google Scholar). Oleic acid treatment also increased apoB secretion in HepG2 cells transfected with Itch (lanes 6–8, +OA) but apoB secretion in cells overexpressing Itch incubated without OA was greater at all time points compared with gp78-expressing cells incubated without OA (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3–5 with lanes 9–11). The pulse-chase design used in this experiment also provided data demonstrating directly that the decrease in apoB recovery from media shown in Fig. 1 was a consequence of increased degradation of apoB, not effects of gp78 overexpression on apoB synthesis (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2; cell lysates obtained 15 min after labeling). The second approach we took to establish the role of gp78 in apoB ERAD was to co-express gp78 cDNA and apoB48 cDNA in a cell-free system that we had previously demonstrated could recapitulate the major features of apoB100 ERAD (18Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the co-expression of gp78 led to decreased recovery of microsome-associated apoB48 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 3; for each sample, microsomes from 12.5 μl of the transcription/translation reaction mixture were solubilized directly in gel buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE). Concomitantly, overexpresssion of gp78 was associated with an increase in Ub-apoB48 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 4; for each sample, microsomes from 37.5 μl of the transcription/translation reaction mixture were subjected to a two-step immunoprecipitation to isolate ubiquitinylated apoB48). Nonspecific effects of co-expression could not explain these results, because the co-expression of luciferase and apoB48 had no impact on apoB48 recovery or ubiquitinylation relative to results when only apoB48 was expressed (data not shown). That the decreased recovery of apoB48 observed when gp78 was co-expressed was caused by proteasomal degradation is supported clearly by the data in Fig. 4B, which employed PSI (19Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Berg K.A. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1578-1581Google Scholar), an effective inhibitor of the proteasome in the cell-free system (18Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, PSI did not alter the recovery of microsome-associated apoB48 when it was expressed alone (Fig. 4, compare lanes A1 and B1), but did significantly increase recovery of translated apoB48 from reaction mixtures where gp78 was co-expressed (Fig. 4, compare lanes A3 and B3). We have previously shown that the most highly ubiquitinylated apoB species are stable and do not undergo de-ubiquitinylation (23Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarah R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Google Scholar). Thus, the appearance of a wider molecular mass range of Ub-apoB48 species when PSI is added to inhibit proteasomal degradation is not surprising (Fig. 4, lanes A4 and B4, compare the regions above the expected migration of unmodified apoB48). The more labile forms of moderately ubiquitinylated apB48 that run between the top of the gel and where minimally ubiquitinylated apoB48 runs were now able to accumulate. ApoB is an atypical secretory protein that, after undergoing early translational targeting to the ER and initiation of co-translational translocation into the ER lumen, assumes a bitopic orientation in the ER membrane. Thus, concomitant with a prolonged interaction between apoB and the Sec61 proteins of the translocon (24Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Johnson A.E. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 541-550Google Scholar), partially translocated apoB has domains in both the ER lumen and in the cytosol (25Davis R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Google Scholar). Because of this atypical orientation relative to the ER membrane, sequences of apoB are exposed to the cytosol, leading to an interaction with the 70- and 90-kDa heat shock proteins and the 26 S proteasome (18Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Google Scholar, 26Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L.-S. Ginsberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Google Scholar). These associations can lead to cotranslational ubiquitinylation (27Zhou M. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Google Scholar) and degradation (7Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Google Scholar). The proportion of newly synthesized apoB that undergoes degradation by the proteasome is critically dependent on the availability of the lipid-ligands for apoB, especially triglycerides (4Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Google Scholar, 28Wu X. Sakata N. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1200-1210Google Scholar, 29Wu X. Sakata N. Lui E. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12375-12382Google Scholar), and varies by cell type. However, ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB has been shown to occur in all systems, including primary hepatocytes (1Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Google Scholar). Ubiquitinylation is dependent on several proteins that activate and transfer ubiquitin to the targeted protein substrate (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar, 11Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Google Scholar, 12Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). The fact that ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB occurs cotranslationally raised the question as to whether any of the proteins involved in those processes were associated with the ER. It has been demonstrated in yeast, for example, that mutant carboxypeptidase Y (30Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Google Scholar) or misfolded hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (31Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Google Scholar) interacts with E3 ligases that are members of the DER3/HRD complex, which contains multiple integral ER membrane proteins (32Deak P.M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10663-10669Google Scholar). The recent identification of a mammalian transmembrane E3 associated with the ER (15Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Google Scholar) allowed us to address that question. The results of the present studies provide clear evidence that the ER-associated E3, gp78, can participate in the ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of apoB. This finding adds another important piece to a model of post-transcriptional regulation of apoB secretion in which, after initial insertion of the amino terminus of apoB into the ER lumen, degradation can be initiated in the original translocon (33Liang J.-S. Wu X. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32003-32010Google Scholar) after only 50–60% (7Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Google Scholar, 27Zhou M. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Google Scholar) of the protein has been translated. Considering the size of apoB (4536 amino acids) and the complexity of its secondary and tertiary structure (34Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Google Scholar), the presence of all essential components of a major system for degradation at the site of synthesis of this protein provides the most efficient system for regulation. In this regard, the results of the present study are consistent with our previous data, which demonstrated that other cytosolic components involved in the targeting and degradation of apoB, such as the 70- and 90-kDa heat shock proteins and proteasomes, are all associated with microsomal apoB in lipid-deprived HepG2 cells (1Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Google Scholar, 24Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Johnson A.E. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 541-550Google Scholar). Whether other ER-associated E3s, or cytosolic E3s other than Itch, can participate significantly in apoB degradation remains to be determined. Because of the large size of apoB, it would not be surprising if its different domains are processed by distinct E3s, given the selectivity of these ligases. We thank Cristina Villagra for excellent technical assistance."

Here, we show that inhibition of 5-LO product formation by nonredox-type 5-LO inhibitors in human isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) depends on the activation pathway of 5-LO. Thus, compared with 5-LO product synthesis induced by the Ca2+-mobilizing agent ionophore A23187, cell stress-induced 5-LO product formation involving 5-LO kinase pathways required ~10- to 100-fold higher concentrations of ZM230487 or L-739.010 for comparable 5-LO inhibition. No such differences were observed for the iron ligand-type 5-LO inhibitor BWA4C or the novel-type 5-LO inhibitors hyperforin and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid. Experiments using purified 5-LO revealed that Ca2+ is no prerequisite for potent enzyme inhibition by ZM230487, and exposure of PMNL to the combination of ionophore and cell stress did not restore potent 5-LO suppression. Intriguingly, a significant difference in the potency of nonredox-type inhibitors (but not of BWA4C) was determined between wild-type 5-LO and the mutant S271A/S663A-5-LO (lacking phosphorylation sites for ERK1/2 and MAPKAPK-2) in HeLa cells. Collectively, our data suggest that compared with Ca2+-mediated 5-LO product formation, enzyme activation involving 5-LO phosphorylation events specifically and strongly alters the susceptibility of 5-LO toward nonredox-type inhibitors in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071124909,"Transplantation of pancreatic islets reconstitutes glucose homeostasis in diabetes mellitus. Before transplantation, islets are disrupted from the surrounding blood vessels by the isolation procedure, with the grafted tissue being subject to ischemic damage. The survival of transplanted islets is assumed to depend on effective revascularization. Perfusion studies suggest that newly formed microvessels supplying the graft with nutrients are exclusively rebuilt by the host. It is generally not known whether isolated islets contain endothelial cells (EC), which potentially participate in the revascularization process. Therefore, we tried to detect immature EC in isolated islets by transformation with polyoma middle T antigen. Endothelioma cells were generated, implicating the presence of de-differentiated EC within isolated islets. When embedded in a fibrin gel, the islets developed cellular cords consisting of EC, whereas FGF-2 and VEGF stimulated the formation of cord-like structures. Furthermore, we studied the presence of donor EC in islet grafts by using transgenic mice with an EC lineage-specific promotor-LacZ reporter construct (Tie-2LacZ). Following islet transplantation, Tie-2LacZ-positive EC of both donor and recipient were identified in the vicinity of or within the graft up to 3 wk after transplantation. In conclusion, EC and/or their progenitors with angiogenic capacity reside within isolated islets of different species, and their proliferative potential can be stimulated by various inducers. These graft-related endothelia persist after islet transplantation and are integrated within newly formed microvessels."

The HTLV-I transactivator protein Tax plays an integral role in the etiology of adult T cell leukemia, as expression of Tax in T lymphocytes has been shown to result in immortalization. In addition, Tax is known to interface with numerous transcription factor families, including activating transcription factor/cAMP response element-binding protein and nuclear factor-κB, requiring Tax to localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In this report, the nucleocytoplasmic localization of Tax was examined in Jurkat, HeLa, and U-87 MG cells. The results reported herein indicate that Tax contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) that, when fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), can direct nuclear export via the CRM-1 pathway, as determined by leptomycin B inhibition of nuclear export. However, cytoplasmic localization of full-length Tax was not altered by treatment with leptomycin B, suggesting that native Tax utilizes another nuclear export pathway. Additional support for the presence of a functional NES has also been shown because the NES mutant Tax(L200A)-GFP localized to the nuclear membrane in the majority of U-87 MG cells. Evidence has also been provided suggesting that the Tax NES likely exists as a conditionally masked signal because the truncation mutant TaxΔ214-GFP localized constitutively to the cytoplasm.

The HTLV-I transactivator protein Tax plays an integral role in productive virus replication and disease progression. Tax is known to interact with a number of cellular signaling pathways and interfaces with numerous transcription factor families, including activating transcription factor/cAMP response element-binding protein (ATF/CREB) and NF-κB (1Grant C. Barmak K. Alefantis T. Yao J. Jacobson S. Wigdahl B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Specifically, Tax enhances CREB binding within the HTLV-I long terminal repeat, which in turn enhances transcription of viral mRNA (2Zhao L.J. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 3Wessner R. Tillmann-Bogush M. Wigdahl B. J. Neurovirol. 1995; 1: 62-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Giebler H.A.

Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to the NF-κB pathway, cytoplasmic Tax acts by directly binding the IKK-γ-subunit of the IκB kinase inhibitor complex. This association induces the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α, the inhibitor of NF-κB, thereby allowing the NF-κB complex to migrate to the nucleus and induce gene expression (6Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 7Jin D.Y. Giordano V. Kibler K.V. Nakano H. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol.

Although the exact events that lead to ATL have not been defined, it has been shown that Tax plays an integral role in this pathologic process (9Barmak K. Harhaj E.W. Grant C. Alefantis T. Wigdahl B. Virology. 2003; 308: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Expression of Tax in T lymphocytes has been shown to result in immortalization (10Grassmann R. Dengler C. Muller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. McGuire K. Dokhelar M.C. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Rosin O. Koch C. Schmitt I. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. Grassmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6698-6703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Normal cells contain checkpoint pathways that prevent cellular division before any DNA damage or chromosomal abnormalities are repaired. Most cancerous cells, including cells and cell lines derived from individuals with ATL, have abnormalities in these checkpoint pathways. A number of molecular mechanisms have been proposed to account for the abnormalities observed in leukemic cells derived from ATL patients. Relevant to these observations, Tax has been shown to bind to the human homolog of MAD1, resulting in a loss of MAD1 function and the appearance of multinucleated giant cells (12Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.-T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Additionally, HTLV-I-infected cells are resistant to microtubule inhibitors, a trait that is associated with the loss of MAD protein function (13Kasai T. Iwanaga Y. Iha H. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5187-5193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAD1 and MAD2 are localized to the cytoplasm in HTLV-I-infected cells, as opposed to the nucleus, where they have been shown to accumulate in normal cells. Although previous studies have indicated that Tax contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) at its amino terminus (amino acids 2–58) (14Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Virology. 1992; 187: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), very little is known concerning the cis-and trans-acting elements and factors, respectively, involved in transport of Tax from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Recently, an amino acid sequence involved in the export of proteins from the nucleus has been identified and characterized (15Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 16Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). This nuclear export signal (NES) usually contains a string of hydrophobic amino acids, including leucine and isoleucine residues (Fig. 1). In conjunction with the cis-acting NES, the cellular protein CRM-1 has also been shown to facilitate export of NES-containing proteins to the cytoplasm (17Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 18Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). The intracellular distribution of a variety of cellular proteins involved in transcriptional regulation occurs via the CRM-1-mediated nuclear export pathway. Nuclear export of several proteins through this pathway is regulated by diverse molecular mechanisms such as protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination that facilitate binding of CRM-1 to the NES (21Cartwright P. Helin K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Gu J. Nie L. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8533-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Wang A.H. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5992-6005Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, if the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Tax is controlled by CRM-1 or other nuclear export proteins, then the level of activity generated by these interactions and modifications can have substantial effects on the level of viral and cellular gene transcription. Previous studies have indicated that Tax is able to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (24Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that Tax interfaces with a nuclear export pathway. In support of these observations, we have demonstrated that Tax contains an NES between amino acids 188 and 202. Functional properties of the Tax NES have been examined in two cell lines: HeLa (cervical carcinoma), a cell line that has been traditionally used to study Tax localization; and U-87 MG, a cell line of astrocytic origin that has been shown to contain higher levels of Tax within the cytoplasm compared with the nuclear compartment (25Szymocha R.

Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Szymocha R. Brisson C. Bernard A. Akaoka H. Belin M.F. Giraudon P. J. Neurovirol. 2000; 6: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The results reported herein indicate that Tax contains a leucine-rich NES that, when fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), can direct nuclear export via the CRM-1 export pathway, as determined by leptomycin B (LMB) inhibition of nuclear export. However, cytoplasmic localization of full-length Tax was not altered by treatment with LMB, suggesting that native Tax may utilize another nuclear export pathway. Interestingly, a Tax NES point mutation (L200A) within the context of full-length Tax resulted in a nuclear envelope localization of Tax in the majority of transfected U-87 MG cells. Evidence is also provided suggesting that the Tax NES within its native context may be a masked signal because the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant TaxΔ214-GFP was shown to localize constitutively to the cytoplasm, although it still retained the NLS. As with full-length Tax-GFP, the cytoplasmic localization of TaxΔ214-GFP was not altered by treatment of cells with LMB, providing additional support that Tax nuclear export is not directed by CRM-1. These results suggest that the localization of Tax may be directed by specific changes in Tax conformation or by specific interactions with other cellular proteins that could lead to changes in the availability of the Tax NES and NLS. Cell Culture—HeLa and U-87 MG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. For each cell line, the growth medium was supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and kanamycin at 0.04 mg/ml each), l-glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), and sodium bicarbonate (0.05%). Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 at 90% relative humidity. Fusion Protein Construction and Plasmid DNA Purification—The cDNA coding sequences for Tax and the TaxΔ214 truncation mutant protein were cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) using PCR and Tax-specific primers. This resulted in a protein expression construct in which Tax was fused to the amino terminus of GFP. The Tax NES (tNES)-GFP and tNES(L194A)-GFP recombinant plasmids were constructed by cloning double-stranded oligonucleotides into the HindIII and SstII restriction endonuclease sites within the pEGFP-N1 plasmid. Point mutations of the NES within the context of full-length Tax-GFP were constructed using oligonucleotides encoding the mutations and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA used for screening and automated sequencing was isolated using the Concert miniprep system (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. The nucleotide sequences of all plasmid constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing (Macromolecular Core Facilities of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine) and subsequent bioinformatics analysis using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). Transient Transfections—For microscopic analyses, HeLa and U-87 MG cells were plated in an eight-well chamber slide coated with either collagen (HeLa) or fibronectin (U-87 MG) (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection. Jurkat cells were plated in a 12-well plate after transfection at 2 × 106 cells/well. For Western immunoblot analyses, HeLa and U-87 MG cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in a six-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. HeLa and U-87 MG cell transfections were performed using 2.4 μg of DNA and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with a protocol optimized for each cell line. Jurkat cell transfections were performed using 2.0 μg of DNA and Amaxa Nucleofection Kit V (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) along with program T-14 on the Nucleofector device. Leptomycin B (Sigma) was added to the culture medium 21 h after transfection at the indicated concentrations. Western Immunoblot Analyses—After transfection (24 h), the cell culture medium was collected and subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min. The resultant cell pellet was washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1 ml). Cells attached to the culture dish were also washed once with cold PBS (1 ml), scraped off the culture dish using a rubber cell scraper, and then added to the cell pellet. Cells were lysed using the mammalian protein extraction reagent (200 μl for cells transfected with GFP and 50 μl for the remaining reactions; Pierce) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The lysate (15 μl) was added to Laemmli sample buffer (15 μl; Bio-Rad) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto a 10% Tris-HCl/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), subjected to electrophoresis at 180 V for 45 min, and blotted onto nitrocellulose (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) for 2 h at 40 mA. Blots were blocked for 15 min with 5% milk dissolved in a solution of PBS with 1.0% Tween 20 (PBST), rinsed once for 10 min and twice for 5 min with PBST, incubated for 1 h with the GFP-specific antibody ab-290 (Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, UK), rinsed once for 10 min and twice for 5 min with PBST, and incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, blots were washed again once for 10 min and twice for 5 min with PBST, developed using the Western Lightning kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to x-ray film. Subsequently, blots were stripped of both the primary and secondary antibodies utilizing Restore Western blot stripping buffer (50 ml; Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. To control for the amount of protein loaded per well, blots were probed with an anti-tubulin primary antibody (Sigma) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction—HeLa or U-87 MG cells were plated in six-well plates and transfected as described above. After transfection (24 h), the medium was removed, and cells were washed once with cold PBS (1 ml). PBS (0.5 ml) was added to each well, and cells were scraped off using a rubber cell scraper and transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min, and the PBS was removed. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions were isolated using the nuclear extraction-protein extraction reagent (Pierce). Fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot analyses as described above. The presence of transfected proteins was detected using the anti-GFP primary antibody ab-6663 (Abcam Ltd.) and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Protein bands of interest were scanned using an Eastman Kodak Image Station 440CF, and band intensities were quantified using Eastman Kodak 1D Image Analysis software. Microscopic Analyses—Transfected cells were prepared for microscopic analysis ∼24 h after transfection. In preparation for fixation of cells, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed once with 0.2 ml of PBS. Cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice for 5 min with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and washed again twice for 5 min with PBS. Actin and nucleic acids were stained for 15 min with phalloidin-Alexa 546 (82.5 nm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and for 2 min with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (100 pm; Molecular Probes, Inc.) diluted in PBS. Coverslips were added along with Fluormount-G mounting medium (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL). Cells were visualized using an Olympus IX-81 automated microscope equipped with appropriate filter cubes for visualizing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Alexa 546, and enhanced GFP (EGFP). Images were obtained with a Cook CCD Sensicam digital camera controlled by Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). All components of the microscopy system were controlled using an Apple Macintosh G4 dual 1-GHz processor computer. Raw fluorescent images were deconvolved (no-neighbors method) using Slidebook. For imaging of live cells transfected with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), Tax-YFP, or TaxΔ214-YFP along with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-Nuc (Clontech), no preparation was performed prior to microscopic analysis. For imaging of live cells transfected with GFP constructs, cells were incubated with 1 mm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) diluted in culture medium for 10 min immediately prior to microscopic analysis. Cells were visualized using an Olympus IX-81 automated microscope equipped with appropriate filter cubes for visualizing Hoechst and EGFP or YFP and CFP, and images were obtained as described above. Quantification of Cytoplasmic Tax-GFP after Microscopic Analysis— HeLa and U-87 MG cells were plated on fibronectin-coated slides, transfected with Tax-GFP in the absence or presence of LMB, and then prepared for microscopic analysis as described above. Images of 50 cells from each treatment group were obtained and deconvolved (no-neighbors method) using Slidebook. For each cell image (see Fig. 2), three masks highlighting Tax-GFP, the nucleus, or the cytoplasm were constructed using either the mask segmentation or mask creation and drawing tools within Slidebook. Mask operations were then utilized to isolate Tax-GFP localized within either the nucleus or cytoplasm. Submasks were constructed to determine the square area (μm2) of each Tax-GFP point. The total area of Tax-GFP in each compartment (cytoplasm or nucleus) was calculated and summed. The percent of total Tax-GFP in the cytoplasm was determined by utilizing the formula (c/(c + n)) × 100, where c is the total square area of cytoplasmic Tax-GFP and n is the total square area of nuclear Tax-GFP per cell. Statistical Analyses—Data collected for the quantitation of cytoplasmic Tax-GFP were analyzed for statistical significance using JMP Version 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Briefly, each set of data was imported into JMP, and an analysis of variance was performed on the four data groups as a whole. The statistical significance of each of the indicated comparisons (see Fig. 3B) was determined using Student's t test. Tax-YFP/GFP Intracellular Distribution Is Cell Type-dependent—Several studies have examined the intracellular distribution of the HTLV-I Tax protein (14Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Virology. 1992; 187: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 28Gitlin S.D. Lindholm P.F.

These investigations have indicated that Tax localizes mainly to the nucleus in interchromatin granules and spliceosomal speckles, areas of the genome where high rates of transcription are thought to occur (30Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, very little Tax was detected in the cytoplasm of the cell types examined, including HeLa and COS-7 cells as well as the HTLV-I-infected cell lines C8166-45 and MT2. However, in more recent studies performed in selected T cell lines, HeLa cells, and primary astrocytes or astrocytic cell lines infected with HTLV-I, Tax was shown to accumulate to significant levels in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus (24Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Szymocha R. Brisson C. Bernard A. Akaoka H. Belin M.F. Giraudon P. J.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these studies have provided the foundation for additional experiments focused on defining the cellular and viral parameters that regulate the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Tax. To facilitate studies to examine the intracellular localization of Tax in live cells, the Tax DNA coding sequence was fused to the coding sequence for YFP (pEYFP-N1, Clontech). The intracellular localization of the Tax-YFP chimeric protein was examined in several cell lines in which the nuclear marker CFPNuc was also transfected. CD4+ cells serve as a primary HTLV-I target cell during the genesis of both ATL and HAM/ TSP; thus, the Jurkat cell line was selected as a representative CD4+ T cell line for initial experimentation. In this cell line, Tax localized primarily to the nucleus (Fig. 2, upper panels). The nuclear localization of Tax-YFP in Jurkat cells was similar to that described in previous reports of Tax localization in T cells utilizing indirect immunofluorescence (33Bex F. McDowall A. Burny A. Gaynor R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3484-3497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conjunction with these studies, the intracellular localization of Tax-YFP was also examined in HeLa cells based on their extensive use in previous studies that have focused on the intracellular localization of Tax (24Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Nicot C. Tie F. Giam C.Z. J.

As previously described utilizing indirect immunofluorescence analyses, transfection of HeLa cells with the Tax-YFP construct resulted in the localization of Tax to the nucleus in a punctate pattern (Fig. 2, middle panels). However, by visual comparison, the amount of cytoplasmic localization of Tax-YFP in HeLa cells occurred to a greater degree than previously reported (Fig. 2, middle panels). Previous studies have demonstrated that the degree of Tax localized to the cytoplasm differs based on both the cell type used to study localization and the detection system used to identify Tax (31Yao Y. Kuo Y.L. Wang L. Harrod R. Tang Y. Cai P. Harrington W. Boros I. Shih H. Giam C.Z. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 535Google Scholar, 32Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The previous studies cited utilized either immunofluorescence in concert with an anti-Tax antibody (4C5) that recognizes amino acids 333–353 or a fusion of Tax and the fluorescent protein Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein or EGFP. Antibody 4C5 was found to detect Tax in different nucleocytoplasmic ratios depending on the cell type used for detection. For instance, antibody 4C5 was reported to detect Tax in the nucleus of JPX cells (a Jurkat-derived cell line that stably expresses Tax), in the nucleus and cytoplasm of PX1 cells (fibroblasts isolated from a Tax transgenic mouse), and predominantly in the cytoplasm of passage 3 primary T cells cultured from peripheral blood lymphocytes of ATL patients (31Yao Y. Kuo Y.L. Wang L. Harrod R. Tang Y. Cai P. Harrington W. Boros I. Shih H. Giam C.Z. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 535Google Scholar). In addition, Tax-Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein and Tax-EGFP were both found to localize to the nucleus and cytoplasm in “hot spots” when transiently transfected into either human osteosarcoma or H441 cells (32Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both of these studies utilized methods similar to the methods presented here in that only full-length Tax or an isoform of Tax in which the carboxyl terminus was available for antibody binding was detected. Previous studies of Tax intracellular localization in HeLa cells that demonstrated strong nuclear localization and very little cytoplasmic localization may have utilized antibodies directed against other regions of Tax that were not available when Tax was localized in the cytoplasm (24Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that the YFP tag utilized in the studies presented herein promoted Tax nuclear export or inhibited Tax nuclear import, resulting in increased levels of cytoplasmic localization. However, we consider this to be an unlikely event based on the ubiquitous utilization of YFP in many other studies of protein intracellular localization in which the YFP tag did not appear to alter the course of cellular localization of the native protein. Furthermore, the degree of cytoplasmic localization of Tax-GFP in HeLa cells was also observed to be different between cells within the same population (data not shown). This could be the result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, stage of the cell cycle and differential expression levels of protein(s) involved in Tax cytoplasmic localization. Because cervical epithelial cells are not likely infected by HTLV-I during the course of either ATL or HAM/TSP, the intracellular localization of Tax-YFP was also examined in the astrocytic U-87 MG cell line. Although in vivo results have not shown conclusively that astrocytes are infected in HTLV-I-positive individuals, experimental results utilizing primary astrocytes infected with HTLV-I in vitro have suggested that astrocytes may be infected in vivo and that viral infection of this cell type may play a role in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP (25Szymocha R.

The presence of verapamil strongly magnified both effects. Inhibition of ATPase was also increased by several other drugs known to bind to drug-binding sites. Inhibition by ADP-vanadate was slow and depended cooperatively on nucleotide binding. Stoichiometry of [14C]ADP trapping by vanadate was 1 mol/mol P-glycoprotein at full inhibition. Catalytic site mutants prevented [14C]ADP trapping, whereas interdomain signal communication mutants reduced it in approximate correlation with their effects upon drug stimulation of ATPase. In explanation of the results, we propose that a “closed conformation” involving dimerization and interdigitation of the two nucleotide-binding domains is necessary to allow inhibition by ADP-vanadate. The results suggest that such a conformation occurs naturally during ATP hydrolysis. It is proposed that in order for the catalytic transition state to form, the two nucleotide-binding domains dimerize to form an integrated single entity containing two bound ATP with just one of the two ATP being hydrolyzed per dimerization event.

P-glycoprotein (Pgp) 1The abbreviations used are: Pgp, P-glycoprotein; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; Vi, vanadate. is a prominent member of the ABC-transporter family of membrane proteins that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to exclude hydrophobic compounds from cells. In human, it was first recognized as a major potential obstacle to successful chemotherapy of cancer because of its expression in cancer cells and was later realized to function physiologically in such strategic locations as the blood-brain barrier, intestine, placenta, and elsewhere as an important agent in protection from environmental and dietary toxins. More recent appreciation of its role in impeding the action of anti-AIDS therapy and its potentially general role in reducing the efficacy of many hydrophobic drugs, new and old, have made it a target of intense investigation.

Our research has focused on the catalytic mechanism by which ATP is hydrolyzed and the energy transduced into drug transport. In 1995, we presented schemes for the hydrolysis of ATP at a single catalytic site (7Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), also for the interaction of the two ATP-binding sites in catalysis and transduction of the energy of hydrolysis to the drug binding site(s) situated in the membrane bilayer (8Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Both ATP-binding sites were shown to have catalytic capability. Release of product Pi was thought to occur before the release of ADP, which was rate-limiting. Interaction of the two ATP-binding sites was concluded to be an integral and a necessary facet of catalysis with hydrolysis of ATP occurring sequentially and alternately at each site. Formation and collapse of the transition state of catalysis were postulated as critical events in driving the changes in drug-binding site affinity and orientation (inward versus outward facing) necessary for binding and extrusion of drug with a stoichiometry of one ATP hydrolyzed per change in drug-binding site affinity and orientation. Later studies of Pgp and also of ABC transporter homologs such as bacterial LmrA and the maltose transporter have supported and extended the earlier schemes (9Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M.

New ideas incorporated into more recent schemes include the concept of reciprocating pairs of drug-binding sites (10Van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Muller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and of the requirement for a second ATP hydrolysis event to “reset” the drug-binding site for drug extrusion (9Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Kerr K.M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Another concept, recently introduced, envisages that the ATP-binding event provides the primary driving force for transport (12Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies provide evidence for conformational changes in the membrane domains observed upon nucleotide binding (12Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar); however, biochemical evidence has been provided showing that the drug-binding site also changes conformation in response to ATP hydrolysis per se (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recent work (15Qu Q. Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, at concentrations of MgATP and MgADP present in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, both nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) in “resting” Pgp would be expected to bind MgATP (15Qu Q. Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our original scheme for ATP-driven drug transport (8Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) envisaged that upon attainment of a conformation in which two ATP were bound in the NBDs concurrent with occupation of the drug-binding site, an intimate interaction of the two NBDs would be engendered as a prerequisite for ATP hydrolysis. In later work we provided evidence for the interaction of the two NBDs in Pgp in catalysis and suggested that formation of a single transition state complex involved liganding from catalytic side-chains of both NBDs (16Urbatsch I.L.

Support for this idea has since come from cross-linking studies showing that catalytic sites of the two NBDs in Pgp can be very close (17Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N.

Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In other ABC transporters the NBDs also interact with each other, as shown by photocleavage studies of the maltose transporter (24Fetsch E.E. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and most recently from x-ray structural characterization of the ABC transporters MJ0796 (25Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L.

Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). This x-ray work showed in detail how the two NBD subunits in ABC transporters can interdigitate to form a “dimer interface” at which the nucleotides are bound. 2The ABC transporter MsbA did not show such close association of the two NBDs (27Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). However, use of OsCl3 to improve resolution may well have dictated orientation of the NBDs seen in this structure (Fig. 2 of Ref. 27Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Thus, “dimerization” of the NBDs appears now to be a well supported feature. In Fig. 1 we show a proposed mechanism of Pgp incorporating the concept of NBD dimerization. A diagram of this kind encourages the thinking that the catalytically active site is actually a composite entity consisting of the two NBDs and two bound ATP, only one of which will by hydrolyzed during one catalytic event. Movement of the NBDs between open and closed forms (Fig. 1) will occur in synchrony with drug transport. However, it is clear that many features of the Pgp catalytic mechanism remain to be elucidated, such as the nature of interdomain communication between the drug-binding site(s) and the NBDs, the structural and functional character of the ATP binding pockets and the transition state, and the time sequence of the dimerization phenomenon in relation to the progression of catalysis through intermediate species. Earlier, we introduced the approach of vanadate (Vi)-induced trapping of nucleotide as a tool to study the catalytic sites in Pgp (7Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Incubation of MgATP with Vi and Pgp was shown to cause strong inhibition of Pgp ATPase brought about by tenacious trapping of MgADP in stoichiometry of just 1 mol ADP/mol Pgp. As was discussed (7Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Urbatsch I.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), biochemical evidence from other ATPase enzymes, notably myosin and dynein, had led to the idea that the pentacovalent Vi in the trapped MgADP·Vi complex mimicked the transition state structure around the γ-phosphate of MgATP in an associative trigonal bipyramidal transition state structure (37Mildvan A.S. Proteins. 1997; 29: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Smith and Rayment (38Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) reported an x-ray structure of myosin bound to MgADP-vanadate, which confirmed this geometry. Biochemical and mutagenesis studies of Pgp have supported such an assignment in Pgp (16Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 276: 1314-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The rate of onset of Vi-induced inhibition and trapping of nucleotide in the presence of MgATP was shown to be accelerated by drugs (40Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 41Szabo K. Welker E. Bakos E. Muller M. Roninson I. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since acceleration of the rate of ATP hydrolysis is a well known property of drugs (43Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) this provided one explanation of the accelerated inhibition, however, it is not yet clear whether the presence of drugs specifically stabilizes the transition state or not. This question also relates to the broader question of the nature of interdomain communication between drug-binding sites and catalytic sites in Pgp. We showed earlier that incubation of Pgp with Vi and either MgADP or the analog Mg-8-azido-ADP led to strong inhibition of ATPase and tenacious trapping of MgADP·Vi (or Mg-8-azido-ADP) in catalytic sites (7Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), this occurring in the absence of any catalytic turnover. Evidence indicated that whether Pgp was initially incubated with MgATP or MgADP together with Vi, the resultant inhibited Pgp·MgADP·Vi showed similar properties, suggesting that the same complex was formed. Inhibition and trapping of the natural MgADP represents therefore an alternative approach to study the effect of drugs on the transition state, which has not so far been studied in detail. In this paper we have utilized pure, soluble, wild-type mouse Mdr3 Pgp to characterize the formation of the MgADP·Vi complex from MgADP and Vi and have additionally studied mutations that impair catalysis directly or that impair interdomain communication between drug sites and catalytic sites. Use of pure protein with the natural MgADP ligand facilitated accurate calculation of stoichiometries and avoids possible limitations inherent from use of photoactivated analogs. Wild-type and mutant mouse Mdr3 Pgp were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity as described previously (16Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Activation of Pgp with DTT and lipid was essentially as described previously (16Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Pgp was incubated with DTT (8 mm) and Escherichia coli lipid (Avanti, acetone/ether-precipitated) at a final ratio of 2/1 lipid/protein (w/w) for 20 min at room temperature followed by sonication for 30 s at 4 °C in a bath sonicator. Linked Enzyme Assay—This assay was used routinely unless otherwise stated in the text. This assay utilizing pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate to regenerate ATP from ADP and lactate dehydrogenase to couple ATP hydrolysis to NADH oxidation by pyruvate was performed at 37 °C as described previously (36Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). MgATP (10 mm) and verapamil (150 μm) were included. Charcoal Adsorption Assay—This assay was used for Ki(ADP) measurement and was performed essentially as described previously (46Tombline G. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14417-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Activated Pgp (0.5 μg in 25-μl volume) was added with mixing to 25 μl of 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, varied concentration of MgATP, and 2 mm excess MgCl2. Incubation was at 37 °C for appropriate times. Reaction was stopped by addition of 0.75-ml ice-cold acid-washed charcoal (catalog C-5510, Sigma), which was suspended at 10% (w/v) in 10 mm EDTA immediately before use. After ≥3-h incubation in ice, samples were centrifuged (14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and the supernatant containing [32P]Pi was counted by the Cerenkov method. Background samples lacking protein but with all of the other components were subtracted at each MgATP concentration. For determination of Ki(ADP), MgADP was included in the assays at 250, 500, and 1000 μm and MgATP concentration was varied from 25 μm to 3 mm. All of the reactions were linear with time, and <10% of the added MgATP was hydrolyzed. 1-ml centrifuge columns of Sephadex G-50 in disposable syringes were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 0.001% N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside at 4 °C. The pre-spin was at 1000 rpm in a clinical centrifuge for 2 min at 4 °C, after which Pgp (10–20 μg in 100 μl) was loaded onto the column and eluted by a second spin. Recovery of Pgp was 70–95% as judged by ATPase and/or protein assays. 10–20 μg of activated Pgp were preincubated with 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, in 100-μl total volume at 37 °C for varied time as described in the text. NaADP or NaATP was present at required concentration as described in the text. Incubations were started by the addition of Pgp and halted by transfer to ice, then passage through centrifuge columns to remove unbound ligand. Stock orthovanadate solutions (100 mm) were prepared from Na3VO4 (Fisher Scientific) at pH 10 and boiled for 2 min before each use. Other variations of the conditions are given in the text. Where MgADP and Vi were used, 100 μm [8-14C]ADP replaced ADP in the preincubation. Where MgATP and Vi were used, [α-32P]ATP was used. Control experiments showed that in absence of Pgp, elution of radioactive nucleotide was negligible. The amount of trapped radioactive ADP was proportional to the amount of Pgp applied in the range 5–20 μg (35–140 pmol). Stoichiometry of trapped nucleotide was calculated using a molecular mass of 142 kDa for Pgp (47Urbatsch I.L. Wilke-Mounts S. Gimi K. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Pgp was inactivated as above in the presence of Vi plus ADP or Vi plus ATP and then passed through centrifuge columns to remove unbound ligands. Eluates were then incubated at 37 °C for various times and then assayed for ATPase by linked enzyme assay. Accurate Pgp concentration was calculated by reference to a standard pure wild-type preparation, which had been subjected to amino acid analysis. A range of amounts of wild-type or mutant Pgp were run on SDS-gels alongside this reference standard, stained with Coomassie Blue, and scanned. For rapid analysis, the Bradford assay was used with bovine serum albumin as standard normalized to the reference Pgp standard. Verapamil and other drugs were added as solution in Me2SO, keeping the final solvent concentration <2% (v/v), and control “no drug” samples contained the same amount of Me2SO. SDS gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (16Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NaADP was purchased from Sigma (Catalog A-2754) or Roche Applied Science (236 675). [8-14C]ADP and [α-32P]ATP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. E. coli lipids (acetone/ether-precipitated) were from Avanti Polar lipids. Inhibition of Wild-type Mouse Mdr3 Pgp after Preincubation with Vanadate and MgADP or Vanadate and MgATP—We previously reported that ATP (or 8-azido-ATP) in conjunction with Mg2+ and Vi could produce long-lived inhibition of Pgp caused by tenacious trapping of the Vi-nucleoside diphosphate complex at a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol Pgp (7Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Similar long-lived inhibition was seen when ADP (or 8-azido-ADP) was substituted for ATP, although the stoichiometry of trapped nucleotide was not established in that case. For this earlier work we used primarily Chinese hamster ovary cell plasma membrane preparations enriched in Pgp. As discussed in Introduction, there is good support for the concept that the Pgp·MgADP·Vi complex mimics the natural transition state of ATP hydrolysis. Subsequently, we and others have shown that purified detergent-soluble mouse (Mdr3) Pgp forms this same complex when incubated with MgATP or Mg-8-azido-ATP (16Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we used purified mouse Mdr3 Pgp to investigate the formation of the Pgp·MgADP·Vi complex in the absence of ATP hydrolysis using MgADP as the loading nucleotide. Fig. 2A shows the inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity as a function of time in the presence of verapamil. Rate of onset of inhibition was slow with a half-time of 37 min, and approximately 90% inhibition was reached after 120 min. Control experiments showed that inhibition was only seen if the ligands ADP, Mg2+, and Vi were present. An omission of any one prevented inhibition. From the first order rate constant (3.4 × 10–4 s–1), an apparent second order rate constant of 3.1 m–1 s–1 in respect to MgADP was calculated. This is low in comparison to simple protein-ligand association reactions and suggests that a slow protein isomerization step has to occur after initial MgADP binding to allow the Pgp·MgADP·Vi complex to form. 3As noted later, Ki(MgADP) under similar conditions = 263 μm. Making the assumption that Ki ≈ Kd and that turnover rate of MgAT-Pase (10Van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Muller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar s–1) is limited by MgADP dissociation (see Introduction), MgADP association rate ≈ 4 × 104m–1 s–1. Qu et al. (15Qu Q. Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported Kd(MgADP) as 0.41 mm in hamster Pgp, so that the assumption seems valid. It may also be noted that kcat/Km(MgATP), often considered to approximate MgATP association rate of an ATPase, similarly calculates to ≈ 4 × 104m–1 s–1 for Pgp. In previous work using hamster Pgp in plasma membrane preparations, an equivalent half-time of 4.8 min was found for inhibition (36Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the difference could be the different lipid environment of pure Pgp activated with E. coli lipid versus Pgp in mammalian plasma membranes or insufficient lipids or the presence of detergent. We addressed these questions by varying the ratio of lipid to protein during activation of Pgp from 1/1 up to 50/1 by supplementing the E. coli lipids with phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol, which better mimics mammalian plasma membrane lipid composition (29Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 48Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1992; 89: 8472-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and by reconstituting Pgp into proteoliposomes by extensive dialysis to remove detergent. None of these treatments increased the rate of onset of inhibition. Thus, the rate is probably an intrinsic property of the species of Pgp under study. In contrast, the inhibition of Mdr3 Pgp was much more rapid with Vi and MgATP (Fig. 2B). The half-time was 27 s, which is almost two orders of magnitude faster than with MgADP. For comparison, the half-time for inhibition of hamster Pgp in plasma membranes by Vi plus MgATP was 10 s (36Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), which is similar to that seen here with Mdr3 Pgp. Hydrolysis of MgATP by Mdr3 Pgp reached 10 s–1 at saturating (10 mM) MgATP, and at the concentration of MgATP (100 μm) and other conditions used in the inhibition experiments, the measured rate of hydrolysis was 0.38 s–1. A comparison of the rate of hydrolysis with the first order rate constant for inhibition (0.026 s–1) demonstrates that not every turnover event leads to the formation of a trapped and inhibited intermediate, at least under the conditions used here. The calculated apparent second order rate constant for inhibition of 198 m–1 s–1 in respect to MgATP is consistent with this conclusion. Verapamil and a Range of Other Drug Substrates Accelerate the Rate of Inhibition by Vi plus MgADP—Fig. 3A shows the effect of verapamil on the inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity by Vi plus ADP. Verapamil has been shown earlier to be among the most effective stimulators of Mdr3 Pgp ATPase (49Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Little inhibition was seen in the absence of added drug or at verapamil concentrations <1 μm. Half-maximal inhibition was seen at 12 μm, and maximal inhibition (70% here because a 60-min incubation time was used, see Fig. 2A) was reached at around 150 μm verapamil, which is also the concentration at which maximal ATPase is elicited. Kinetic experiments utilizing varied concentrations of verapamil indicated that formation of the inhibited state was faster and more complete with increasing concentrations of verapamil (not shown). The data show that, in the absence of hydrolysis, binding of drug to the drug-binding site greatly enhances the formation of the transition state-like"

Biochemical regulation, i.e. regulation by ligands, cofactors, or by covalent modification are also likely involved. The first line of regulation could be provided by FAs (20Jabůrek M. Vařecha M.

It has been established that, like UCP1 and plant UCP (PUMP), UCP2 and UCP3 are also activated by FAs (20Jabůrek M. Vařecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Ježek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A.

Hence, the availability of free FAs is the first prerequisite for UCP function. Second, purine nucleotides (PN) were confirmed to inhibit the protonophoric action of reconstituted Escherichia coli-expressed UCP2 or UCP3. Garlid and co-workers (20Jabůrek M. Vařecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Ježek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Modulation, i.e. the lowering of PN inhibition by some yet unknown factors, may represent the mechanism that activates UCP2- or UCP3-mediated uncoupling in vivo. Such well known modulators for UCP1 are alkaline pH and Mg2+ (24Ježek P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Huang S-G. Lin Q-S. Klingenberg M. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M.

Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) were suggested to activate UCP2 (UCP3). Coenzyme Q10 was claimed to be required to restore the intact conformation of recombinant UCPs solubilized by sarcosinate from inclusion bodies (21Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Even native UCP2 (UCP3) was reported to be stimulated upon superoxide generation in various types of mitochondria (27Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St.-Pierre J. Jekabson M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). UCP2 (UCP3) in this presumably stimulated state was inhibited by ATP, ADP, GTP, and GDP in kidney or skeletal muscle mitochondria (27Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St.-Pierre J. Jekabson M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). These results suggested that native UCP2 (UCP3) could also be inhibited by PN. Recently, fluorescent nucleotide derivatives were demonstrated to interact with E. coli-expressed UCP2 (28Jekabson M.B. Echtay K.S. Brand M. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 565-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but direct measurements with native nucleotides were still lacking. Most initial studies of recombinant UCP2 and UCP3 expressed in yeast were performed while monitoring coupling in yeast mitochondria (6Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Weng X. Shyjan A.W. Gimeno C.J. Iris F.

Claims were made that UCP2 is specifically activated (state 4 respiration in yeast mitochondria is stimulated) by all-trans-retinoic acid and that it is insensitive to palmitic acid, 9-cis-retinoic acid, and other FAs tested including arachidonic, linoleic, docosahexaenoic acid, and prostaglandin E2 (36Rial E. Gonzáles-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenéz-Jimenéz J. Ricquier D Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is difficult to imagine a physicochemical basis for this strange FA specificity, which is incompatible with previous surveys of FAs interacting with UCP1 (37Ježek P. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 38Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, in this work we have studied reconstituted yeast-expressed UCP2 and UCP3 in their partially purified (but highly active) form, in order to screen in detail their natural ligands, FAs and PN. We have clearly demonstrated that all natural long chain FAs, saturated or unsaturated, activate UCP2- or UCP3-mediated H+ translocation. From kinetics of putative FA cycling we have found the highest apparent affinity to UCP2 (lowest Km) for two ω-6 polyunsaturated FAs, which are also the most potent agonists of PPARβ (17Chevillotte E. Rieusset J. Roques M. Desage M. Vidal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10853-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This finding suggests their possible dual role in activating both UCP expression and uncoupling activity. We have also shown that the apparent affinity to UCP2 (reciprocal Ki) is decreasing in order: ADP > ATP ∼ GTP > GDP >> AMP. Demonstrating the existence of high affinity [3H]GTP and [3H]ATP binding to recombinant UCP2 (Kd, ∼1.5 μm for yeast expression) and UCP3, expressed either in yeast or E. coli (Kd, ∼ 5 μm) and showing that numbers of very high affinity [3H]GTP binding sites (Kd, ∼0.2–0.4 μm) decrease in the mitochondria of lung > kidney > muscle > liver, we provide strong support for the view that PN must be the physiological inhibitors of UCPn-mediated uncoupling in vivo. Most of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. 3H-labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences. Hydroxylapatite, Bio-Gel HTP, and Bio-Beads SM2 were from Bio-Rad. Octylpentaoxyethylene (OctylPOE) was from Bachem Feinchemikalien, Bubendorf, Switzerland. Materials for reconstitution were from the same sources as described elsewhere (39Žáčková M. Krämer R.

All other chemicals were reagent grade. Yeast Expression of UCP2 and UCP3—W303 yeast containing pCGS110 (or pYES) vectors with inserted cDNAs coding for human UCP2 and human UCP3 under control of an inducible Gal promoter and ura- selection were donated by Ruth E.

Yeast cells were grown on ura- selective plates and were inoculated into 4–8 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks with a medium containing 203 mm (1.5 vol%) lactate, 0.05% glucose, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (Difco) 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.005% each of l-aminoacids (tryptophan, methionine, arginine, leucine, histidine), and adenine sulfate. After 24 h, 0.2% galactose was added, and cells were shaken for another 24–28 h until the optical density of 1 was achieved. Mitochondria were prepared immediately after terminating fermentation using Zymolyase 100T (ICN) to cleave the cell wall (40Murdza-Inglis D.L. Patel H.V. Freeman K.B. Ježek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D.

The cells were grown at 30 °C to an OD600 of 0.6 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 6 h. Cells from a 700-ml culture were lysed in a French Press in 20 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol); the lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of the lysis buffer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min. 1-ml aliquots of the supernatant were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pelleted inclusion bodies were stored frozen at -70 °C. When used, they were suspended (3 mg of protein) and washed two times in 10 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0. The washed pellet was solubilized in 0.75 ml of 5 mm TEA-TES, 30 mm TEA2SO4, 0.1 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.2, containing 1.67% sodium lauroylsarcosinate (SLS) and 1% octylpentaoxyethylene. The resulted micellar solution was concentrated (thus partly depleted of SLS) and subsequently diluted (usually 1:1) in 20 mm Na-MES, pH 6.

It included OctylPOE extraction of yeast mitochondria (30 mg of protein) under lipid protection, the isolation step on HTP, detergent removal on Bio-Beads SM2 overnight, and washing of external probe Sephadex G25-300. The total amount of added lipid was 40.7 mg (egg yolk lecithin, type XI-E, Sigma, 4% cardiolipin and 1.6% l-α-phosphatidic acid). Additional lipids in 1 ml of final suspension, up to 20 mg, could have originated from the mitochondria. The internal medium for liposomes contained 84.4 mm TEA2SO4, 28.8 mm TEA-TES with 9.2 mm TEA, pH 7.2, 0.6 mm TEA-EGTA. The protein content of liposomes was also estimated by the Amido Black method (42Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Usually, a lipid-to-protein ratio of about 1000 or higher was obtained. The identity of UCP2 (UCP3) in HTP flow-through was verified using peptide mapping assisted by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy after in-gel trypsin cleavage of the PAGE-separated acetone-precipitated samples.

This study investigated the roles of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), PDK1, FRAP/mammalian target of rapamycin, and ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) signaling mechanism by which TSH and the stimulating type TSHR antibodies regulate thyrocyte proliferation and the follicle activities in vitro and in vivo. The TSHR immunoprecipitates exhibited PI3K activity, which was higher in the cells treated with either TSH or 8-bromo-cAMP. TSH and cAMP increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of TSHR and the association between TSHR and the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K. TSH induced a redistribution of PDK1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in the cells in a PI3K- and protein kinase A-dependent manner. TSH induced the PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of S6K1 but did not induce Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation. The TSH-induced S6K1 phosphorylation was inhibited by a dominant negative p85α regulatory subunit or by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation of S6K1 in the cells treated with either TSH or 8-bromo-cAMP. The stimulating type TSHR antibodies from patients with Graves disease also induced S6K1 activation, whereas the blocking type TSHR antibodies from patients with primary myxedema inhibited TSH- but not the insulin-induced phosphorylation of S6K1. In addition, rapamycin treatment in vivo inhibited the TSH-stimulated thyroid follicle hyperplasia and follicle activity. These findings suggest an interaction between TSHR and PI3K, which is stimulated by TSH and cAMP and might involve the downstream S6K1 but not Akt/protein kinase B. This pathway may play a role in the TSH/stimulating type TSH receptor antibody-mediated thyrocyte proliferation in vitro and in the response to TSH in vivo.

All of these hormones are not only important for hormone production but also for maintaining the glandular weight in their target gland. These hormones bind to ligand-specific cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptors and activate adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP. These glycoprotein hormone receptors also activate the PI3K-dependent signaling pathways (1Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how these glycoprotein hormone receptors are coupled to the PI3K signaling pathways.The TSH receptor (TSHR) has many important functions that regulate growth, proliferation, differentiation, and the survival of thyrocytes and increasing hormone production in the thyroid gland (2Kohn L.D.

The signaling components downstream of TSHR (Gβγ, cAMP, and PKA) may overlap with the downstream components of the PI3K signaling pathway. The Gβγ subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins specifically activates PI3Kγ in the myeloid-derived cells (4Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T.

Both TSH and cAMP induce Ser-473 phosphorylation in Akt/PKB, a major phosphorylation site for the regulation of Akt/PKB by growth factors.

Ng J.C. Reinhard C. Neufeld T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2712-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar).This study examines the interactions between the TSHR and the regulatory p85α subunit of PI3K in the presence and absence of TSH and cAMP. TSH and 8-Br-cAMP stimulate the interaction between TSHR and PI3K, which leads to a PI3K- and PKA-dependent translocation of PDK1. PDK1 phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and S6K1 appears to be differentially stimulated by TSH and insulin. TSH stimulates S6K1 through the PI3K-, PDK1-, and PKA-dependent but Akt/PKB-independent pathways. The FRAP/mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibits the TSH-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 and inhibits cell cycle progression in the FRTL-5 thyroid cells. Rapamycin also modulates the thyroid follicle activity, which is induced by elevated endogenous TSH levels in vivo. This study suggests that S6K1 plays an important role in TSHR-activated PI3K signaling, which modulates the thyrocyte proliferation and thyroid follicle activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The media and cell culture reagents and materials were purchased from Invitrogen, Sigma, Fisher, Corning Glass, and Hyclone Laboratories, Inc.

Mouse anti-human TSHR (MCA1571) was from Serotec (Kidlington, Oxford, UK), and anti-FLAG antibody (200472) was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All other materials, including 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP and, N-α-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), were purchased from Sigma.Preparation of IgG—The control sera were obtained from 5 normal individuals who had no history or clinical or chemical evidence (abnormal thyroid hormone and TSH levels) of thyroid disease. The diagnosis of the 10 patients with Graves disease was based on conventional clinical and laboratory criteria, including elevated serum thyroid hormone levels, undetectable TSH by a sensitive radioimmunoassay, testing positive for TBII (TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins), and a diffuse goiter with increased 99mTc 99mTcO4−99mTcO4−99mTcO4−99mTcO4− uptake at scintiscan. IgGs were extracted by affinity chromatography using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B columns; IgG was lyophilized and stored at–20 °C until assay. The IgGs were extracted by affinity chromatography from normal pooled sera (NP), as well as the sera from the patients with primary myxedema (PM) who tested positive to the blocking TSHR antibody test.Cell Culture and Gene Transfection—A fresh subclone (F1) of FRTL-5 was used in the rat thyroid cells (Interthyr Research Foundation, Baltimore, MD). After 6 days in medium with no TSH, the addition of 1 milliunit/ml crude bovine TSH (Sigma) stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA by at least 10-fold. The doubling time of the cells with TSH was 36 ± 6 h without TSH, and they did not proliferate. The cells used were diploid and between their 5th and 20th passage. The cells were grown in 6H medium consisting of Coon's modified F-12 supplemented with 5% calf serum, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, and a mixture of six hormones as follows: bovine TSH (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), cortisol (0.4 ng/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), glycyl-l-histidyl- l-lysine acetate (10 ng/ml), and somatostatin (10 ng/ml). Fresh medium was added to all cells every 2 or 3 days, and the cells were passaged every 7–10 days. In individual experiments, the cells were shifted to 3H (which is devoid of insulin, TSH, and somatostatin), 4H (which is devoid of insulin and TSH), or 5H medium (which is devoid of TSH) with or without 5% calf serum before TSH, forskolin (Sigma), or the other agents were added. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Expression plasmids carrying hTSHR, p85α, and PDK1 cDNAs were introduced into the FRTL-5 and CHO cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).PI3K Assay—The cell extracts obtained from the FRTL-5 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-TSHR monoclonal antibodies (clone 4C1, Serotec, Oxford, UK) and the control IgG antibodies. The samples were washed twice with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in phosphate-buffered saline, twice with washing buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm LiCl, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and twice with ST with 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). The samples were resuspended in a PI kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. A phosphoinositide/EGTA solution consisting of 1 mg/ml phosphoinositide and 2.5 mm EGTA was then added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. A solution containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm MnCl2, 10 μm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 m HCl, and the phospholipids were extracted using CHCl3. The dried samples were separated by TLC. The phosphorylated lipids were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager (BAS1500, Fuji).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The following immunoprecipitation procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells grown on the 100-mm dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice prior to lysis. The RIPA buffer containing the protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added for cell lysis. The cell lysate was collected, triturated, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. To preclear the cell lysate, the supernatant was mixed with 20 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubated for 30 min with rocking, and were centrifuged for 15 min at 1000 × g. Precleared samples were incubated with the primary antibodies for 2 h with rocking, and protein A/G beads were then added, incubated overnight, and centrifuged at 1000 × g. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times with RIPA buffer.For Western blot analysis, the cells were lysed at 4 °C in a mixture of 10 mm KPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), and 10 μg each of aprotinin and leupeptin/ml. The total protein lysates were denatured by boiling in a Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on 7.5–15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) milk and 0.1% Tween and then incubated for 2 h with the polyclonal antibodies against p70 S6K (supplied by Dr. J. Blenis, Harvard University, Boston).[3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—Confluent FRTL-5 thyroid cells in 100-mm dishes were detached by trypsinization, resuspended in 6H growth medium, seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates, and incubated for 2–3 days until 80% confluent. The medium was changed to 5H medium and incubated for an additional 7 days. TSH and/or wortmannin, LY294002, H89, and rapamycin were added to the quiescent cells, which were then incubated for 24 h, followed by the addition of 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to pulse the cells for an additional 12 h. The experimental samples were prepared in triplicate. The cells were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, precipitated twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (30 min each time on ice), briefly washed once with ice-cold ethanol, lysed with 0.2 n NaOH in 0.5% SDS, and incubated at 37 °C for at least 30 min. The level of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Beckman Instruments). The results were measured as the number of counts/min in each well. Each experimental data point represents triplicate wells from at least four different experiments.Flow Cytometry—The samples were prepared for flow cytometry essentially as described previously (4Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and then fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol. The samples were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and stained with propidium iodide 60 μg/ml (Sigma) containing 100 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a BD Biosciences fluorescence-activated cell analyzer and Cell Quest version 1.2 software (BD Biosciences). At least 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample. The cell cycle distribution was quantified using the ModFit LT version 1.01 software (Verity Software House Inc., Topsham, ME).Confocal Microscopy—The FRTL-5 thyroid cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with pEGFP-PDK-1 and pCDNA3-PDK-1-myc using the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen). Quiescent cells stimulated with TSH were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 40 min. Fixed cells were mounted on glass slides with phosphate-buffered saline and observed using laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2).Protein Kinase Assays—The FRTL-5 thyroid cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged p70 S6K1 and immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody coupled to protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The samples were washed twice with Buffer A (containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and then twice with Buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl. Finally the immunocomplexes were washed, in succession, with Buffer C (containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol), Buffer D (containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2,10mm MnCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EGTA), and Buffer E (containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The S6 phosphotransferase activities were assayed in a reaction mixture consisting of 1× Buffer C, 1 μg of S6 peptide, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity: 3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 20 min. The samples were subjected to liquid scintillation counting (Hewlett-Packard).Preparation of Thyroid Gland and Immunohistochemistry—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (120–130 g) were fed with water containing 0.025% MMI for 2 weeks. Rapamycin (Calbiochem) was delivered once daily by an intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg dissolved in 2% carboxymethylcellulose for 1 week before histologic examination. Tissue samples of the rat thyroid gland were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, processed routinely, and embedded in paraffin. Three-micrometer-thick sections were cut from the paraffin blocks and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The number of follicles in 2 medium power fields (×200) was counted. Further sections were used for immunohistochemistry. All immunostaining steps were carried out at room temperature. After deparaffinization and antigen retrieval by autoclaving in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at full power for 10 min, the tissue sections were treated with blocking rabbit serum for 15 min. The primary antibody, polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Cell Signaling Technology), was diluted (1:200) with a background-reducing diluent (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and incubated for 60 min. The sections were then incubated with a rabbit EnVision-HRP detection system reagent (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min. The sections were then sequentially incubated with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Dako) chromogen for 5 min, counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin, and mounted. Careful rinses with several changes of Tris-buffered saline, 0.3% Tween buffer were performed between each step. A negative control that excluded the primary antibody was used. Cells with cytoplasmic granular staining were considered positive.Other Assays—The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using recrystallized bovine serum albumin as a standard. The sera were stored–70 °C until IgG preparation. The IgGs were extracted by affinity chromatography using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B columns (Amersham Biosciences) followed by dialysis. The purity of the IgG preparation was confirmed by the documentation of undetectable TSH levels with immunoradiometric assay.Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times with different cells. The values are the mean ± S.E. of these experiments. Statistical significance was determined by a two-way analysis of variance.RESULTSAssociation of PI3K Activities with TSHR—TSHR was immunoprecipitated from extracts from FRTL-5 thyroid cells exposed to TSH or 8-Br-cAMP using monoclonal anti-TSHR antibodies, and the immunoprecipitate was tested for PI3K activity. The phosphatidylinositol phosphotransferase activity was detected in the immunoprecipitate, which was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (0.5 μm) (Fig. 1A). The TSHR-associated PI3K activity was barely detectable in the untreated FRTL-5 thyroid cells (Fig. 1, A, lane 1, and B, lane 1). Both TSH and 8-Br-cAMP stimulated the TSHR-associated PI3K activity (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). H89 did not inhibit the PI3K kinase activity in vitro (data not shown), but the H89 treated cells had a lower level of TSHR-associated PI3K activity in the TSH- or 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 5).The specificity of the interaction between TSHR and PI3K was determined in the following experiment. The extracts were prepared from the wild-type CHO cells or the CHO cells expressing human TSHR (CHO-TSHR) (30Kim W.B. Chung H.K. Lee H.K. Kohn L.D. Tahara K. Cho B.Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1953-1959PubMed Google Scholar, 31Park E.S. Kim H. Suh J.M. Park J. You S.H. Chung H.K. Lee K.W. Kwon O.-Y. Cho B.Y. Kim Y.K. Ro H.K. Chung J. Shong M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-TSHR (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–4) or the control IgG (Fig. 1C, lane 5). A low level of PI3K activity was detected in the anti-TSHR immunoprecipitates from the CHO-TSHR cells (Fig. 1C, lane 2). This activity increased in the cells treated with TSH (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 versus 3) and was inhibited by 100 nm wortmannin (Fig. 1C, lane 4). No PI3K activity was detected in the experiments using the wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 1C, lane 1) or the control IgG (Fig. 1C, lane 5). These findings suggest that TSHR interacts specifically with PI3K and that TSH and cAMP stimulate this interaction.TSHR Interacts with the p85α Regulatory Subunit of PI3K— Western blot analysis was carried out to identify the specific regulatory and catalytic subunits of class I PI3K in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. The p85α regulatory subunit of class I PI3K (p85α) was expressed strongly in the cells treated with or without TSH, 8-Br-cAMP, and insulin (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the p110γ catalytic subunit of class I PI3K, which is activated by the Gβγ subunits of the heterodimeric G-proteins, was not expressed at a detectable level in these cells (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2A, the expression of p85α regulatory subunit and p110γ catalytic subunit of class I PI3K isoforms in FRTL5. FRTL-5 cells were grown to 70% confluence in complete 6H medium with 5% serum and then maintained for 6 days in 4H0% medium, which does not contain TSH, insulin, and serum. Total cell lysates were prepared from cells treated for 12 h with TSH (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), or 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K antibody and an anti-p110γ catalytic subunit of PI3K antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2128292711,"In bovine coronary artery segments, peroxynitrite inhibits prostacyclin (PGI2) synthase by tyrosine nitration. Using this pharmacological model, we show that a 1 h exposure of bovine coronary artery segments to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) inhibits the relaxation phase following angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation and causes a vasospasm that can be suppressed by a thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor blocker. In parallel, PGI2 synthesis decreases in favor of prostaglandin E2 formation. Immunoprecipitation and costaining with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody identified PGI2 synthase as the main nitrated protein in the endothelium. All effects of LPS could be prevented in the presence of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor Nomega-mono-methyl-L-arginine and polyethylene-glycolated Cu/Zn- superoxide dismutase. Thus, the early phase of endothelial cell activation in bovine coronary arteries by inflammatory agents proceeds by a protein synthesis-independent priming process for a source of superoxide that we tentatively attribute to xanthine oxidase. Upon receptor activation, Ang II stimulates NO and superoxide production, resulting in a peroxynitrite-mediated nitration and inhibition of PGI2 synthase. The remaining 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin 9,11-endoperoxide (PGH2) first activates the TxA2/PGH2 receptor and then is converted to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by smooth muscle cells. PGE2 together with a lack of NO and PGI2 is known to promote the adhesion of white blood cells and their immigration to the inflammatory locus."
https://openalex.org/W2125515549,"Extraocular muscle (EOM) is spared in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we tested putative EOM sparing mechanisms predicted from existing dystrophinopathy models. Data show that mdx mouse EOM contains dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC)-competent and DGC-deficient myofibers distributed in a fiber type-specific pattern. Up-regulation of a dystrophin homologue, utrophin, mediates selective DGC retention. Counter to the DGC mechanical hypothesis, an intact DGC is not a precondition for EOM sarcolemmal integrity, and active adaptation at the level of calcium homeostasis is not mechanistic in protection. A partial, fiber type-specific retention of antiischemic nitric oxide to vascular smooth muscle signaling is not a factor in EOM sparing, because mice deficient in dystrophin and alpha-syntrophin, which localizes neuronal nitric oxide synthase to the sarcolemma, have normal EOMs. Moreover, an alternative transmembrane protein, alpha7beta1 integrin, does not appear to substitute for the DGC in EOM. Finally, genomewide expression profiling showed that EOM does not actively adapt to dystrophinopathy but identified candidate genes for the constitutive protection of mdx EOM. Taken together, data emphasize the conditional nature of dystrophinopathy and the potential importance of nonmechanical DGC roles and support the hypothesis that broad, constitutive structural cell signaling, and/or biochemical differences between EOM and other skeletal muscles are determinants of differential disease responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2098615221,"The pineal hormone melatonin has been reported to protect tissue from oxidative damage. This study was designed to determine whether melatonin could prevent cell events leading to tissue injury and renal dysfunction after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Using an in vivo rat model of I/R, we show a significant increase in kidney malondialdehyde concentrations, reflecting lipid peroxidation, and cell apoptosis measured by TUNEL staining. This apoptotic cell death was associated with an increase in the activity of the proapoptotic factor caspase-3, determined by fluorometric protease activity assay. Histomorphological analysis of ischemic kidneys revealed that the most extensive tubular necrosis occurred at 24 and 48 h after reperfusion, which correlated with peak elevations in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Rat pretreatment with melatonin prevented lipid peroxidation, cell apoptosis, and necrosis and blocked caspase-3 activity. The prevention of tissue injury was associated with the improvement of renal function as shown by the decrease in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations. The demonstration that melatonin prevents postreperfusion apoptotic and necrotic cell death and improves renal function suggests that melatonin may represent a novel therapeutic approach for prevention of I/R injury."

In this work, we analyzed 12 DD-associated mutations from all of the regions of SERCA2b to study the underlying pathologic mechanism of DD and to elucidate the role of dimerization in SERCA2b activity.

OMIM 124200), also known as keratosis follicularis, is an autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by loss of adhesion between epidermal cells (acantholysis) and abnormal keratinization (1Burge S.M. Wilkinson J.D. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1992; 27: 40-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). DD is also associated with an increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders including bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and mental retardation (1Burge S.M. Wilkinson J.D. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1992; 27: 40-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in the ATP2A2 gene encoding the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump type 2b isoform (SERCA2b) have been identified as a cause of DD (2Sakuntabhai A. Ruiz-Perez V. Carter S. Jacobsen N. Burge S. Monk S. Smith M. Munro C.S. O'Donovan M. Craddock N. Kucherlapati R. Rees J.L. Owen M. Lathrop G.M. Monaco A.P. Strachan T. Hovnanian A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). SERCA2b is a housekeeping protein, which is expressed ubiquitously and is responsible for Ca2+ uptake into the ER, including the agonist-mobilizable Ca2+ pool (3Baba-Aissa F. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Dode L. Casteels R. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1998; 33: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Shull G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By determining ER Ca2+ load, the SERCA2 pumps modulate several parameters of the Ca2+ signal. In resting cells, the SERCA2 pump provides the bulk of the dynamic Ca2+-buffering capacity to prevent large fluctuation in [Ca2+]i (5Kiselyov K. Shin D.A. Muallem S. Cell. Signalling. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In stimulated cells, SERCA2 controls the activity of the store-operated Ca2+ influx channel by preventing accumulation of Ca2+ at the mouth of the channels and their inhibition by [Ca2+]i (6Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SERCA2b reloads the ER with Ca2+ at the end of cell stimulation (5Kiselyov K. Shin D.A. Muallem S. Cell. Signalling. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and between Ca2+ spikes to determine the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (7Zhao X.S. Shin D.M. Liu L.H. Shull G.E. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and to control the diverse cellular functions regulated by [Ca2+]i and Ca2+ oscillations (8Berridge M.J. Novartis Found. Symp. 2001; 239 (150–159): 52-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Alteration in SERCA2 pump function by overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary cells (10Brini M. Bano D. Manni S. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) lead to adaptation of the Ca2+ signaling machinery and Ca2+-regulated cell functions that translates to nearly normal physiological response in the majority of organs and tissues. This correlates with the lack of consistent defect in DD patient platelet and heart function in which SERCA2 is the major pump in the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum (11Tavadia S. Tait R.C. McDonagh T.A. Munro C.S. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 2001; 26: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). By contrast, all of the DD-associated mutations cause moderate to severe skin disorders and several mutations cause neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting particular susceptibility of these tissues to reduction in SERCA2 activity. These intriguing observations raise several questions, among them are noted as follows. (a) How mutations associated with DD affect SERCA2 pump activity? (b) Mutations in ATP2A2 that cause DD are found all along the gene, and no phenotype-genotype could be deduced. Can phenotype-genotype be found based on SERCA2 pump activity? (c) Do selective mutants associated with DD affect native SERCA pump activity to provide a mechanism for the variable phenotypes? Partial answers to these questions can further our understanding of SERCA2 pump function and how mutations in the pump lead to DD. In this work, we analyzed 12 SERCA2b mutants that cause DD in an attempt to address these questions. Mutants were selected from all of the regions of the protein. The clinical description of the disease for the vast majority of the mutants is incomplete and, for the most part, relies on a single patient of a single affected family. This made it difficult to attempt correlation between genotype and phenotype. Nevertheless, relying on published information, we attempted to select one group of mutants that was reported to affect only keratinocyte function and one group that was reported to also cause neurological deficiencies. An analysis of protein expression revealed a diverse effect of the DD-causing mutations on protein expression. Measurements of Ca2+ uptake and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed interactions among SERCA2b monomers and highlighted the role of the dimers in pump regulation. Most notably, several mutants reduced the activity of the native and of co-expressed WT pumps. These findings provide the first evidence to indicate physical and functional interaction between SERCA2b monomers. Although no definitive correlations between the mutations and DD phenotype became apparent, probably because of poor clinical information available for this disease, our findings do provide a molecular mechanism to account for the disease pathogenesis and how diverse phenotypes can be manifested.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of HA-tagged and Myc-tagged Human SERCA2b Constructs—HA- and Myc-tagged human SERCA2b constructs were generated by PCR amplification of human SERCA2b using the 5′-oligonucleotide primer 5′-AC GTC AAT GGGTCGACT ATT TAC G-3′ containing the underlined SalI and 3′-oligonucleotide primer 5′-AGA AGG CAC AGT CGA GGC TG-3′ located after a NotI site. The amplified DNA was gel-purified, digested with appropriate enzymes, and ligated into the pCMV-HA or Myc vectors (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto) that had been digested with SalI and NotI and gel-purified. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfected HEK 293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with buffer containing 135 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences). Precleared lysates (up to 500 μg of protein) were mixed with 3 μl of anti-HA antibodies or anti-Myc antibodies and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer. Immune complexes were collected by overnight incubation with 50 μl of protein G-agarose at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed four times with lysis buffer prior to electrophoresis. The immunoprecipitates or lysates were suspended in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the proteins were detected with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Measurement of Ca2+Uptake and Release in Permeabilized Cells— HEK 293 cells were released, washed, and re-suspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm glucose. The cells then were counted, and 3 × 106 cells were washed twice with a high potassium solution (130 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH). The cells were suspended in 50 μl of Chelex-treated high potassium solution and added to 0.45 ml of SLO-permeabilization medium. The SLO-permeabilization medium was composed of resin-treated 130 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES solution supplemented with 3 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2,10mm phosphocreatinine, 30 units/ml creatinine phosphokinase, 5 μm antimycin A, 5 μm oligomycin, 2 μm Fluo-3, and 4.5 mg/ml SLO. The recording of Fluo-3 fluorescence was initiated upon the addition of cells to a warm (37 °C) permeabilization medium and was recorded at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 530 nm, respectively. The cells were allowed to take up and reduce [Ca2+]of the permeabilization medium to 50–100 nm before the addition of IP3 or BHQ. The Fluo-3 fluorescence signals were calibrated by the addition of 1 mm CaCl2 to the medium (Fmax), which was followed by the addition of 5 mm EGTA and 30 mm NaOH to obtain Fmin. [Ca2+] was calculated using a Kd of 370 nm at 37 °C. Protein Levels of SERCA2b Mutants—Because haploinsufficiency cannot explain the variable phenotype of DD patients (12Sakuntabhai A. Burge S. Monk S. Hovnanian A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1611-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), our initial hypothesis was that the severity of the disease may correlate with protein expression levels. This hypothesis was refuted by the finding that most DD mutants examined affected SERCA2b expression and/or stability (Fig. 1A). With the exception of two mutants (C344Y and V843F), all of the mutants markedly reduced protein expression. The possibility of variable SERCA2b expression because of variable transfection efficiency was excluded by the analysis of co-transfected green fluorescent protein (Fig. 1B). Effect of the N-terminal mutants is consistent with previous work with SERCA1. Deletion of the N-terminal domain of SERCA1 reduced protein expression (13Skerjanc I.S. Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Accordingly, mutation of SERCA2b Asn-39 to Asp or Thr reduced protein expression, suggesting that the integrity of the N terminus is important for pump expression. Interestingly, all of the truncation mutants including E917X markedly reduced protein expression, suggesting increased degradation of these pump products (see below). No concrete conclusion emerged from the other mutations. Thus, a mutation in the P domain (phosphorylation domain), C334Y, had minimal effect on protein expression, whereas another mutation, F487S, markedly reduced protein expression. Similarly, G769R in TM5 reduced protein expression, whereas V843F in the TM8-TM9 loop had minimal effect. Hence, the overall significance of the protein expression findings to DD is that the mutations can affect pump activity by multiple mechanisms. Some mutants affect pump activity because of reduced protein expression, whereas others such as C344Y and V843F must act by a different mechanism. The results in Fig. 1 together with the phenotypic information listed in Table I indicate a lack of correlation between protein expression and disease phenotype. Proteasome-mediated Degradation of Mutant SERCA2b Protein—Previous work showed that lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, enhanced degradation of WT SERCA1 and prevented the small degradation of ΔAla3-SERCA1 but had no effect on several other deletion or mutations between Glu2-Ala14-SERCA1 (14Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effects of lactacystin on SERCA2b protein levels. Several of the mutants that showed low protein expression exhibited enhanced protein degradation. However, as with protein expression, protein degradation followed a complex pattern with respect to the effect of individual mutants (Fig. 2). First, we confirmed the finding made with SERCA1 by observing slight increased degradation of WT SERCA2b by lactacystin. Furthermore, lactacystin similarly increased degradation of the C344Y and V843F mutants that had minimal effect on protein expression. The group of mutants most susceptible to degradation by the proteasome is the nonsense and the premature translation termination codon-inducing frameshift mutations (1625delAG). Lactacystin increased the expression of these mutants between 5- and 20-fold (Fig. 2C). This finding indicates that the ER quality control-mediated degradation machinery recognizes the truncated SERCA2b mutants as misfolded proteins. Interestingly, the inhibition of the proteasome did not have a similar effect on all of the mutants. Furthermore, the mutants in the same region had an opposite effect. Thus, lactacystin had no effect on N39D but appeared to enhance expression of N39T, and it had no effect on expression of ΔL41 but enhanced the expression of ΔP42. Selective effect of lactacystin on the degradation of several SERCA2b (this work) and SERCA1 mutants (14Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggest that SERCA pumps are degraded by the proteasome and other proteases. However, as with protein expression, no obvious correlation between phenotype-genotype was apparent. Ca2+Uptake Activity—The most interesting results were obtained by measuring SERCA pump activity. Selective traces, the experimental protocols, and the parameters tested are illustrated in Fig. 3. A summary of pump activity of native cells, cells transfected with the WT pump, and all of the mutants is given in Fig. 4. Ca2+ uptake into the ER was initiated by adding cells to the SLO-containing permeabilization medium. The uptake attained constant rate after completion of permeabilization, and Ca2+ uptake rate was determined from the nearly linear portion of the slopes as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 3. At the end of the uptake period, the cells were used to measure either IP3-mediated Ca2+ release (Fig. 3, A–C) or the rate of ER-passive Ca2+ leak by inhibition of SERCA2b with BHQ (Fig. 3, D–F). Residual Ca2+ in the stores was then discharged by the addition of 2 μm Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Expression of WT SERCA2b increased Ca2+ uptake rate by ∼3-fold. Evaluation of Ca2+ uptake by all of the mutants revealed that only one mutant, V843F, which was expressed at levels comparable to the WT pump, retained activity that was approximately 50% that of the WT pump (Fig. 4). Six mutants had no activity and did not affect Ca2+ pumping by the native SERCA pumps. The most interesting mutants were the 5 of the 12 tested (42%) (N39D, N39T, C344Y, F487S, and S920Y) that reduced the activity of the native pumps.Fig. 4Ca2+transport by WT and mutant SERCA2b pumps. The protocol of Fig. 3 was used to evaluate pump activity of all of the mutants. The number of experiments is given in the columns. The results are plotted as the mean ± S.E. * and #, statistically significant difference of p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively, compared with control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reduction of native Ca2+-pumping activity raised the question of relevance to DD where the WT and most mutants mRNA are likely to be present at comparable levels. Therefore, to simulate the DD situation, a 1:1 mixture of WT and the mutant clones that reduced the activity of the native pump were transfected and the resulting pumping activity measured. The results are summarized in Fig. 5. The expression of WT SERCA2b again increased Ca2+-pumping rate by ∼3-fold, and this rate was taken as 100% control. Co-expression of WT and the G769R mutant that had no effect on the native pump (Fig. 4) was used as an expression control, and as expected, it had no effect on Ca2+ pumping by the expressed WT SERCA2b. Fig. 5 shows that all of the mutants that reduced the activity of the native pump similarly inhibited the activity of the expressed WT SERCA2b, indicating that the inhibition is inheritant to these mutants. The poor clinical definition of DD phenotype makes it difficult to draw a precise correlation between the mutants that inhibited WT SERCA2 activity and the disease phenotype. However, the tendency is that mutants that cause a relatively severe phenotype such as F487S and S920Y noticeably inhibited endogenous and expressed WT SERCA2b activity. The finding of reduced WT pump activity by the mutants provides the first molecular mechanism that can account for the variable DD phenotypes. Passive Ca2+Leak and IP3Sensitivity—The next question we addressed is how the DD-associated mutations reduce WT SERCA2b-pumping activity. One possibility is that the mutant proteins increase passive Ca2+ leak across the ER membrane, resulting in an apparent reduced pumping rate. Increased passive leak was proposed to account for the inhibition of native Ca2+ pump activity by SERCA1 splice variants when expressed in heterogeneous systems (15Chami M. Gozuacik D. Lagorce D. Brini M. Falson P. Peaucellier G. Pinton P. Lecoeur H. Gougeon M.L. le Maire M. Rizzuto R. Brechot C. Paterlini-Brechot P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this work, we used a SERCA pump inhibition protocol to estimate the Ca2+ leak rate at the end of the uptake period. Measurement of Ca2+ leak with all of the DD mutants used in this work (Fig. 3, D–F, BHQ addition) showed that this mechanism cannot account for the reduced SERCA pump activity, because none of the mutants increased the passive Ca2+ leak. Because SERCA pumps determine Ca2+ content in the ER and the ER Ca2+ load affect sensitivity to IP3 (5Kiselyov K. Shin D.A. Muallem S. Cell. Signalling. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), another possibility is that the mutant pumps altered IP3-mediated Ca2+ release. The measurement of the extent of Ca2+ release and its dependence on IP3 concentration showed that none of the mutants had an apparent effect on IP3-mediated Ca2+ release (Fig. 3, A–C), confirming the results obtained in the SERCA2b+/– mice (7Zhao X.S. Shin D.M. Liu L.H. Shull G.E. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interaction between SERCA2b Monomers—The simplest mechanism by which the mutants can inhibit the activity of the WT SERCA2b is reducing the expression of the pump; however, this was found not to be the case (Fig. 6). The level of WT pump protein was not affected by co-expression of any of the mutant proteins. Equally, co-expression of the WT and mutant pumps had no effect on expression of the mutant pumps. A second alternative is that SERCA2b exists as a dimer and the mutants, including those that are expressed at low levels, interact with the WT pump to reduce its activity. A clue to this possible mechanism is provided by earlier work suggesting that SERCA pump monomers sense and are influenced by their neighbors. Thus, the titration of Ca2+-ATPase and Ca2+ uptake activities with fluorescein isothiocyanate (16Pick U. Karlish S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), radiation inactivation analysis of pump activity and integrity (17Chamberlain B.K. Berenski C.J. Jung C.Y. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11997-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hymel L. Maurer A. Berenski C. Jung C.Y. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), freeze-fracture and deep-etching of sarcoplasmic reticular membranes (19Napolitano C.A. Cooke P. Segalman K. Herbette L. Biophys. J. 1983; 42: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Castellani L. Hardwicke P.M. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and analysis with photoaffinity spin-labeled derivative of ATP (21Palm T. Coan C. Trommer W.E. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) all suggested that the functional unit of the Ca2+-ATPase is a dimer. Furthermore, an analysis of a purified 48-kDa SERCA1 fusion protein by small angle x-ray scattering suggested a requirement of the hinge domain (amino acids 670–728) region for self-association of the large hydrophilic domain into a dimer (22Carvalho-Alves P.C. Hering V.R. Oliveira J.M. Salinas R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the mutant pumps affect the WT pump by way of protein interaction. To test interaction between pump monomers, we attempted to co-immunoprecipitate (co-IP) co-expressed HA- and Myc-tagged SERCA2b. Initial attempts to do so failed. Fig. 7, A and B, shows that when the cells were lysed with a medium containing 1.0% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl, it was possible to immunoprecipitate each of the tagged monomers but not to co-IP them. We then considered the possibility that interaction among the SERCA2b monomers is subtle and could not withstand the harsh solubilization conditions. This was confirmed by observing co-IP of the monomers when the cells were lysed in a medium containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 135 mm NaCl (Fig. 7, C and D). Furthermore, co-IP of the SERCA2b monomers could be observed when the cells were lysed with 1% of the milder detergent Nonidet P-40 (data not shown). The findings in Fig. 7 provide the first direct evidence that SERCA2b monomers can interact with each other in vivo. The functional consequence of dimerization of the SERCA2b monomers can be deduced from examining the interaction of the mutants with the WT pump. The results of such analysis are displayed in Fig. 7, E and F. Several findings are noticeable. First, most but not all SERCA2b mutants interact with the WT pump, providing a plausible explanation for inhibition of the native and expressed WT SERCA2b activity by the mutants. Second, all of the extreme N-terminal mutants showed reduced co-IP compared with their expression levels, implicating this region of the protein in dimerization. The same probably holds for the G769R mutation that showed good expression when expressed alone (Fig. 1 and 2) or together with the WT pump (Fig. 6) but showed very poor co-IP (Fig. 7). Because this mutation inserts an additional positive charge into TM5, it may result in misfolding of the protein to prevent dimerization. Third, all of the truncation mutants and the S920Y mutant showed preferential co-IP with the WT pump, more than expected from their expression. Because the truncation mutants are the most susceptible to proteolysis (Fig. 3), the simplest explanation for this finding is that dimerization protects these mutants from proteolysis. However, the analysis of protein expression levels in Fig. 6 does not support such an explanation. Another possibility is that sequences C-terminal to position Glu-917 (the shortest truncation tested) function to reduce pump dimerization and their truncation resulted in enhanced association of the truncated mutants with the WT pump. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the only other mutation to induce preferential binding is the S920Y and that this portion of the protein between TM8 and the C terminus appears to be the most rigid because it shows the least movement upon transition from the E1 to the E2 conformation (23Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Ca2+ pools have a key role in shaping the spatiotemporal complexity of Ca2+ signaling and in controlling cellular processes of major physiological and pathological relevance (24Rizzuto R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SERCA pumps are key participants in the Ca2+ signal as they determine ER Ca2+ content at rest and during stimulation (10Brini M. Bano D. Manni S. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4926-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several ER functions such as the activity of several chaperones and that of the unfolded protein response are regulated by ER Ca2+ content (25Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 26Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that mutations in SERCA2 pump activity lead to DD. However, DD is characterized by variable phenotypes from very mild symptoms with dislodging of skin keratinocytes to severe manifestation with several neurological deficiencies. The effect of DD-causing mutations on SERCA2b pump activity is unknown, let alone the underlying mechanism for the variable phenotype of the disease. In this work, we analyzed several mutations that cause DD in an effort to partially address these questions and to gain a further understanding of SERCA2b pump function. All of the mutations analyzed with the exception of one showed no Ca2+-pumping activity, and the V843F mutation reduced pump activity by 50%. Hence, it is clear that the mutations that cause DD do so by reducing SERCA2b activity. Multiple biochemical mechanisms appear responsible for reduced pump activity. Thus, nonsense mutations resulted in truncated pump proteins that were susceptible for degradation by the proteasome. Several missense mutations caused a marked reduction in protein level that was partially attributed to degradation by the proteasome, whereas others had a minimal effect on pump expression. This variability probably contributes to the variable clinical phenotype, but it is not sufficient to account for all of the variability because 11 of the 12 mutants examined had no pumping activity. The two most notable and related findings in this work are the biochemical evidence for interaction between SERCA2b monomers and the inhibition of the native and expressed WT SERCA2b activity by five of the mutants. The crystal structure of SERCA1 in the E1 (Ca2+) (27Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) and E2 (2H+) (23Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) conformations suggest that SERCA pumps can exist as monomers. Of course, this does not exclude the possibility that in vivo the monomers interact with each other or that the pump functions as a dimer. Indeed, several lines of functional and biochemical evidence (16Pick U. Karlish S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Chamberlain B.K. Berenski C.J. Jung C.Y. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11997-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hymel L. Maurer A. Berenski C. Jung C.Y. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Napolitano C.A. Cooke P. Segalman K. Herbette L. Biophys. J. 1983; 42: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Castellani L. Hardwicke P.M. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Palm T. Coan C. Trommer W.E. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) support this notion. Here we provided the first direct evidence that SERCA2b exists as a dimer by showing that HA-tagged and Myc-tagged pumps can be co-IPed under mild extraction conditions. Importantly, all of the DD mutants interacted with the WT pump. The significance of interaction of the WT and mutant SERCA2b monomers in vivo is that it provides a mechanism to explain reduced Ca2+ pumping below 50% that is expected from the recessive nature of the disease. This provides a likely mechanism to account for the variable clinical features of DD. Hence, the essential role of SERCA2b in Ca2+ signaling makes it vital for life, and even a 50% reduction in pump activity is not tolerated, leading to the detachment of skin keratinocytes. Other cellular activities such as Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (7Zhao X.S. Shin D.M. Liu L.H. Shull G.E. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and myocytes contractility (28Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) undergo adaptation to the modified Ca2+ response. However, the interaction of WT and the DD-causing mutants that leads to a further reduction of SERCA2b pump activity is likely to affect additional cells and organs such as the nervous system. The clinical features of DD point to particular vulnerability of keratinocytes and neuronal cells to mutations in SERCA2b and Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER. This suggests that a cellular function common to the two cell types is particularly sensitive to ER Ca2+ content. Such a potential function can be cell-cell and cell-matrix attachment that in keratinocytes are mediated by cadherins, a family of calcium-dependent adherent proteins. Cadherins also play a central role in the formation of neuronal connections (29Bruses J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Ranscht B. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 18: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and may contribute to neurite outgrowth and pathfinding and to synaptic specificity in the central nervous system (31Tepass U. Truong K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Aberrant function of cadherins can explain the symptomatic skin disorders in DD and that the second most prevalent disorder in DD is neurological deficiencies. If aberrant function of cadherins is the underlying cause of DD symptoms, our findings point to a central role of ER Ca2+ in the function of cadherins. Most studies attribute Ca2+ regulation of cadherins function to extracellular Ca2+ (32Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar). In fact, little is known regarding the role of [Ca2+]i in the regulation of cadherins function. However, accumulating evidence points to such a role. Depletion of ER Ca2+ with thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid prevented accumulation of cadherins at cell-cell junctions (34Li L. Tucker R.W. Hennings H. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1171-1184PubMed Google Scholar) and increased endothelial permeability by increasing discontinuities in cadherins junctions (35Sandoval R. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Kouklis P. Ellis C.A. Tiruppathi C. J Physiol (Lond.). 2001; 533: 433-445Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Conversely, increased ER Ca2+ load by overexpression of calreticulin, a Ca2+ storage protein and chaperone in the ER, enhances assembly of cadherins junctions in cell-cell contacts (36Fadel M.P. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Leclerc P. Dziak E. Symonds J.M. Blaschuk O. Michalak M. Opas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27083-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Significantly, dissociation of cadherins was observed in the skin of patients with DD (37Hakuno M. Shimizu H. Akiyama M. Amagai M. Wahl J.K. Wheelock M.J. Nishikawa T. Br. J. Dermatol. 2000; 142: 702-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Together, these findings point to the importance of ER Ca2+ in cadherins function and their possible aberrant function in DD. In summary, this work demonstrates multiple effects of mutations in SERCA2b pump associated with DD. The mutations affect protein expression, degradation, and activity. The most significant finding is that several DD-associated mutants inhibit the activity of the native and the expressed WT pumps. The inhibition was not the result of altered protein expression nor increased passive leak but rather the inhibition of pumping activity by protein-protein interaction. These findings provide a plausible molecular mechanism for diverse phenotypes of DD and a framework to further understand the role of SERCA2b in specific cell functions.

Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) of the high resolution crystal structure of MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tb-MscL). This result confirmed many of the essential conclusions of the earlier mutagenesis studies, while also clarifying some confusion concerning the stoichiometry of the channel and providing a wealth of new insights into the molecular details of the structure.The image of Tb-MscL produced by Rees and coworkers is undoubtedly of the closed state of the channel. Of the many challenges associated with the detailed study of channels and other membrane proteins, a major issue is the elucidation of the several states (open, closed, intermediate, desensitized) associated with such structures and the mechanisms of the transitions among them. For a type of bacterial K+ channel images of the open and closed state are now available (13Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.L. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

At present, however, it is not possible to run such simulations long enough to see the transition from closed to open state. As a result, the de novo construction of molecular models for the open state and various intermediates on the opening pathway has been attempted.In particular, a detailed, atomic-level gating model for Ec-MscL has been developed by Sukharev, Guy, and coworkers (SG) (19Sukharev S. Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 917-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Sukharev S. Betanzos M. Chiang C.S. Guy H.R.

Although the Rees crystal structure is of Tb-MscL, SG chose to model Ec-MscL so that use could be made of the much larger collection of experimental data that exist for this homologue. These data were used extensively in developing the computational model. In addition to emphasizing key residues identified from the mutagenesis studies, the SG model naturally identified a number of other key interactions that make important contributions in the open state and in a key intermediate state identified along the gating pathway. Recently, the Perozo lab has developed a structural model of the transmembrane domains based on spin labeling data that supports many features of the SG model (22Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Sompornpisut P. Kloda A. Martinac B. Nature. 2002; 418: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).To test specific features of the SG model, it would be useful to evaluate the many proposed structural contacts by site-directed mutagenesis. However, the protocols for evaluating MscL mutants, either through electrophysiology or growth studies, are time-consuming and tedious. Also, two distinct MscL mutant phenotypes have been identified using electrophysiology: gain of function mutations (GOF), which are mutations that open spontaneously or with less tension than required to open wild type MscL, and loss of function mutations (LOF), which are mutations that cannot be gated or require more tension than wild type MscL to gate. Previous mutagenic studies, however, have generally evaluated GOF mutations only, because the LOF assay is especially tedious.Recently, we have developed a high-throughput, fluorescence-based method for the phenotypical characterization of both LOF and GOF mutations in Ec-MscL (23Maurer J.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1514: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This approach allows for the rapid screening and identification of mutations that are phenotypically wild type, gain of function, or loss of function. We now report the results of an extensive random mutagenesis study of Ec-MscL, looking at mutations with both possible phenotypes. We have greatly expanded the number of MscL mutants with an altered phenotype, especially for the LOF phenotype. These mutagenesis results have been used to evaluate several key features of the SG gating model. In addition, our mutagenesis results implicate particular regions of MscL as being involved in tension sensing and may discriminate between two proposed evolutionary models of MscL.EXPERIMENTAL PRODECURESPlasmids and Strains—The Ec-MscL protein was encoded under the control of an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter in pB10b, as previously described. All experiments were carried out in the MJF465 bacterial strain that is lacking the MscL, MscS (YggB), and KefA genes.Random Mutagenesis—Random mutagenesis of Ec-MscL was performed using the Diversify PCR Random Mutagenesis kit (Clontech) under buffer condition six. A standard PCR reaction using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase was carried out in the presence of 640 μm MnSO4 and 80 μm dGTP. Following PCR, the reaction products were subcloned into fresh pB10b vector using the BglII and XhoI restriction sites.Phenotypical Characterization of MscL Mutations—Phenotypical characterization of Ec-MscL mutations was carried out as previously described with slight modification to allow growth in deep 96-well plates. Single colonies resulting from the subcloned random Ec-MscL mutations were grown in a 2-ml 96-well growth block using 200 μl of Luria Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for 14 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator (400 rpm). To prevent evaporation and allow gas exchange, the plate was covered with two sheets of 0.5 mil polyester. The Luria Bertani culture (1 μl) was then used to induce a 200-μl culture in HOEM medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). The cultures were covered with polyester and grown for 7 h and 45 min at 37 °C in a shaking incubator (400 rpm). In a 96-well plate the HOEM cultures (10 μl) were diluted 20-fold by addition of solutions (190 μl) of various osmotic strengths containing propidium iodide and SYTO 9 (Molecular Probes). Each HOEM culture was subjected to eight different downshock solutions. The downshock solutions were prepared by mixing HOEM medium with water in the following ratios: 1:0, 4:1, 13:7, 1:1, 3:5, 1:3, 1:7, and 0:1. After mixing, the 96-well plate was incubated at 37 °C in a plate incubator for 90 min. The plates were then read using a Gemini XS plate reader (Molecular Devices) with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelengths of 530 and 630 nm. Phenotypes were determined from the resulting downshock curves as previously described. In previous work (23Maurer J.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1514: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) we have shown that this screen faithfully reproduces the phenotypical variation seen in a series of G22X mutants, and so no rescreening using electrophysiology was performed.DNA Sequencing—For DNA sequencing, the remaining Luria Bertani cultures were diluted with TB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown to saturation. Mini-prep DNA was obtained for sequencing using either a spin mini-prep kit (Qiagen), a 96-well mini-prep kit (Millipore), or a mini-prep robot (Laragen, Inc., Los Angeles, CA or ACGT, Inc., Northbrook, IL). Big dye terminated automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) was performed by either the Caltech Sequence Analysis Facility (Pasadena, CA), Laragen, Inc., or ACGT, Inc.RESULTSThe Library—A library of random mutations was created using a standard sloppy PCR protocol, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Starting with this library, 408 Ec-MscL constructs gave reliable sequencing data and were phenotypically screened. The resulting constructs had a modal distribution centered at 2–3 nucleotide changes per construct and one amino acid change per construct. The distribution of mutations is shown in Fig. 1A. Of the 408 sequenced constructs, 348 contained at least one amino acid change in the MscL protein.Of the constructs that contained at least one amino acid point mutation, 64% were phenotypically wild type, 29% were phenotypically loss of function, and 7% were phenotypically gain of function. Looking only at the constructs with a single amino acid change, 74% were wild type, 20% were loss of function, and 6% were gain of function. Of course, the wild type phenotype described here could be indistinguishable from very weakly LOF or GOF phenotypes that might be detectable by detailed electrophysiological studies. The GOF and LOF phenotypes are unambiguous. These results are thus in striking contrast to previous work, which has primarily identified gain of function mutations.As expected, increasing the number of mutations increased the probability of a channel showing an altered phenotype (GOF or LOF). Fig. 1B shows the number of occurrences of a particular phenotype as a function of the number of amino acid point mutations. The large number of phenotypically wild type mutations observed, coupled with the observation of phenotypically wild type constructs that contain multiple mutations (up to seven), suggests that MscL is relatively tolerant to mutation.Ninety percent of the amino acids that make up Ec-MscL were mutated at least once in our sequenced random mutation library. A modal distribution was observed centered around three amino acid changes per Ec-MscL residue (Fig. 1C). Up to seven different amino acid changes were observed at a single Ec-MscL position. Assuming a single nucleotide change per codon in Ec-MscL, there are 843 possible non-silent point mutations. Forty-six percent (390) of all possible point mutations were observed in our sequenced random mutation library.Evaluating Multiple Mutations—Single site mutants are, of course, straightforward to interpret, whether they give wild type, GOF, or LOF phenotypes. On the other hand, interpreting the results for structures with multiple mutations can be challenging. If we assume that the occurrence of compensating LOF and GOF mutations is rare, multiple mutations that are phenotypically wild type arise from a collection of phenotypically wild type mutations. To test this assumption we can use the number of single site, wild type mutations to predict the expected number of multisite wild type mutations. That is, if 75% of single site mutants are wild type, then we expect the fraction of double mutants that are wild type to be (0.75)2. The predicted and actual fractions of wild type phenotypes for multiple mutants are shown in Fig. 1D, and the agreement is acceptable. We therefore assume that a mutation that occurs in any wild type construct is a “wild type” mutation and would produce a wild type phenotype if it occurred as a single mutant. This also means that such a mutation does not contribute to GOF or LOF phenotypes.Constructs with multiple mutations and an altered phenotype are more difficult to interpret, because any single mutation could give rise to the observed phenotype. Pseudo-single site, altered phenotype mutation data can be generated, however, by subtracting the wild type data from the non-wild type data. In this process, if the same mutation is observed in both a wild type construct and an altered phenotype construct, the mutation is assumed not to give rise to the altered phenotype. For example, the double mutant V23A/K117T is observed to be gain of function, and the mutation K117T is observed in a wild type construct. From this we conclude that the mutation V23A gives rise to the observed gain of function phenotype. Additional pseudo-single site data can be obtained by assuming that mutations to Ec-MscL beyond residue 110 are wild type. It has been shown that deletion of residues 110–136 in Ec-MscL does not dramatically alter the gating of the channel (8Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1996; 93: 11652-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Hase C.C. LeDain A.C. Martinac B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Similar to the analysis of wild type mutations, the number of LOF and GOF mutations can be predicted from the number of single site mutations, using the assumption that one mutation gives rise to a particular phenotype. The number of observed mutations is again similar to the predicted value (data not shown).Based on this reasoning, the library contains 289 single site and pseudo-single site mutations: 237 wild type structures along with 7 GOF and 45 LOF mutants. These mutations are mapped onto the MscL sequence in Fig. 2. Fig. 3A gives a pictorial definition of the various domains of the receptor. A listing of all mutants prepared is given in the tables under supplemental information.Fig. 2Observed single site and pseudo-single site mutations and their phenotypes are shown above the wild type Ec-MscL sequence. Amino acid mutations that are phenotypically wild type are shown in black, mutations that are phenotypically loss of function are shown in red, and mutations that are phenotypically gain of function are shown in blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3A, a single chain of the SG closed state model highlighting the various regions of the protein.

Two new gain of function mutations are observed in this region, F83Y and L86R, along with many loss of function mutations. With the exception of N100D, mutations in TM2 with altered phenotypes had not been observed in previous random screenings of Ec-MscL.Previous work had identified roughly 30 gain of function mutations in Ec-MscL, and the 7 GOF constructs observed here add 5 new entries to that list. In contrast, previous work had identified only 10 loss of function mutants, and so the discovery of 45 new LOF mutants greatly expands the list and has significant implications for channel function and design, as discussed below. Additionally, the 237 single site wild type mutations or pseudo-single site wild type mutations provide additional information that was not previously available.DISCUSSIONUsing a standard sloppy PCR protocol and a recently developed high-throughput screen, we have been able to evaluate 408 Ec-MscL constructs, of which 348 contained at least one altered amino acid. The coverage of mutations is good and fairly uniform (Figs. 1A and 2). We feel the results have significant implications for several aspects of MscL research, including the details of the SG model and possible tension-sensing regions.Previous work had identified roughly 30 gain of function mutations in Ec-MscL, and the 7 GOF constructs observed here add 5 new entries to that list. In contrast, previous work had identified only 10 loss of function mutants, all of which were variants at the Gly-22 site that also produces GOF mutants (11Yoshimura K. Batiza A. Schroeder M. Blount P. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1960-1972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As such, the discovery of 45 new LOF mutants (Fig. 2) greatly expands the list and has significant implications for channel function and design, as discussed below. No doubt the small number of previously observed LOF mutants reflects the greater challenge in performing conventional LOF assays. The fluorescence assay used here overcomes this limitation. Using this assay 29% of the constructs containing one or more mutations were LOF, and 20% of all constructs containing precisely one mutation were LOF (Fig. 1B). In sharp contrast, only 7% of all constructs containing at least one mutation were gain of function and only 6% of constructs with precisely one mutation were GOF (Fig. 1B).Concerning global features of the channel, it is interesting that phenotypically altered single site data suggest that TM2 is functionally significant. Two new gain of function mutations are observed in this region, F83Y and L86R, along with many loss of function mutations. With the exception of N100D, mutations in TM2 with altered phenotypes had not been observed in previous random screenings of Ec-MscL.Implications for the SG Model—The detailed model developed by SG is based on a number of reasonable assumptions and additional creative ideas to close some key gaps. The starting point for the SG model is a modified homology model of the Tb-MscL crystal structure of the closed state. A new helix (Fig. 3, S1) was added to the amino terminus of the protein, corresponding to a region that was not resolved in the Tb-MscL crystal structure. Also, because the loop region of MscL is not well conserved between the E. coli and the M. tuberculosis homologues, a de novo model for the Ec-MscL loop region, not based on the crystal structure of Tb-MscL, was developed. Additionally, the carboxyl terminus of the protein was adjusted to make room for the S1 region. The various regions of the model are shown in Fig. 3A. We note that SG have generously made the coordinates of their models freely available, which greatly facilitates efforts to develop experimental tests of the model.A key feature of the SG model is the presence of an expanded, intermediate state on the gating pathway. In this state the occlusion of the pore seen in the crystal structure is broken, but an occlusion formed by the modeled S1 helices remains. This pre-expanded state was considered necessary to explain the electrophysiology of Ec-MscL. Fig. 3, B–D, shows a top view of the SG model for the closed, expanded intermediate, and open states, respectively. It could well be there are several states of intermediate conductance in the MscL channel, and it is not possible with a screen such as the one employed here to determine where along such a pathway a given mutation is exerting its influence. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to assume that mutations of residues proposed to play a key structural role should have a functional consequence.In the present work, we use specific point mutations to probe features of the SG model. It is difficult for a study of point mutations to provide compelling evidence in support of or opposed to the global structural changes inherent in the SG model, and we note that the global model for the first and second transmembrane domains has received some experimental support (1Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 20Sukharev S. Betanzos M. Chiang C.S. Guy H.R.

Cortes D.M. Sompornpisut P. Kloda A. Martinac B. Nature. 2002; 418: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Still, evaluating particular amino acids is justified by the fact that the SG model was created with a strong reliance on the assumption that highly conserved residues are important and should be involved in complementary interactions in the closed, pre-expanded, and/or open states (19Sukharev S. Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 917-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Relying on sequence conservation is inherently challenging for MscL, because conservation across the family is not nearly as extensive as is typical for homologous proteins. Also, a detailed sequence analysis from our labs (25Maurer J.A. Elmore D.E. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22238-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) produced two distinct MscL subtypes with Tb-MscL, the sequence for which a crystal structure exists, lying in a different family from Ec-MscL, the sequence modeled by SG.As shown in Fig. 2 and the supplemental material, many conserved residues can be mutated and yet still produce a wild type phenotype. Attempts to correlate mutational tolerance with sequence conservation were made by applying the Rao physiochemical scoring matrix (26Rao J.K.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 29: 276-281Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to the observed mutational data and our sequence alignment, but no correlation was found. These results highlight the previously noted fact that sequence conservation among the MscL channels is not high, with some tendency for homologues to cluster into specific subtypes.The supplemental material shows the proposed interacting partners for the conserved residues in each state based on the SG model and the mutations we have observed for these residues. It is clear from this table that many of the residues postulated to be involved in key interactions in the various states of the model can be mutated and yet still produce a wild type phenotype. This calls into question the degree to which a given interaction is essential for proper channel function. Furthermore, no direct correlation is observed between sequence conservation and mutational tolerance for a given residue. As can be seen in the supplemental material, mutations were observed for most of the conserved residues, with many producing a wild type channel. This is especially true for residues located in the amino and carboxyl termini of the protein. In the non-terminal regions of MscL, the number of sites having mutations that give rise to an altered phenotype is not appreciably different between the conserved and non-conserved residues. Here, we focus on select residues that have been proposed by SG to play key roles in the gating mechanism.The Role of S1 and the Five Conserved Phenylalanines—The SG model makes many predictions about key interactions involved in various states of MscL. SG observe five highly conserved phenylalanines in the MscL family and assign significant functional roles to all of them. The first two, Phe-7 and -10, are proposed to reside in the hypothetical S1 helix that is not observed in the Tb-MscL crystal structure. The third phenylalanine, Phe-29, resides in the first transmembrane domain, and the final two phenylalanines, Phe-85 and -93, reside in the second transmembrane domain. Our data suggest that none of these residues is critical to channel function.The SG model postulates that in the closed state Phe-7 and -10 interact with each other to occlude the p"

These signals are observed at the interface of bone and teeth, where osteoblast-like periodontal ligament (PDL) cells constantly take part in bone formation and resorption in response to applied mechanical forces. Earlier, we reported that signals generated by tensile strain of low magnitude (TENS-L) are antiinflammatory, whereas tensile strain of high magnitude (TENS-H) is proinflammatory and catabolic. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of intracellular actions of the antiinflammatory and proinflammatory signals generated by TENS of various magnitudes. We show that both low and high magnitudes of mechanical strain exploit nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB as a common pathway for transcriptional inhibition/activation of proinflammatory genes and catabolic processes. TENS-L is a potent inhibitor of interleukin (IL)-1 beta-induced I-kappaBbeta degradation and prevents dissociation of NF-kB from cytoplasmic complexes and thus its nuclear translocation. This leads to sustained suppression of IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional regulation of proinflammatory genes. In contrast, TENS-H is a proinflammatory signal that induces I-kappaBbeta degradation, nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, and transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes. These findings are the first to describe the largely unknown intracellular mechanism of action of applied tensile forces in osteoblast-like cells and have critical implications in bone remodeling."

It has been shown to resemble nonphotochemical quenching observed in isolated chloroplasts and leaves in several important respects, providing a model system for study of the mechanism of photoprotective energy dissipation. The effect of temperature on the rate of quenching in trimeric and monomeric antenna complexes revealed the presence of two temperature-dependent processes with different activation energies, one between ∼15 and 35 °C and another between ∼40 and 60 °C. The temperature of the transition between the two phases was higher for trimers than for monomers. Throughout this temperature range, the quenching was almost completely reversible, the protein CD was unchanged, and pigment binding was maintained. The activation energy for the low temperature phase was consistent with local rearrangements of pigments within some of the protein domains, whereas the higher temperature phase seemed to arise from large scale conformational transitions. For both phases, there was a strong linear correlation between the quenching rate and the appearance of an absorption band at 685 nm. In addition, quenching was correlated with a loss of CD at ∼495 nm from Lutein 1 and at 680 nm from chlorophylls a1 and a2, the terminal emitters. The results obtained indicate that quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence in antenna complexes is brought about by perturbation of the lutein 1/chlorophyll a1/chlorophyll a2 locus, forming a poorly fluorescing chlorophyll associate, either a dimer or an excimer.

The light-harvesting antenna of photosystem II in higher plants consists of the major trimeric complex LHCII 1The abbreviations used are: LHCII, light-harvesting complex of the photosystem II; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Lut1 and Lut2, luteins bound to LHCII. and three minor monomeric complexes, CP29, CP26, and CP24 (1Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). These proteins function not only to harvest sunlight and deliver excitation energy to the photosystem II core complex but also to provide sites for photoprotection (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants under conditions of excess absorbed radiation is achieved by the induction of a process that dissipates light energy from the light-harvesting complexes. This de-excitation of the excited singlet states of chlorophyll is called nonphotochemical quenching. The major fraction of nonphotochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, qE, is regulated by the size of the thylakoid ΔpH (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar), which controls both the protonation of amino acid side chains on proteins of the light-harvesting system and the activity of violaxanthin de-epoxidase. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of zeaxanthin from violaxanthin. Kinetic analysis of qE indicates that it arises from a change in the equilibrium between two discrete states of the light harvesting system, an unquenched U state and a quenched Q state (3Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1-10Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These states have fluorescence lifetimes of 0.4 and 1.6 ns, respectively (4Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This equilibrium is controlled in an allosteric manner by protonation and zeaxanthin binding (5Ruban A.V. Young A.J.

It has been suggested that PsbS is a regulatory subunit of the photosystem II antenna, possibly interacting with LHCII, and thereby controlling the conversion between U and Q (3Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1-10Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The concentration of PsbS controls the amplitude of qE (12Li X.P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K.

Purified light-harvesting complexes have been used to investigate the mechanism of nonphotochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching. Reconstitution of CP29 and CP26 allows incorporation of zeaxanthin into the Lut 1 and Lut 2 sites and results in a decrease in fluorescence yield (14Crimi M. Dorra D. Bosinger C.S. Giuffra E. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Polivka T. Zigmantas D. Sundstrom V. Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similarly, addition of exogenous zeaxanthin can induce fluorescence quenching in LHCII, CP29, and CP26 (16Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. FEBS Letters. 2000; 471: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In both cases, the decrease in fluorescence is much less than that found for qE. In contrast, the induction of quenching under reduced detergent concentration, which promotes protein-protein interactions and formation of oligomers, leads to a large decrease in fluorescence. It was proposed that the Q state is stabilized by such interaction, pulling the equilibrium strongly in favor of this conformation. Alternatively, the enhanced quenching in oligomers may arise from new pigment interactions (17Bassi R. Silvestri M. Dainese P. Moya I. Giacometti G.M.J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1991; 9: 335-354Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was found that the endogenous (18Ruban A.V. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or exogenous (5Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 123-127Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. FEBS Letters. 2000; 471: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9902-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) content of the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids violaxanthin and zeaxanthin could control quenching in vitro. In several ways, the quenching observed in vitro bears a striking similarity to that seen for qE in vivo (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Particularly significant are the absorption changes associated with fluorescence quenching in isolated light harvesting complexes (5Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 123-127Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. FEBS Letters. 2000; 471: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Ruban A.V. Pesaresi P. Wacker U. Irrgang K.-D.J. Bassi R. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11586-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and qE (21Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 39-44Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Horton P. Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. 8. Kluwer, Dordrecht, the Netherlands1999: 271-291Google Scholar). These point to an alteration in a subpopulation of chlorophyll and xanthophyll molecules. However, the molecular mechanism of quenching remains unresolved. It has been suggested that non-fluorescent chlorophyll a excimers or dimers are formed, which can be effective excitation quenchers in the complex (23Horton P. Ruban A.V. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R. Photoinhibition of Photosynthesis. BIOS Scientific, Oxford1994: 111-125Google Scholar). Another suggestion is that fluorescence quenching arises from a charge transfer complex of two chlorophyll molecules (24Pieper J. Rätsep M. Jankowiak R. Irrgang K.-D. Voigt J. Renger G. Small G.J. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1999; 103: 2422-2432Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a direct role in quenching of chlorophyll excited states by either zeaxanthin or lutein (14Crimi M. Dorra D. Bosinger C.S. Giuffra E. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Naqvi K.R. Melo T.B. Raju B.B. Javorfi T. Simidjiev I. Garab G.

Analysis of the rate of qE formation in leaves and chloroplasts revealed that the fluorescence decay followed second-order kinetics suggesting that quenching arose from a binary reaction of two chlorophyll molecules (8Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Horton P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9896-9901Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Ruban A.V. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A binary reaction was also evident in vitro, where the kinetics of the decrease in fluorescence of LHCII, CP26, and CP29 robustly fitted a second-order kinetic model with respect to time after quenching initiation (16Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. FEBS Letters. 2000; 471: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Ruban A.V. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9902-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using this kinetic model, we show in this article a thermodynamic analysis of fluorescence quenching in isolated light harvesting complexes. We show that the quenching reaction has low activation energy consistent with an alteration in the intramolecular conformation and interaction of pigments. Quenching rate is shown to be tightly associated with the formation of a chlorophyll species that absorbs at 685 nm. In addition, we show that there is a decrease in the chlorophyll a CD signal around 680 nm and a change in the Lutein 1 CD signal consistent with an alteration within the Lutein 1 domain during quenching. Light-harvesting complexes were purified from spinach leaves as described previously (28Ruban A.V. Young A. Pascal A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). LHCII monomers were prepared by treatment of isoelectric focussing isolated trimers with phospholipase A as described previously (20Ruban A.V. Pesaresi P. Wacker U. Irrgang K.-D.J. Bassi R. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11586-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Investigation of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching followed a well documented protocol: the samples were dissolved in 200 μm DM, and diluted into detergent-free medium at a specific pH and temperature to give a final DM concentration of ∼6 μm (5Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 123-127Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of temperature, the detergent-free medium was equilibrated at the desired temperature before sample addition. Chlorophyll fluorescence yield was measured using a PAM 101 fluorometer (Waltz, Germany) as described previously (6Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and displayed on a chart recorder. Data points were obtained by digitization of the chart recorder traces using Ungraph (Cambridge Soft). Kinetic analysis was carried out as described previously (18Ruban A.V. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9902-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the data were fitted to the simple hyperbolic decay F = 1/(kt + 1/Fq) + Fu, where k is the second-order rate constant, Fq is the amplitude of quenchable fluorescence, and Fu is the amplitude of unquenchable fluorescence. Measurements of the absorption change occurring during quenching at different temperatures were carried out using a Cary 500 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian), at a spectral resolution of 1 nm, with an attached Peltier system for temperature control. The sample buffer was equilibrated at the desired temperature before sample addition and quenching induction. Measurements of the protein and chlorophyll CD changes occurring during quenching at different temperatures were carried out using a J810 (Jasco) spectropolarimeter, spectra were recorded at a resolution of 2 nm. Temperature was maintained by an attached PFD425S Peltier system. Quenching was allowed to proceed until a steady-state fluorescence yield was achieved (∼30–60 s after induction) before absorption and CD spectra were measured. Activation energies for the quenching reaction were calculated by fitting the rate data to the Arrhenius equation: k = ln [A – (Ea/RT)], where k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Ea is the activation energy. Temperature Dependence of Fluorescence Quenching—The rate of fluorescence quenching induced by dilution of samples of light-harvesting complexes into detergent-free solution is temperature dependent. Fig. 1 shows an Arrhenius plot for the rate of quenching for LHCII trimers, LHCII monomers, and CP26. For each complex, the quenching reaction is described by two distinct linear phases. In the first phase, the rate of quenching was almost temperature independent. However, the second phase was strongly dependent on the temperature, as evidenced by the large increase in the gradient of the Arrhenius plot. The extrapolated break point between these phases was 31.9 °C for CP26, 32.1 °C for LHCII monomers, and 38.5 °C for LHCII trimers. Above 60 °C, the rate of quenching became too fast to measure, with the sample essentially being completely quenched immediately after mixing (data not shown). The gradient of the Arrhenius plot is a measure of the activation energy of the quenching reaction. The activation energies for the initial reaction were similar for all the complexes, being 8.36, 6.46, and 6.30 kJ/mol for CP26, LHCII trimers, and LHCII monomers, respectively. Above 35 °C for CP26 and LHCII monomers and 40 °C for LHCII trimers, the activation energy of quenching reaction increases 10-fold to 70–90 kJ/mol. Changes in CD Associated with Quenching—Fig. 2 shows the CD spectra of LHCII and CP26 before and after quenching at 35 °C. In the unquenched state, the CD profile of LHCII in the red region had a characteristic shape with a strong positive band at 668–669 nm and negative bands at 653 and 682 nm (Fig. 2A). The spectrum of CP26 was similar to that of LHCII except that the negative chlorophyll b band around 652 nm was greatly reduced (Fig. 2B). It was found that in both complexes, quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence was associated with a decrease in the CD signal, particularly from the red-most band. Difference CD spectra calculated as quenched minus unquenched showed the loss of a chlorophyll a signal at 680 nm, seen as a positive band in the difference spectrum (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom). In addition to the change at ∼680 nm, there was also the loss of a band at ∼652 nm, suggesting an alteration in the chlorophyll b environment during quenching. Fig. 2, C and D, shows protein CD spectra for LHCII and CP26, respectively. The CD spectra of both CP26 and LHCII are dominated by the classic pair of minima at 211 and 222 nm arising from the α-helical secondary structure. There is also a broad positive maximum at ∼260 nm from the presence of a low proportion of random coiled structure. It was evident from the difference spectra of both complexes (Fig. 2, C and D, bottom) that there were no detectable changes in the protein CD during quenching. Temperature Dependence of CD—Fig. 3 shows the amplitude of CD in the quenched state observed at 211 nm (protein) and 680 nm (chlorophyll) with increasing temperature for both trimeric LHCII (Fig. 3, A and C) and CP26 (Fig. 3, B and D). There was little or no change in the protein CD in either LHCII trimers or CP26 up to 60 °C (Fig. 3, A and B). When the temperature was raised above 60 °C, there was a strong decrease in the CD signal at 211 nm, most likely representing the unfolding of the helical secondary structure of the protein upon denaturation (see below). In contrast, there are characteristic changes in the chlorophyll CD (Fig. 3, C and D). Between 4 and 40 °C in LHCII trimers and between 4 and 32 °C in CP26, the chlorophyll CD at 680 nm showed negligible temperature dependence. Between 40 and 60 °C (LHCII trimers) and between 32 and 60 °C (CP26), there was a large decrease in the CD signal, showing a change in the interaction of the chlorophylls within the complexes. The temperature range over which there was little change in the chlorophyll CD signal was the same range in which there is little change in the rate of quenching. For both LHCII and CP26, the temperature at which the rate of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching begins to increase is the same temperature at which the CD signal at 680 nm begins to decrease. CD of Carotenoids—Measurements on the CD changes of the carotenoids within the complexes were complicated by spectral overlap with chlorophylls (Fig. 4). However, the quenched minus unquenched difference spectrum revealed a number of features arising from LHCII carotenoids: a positive band at ∼495 nm together with negative bands at 445, 469, and 485 nm. These changes were also observed in CP26 during quenching in vitro (data not shown). The loss of the CD at 495 nm was found to respond to changes in the temperature in a manner similar to that seen for chlorophyll CD, with two distinct phases again resolved (Fig. 5): the amplitude of the CD change at 495 nm was only slightly temperature dependent between 4 and 40 °C, but the amplitude increased when the temperature was raised above 40 °C. This pattern of temperature dependence was again similar to that shown by the rate of quenching.Fig. 5Arrhenius-like plot of the change in amplitude of the CD at 495 nm against temperature. Data was obtained for LHCII after quenching at different temperatures, compared with the rate of quenching taken from Fig. 1 (dotted line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Absorption Changes—Absorbance changes around 685 nm have been found in all cases of in vitro quenching (5Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 123-127Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. FEBS Letters. 2000; 471: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Ruban A.V. Pesaresi P. Wacker U. Irrgang K.-D.J. Bassi R. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11586-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and a similar nonphotochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching-related absorbance change has been observed in isolated chloroplasts (21Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 39-44Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Horton P. Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. 8. Kluwer, Dordrecht, the Netherlands1999: 271-291Google Scholar). To determine whether the changes in quenching rate at different temperatures were associated with alteration in this absorption change, absorption spectra were recorded before and after quenching, and ΔA685 was measured. As shown in Fig. 6A, ΔA685 exhibited little change up to 35 °C, but increased strongly above this temperature. The temperature dependences of the absorption change and of the rate of quenching were the same. In fact, there was a strong linear correlation (r2 > 0.98) between the rate of quenching and the extent of ΔA685 (Fig. 6B). Temperature Dependence of Reversibility and Complex Stability—In the range 5 to 60 °C, the fluorescence quenching rate and associated changes in CD were almost completely reversible by addition of detergent, for both CP26 and LHCII (Fig. 7, A and B). Thus, the effect of temperature was caused not by a denaturing effect but only an enhancement of the dynamic behavior. If the temperature was increased beyond 55–60 °C, then denaturation did occur—the fluorescence quenching became irreversible, and the protein CD was lost (Fig. 7C). At this temperature, pigment binding was also disrupted, and fluorescence emission from chlorophyll b was observed (Fig. 7D). Activation Energy of Quenching—In the temperature range below 35 °C, the rate of quenching in isolated LHCII and CP26 was almost temperature independent. An activation energy of just 6–8 kJ/mol indicates that quenching arises from small changes in conformation (e.g. arising from alterations in the van der Waals interactions within the complex). Such changes may comprise small alterations in the orientation and/or positions of chlorophylls and/or carotenoids within individual subunits of LHCII. Above 35–40 °C, there were dramatic increases in the rate of quenching and an increase in activation energy for all complexes. Because absorption and CD changes showed exactly the same temperature dependence as the quenching rate, it is concluded that the mechanism of quenching is the same both above and below this transition temperature. The second phase has an activation energy of between 70 and 90 kJ/mol, indicating larger alterations within the complex that allow it to adopt readily the quenched conformation. These changes might include the formation of H-bonds and alterations in charge interactions associated with larger conformational changes or, alternatively, a “melting” of bound lipid and/or detergent. Under the conditions used for induction of quenching, it is known that the complexes form oligomers and, in some cases, large macromolecular aggregates. The transition temperature may be associated with increased tendency for formation of such multimeric states. Because quenching is normally induced by lowering the detergent concentration, this observation provides support for the notion that the transition is associated with a disruption of protein/detergent interactions. It has previously been found that monomers of LHCII have a greater tendency to adopt the quenched state compared with trimers (16Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. FEBS Letters. 2000; 471: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and it is therefore significant that the transition temperature was almost 10 °C higher for trimers compared with monomers. The activation energy of qE in isolated spinach chloroplasts is similar to that found for the higher temperature phase (29Krause G.H. Photosynthetica. 1992; 27: 249-252Google Scholar). Here, it is possible that the three-dimensional organization of the photosystem II antenna within the thylakoid membrane stabilizes the unquenched state, increasing the energy required to activate the quenching process. Hence, LHCII is locked into the unquenched state by its interaction with associated proteins, lipid, and xanthophylls. In both cases, the external interactions of LHCII subunits control the internal configuration and the quenching state of the complex. In the case of qE, quenching occurs only by means of a “catalyst”— perhaps by protonation and zeaxanthin binding to the PsbS subunit. Stability of Light-harvesting Complexes—The present data show that the changes in pigment configurations associated with quenching are fully reversible up to ∼50–60 °C. Up to this temperature range, the α-helical structure of the complexes is retained, and pigment interactions are preserved, as evidenced by the lack of fluorescence emission from chlorophyll b and the unperturbed chlorophyll CD. Beyond 60 °C, the complexes become denatured— helical structure is lost, chlorophyll b emission is observed, the chlorophyll CD is lost, and quenching becomes strong and irreversible. This points to a high degree of stability of the light harvesting complexes, as observed previously (30Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Identity of the Quenching Species—We have shown here that quenching in CP26 and LHCII is associated with spectral changes in chlorophylls and xanthophylls. More specifically, it has been demonstrated that over a 20-fold change in the rate of quenching, throughout a 50 °C temperature range, strong correlation was observed with these spectral changes. In line with previous observations, quenching was associated with the appearance of an absorption band at 685 nm. There was an inverse relationship between the OD at 685 nm and CD changes around 680 nm in both CP26 and LHCII. However, it is apparent that although we see a loss of the CD signal around 680 nm associated with quenching, this is not associated with any new CD band in the red region. Thus, during quenching, the interaction of the chlorophylls responsible for the negative CD signal at 680 nm changes in such a way as to produce a species that has no CD signature but is visible as a new band in the OD spectra. It could be suggested that in the quenched state, there is more freedom for those interacting chlorophylls, which give rise to the 680 CD signal in the unquenched state. However, this could not account for the appearance of the absorption band at 685 nm. A second possibility is that there is a new specific orientation of the interacting chlorophylls. In this case, formation of an almost perpendicular association of two chlorophyll molecules would not have a CD signal but could display a red-shifted absorption at 685 nm. Chlorophyll associates in various solvents or in liposomes have been shown to absorb at ∼685 nm (31Uehara K. Mimuro M. Tanaka M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 53: 371-377Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Agostiano A. Cosma P. Della Monica M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 58: 201-213Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The CD at 680 nm arises from the terminal emitter chlorophylls, a1 or a2 (33Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 34Rogl H. Kuhlbrandt W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16214-16222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that quenching is associated with alterations within this domain. Any change in conformation of this domain would be expected to perturb Lutein 1, which lies ∼4 Å from chlorophyll a1 and a2 (35Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8A). Indeed, differences in the CD spectrum in the Soret region were found, indicating some change in carotenoid conformation. Although it is difficult to determine what is responsible for the two short wavelength bands that appeared in the difference CD because of complications with overlap from chlorophyll, the long wavelength band at 495 nm most likely belongs to Lutein 1 (36Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The structural model for LHCII reveals that the maximum separation between chlorophylls a1 and a2 is ∼8.5 Å (35Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Additionally, the chlorophyll b1 site has also been shown in LHCII to be occupied by chlorophyll a (33Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This chlorophyll could form a second dimer within the Lutein 1 domain with chlorophyll a1, with a chlorophyll-chlorophyll ring separation of less than 5.0 Å. It is very important to note that chlorophyll a dimers have been shown to be quenchers when their separation is less than 12 Å (37Beddard, G. S., and Porter, G. Nature, 260, 366–367Google Scholar). The Mechanism of Quenching Induction—We propose a model for the mechanism of quenching based upon a change in pigment organization within the Lutein 1 domain. Because of the low activation energy, this change is suggested to be caused by only a small change in the tertiary structure of the LHCII protein (Fig. 8B). For this model, we assume that the pigment configuration in the structural model of LHCII (35Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) is that of the quenched state, because the two-dimensional crystals of LHCII used for crystallography are highly quenched. 2D. Klug and W. Kuhlbrandt, personal communications. We suggest that that the configuration of pigments in this domain in the unquenched state prevents possible dissipative interactions between closely packed chlorophylls. We suggest that the position of Lutein 1 relative to chlorophylls a2 and a1 is particularly important. The change to quenched state is associated with the concerted loss of the chlorophyll CD signal at ∼680 nm, Lutein 1 CD at 495 nm, and the formation of a new chlorophyll species absorbing at ∼685 nm. The loss of chlorophyll CD signal indicates a change in the orientation of the terminal emitter chlorophyll, whereas the loss of Lutein 1 CD signal indicates an alteration in the interaction of this lutein with other pigments within the domain. Previously, it was shown by linear dichroism that there is a difference in lutein orientation in quenched LHCII aggregates compared with unquenched trimers (38Ruban A.V. Calkoen F. Kwa S.L.S. van Grondelle R. Horton P. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 61-70Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The change in the position of Lutein 1 is suggested to allow a new type of perpendicular association between chlorophylls a1 and a2, forming a quenching dimer/excimer (Fig. 8B). An alternative model is that the creation of an increased chlorophyll-carotenoid interaction in the altered Lutein 1 domain is responsible for quenching. This idea would encompass suggestions about how carotenoids may directly quench chlorophyll excited singlet states (26Naqvi K.R. Melo T.B. Raju B.B. Javorfi T. Simidjiev I. Garab G. Spectrochim. Acta A. 1997; 53: 2659-2667Crossref Google Scholar, 27Naqvi K.R. Javorfi T. Melo T.B. Garab G. Spectrochim. Acta A. 1999; 55: 193-204Crossref Google Scholar, 39Owens T.G. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R.

Res. 1994; 41: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Nonphotochemical Quenching in Vivo—The similarity between the type of quenching studied here and the in vivo process of nonphotochemical quenching, qE, has been well documented (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 5Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 123-127Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. FEBS Letters. 2000; 471: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Wentworth M. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9902-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mechanism for quenching responsible for qE has proved controversial. The requirement for protonation and the involvement of zeaxanthin has led to proposals quite different from the model presented in Fig. 8. Similarly, the obligatory requirement for the PsbS protein has called into question whether qE directly involves any of the antenna complexes. However, observations that PsbS does not bind chlorophyll (41Dominici P. Caffarri S. Armenante F. Ceoldo S. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 272: 2750-22758Google Scholar) but that it provides qE-related protonation sites (11Li X.P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) suggests that this protein has an activating role in quenching. Similarly, it seems that PsbS also provides the binding site for zeaxanthin (10Aspinall-O'Dea M. Wentworth M. Pascal A. Robert B. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16331-16335Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), generating the ΔA535 that is characteristic of qE (42Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the conformational state of one or more antenna complexes is controlled by its interaction with PsbS. Because the antenna complexes in vivo are in a macro-organized oligomeric state (43Boekema E.J. Van Breemen J.F.L. Van Roon H. Dekker J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), protein-protein interactions will govern the transitions between their unquenched and quenched states. Indeed such interactions may be necessary for the large increases in energy dissipation found in vivo as well as in vitro, explaining the high activation energy observed in vivo and in this study. Recent data have indicated that mutation of an LHCII protein in Chlamydomonas leads to inhibition of qE (44Elrad D. Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1801-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins may also provide the sites of quenching in higher plants. This rationale is entirely consistent with the “LHCII-aggregation” hypothesis proposed more than 10 years ago (25Horton P. Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A.A. Noctor G. Young A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2035655203,"Vitamins B12, B6, and folic acid converge at the homocysteine metabolic junction where they support the activities of two key enzymes involved in intracellular homocysteine management, methionine synthase (MS) and cystathionine β-synthase. The molecular mechanism for the regulation of homocysteine metabolism by B12 supplementation has been investigated in this study. B12 supplementation does not alter mRNA or protein turnover rates but induces translational up-regulation of MS by shifting the mRNA from the ribonucleoprotein to the polysome pool. The B12-responsive element has been localized by deletion analysis using a reporter gene assay to a 70-bp region located at the 3′ end of the 5′-untranslated region of the MS mRNA. The cellular consequence of the B12 response is a 2- and 3.5-fold increase in the flux of homocysteine through the MS-dependent transmethylation pathway in HepG2 and 293 cells, respectively. It is speculated that B12-induced up-regulation of MS may have evolved as an adaptive strategy for rapidly sequestering an essential and rare nutrient whose availability may have been limited in the evolutionary history of mammals, a problem that is exacerbated by the absence of this vitamin from the plant kingdom.

Vitamins B12, folic acid, and B6 converge at a single metabolic junction in mammals that is involved in homocysteine detoxification. Elevated levels of homocysteine are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (1Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar), neural tube defects (2Mills J.L. McPartlin J.M. Kirke P.N. Lee Y.J. Conle M.R. Weir D.G. Lancet. 1995; 345: 149-151Abstract PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), and Alzheimer's disease (3Clarke R. Smith A.D. Jobst K.A. Refsum H. Sutton L. Ueland P.M. Arch. Neurol. 1998; 55: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). It is estimated that up to 40% of the general population at risk for heart diseases may have elevated levels of homocysteine. Despite these significant statistics, our understanding of homocysteine regulation and how nutrients (viz. vitamins) can modulate flux of homocysteine through competing pathways is poor. Of the three vitamins important for homocysteine metabolism, B12 has the most limited distribution in nature; it is biosynthesized by some bacteria and is absent from the plant kingdom. In humans, it supports the activities of two known enzymes, the cytoplasmic methionine synthase (MS) 1The abbreviations used are: MS, methionine synthase; UTR, untranslated region; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; H4folate, tetrahydrofolate. 1The abbreviations used are: MS, methionine synthase; UTR, untranslated region; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; H4folate, tetrahydrofolate. and the mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (4Kolhouse J.F. Allen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Mellman I.S. Youngdahl-Turner P. Huntington F.W. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MS is a housekeeping enzyme that plays an essential function, and knockout of this gene in mice results in embryonic lethality in the homozygous state (6Swanson D.A. Liu M.L. Baker P.J. Garrett L. Stitzel M. Wu J. Harris M. Banerjee R. Shane B. Brody L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The ability of vitamin B12 added to the cell culture medium to activate MS was first reported more than three decades ago (7Mangum J.H. North J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Mangum J.H. Murray B.K. North J.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3496-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize that in these studies cells were exposed to B12 supplementation after having been cultured in “normal” rather than B12-depleted media. Thus, the induction of MS activity by B12 was elicited by vitamin supplementation rather than a transition from B12-deplete to B12-replete medium. Although the molecular basis for this induction was not described, it was suggested that it resulted from conversion of apoenzyme to holoenzyme in the presence of exogenous B12 (9Kamely D. Littlefield J.W. Erbe R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More recently, we have published evidence that ruled out apoenzyme to holoenzyme conversion as a plausible mechanism for B12-induced activation of MS and demonstrated that although the steady-state levels of mRNA were unaffected, the MS protein levels increased 2–3-fold (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results ruled out transcriptional regulation and suggested that the B12 effect may be exerted at a translational level. In principle, the effect of B12 at a posttranscriptional level could occur by enhanced mRNA or protein stability or by increased translational efficiency. This study was designed to distinguish between these possibilities and to determine whether modulation of MS translation efficiency by B12 is mediated by an element in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA. The physiological relevance of B12-dependent gene regulation was demonstrated by the observation that B12 supplementation resulted in enhanced flux of homocysteine through the MS-dependent transmethylation pathway in cultured cells. Materials—Eagle's minimum essential medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, hydroxocobalamin, puromycin, actinomycin D, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and anti-rabbit IgG (alkaline phosphatase conjugate) were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. 293 cells (transformed human epithelial kidney cells) and HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma) were from American Type Culture Collection. COS-1 (monkey kidney fibroblast) cells were obtained from Dr. Charles Wood at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE. Restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen or New England Biolabs. [14CH3]H4folate (barium salt, 57 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture Conditions—Cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. B12 derived from fetal bovine serum is present at an estimated final concentration of ∼125 pm in this medium (9Kamely D. Littlefield J.W. Erbe R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For B12 induction studies, the cells were grown to 60–80% confluency, and fresh Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5 mg/liter hydroxocobalamin (or 3.6 μm final concentration) was added. For Western and Northern analyses of MS and for the luciferase reporter studies, cells were harvested from 100-mm plates. [14CH3]H4folate incorporation was examined in cells grown in 60-mm plates. Protein and mRNA turnover experiments were performed in the presence of puromycin and actinomycin, respectively (at final concentrations of 10 μg/ml each), added to the cell culture medium. Western Blot Analysis of MS—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The bands were quantitated by densitometry using NIH image software. To ensure equal loading, the membranes were also probed with an antibodies against Propionibacterium shermanii methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Northern Blot Analysis of MS mRNA—Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and Northern blots were performed as described previously (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The membrane was then exposed to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at–70 °C and developed, and the bands were quantified by densitometry using NIH image software. The band intensities were normalized versus 18 S ribosomal RNA in the same samples. Polysome Analysis—Polysome analysis was performed essentially as described (11Savant-Bhonsale S. Cleveland D.W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1927-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, four 100-mm dishes of COS-1 cells at subconfluent density were used for each polysome distribution analysis. Cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, removed using a cell scraper, and lysed in polysome lysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 units/ml RNasin (Promega). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded onto each 15–50% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient. Gradients were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor, and fractions were collected with an ISCO model 640 density gradient fractionator (ISCO, Inc. Lincoln, NE). Total RNA from each fraction was extracted with phenol/chloroform and reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the SuperScriptTM kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was obtained using gene-specific primers. For MS, a fragment of 340 bases from the 5′-UTR was amplified. For methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a fragment encompassing the coding sequence was amplified. Products of the reverse transcription-PCR reactions were separated on agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Control experiments were conducted to ensure that the reverse transcription-PCR reactions were in the linear range of amplification by examining the dependence of the product intensity on the number of amplification cycles. Based on this analysis, 25 and 30 cycles of amplification were employed with the MS and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase primers, respectively. The bands were quantified by densitometry using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software. Three independent experiments were performed. Luciferase and CAT Reporter Constructs—A clone containing the 5′-UTR of MS was generously provided by Dr. Barry Shane (University of California, Berkeley). To follow the effects of the 5′-UTR of MS on a downstream reporter gene, the full-length 5′-UTR of MS or the second half (bases 173–394) were cloned upstream of the luciferase- or CAT-coding regions in the pGL3 or pCAT3-Promoter vectors (Promega), respectively. Pairs of primers for amplification of the full-length 5′-UTR of MS and for the first and second halves of the 5′-UTR of MS were designed as follows: full-length 5′-UTR sense primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTAAAGGTTCTAAAT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CATGCCATGGTTGTCGAGTCTC-3′; first half of 5′-UTR antisense primer, 5′-CATGCCATGGGACCCCGAAAGCCCGCAGCG-3′, and second half of 5′-UTR sense primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCAGCAGTTGCCGCGCCCAG-3′. HindIII and NcoI restriction sites were engineered into the 5′ and the 3′ primers, respectively. After PCR amplification, the DNA fragments were directly cloned into the HindIII/NcoI sites of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega) so that the MS 5′-UTR was followed by the luciferase start codon. The only difference was a cytosine inserted between the MS 5′-UTR and the luciferase start codon that resulted from the creation of the NcoI site. The pGL3 promoter vector contains an SV40 promoter close to the HindIII site so that 20 bases are added upstream of the MS 5′-UTR in the resulting reporter gene transcript. All PCR reactions were performed using the high fidelity Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) to minimize the risk of introducing unwanted mutations. The sequences of all the constructs were verified by nucleotide sequence determination at the Center for Biotechnology Core Facility (University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE). All the clones had a single base difference (a G instead of A at position 161) as compared with the reported MS 5′-UTR in Gen-BankTM (accession number U73338). Deletion constructs containing 340, 270, 140, and 70 bases of the 5′-UTR of MS were generated by PCR and cloned into the pGL3-Promoter vector using the HindIII/NcoI sites. For PCR amplification of these fragments, the antisense primer described above was used. The sense primers were designed as follows: fragment 54–394, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTGCCGGTTTTCTCTTGGGTC-3′; fragment 124–394, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTAGGCCGACACCAAGGACT-3′; fragment 173–394, 5′-CCCAAGCTTAGCCAACGGCAGGCGTCAAA-3′; fragment 254–394, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTGGCCGTCGTCACCTGTGG-3′. To determine the effects of the 5′-UTR on a second reporter, the full-length 5′-UTR of MS (bases 1–394) and the second half (bases 173–394) were subcloned into the pCAT3-Promoter vector (Promega) using the same cloning strategy described above for the luciferase reporter construct. Transient Transfection and Reporter Assays—Transfection was performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) for 293 cells or the GeneJammer (Stratagene) for HepG2 and COS-1 cells. Briefly, 15–20 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 80–100 μl of transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications, and the mixture was added to 100-mm plates. 24 h after transfection, B12 was added to half of the plates. At the end of the incubation, two-thirds of each plate were scraped, and cells were centrifuged and saved for total RNA isolation. The remaining one-third of the cells were lysed using the protocol supplied with the luciferase assay system (Promega). The luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (average of three readings). CAT activity was measured according to the vendor's protocol (Promega). Both luciferase and CAT activities were normalized to total protein concentration in each sample. To account for differences in transfection efficiency (and therefore transcription) between plates, the luciferase and CAT activities were additionally normalized to luciferase and CAT mRNA levels, respectively, as determined by Northern blot analysis. Northern Blot Analysis of Luciferase and CAT mRNA—Total RNA was isolated using the RNAqueaous kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and Northern blots were performed as described previously (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled probes consisting of a DNA fragment encompassing the entire luciferase or CAT open reading frame were purified and labeled with random primers using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified by densitometry using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software. The band intensities were normalized to the 18 S ribosomal RNA band in each sample to correct for variations in loading quantities. Measurement of [14CH3]-H4folate Incorporation into Proteins—Cells were grown to 60–80% confluency on 60-mm plates, and B12 (5 mg/liter) was added to half of the plates for 24 h. After B12 induction, incorporation of [14CH3]-H4folate into proteins was measured as previously described (12Danishpajooh I.O. Gudi T. Chen Y. Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27296-27303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine-deficient media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and supplemented with 100 μm homocysteine and 9 μm folic acid). 5 μCi of [14CH3]-H4folate (Amersham Biosciences, 57 mCi/mmol; final medium concentration, 53 μm) was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. 100 μl from each sample was set aside for protein concentration determination. The remaining suspension was centrifuged, and proteins were precipitated with 500 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 20 min, heated at 80 °C for 30 min, and then cooled on ice for 30 min. The protein precipitate was washed 3 times with 5% trichloroacetic acid and then suspended in 200 μl of 3 m NaOH, and the amount of radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The radioactive content was normalized to total protein concentration in each sample. Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (Microcal Origin software), and results were considered significant if the p value was <0.05. Each of the methods employed in this study, viz. densitometric analysis of Western and Northern blots and luciferase reporter assays, have errors that are inherently associated with them, which renders measurement of 2-fold effects of the kind reported in this study challenging. However, it should be noted that in all cases we have examined the relative effect of the variable, i.e. B12 supplementation, on experiments run in parallel in unsupplemented media. Effect of B12on MS mRNA Stability—The influence of B12 on MS mRNA stability was assessed in 293 cells treated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. The relative steady-state MS mRNA levels were followed by Northern blot analysis as shown in Fig. 1. Two messages corresponding in size to ∼7 and 10 kb are seen in all human tissues that have been examined so far (13Li Y.N. Gulati S. Baker P.J. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Kruger W.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our results show that rate of MS mRNA turnover is unaffected by B12 supplementation of the medium and that the half-life of the message is ≈19 h. These results indicate the B12 induction of MS activity is not exerted at the level of increased mRNA stability. Effect of B12on MS Stability—It is not uncommon for protein stability to be enhanced by the binding of its cofactor, and in fact rat MS has been shown to be stabilized by B12 (14Yamada K. Kawata T. Wada M. Isshiki T. Onoda J. Kawanishi T. Kunou A. Tadokoro T. Tobimatsu T. Maekawa A. Toraya T. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1894-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine whether B12 supplementation affected the steady-state turnover of MS, we examined the relative levels of this protein by Western blot analysis in 293 cells treated with the translation inhibitor puromycin (Fig. 2A). The turnover rate of MS in the presence and absence of exogenous B12 was the same (half-life ≈12 h) within experimental error excluding a role for B12 in modulating MS stability under these conditions (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with our earlier observations that MS is present predominantly (>80%) in the holoenzyme form in 293 cells grown in the presence of normal Eagle's minimum essential medium (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, we have reported that the relative proportion of the holoenzyme form is unchanged under conditions of B12 supplementation, although the enzyme activity is increased 2.5-fold under these conditions (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Effect of B12on MS Polysomes—We analyzed the influence of B12 on translation of MS by examining the polysomal association of mRNAs in the presence and absence of B12. As shown in Fig. 3, B12 supplementation elicits a 2.5–3-fold increase in the amplitude of MS polysomes and a corresponding decrease in the proportion of MS mRNA associated with the ribonucleoprotein fraction. These results are consistent with activation of MS translation by B12 supplementation. The magnitude of the increase in MS polysomes is consistent with the previously reported 3.8-fold increase in MS activity induced by B12 in COS-1 cells (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As a control, the distribution of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, whose activity is not affected by B12 supplementation, was determined under the same conditions. The amplitude of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase message in the polysomes and ribonucleoprotein pools was unchanged, revealing a specific effect of B12 supplementation on MS mRNA. Changes in the polysome density (i.e. number of ribosomes per mRNA) or amplitude (i.e. number of actively translated mRNAs) are diagnostic of the status of translation from a given message. Activation of protein synthesis can occur via increased recruitment of ribosomes to the mRNA being translated. Alternatively, activation can result due to an increase in the number of mRNA molecules undergoing translation due to a shift in the equilibrium between the inactive (translation suppressed, ribonucleoprotein) and active (translation active, polysome) pools (15Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 1-31Google Scholar). Role of the 5′-UTR in Mediating B12-dependent Increase in Translational Efficiency—The potential role of B12 in increasing the translational efficiency of MS mRNA was probed with two reporter gene assays. The 5′-UTR of the MS mRNA was chosen for these initial studies because it is unusually long (394 bases) and displays a high potential for formation of secondary structures, suggestive of a role in regulation of translation. Reporter constructs were initially generated with either the full-length leader sequence or with the second half (173–394 bases) of the 5′-UTR inserted upstream of the luciferase or CAT reporter gene (Fig. 4). The respective vectors lacking the 5′ MS-UTR served as one set of controls. Both the full-length 5′-UTR of MS and the second half increased translation of the heterologous reporter gene as assessed by the ratio of the activity of the reporter to its own mRNA levels. The presence of the full-length 5′-UTR of MS between the SV40 promoter and the luciferase open reading frame increased the translational efficiency of luciferase in 293 cells ∼7-fold, whereas the presence of the second half of the 5′-UTR increased translational efficiency ∼2-fold as compared with the pGL3-Promoter vector alone (not shown). The increase in reporter activity upon insertion of the 5′ MS-UTR could be due to the presence of other regulatory elements in this region, including two upstream open reading frames and the possible existence of an internal ribosome entry sequence element affording cap-independent translation initiation. 2S. Oltean and R. Banerjee, unpublished results. The roles of these elements in regulating MS translation and their interactions with B12 are under investigation in our laboratory. To determine whether the B12 effect could be observed in the reporter assays and to exclude a cell-specific response, luciferase activity was determined after transient transfection in two cells lines, HepG2 and 293, 24 h after exposure to B12 (or an equivalent volume of medium in controls). To account for variations in transfection efficiency, the luciferase activities were normalized to the luciferase mRNA levels determined by Northern blot analysis, and equal loading of RNA was confirmed by quantitation of the 18 S rRNA in these samples (Fig. 4). In both 293 (Fig. 4A) and HepG2 (not shown) cells, the presence of B12 induced an increase in luciferase activity with the full-length and second half of the leader sequence. Similarly, in COS-1 cells, a 1.2- and 2.9-fold enhancement of CAT reporter activity was observed with B12 when the full length and the second half of the 5′-UTR respectively, were present (Fig. 4B). In all three cell lines the increase in reporter activity induced by B12 was lower than the increase in MS activity (2.5-, 3.8-, and 13.7-fold increase in 293, COS-1, and HepG2 cells, respectively) reported previously (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The difference may be attributed to the use of transient transfections in which the full extent of induction is missed or to the boundaries of the B12-responsive element extending beyond those of the 5′ leader used in the present constructs or to long distance interactions with elements that are missing in the reporter constructs. These will be explored in future investigations. Localization of B12-responsive Element—A set of nested deletions extending from the 3′ end of the 5′-UTR were constructed, and their ability to confer responsiveness to B12 in the luciferase reporter construct was tested in COS-1 cells (Fig. 5). With each deletion construct, the luciferase activity was compared in the presence and absence of B12 supplementation to the medium. These experiments localized the B12-responsive element to a 70-bp region extending from the 3′ end of the 5′-UTR. It is interesting to note that deletion of the upstream sequences in the 5′-UTR resulted in a small increase in the magnitude of the B12 effect, as seen in the constructs starting from bp 254 and 324. B12Supplementation Enhances Flux Through the Transmethylation Pathway—The effect of B12-induced increase in MS levels on the flux of homocysteine through the transmethylation pathway was examined by measuring incorporation of [14CH3]-H4folate into proteins. CH3-H4folate is a substrate for only one known enzyme, B12-dependent MS, which transfers the methyl group to homocysteine to give methionine (Fig. 6A). B12 supplementation resulted in a 2–3.5-fold increase in incorporation of radiolabel into proteins in HepG2 and 293 cell lines (Fig. 6B). Three other B12 forms, cyano-, deoxyadenosyl- and methylcobalamin, were equally efficacious in eliciting enhanced flux through the MS-dependent transmethylation pathway (not shown). These results support a physiological relevance for the role of B12 supplementation in increasing flux through the transmethylation pathway and, therefore, in intracellular homocysteine clearance. Translational regulation affords a relatively rapid response to external stimuli, bypassing the steps of transcription, splicing, and translocation. This mode of regulation can lead to both global and selective control of gene expression. Well studied examples of global control include changes that occur in eggs immediately after fertilization and in reticulocytes in response to heme levels. Specific translational control may be achieved by one of a variety of mechanisms including (i) autoregulation via binding of the encoded protein to its mRNA as in thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase (16Chu E. Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Drake J.C. Chabner B.A. EWlwood P.C. Zinn S. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8977-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 17Chu E.

Maley F. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) or a redox-sensitive protein that binds to a translational enhancer in the 3′-UTR of manganese superoxide dismutase (20Fazzone H. Wangner A. Clerch L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or (iii) by a short upstream open reading frame in the 5′-UTR as in ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases (21Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The response of human MS mRNA to the presence of a nutritional cofactor, B12, appears to be a novel example of specific translational control, since the other B12 enzyme found in humans, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, is unaffected (10Gulati S.

The results reported here rule out a role for B12 in influencing the rate of MS mRNA or protein turnover (Figs. 1 and 2), and together with our earlier results, which excluded conversion of preexisting apoenzyme to holoenzyme as a plausible mechanism (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), implicate translational regulation. This model is further supported by a B12-induced increase in the amplitude of MS mRNA polysomes with a corresponding decrease in the ribonucleoprotein fraction, which suggests alleviation of translational inhibition or “unmasking” of existing MS mRNAs by the cofactor. The human MS mRNA is >7 kb long with a 3.8-kb open reading frame that is hemmed in by a 394-base-long 5′-UTR and an ∼3-kb-long 3′-UTR (13Li Y.N. Gulati S. Baker P.J. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Kruger W.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Chen L.H. Liu M.-L. Hwang H.-Y. Chen L.-S. Korenberg J. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3628-3634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In general, long 5′-UTRs exceeding the average length of 100–140 nucleotides and exhibiting the potential for stable secondary structure formation are deemed to be important in translational regulation. These considerations guided our decision to initially focus on interrogating the role, if any, of the 5′-UTR in modulating the response of human MS mRNA to B12. The extent of translational modulation by the cofactor is modest and varies between 2- and 3-fold in most cell lines that we have tested (10Gulati S. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and leads to an up-regulation rather than repression, which is more commonly observed in examples of translational control of gene expression. Luciferase and CAT reporter constructs implicate the importance of sequences in the 3′ end of the 5′-UTR in modulating the B12 response (Fig. 4). This stretch of the human MS mRNA is predicted to form extensive secondary structures (Fig. 7). The ∼2–3-fold enhancement of MS translational efficiency by B12, albeit modest, is not unexpected for MS, which is a housekeeping enzyme. In another folate cycle enzyme, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, ferritin was reported to increase translation efficiency 1.14–2.16-fold in reporter constructs containing the 5′-UTR (24Oppenheim E.W. Adelman C. Liu X. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19855-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The magnitude of changes for most genes involved in energy metabolism and biosynthesis appears to be ∼2-fold, as revealed by a global analysis of gene profiles associated with aging (23Lee C.-K. Klopp R.G. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Recent reports reveal inhibition of translation of genomic RNA in the hepatitis C virus by vitamin B12 (25Lott W.B. Takyar S.S. Tuppen J. Crawford D.H. Harrison M. Sloots T.P. Gowans E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4916-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Toe-printing studies reveal that the vitamin stalls initiation by trapping the 80 S ribosomal complexes on the internal ribosome entry site element (26Takyar S.S. Gowans E.J. Lott W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Translational regulation by B12 has also been documented in prokaryotes, where it represses the btuB gene involved in B12 transport in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and the cob biosynthesis operon in S. typhimurium (for review, see Ref. 27Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation observed with the human gene, the bacterial response is specific for adenosylcobalamin and represents classic feedback regulation for both the transport and synthesis pathways when exogenous B12 levels are high. The proposed model involves long range interactions between a translational enhancer in the 5′-UTR and the region preceding the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which promotes initiation in the absence of B12 (28Ravnum S. Andersson D.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the presence of B12, the conserved “B12 box” interacts with the translational enhancer, relieving the long distance interactions and promoting secondary structure formation in the region encompassing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, thereby inhibiting initiation. Adenosylcobalamin has been shown to specifically inhibit ribosome binding to the btuB RNA (29Nou X. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7190-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A similar mode of regulation has been proposed for other bacterial vitamin biosynthesis genes including thiamin (30Miranda-Rios J. Navarro M. Soberon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9736-9741Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and riboflavin (31Gelfand M.S. Mironov A.A. Jomantas J. Kozlov Y.I. Perumov D.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Regulatory proteins that bind to adenosylcobalamin have not been identified in prokaryotes despite intensive efforts, raising the possibility that elements in the mRNAs are the direct sensors of this nutrient. Although this issue has not yet been explored in the eukaryotic system reported in this study, it is interesting to note that RNA aptamers selected for very high and specific binding of cyanocobalamin are known (32Lorsch J.R. Szostak J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The structure of one of these aptamers has revealed the basis of the specificity that underlies the high affinity (Kd = 90 nm) and represents one of the tightest aptamer-small molecule interactions that has been characterized (32Lorsch J.R. Szostak J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although the existence of B12-induced translational repression in prokaryotes can be rationalized from the standpoint of metabolic economy, the advantage of translational up-regulation in mammals is less obvious. One possibility is that the availability of B12 has been limited through much of our evolutionary history, a problem exacerbated by the absence of this vitamin from the plant kingdom. MS is an essential gene, as evidenced by the embryonic lethal phenotype of MS null mice (6Swanson D.A. Liu M.L. Baker P.J. Garrett L. Stitzel M. Wu J. Harris M. Banerjee R. Shane B. Brody L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and is absolutely dependent on B12 for its activity. The B12-independent MS found in some bacteria and in plants is absent in mammals. It is striking that the known B12-binding proteins and B12-dependent enzymes found in mammals bind their cofactor avidly, in contrast to many prokaryotic enzymes such as glutamate mutase (33Chen H.P. Marsh E.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7884-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, one of the tightest protein-ligand interactions that have been measured is for chicken haptocorrin, which displays a binding constant for B12 of 1016m–1 (34Marchaj A. Jacobsen D.W. Savon S.R. Brown K.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 11640-11646Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is possible then that translational up-regulation of MS by B12 represents an evolutionary adaptation for rapid and efficient sequestration of a rare nutrient, since increased steady-state levels of MS would lead to increased intracellular B12 concentrations. The demonstration that B12 added to cells grown in normal medium leads to enhanced flux through the transmethylation pathway suggests a beneficial role for B12 supplementation. The increased incorporation of radioactivity from [14CH3]-H4folate to proteins (Fig. 6B) in B12-supplemented medium suggests the potential value of such an intervention in homocysteine-lowering clinical trials by a molecular mechanism that has previously not been recognized."

Progesterone triggers activation of M-phase promoting factor (MPF) or Cdc2-cyclin B complex and neosynthesis of Mos kinase, responsible for MAPK activation. Both Cdc2 and MAPK activities are required for the success of meiotic maturation. However, the signaling pathway induced by progesterone and leading to MPF activation is poorly understood, and most of the targets of both Cdc2 and MAPK in the oocyte remain to be determined. Aurora-A is a Ser/Thr kinase involved in separation of centrosomes and in spindle assembly during mitosis. It has been proposed that in Xenopus oocytes Aurora-A could be an early component of the progesterone-transduction pathway, acting through the regulation of Mos synthesis upstream Cdc2 activation. We addressed here the question of Aurora-A regulation during meiotic maturation by using new in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches. We demonstrate that Cdc2 kinase activity is necessary and sufficient to trigger both Aurora-A phosphorylation and kinase activation in Xenopus oocyte. In contrast, these events are independent of the Mos/MAPK pathway. Aurora-A is phosphorylated in vivo at least on three residues that regulate differentially its kinase activity. Therefore, Aurora-A is under the control of Cdc2 in the Xenopus oocyte and could be involved in meiotic spindle establishment.

Amphibian oocyte meiotic maturation is a pioneer model system to study an unconventional post-transcriptional pathway induced by a steroid hormone, progesterone, and the regulation of M-phase promoting factor (MPF) 1The abbreviations used are: MPF, M-phase promoting factor; Cdc, cell division cycle; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PP, protein phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHX, cycloheximide; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; OA, okadaic acid; WT, wild type. or Cdc2-cyclin B complex, the universal inducer of mitotic and meiotic divisions (1Karaiskou A. Dupre A. Haccard O. Jessus C. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes are arrested in prophase of the first meiotic division, assimilated to the G2 arrest of the cell cycle. When stimulated by progesterone, they resume meiotic division through the activation of MPF. The signaling pathway induced by progesterone and leading to MPF activation is not well understood (1Karaiskou A. Dupre A. Haccard O. Jessus C. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It involves a drop in cAMP, induced within minutes after progesterone addition, leading to the inhibition of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase A (2Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase A down-regulation could stimulate the synthesis of new proteins, a process required to activate Cdc2-cyclin B complex (3Jessus C. Ozon R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106A: 431-448Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The identification of the one or more proteins whose synthesis is needed for Cdc2 activation represents a major challenge. Mos kinase is synthesized and activated simultaneously with that of MPF activation and indirectly induces MAPK activation (4Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). It has been recently proposed that Mos synthesis and MAPK activation are not required to induce Cdc2-cyclin B activation in Xenopus oocyte; however, they most probably facilitate this process (5Dupre A. Jessus C. Ozon R. Haccard O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Fisher D.L. Brassac T. Galas S. Doree M.

Thus, one or more other proteins, not identified yet, must be synthesized in response to progesterone to allow Cdc2-cyclin B activation. Recently, the Aurora kinases emerged as a new family of mitotic Ser/Thr kinases conserved from yeast to humans (8Chan C.S. Botstein D.

The vertebrate Aurora family is composed of three members, termed Aurora-A, -B, and -C (14Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Aurora-A localizes to the centrosomes and the spindle poles during mitosis (11Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. LeGuellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ablation or inactivation of Aurora-A in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos and mammalian culture cells prevents centrosome maturation and spindle assembly, showing a role of Aurora-A in centrosome separation and bipolar establishment of the spindle (9Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 15Dutertre S. Descamps S. Prigent C.

It has also been demonstrated that, in Xenopus, one substrate of Aurora-A could be the kinesin-related motor Eg5, involved in centrosome separation (17Giet R. Uzbekov R. Cubizolles F. Le Guellec K. Prigent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15005-15013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Given the regulation of spindle function by Aurora-A (11Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. LeGuellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it could be proposed that this kinase plays a role downstream MPF activation in the oocyte, as described in human mitotic cell lines (19Marumoto T. Hirota T. Morisaki T. Kunitoku N. Zhang D. Ichikawa Y. Sasayama T. Kuninaka S. Mimori T. Tamaki N. Kimura M. Okano Y. Saya H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Xenopus Aurora-A has been cloned and originally termed “Eg2” in a screen designed to identify mRNAs that are polyadenylated during meiotic maturation and dead-enylated at fertilization (11Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. LeGuellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Paris J. Le Guellec R. Couturier A.

Legagneux V. Roghi C. Bassez T. Osborne H.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Aurora-A protein accumulates during meiotic maturation, in response to progesterone independently of MPF activation, but its kinase activity would be under the control of MPF (22Frank-Vaillant M. Haccard O. Thibier C. Ozon R. Arlot-Bonnemains Y. Prigent C. Jessus C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of Aurora-A by microinjection of a specific antibody in Xenopus oocytes neither affects nuclear envelope breakdown (GVBD, for germinal vesicle breakdown) nor Cdc2 activation. However, oocytes arrest in metaphase I without extruding the first polar body (23Castro A. Mandart E. Lorca T. Galas S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2236-2241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This suggests again that Aurora-A functions downstream of MPF activation and controls the meiotic spindle. However, Andrésson and Ruderman (24Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) cloned Aurora-A cDNA using a screen designed to identify oocyte proteins whose electrophoretic migration is retarded within 30 min after progesterone stimulation. Moreover, they reported that Aurora-A overexpression accelerates GVBD in response to progesterone (24Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It was then shown in Xenopus oocyte that Aurora-A phosphorylates and regulates CPEB, a protein that binds the CPE sequence present in the 3′ non-coding region of several mRNAs, including Mos mRNA, and allows their transduction (25Mendez R. Hake L.E. Andresson T. Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Richter J.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Therefore, Aurora-A could be an early component of the progesterone pathway stimulating Mos synthesis upstream of Cdc2 activation. Because the Mos/MAPK pathway appears to be dispensable for Cdc2 activation (5Dupre A. Jessus C. Ozon R. Haccard O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Fisher D.L. Brassac T. Galas S. Doree M. Development. 1999; 126: 4537-4546PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it is difficult to assume that the physiological function of Aurora-A would be restricted to Cdc2 activation. Whether Aurora-A functions upstream or downstream of Cdc2 is important to further understand the regulation of the meiotic process. In this study, we addressed two main questions. First, is Aurora-A kinase activation physiologically controlled by MPF, or by the Mos/MAPK pathway, or by an upstream regulator of MPF? Second, what is the molecular basis of this activation? Several reports have shown that Aurora-A activation correlates with the phosphorylation of several of its residues (26Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of these phosphorylations remains unclear. Some of them could target the protein to the degradation pathway, others could play a docking function, while a third category could function as activators (19Marumoto T. Hirota T. Morisaki T. Kunitoku N. Zhang D. Ichikawa Y. Sasayama T. Kuninaka S. Mimori T. Tamaki N. Kimura M. Okano Y. Saya H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 27Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2274-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To answer these questions, we took advantage of a new in vitro substrate, histone H3, that allowed us to assay Aurora-A kinase activity in a reliable manner. We demonstrate that, in vivo during oocyte maturation as well as in vitro using prophase cytosolic extracts, active MPF is necessary and sufficient to induce Aurora-A phosphorylation and activation, independently of the Mos/MAPK pathway. Material—Xenopus laevis adult females (Horst Kähler, Germany) were bred and maintained under laboratory conditions. Reagents, unless otherwise specified, were from Sigma. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The 21 N-terminal amino acids of either wild type histone H3 (WT H3) or histone H3 mutant where Ser10 was replaced by Ala (S10A H3) fused with GST were cloned into pGEX vector (28Scrittori L.

Oocytes were injected with various proteins: recombinant GST-p21cip1 at 40 ng per oocyte, recombinant Cdc25A at 25 ng per oocyte, sea urchin cyclin B at 5 ng per oocyte, okadaic acid at 5 × 10–6m intracellular concentration, and morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (Gene Tools LLC) raised against c-Mos mRNA at 100 ng per oocyte (5Dupre A. Jessus C. Ozon R. Haccard O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Oocytes were also incubated in the presence of various reagents: 1 μm progesterone, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), or 50 μm U0126 (Promega). GVBD was monitored by the appearance of a white spot at the animal pole. Oocytes were referred as to “metaphase II-arrested oocytes” when they were collected at least 2 h after GVBD. Activation of metaphase II-arrested oocytes was induced by electric shock (33Karsenti E. Newport J. Hubble R. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1730-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Oocytes were collected by groups of 10 or 20, and lysed at 4 °C in 4 volumes of EB (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340) and 1 μm okadaic acid (ICN). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min and frozen at –80 °C. Western blot analysis and kinase activity assays were then performed by using the same lysate. In Vitro Extracts—Xenopus prophase oocyte lysates prepared in the absence of okadaic acid were incubated at 30 °C in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 80 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2) and either 1 μm okadaic acid (ICN) or 4 μg/ml recombinant Cdc25A. Samples were collected at indicated times for Western blot analysis and kinase assays. Western Blotting—Samples equivalent to two oocytes were electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE Anderson system (34Anderson C.W. Baum P.R. Gesteland R.F. J.

The mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the active phosphorylated form of MAPK, P-MAPK, was purchased from New England BioLabs. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against ERK1 and Xenopus Mos protein were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies.

Kinase Assays and Phosphatase Treatment—To measure Cdc2 kinase activity, histone H1 assays were performed on p13suc1 Sepharose pull-down extracts (three oocytes equivalent) in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), 100 μm ATP and 0.2 mg/ml histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Histone H3 kinase activity of Aurora-A was assayed in immunoprecipitates, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of kinase buffer containing 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), 50 μm ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml of either WT H3 or S10A H3. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and boiling. After electrophoresis and autoradiography, the bands corresponding to histone H1 and histone H3 were excised, and the associated radioactivity was measured in a Wallac 1409 scintillation counter. Phosphatase treatments were carried out in Aurora-A immunoprecipitates, incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of 2000 units of λ phosphatase (New England BioLabs). Biochemical Characterization of Aurora-A Kinase Activity— To study the regulation of Aurora-A kinase activity, a reproducible kinase assay was developed. MBP and casein are often used to assay Aurora-A kinase activity in vitro (12Gopalan G. Chan C.S. Donovan P.J. J.

However, the activity of Xenopus oocyte Aurora-A kinase toward both substrates is low, rendering the quantification of the kinase activity difficult. It is established that Aurora-B phosphorylates in vivo histone H3 on a single residue, Ser10 (40Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Given the high homology between the kinase domains of Aurora-A and Aurora-B, we checked whether histone H3 could be an in vitro substrate of Xenopus Aurora-A. Aurora-A was immunoprecipitated from metaphase II-arrested oocytes that have been reported to contain active Aurora-A kinase (22Frank-Vaillant M. Haccard O. Thibier C. Ozon R. Arlot-Bonnemains Y. Prigent C. Jessus C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The kinase activity was measured in immunoprecipitates using the 21 N-terminal amino acids of histone H3 (ARTKQTARKS10TGGKAPRKQLC) fused with a GST tag, as substrate. As a control, we used a mutated histone H3, where Ser10, the unique residue in H3 phosphorylated by Aurora-B, was replaced by Ala (S10A H3). This S10A H3-peptide was never phosphorylated under our conditions. To determine the optimal conditions for the kinase assay, H3-peptide phosphorylation was measured in the presence of various ATP concentrations (from 10 μm to 1 mm) or various histone H3-peptide concentrations (from 2.5 to 500 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 30 min (Fig. 1). The Km for ATP and histone H3-peptide were, respectively, 80 μm and 35 μg/ml (Fig. 1). These values are comparable to those reported for the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase (75 μm for ATP and 40 μg/ml for histone H1 (41Erikson E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19577-19582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Aurora-A Is Activated at GVBD Time during Meiotic Maturation—To investigate how Aurora-A is regulated during meiotic maturation, the activity of the protein was estimated, in parallel with its electrophoretic migration. Oocytes were collected at different times following progesterone stimulation (Fig. 2). As expected, MPF activity, measured by histone H1 kinase assay, increased just before GVBD, in correlation with cyclin B2 electrophoretic mobility retardation. Its activity decreased at the metaphase I-metaphase II transition and increased again, inducing entry into metaphase II. MAPK activity was estimated by Western blot, using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated active form of the protein. As already reported, MAPK was stably activated at time of GVBD, due to Mos synthesis, until the end of the maturation process (Fig. 2A). Aurora-A kinase activity was similarly measured during meiotic maturation using histone H3-peptide as substrate (Fig. 2B). In prophase-arrested oocytes and until GVBD, Aurora-A was inactive and migrated as a single band (Fig. 2). At GVBD time, Aurora-A accumulated, as previously reported (22Frank-Vaillant M. Haccard O. Thibier C. Ozon R. Arlot-Bonnemains Y. Prigent C. Jessus C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and underwent an electrophoretic shift, leading to a doublet, in correlation with its kinase activation (Fig. 2). In this experiment, the level of Aurora-A activity increased continuously from GVBD until the arrest in metaphase II. In some cases, Aurora-A kinase activity is maximal at GVBD time and is maintained at a high level until metaphase II (see Figs. 4, 8, and 10 below).Fig. 4Aurora-A kinase activation depends on cAMP and on protein synthesis during Xenopus oocyte meiotic maturation. Prophase oocytes were incubated in the presence (+) or in the absence (–) of cycloheximide (CHX)or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) for 1 h and then stimulated by progesterone (Pg). Oocytes were collected at the indicated times after progesterone addition and homogenized. In control oocytes, GVBD started 4 h after progesterone addition. Lysates were subjected to Western blot with anti-cyclin B2 antibody, anti-Aurora-A antibody, or anti-phospho-MAPK (P-MAPK) antibody, as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were performed in the same lysates with anti-Aurora-A antibody and assayed for Aurora-A kinase activity using histone H3-peptide as substrate.

Prophase oocytes were incubated in the presence of progesterone, and oocytes were collected either in prophase (Pro), at GVBD, or 2 h after GVBD (GVBD+2h). A, GVBD oocytes were either immediately homogenized, incubated in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), or injected with p21cip1 and collected 2 h later. Lysates were subjected to Western blot with anti-cyclin B2 antibody, anti-Aurora-A antibody, or anti-phospho-MAPK (P-MAPK) antibody, as indicated, or immunoprecipitated with anti-Aurora-A antibody and assayed for Aurora-A kinase activity using histone H3-peptide as substrate.

Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Aurora-A antibody and incubated (+) or not (–) in the presence of λ phosphatase (PPλ) for 1 h at 30 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then assayed for Aurora-A kinase activity using histone H3-peptide as substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Metaphase II oocytes were parthenogenetically activated by electric shock. This treatment inactivated MPF within 10 min, due to cyclin B2 degradation (Fig. 2). Mos was degraded 30 min after activation, and consequently, MAPK was inactivated at the same time (Fig. 2A). When oocytes re-entered interphase in response to activation, the upper band of Aurora-A partially disappeared, in correlation with a drop in its kinase activity (Fig. 2). The H3 Kinase Activity of Aurora-A Depends on Its Phosphorylation—We next addressed the question whether Aurora-A activation results from its phosphorylation, as suggested by the electrophoretic retardation that correlates with the active form of the H3 kinase activity. Active Aurora-A kinase was immunoprecipitated from metaphase II-arrested oocytes and incubated in the presence of phosphatase λ (PPλ), that exhibits a broad range of specificity. PPλ treatment abolished Aurora-A activity, whereas heat-inactivated PPλ had no effect (Fig. 3A). The electrophoretic migration of Aurora-A was further analyzed in immunoprecipitates that allow a better resolution than crude extracts. Active Aurora-A migrated as a doublet when metaphase II oocyte extracts were loaded on a gel (see Fig. 2A). The active kinase isolated by immunoprecipitation migrated under three bands (Fig. 3B). The lower band migrated at the same level as the inactive prophase form (Fig. 3B). PPλ treatment induced the disappearance of the upper band, a decrease in the middle band, and the enrichment of the lower band (Fig. 3B). These observations indicate that Aurora-A is activated by phosphorylation and that at least two residues of Aurora-A are phosphorylated in metaphase II-arrested oocytes, resulting in the electrophoretic retardation of the protein. Aurora-A Phosphorylation and Activation Are under the Control of cAMP and Protein Synthesis—Aurora-A phosphorylation and H3 kinase activation take place in response to progesterone at GVBD time. It is well established that progesterone induces an early drop in cAMP and the synthesis of new proteins, both events being required"
https://openalex.org/W2055237966,"Cation channel gating may occur either at or below the inner vestibule entrance or at the selectivity filter. To differentiate these possibilities in inward rectifier (Kir) channels, we examined cysteine accessibility in the ATP-gated Kir6.2 channel. MTSEA and MTSET both block channels and modify M2 cysteines with identical voltage dependence. If entry is restricted to open channels, modification rates will slow in ATP-closed channels, but because the reagent can be trapped in the pore following brief openings, this may not be apparent until open probability is extremely low (<0.01). When these conditions are met, modification does slow significantly, indicating gated access and highlighting an important caveat for interpretation of MTS-accessibility measurements: reagent ""trapping"" in nominally ""closed"" channels may obscure gated access."
https://openalex.org/W2050974949,"The expression of gadA and gadB, which encode two glutamate decarboxylases (GADs) of Escherichia coli, is induced by an acidic environment and participate in acid resistance. In this study, we constructed a polyamine-deficient mutant and investigated the role of polyamines in acid resistance. The expression of gadA and gadB was shown to be dependent on polyamines. For that reason, the polyamine-deficient mutant was completely devoid of GAD activity and was very susceptible to low pH if large amounts of polyamines were not provided. We also showed that the polyamine-deficient mutant contained higher cAMP levels than the isogenic polyamine-proficient wild type, and cAMP negatively regulated the expression of gadA and gadB. Therefore, introduction of the cya (encoding adenylate cyclase) mutation allele into the polyamine-deficient mutant resulted in the increment of GAD activity and thus restored the reduced acid resistance of the mutant. The positive regulators, H-NS (histone-like protein, encoded by the hns gene) and RpoS (alternative RNA polymerase σ subunit, encoded by rpoS gene), also significantly governed the expression of gadA and gadB, respectively. However, polyamines did not regulate either the intracellular H-NS level or rpoS expression under these culture conditions. These results strongly suggest that there are at least two different regulatory systems in acid resistance, one is positive regulation via a H-NS/RpoS system and the other is negative regulation via a polyamine/cAMP system.

Escherichia coli maintains its internal pH between 7.4 and 7.8 during aerobic growth under an external pH of 5.0–9.0 (33Zilberstein D. Agmon V. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 246-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms of pH homeostasis remain elusive (19Lambert L.A. Abshire K. Blankenhorn D. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to survive in an acidic environment is essential for successful colonization of the mammalian host by both commensal and pathogenic enteric bacteria (26Tramonti A. Visca P. De Canio M. Falconi M. De Biase D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2603-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In order to survive in the mammalian host, commensal and pathogenic bacteria must have specific mechanisms that can overcome the deleterious effect of the acidic environment, because these microorganisms are faced with acidic shock (pH < 2.5) during their passage through the stomach (26Tramonti A. Visca P. De Canio M. Falconi M. De Biase D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2603-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Numerous strategies including amino acid decarboxylase-based systems are necessary to enable them to combat this acidic stress (11Foster J.W. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses.

EC 4.1.1.15) system has been extensively studied because of its major role in the acid resistance of enteric pathogens such as E. coli O157, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria monocytogenes (6Castanie-Cornet M.P.

E. coli contains two genes, gadA and gadB (mapped at 78 and 33 min on its chromosome), which encode two biochemically indistinguishable forms of GAD and are very similar in sequence (2Blattner F.R.

Sequential reaction through GAD and the putative glutamate/GABA antiporter encoded by the gadC gene allows cells to remove intracellular protons (8De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The expression of gad genes is induced at the stationary phase under normal aerobic conditions and positively responds to acidic, hyper-, and hypo-osmotic shocks (8De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The extent of gadA and gadB expression can be differentiated depending on the culture conditions, and both the stationary phase and acidic pH activate distinct regulatory circuits (8De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Two distinct regulatory proteins, H-NS (histone-like protein, encoded by hns) and RpoS (alternative RNA polymerase σ subunit, encoded by rpoS), are known to be involved in the regulation of gadA and gadB expression. The expression of gadA and gadB is negatively regulated by H-NS during the exponential growth phase, while stationary phase induction of gadA and gadB expression requires sigma factor RpoS (sigma S) (5Castanie-Cornet M-P. Foster J.W. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Castanie-Cornet M.P. Penfound T.A. Smith D. Elliott J.F. Foster J.W. J.

The present work was undertaken to identify the environmental and regulatory factors affecting the expression of gad genes in E. coli. Some evidence that polyamine is essential for the normal expression of gad genes. It is suggested that both H-NS and RpoS are “positively” involved in gad expression as transcriptional regulators. We also suggest that the polyamine/cAMP system as well as the H-NS/RpoS system plays an important part in acid resistance through the regulation of the intracellular cAMP concentration by polyamines. Finally, the possible regulatory circuits for acid resistance via a GAD system are presented. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains used in this study are shown in Table I. All strains are E. coli K-12 MG1655 [λ-, rph-] derivatives. To construct a polyamine-deficient mutant strain, Δ(speA-speB) and Δ(speC-glc) mutations were simultaneously transduced into QC2461 with selection of the linked galP::Tn10 as described by Minton et al. (22Minton K.W. Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2851-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the polyamine concentrations of the strain were determined (Table II). A total of 41 of 172 transductants did not grow in a minimal M9 medium containing 10 mm glycolic acid as a sole carbon source, and only 3 of them grew normally when supplemented with putrescine or spermidine (co-transduction frequency was about 1.74%, see Ref. 12Hafner E.W.

The polyamine concentrations of those 3 strains were determined, and one of the resultant polyamine-deficient mutant strains was designated as JIL585. To construct a Tc-s derivative (JIL601) of JIL585, a fusaric acid selection method was carried out as described by Maloy and Nunn (20Maloy S.R. Nunn W.D. J.

Open table in a new tab The gad::lacZ fusions and various mutations were introduced into strains of interest using P1-mediated transduction (21Miller J.H. Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). In vivo recombination between a plasmid carrying rpoS742::lacZ transcription fusion and λRZ5 was used to transfer the fusion to bacteriophage lambda. λ(rpoS742::lacZ) was produced by growing λRZ5 on the strain carrying plasmid pRL45. The resultant lysate was used to infect JIL601, and desirable lysogen was selected as a blue colony on a lactose (0.4%) minimal medium with 20 μg/ml 5-bromo-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. To transduce cya (encoding adenylate cyclase) mutation allele in the gadA or gadB::lacZ fusion strain (both cya and gadA::lacZ or gadB::lacZ fusion have the kanamycin-resistant gene), transductants were isolated in LB containing phosphomycin (30 μg/ml) as previously described (27Tsuruoka T. Miyata A. Yamada Y. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The addition of cAMP restored sensitivity to the phosphomycin. Cells were grown in an LB (Bacto tryptone, 10 g; Bacto yeast extract, 5 g; NaCl, 10 g per liter) broth or a minimal M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose as a carbon source. Thiamine (1 μm) was added to all minimal M9 medium used in this study. Overnight cultures grown in LB were washed and diluted to an initial OD600 of 0.01 in a minimal M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose as the sole carbon source and cultivated again overnight. These overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.01 in the same fresh medium and incubated for the times indicated. Kanamycin (km), tetracycline (Tc), ampicillin (amp), and chloramphenicol (cm) were added to the medium when needed, to reach final concentrations of 75 μg/ml, 20 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml, and 30 μg/ml, respectively. Tryptophan was added at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml for the growth of strains containing the gad::lacZ fusion. Measurement of Polyamine Contents—Putrescine and spermidine concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (15Hwang D.-F. Chang S.-H. Shiua C.-Y. Chai T.-J. J. Chromatogr. 1997; 693: 23-29Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The stationary phase-grown cultures (1 × 1010 cells) were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4), resuspended in 5% perchloric acid, vigorously vortexed, and then allowed to stand on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred into a new tube, and half of the volume of 2 n NaOH was added, followed by 4 μl of benzoyl chloride. They were mixed and allowed to stand at 30 °C for 40 min. Adding saturated NaCl stopped the benzoylation, and the mixture was extracted with 2 volumes of diethyl ether. After separation by centrifugation, the upper layer was transferred into a new tube and dried in a stream of nitrogen. For analysis of polyamines, a Waters liquid chromatograph (Waters 2690, Waters Co.) equipped with a photodiode array detector (Waters 996, Waters Co.) set at 225 nm was applied. A symmetry C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Waters Co.) was used for the separation; the injection volume was 20 μl, and the gradient program proceeded from 50–85% methanol. The flow rate was 0.9 ml/min, and spermine was used as an internal standard. cAMP Determination—Intracellular cAMP concentrations were determined using a cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (Assay Design Inc.). Cells grown overnight in LB were washed with a minimal M9 medium and subcultured to an initial OD600 of 0.01 in a minimal M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose and cultivated for 24 h. Cells were then harvested, washed, and resuspended to equal cell densities (1 × 1010) in 0.9% NaCl. cAMP concentrations of cells boiled for 10 min at 100 °C were determined following the manufacturer's recommendation. The cAMP concentrations were calculated from the typical standard curves, and the detectable range was 0.2–19.8 pmol/ml. β-Galactosidase Activity Assay—At the end of the growth period, an aliquot of each culture was transferred to new tubes containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol (final concentrations) and prechilled on ice. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by monitoring the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as described by Miller and expressed as Miller units (21Miller J.H. Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Results were confirmed by at least two or three independent experiments. GAD Activity Assay—Cells grown for 24 h in a minimal M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose were harvested, washed with 0.9% NaCl, and resuspended to equal cell densities (5 × 1010 cells/ml) in the same solution. A GAD activity assay was carried out using GAD reagent with some modifications (23Rice E.W. Johnson C.H. Dunnigan M.E. Reasoner D.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 4347-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GAD reagent consisted of1gof l-glutamic acid, 0.05 g of bromcresol green (colorimetric indicator), 90 g of NaCl, and 3 ml of Triton X-100 per liter. An aliquot of cells (5 × 109 cells) was transferred to a test tube, and 1 ml of GAD reagent was added, mixed immediately, and allowed to vortex vigorously for 30 s. The tubes were then incubated in a 35 °C water bath, and the change in pH was measured after 1 h. Western Blot Analysis—Strains were grown in a minimal M9 medium containing glucose. At the stationary phase, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Protein extract was separated on to a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. After transferring the proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes, the proteins were revealed using primary antibody (rabbit anti-H-NS, kindly supplied by Dr. E. Bremer; see Ref. 10Dersch P. Schmidt K. Bremer E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit antibody), and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (4Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Measurement of Acid Survival Rate—Strains were grown in a minimal M9 medium containing glucose with and without polyamines (1 mm) until they entered the stationary phase. After 24 h of cultivation, the cells were harvested and resuspended in a PBS buffer (pH 7.0). Two aliquots of cells (each 1 × 108 cells per ml) were transferred to new tubes and adjusted to a 1-ml final volume using PBS buffer (pH 2.5 and 7.0, respectively). The mixtures were incubated for 1 h in a 37 °C water bath. Cells were serially diluted with PBS (pH 7.0), and viable cells were counted on a LB agar plate. Deficiency of GAD Activity Caused by the Genetic Inactivation of Both gadA and gadB Genes Causes Elevated Sensitivity under Low pH—Despite the importance of GAD under acidic conditions, no gadA/gadB double mutant phenotypes have been reported to date. We constructed a gadA/gadB double mutant in the polyamine-synthesizing wild-type background to investigate the role of GAD on normal cell growth. While each single mutant showed a normal growth pattern, the gadA/gadB double mutant showed a decreased growth rate (∼70% of the level of the wild type) in a medium containing glucose as the carbon source (Fig. 1A). We also assayed GAD activity of the wild type and gadA and/or gadB mutant by investigating the pH variation. Each single mutant containing either gadA or gadB mutation represented approximately half the activity of total GAD, and the gadA/gadB double mutant was completely devoid of GAD activity, indicating that GadA and GadB comprise the whole GAD activity (Fig. 1, B and C). When decarboxylation occurs, the pH of the GAD reagent progressively increases, causing the indicator color to change from yellow to green (23Rice E.W. Johnson C.H. Dunnigan M.E. Reasoner D.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 4347-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type containing normal gadA and gadB genes showed a green color with time, but the gadA/gadB double mutant sustained its yellow color. As might be expected, the single mutant in either gadA or gadB gene, showed mixed colors of green and yellow. It is well known that GAD is needed for survival under low pH (6Castanie-Cornet M.P. Penfound T.A. Smith D. Elliott J.F. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3525-3535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hersh B.M. Farooq F.T. Barstad D.N. Blankenhorn D.L. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3978-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We compared acid resistance under an extreme acidic environment (pH 2.5) in the wild-type and gadA and/or gadB mutants. The wild type showed higher levels of acid resistance than the gadA or gadB single mutant and the gadA/gadB double mutant. Complete deficiency of GAD activity in the gadA/gadB double mutant showed a great sensitivity to low pH (Fig. 1D). Polyamines Are Necessary to Keep Normal GAD Activity and Acid Resistance through the Induction of gadA and gadB Expression under Normal Aerobic Conditions—To investigate the expression patterns of gadA and gadB with growth time in the presence or absence of polyamines, we measured the β-galactosidase activities of both genes under normal aerobic conditions in a minimal M9 medium containing glucose as the carbon source. We identified that a polyamine-deficient mutant showed growth reduction if polyamines were not provided (Fig. 2A). While the gadA expression was not significantly induced in the absence of polyamines, exogenous supplementation of polyamines restored gadA expression to the wild-type level (Fig. 2B). As well as gadA, the gadB expression was induced at an extremely low level in the absence of polyamines and greatly induced by the supplementation of polyamines (Fig. 2C). The above results indicate that polyamines are definitely required for the induction of both genes (gadA and gadB) in a minimal M9 medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source, even under normal aerobic conditions. gadA and gadB expression has been induced at the stationary phase in previous studies (8De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and we confirmed those results. Based upon the above results, we directly measured GAD activities of the wild-type and the polyamine-deficient mutant type in the presence or absence of polyamines. While GAD activity was normal in the wild type, the polyamine-deficient mutant failed to show normal activity (Fig. 2D). GAD activity in the mutant was dramatically increased by exogenous supplementation of putrescine or spermidine. The polyamine-synthesizing wild type showed a green color with time, but the polyamine-deficient mutant grown in the absence of polyamines sustained its yellow color. The color changed dramatically from yellow to green with the addition of polyamines to the polyamine-deficient mutant strain, indicating that polyamines are essential for the maintenance of GAD activity (Fig. 2E). Because a polyamine-deficient mutant is devoid of GAD activity as described above, we anticipated that a low environmental pH could lead to a severe deleterious effect on the polyamine-deficient mutant. Based upon the induction pattern of gad expression under normal aerobic conditions, we prepared stationary phase cells of the polyamine-deficient mutant and its isogenic polyamine-synthesizing wild type. Compared with the wild type, the mutant is at least 4,000 times more susceptible to an environmental pH of 2.5. However, exogenous supplementation of polyamines dramatically relieved the increased cytotoxicity by the acid-induced stress in the mutant (Fig. 2F). Regulation of gad Expression by Polyamine/cAMP System—A regulatory mechanism via the action of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) has been suggested, in which CRP acts as a negative regulator for gad expression (5Castanie-Cornet M-P. Foster J.W. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We tried to suggest a characteristic polyamine-induced regulatory circuit in acid resistance, investigating the role of cAMP in the induction of gad expression and the modulation of the cAMP level by polyamines. A cya mutant showed increased gadA and gadB expression, indicating that cAMP acts as a negative regulator for gad induction (Fig. 3A). GAD activity in the cya mutant was also visualized by applying a GAD reagent compared with its isogenic wild type (Fig. 3B). The cya mutant showed a dark green color, suggesting that the cya mutant contains higher GAD activity. To reveal the relationship between cAMP and polyamines in acid resistance, we measured the intracellular cAMP level in the presence or absence of polyamines. Interestingly, the polyamine-deficient mutant strain contains a 4 times higher level of cAMP than the polyamine-synthesizing wild type, and polyamine supplementation to the polyamine-deficient mutant also decreased the intracellular cAMP concentration to the wild-type level (Fig. 3C). To investigate whether the polyamines cause the reduction of the intracellular cAMP level and this decreased cAMP induces gad induction, we examined gadA and gadB expression in a cya mutant background (Fig. 3D, left panel). The introduction of a cya mutation allele in a polyamine-deficient mutant elevated gad expression even if polyamines were not exogenously provided. The cya mutation also recovered its cytotoxicity shown in the polyamine-deficient mutant under pH 2.5 (Fig. 3D, right panel). These results strongly suggest that the polyamine signal enabling normal induction of gad expression and acid resistance resulted from the reduction of the intracellular cAMP level, acting as a negative regulator for gad induction and acid resistance. Independent Regulation of gad Expression by H-NS/RpoS and Polyamine/cAMP Systems—Previous studies have suggested that two regulatory proteins, H-NS and RpoS, are involved in the regulation of gadA and gadB transcription. H-NS negatively regulates the expression of gad genes in the exponential phase, while alternative sigma factor RpoS positively regulates them in the stationary phase (5Castanie-Cornet M-P. Foster J.W. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Castanie-Cornet M.P. Penfound T.A. Smith D. Elliott J.F. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3525-3535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bossa F. Visca P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Because gadA and gadB expression are induced in the stationary phase, we investigated their regulation by H-NS and RpoS in the stationary phase. Genetic inactivation of hns led to absolute repression of both gadA and gadB expression, indicating that H-NS acts as a positive regulator for gad induction in the stationary phase, unlike the previous results showing that H-NS acts as a negative regulator in the exponential growth phase (Fig. 4A). RpoS, another known regulator, was partially involved in gadA or gadB expression. An rpoS mutant also showed decreased gad expression, indicating that RpoS also acts as a positive regulator (See also Fig. 4A). While RpoS partially r"

Signal transduction from G protein-coupled receptors is regulated by the cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ). Upon binding of an extracellular ligand, the activated receptor acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, catalyzing the release of GDP and subsequent binding of GTP to the Gα subunit, which promotes the heterotrimeric G protein to dissociate into Gα-GTP and a Gβγ subunit complex. Both Gα-GTP and the tightly associated Gβγ can modulate the activity of effector enzymes or ion channels until the GTP is hydrolyzed and the inactive Gαβγ heterotrimer is reformed. Control of the duration of the active state of the pathway takes place on several levels. One critical family of proteins involved in this regulation is the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) 1The abbreviations used are: RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; YFP, yellow fluorescence protein; CFP, cyan fluorescence proteins; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. proteins, which act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) to accelerate GTP hydrolysis on Gα subunits. All RGS proteins have an ∼120-amino acid RGS domain, which binds to Gα subunits and stimulates their GTPase activity (1Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many RGS proteins contain additional domains involved in other proteins-protein interactions as well. One such subfamily of RGS proteins, consisting of RGS6, -7, -9, and -11, contains a unique G protein γ-like domain and exists as an obligatory heterodimer with the G protein subunit Gβ5 (4Snow B.E.

Although the majority of RGS proteins have been shown to be GAPs, some RGS proteins can also act via non-GAP mechanisms. For example, although RGS4 and GAIP can both act as GAPs for Gαq, they also regulate signal transduction by blocking effector binding (12Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl.

Additionally, RGS12 and RGS14 contain a unique motif that binds to Gα-GDP and acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (14Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M. De Vries L. Trends Biochem.

With the exception of the Gβ5L·RGS9 complex in photoreceptors, which has been demonstrated to be a GAP for transducin in vivo (9Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Using in vitro GAP assays, it was shown that Gβ5·RGS7 acts exclusively on the Gαo subunit, and not on Gαq or even Gαi (16Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol.

Here, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study direct protein-protein interactions between RGS7 and Gα subunits in living cells. Constructs for FRET—For FRET experiments, murine Gβ5 was subcloned into pEYFP-C1 and bovine RGS7 into both pEYFP-C1 and pECFP-C1 (Clontech) using SalI and SacII restriction sites. Murine Gαq was PCR-amplified to incorporate HindIII and SacII restriction sites using the primers 5′-CTGAAGCTTCGATGACTCTGGAGTCCATCATG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCGCGGGACCAGATTGTACTCCTTCAGG-3′. Murine Gαo was PCR-amplified to incorporate EcoRI and SalI restriction sites using the primers 5′-CTGGAATTCCATGGGATGTACGCTGACC-3′ and 5′-CTGGTCGACAAGTACAAGCCGCAGCCC-3′. The resulting PCR fragments were then subcloned into pECFP-N1 using HindIII/SacII (GαqCFP-CT) for Gαq constructs and EcoRI/SalI (GαoCFP-CT) for Gαo constructs. Additionally, a plasmid encoding GαqCFP-M, in which CFP along with an SGGGS spacer was inserted between residues 124 and 125 of murine Gαq, was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Devreotes. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Glutamax-1 and Earle's salts (Invitrogen) supplemented with nonessential amino acids (1%), fetal calf serum (10%), and gentamycin (0.5%). CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum with penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere (95% O2, 5% CO2, 37 °C) with the culture medium replaced every third day and were passaged when they reached ∼80% confluence. For single cell imaging, cells were plated onto 25-mm borosilicate glass coverslips coated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine (Sigma). After 2 days in culture, cells were transfected with the relevant DNA using Genejuice (Calbiochem) at a ratio of 3:1 (μl of Genejuice:μg of DNA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested or used for imaging 24 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation—Transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells were lysed 24 h after transfection and extracted with 1% Triton X-100. The supernatant after centrifugation (100,000 × g) was immunoprecipitated using anti-RGS7 antibodies as described previously (11Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Detection of YFP and CFP fusion proteins was achieved using a polyclonal antibody #8372–2 from Clontech (1:10,000 dilution). Confocal Imaging and Calcium Recordings—Cells on coverslips were loaded with fluo-3 in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (10 mm Hepes, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 1.18 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 4.69 mm KCl, 118 mm NaCl, 1.29 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.4) by incubation with fluo-3 AM (2 μm, prepared in anhydrous Me2SO) for 45 min at 20 °C followed by a further 45-min incubation in Krebs-Henseleit buffer to allow de-esterification of the indicator. Cells on coverslips were then mounted onto the stage of an Olympus IX50 inverted microscope and maintained at 37 °C. Measurement of [Ca2+]i was performed as follows. Fluo-3 fluorescence was monitored using an Olympus FV500 or PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultraview confocal microscope with images captured every second. On-line analysis was carried out using Fluoview software provided by the manufacturer with raw fluorescence data exported to Microsoft Excel and expressed as fluo-3 fluorescence/basal fluo-3 fluorescence for each cell. Traces represent the average fluo-3 fluorescence recordings made from at least 10 transfected and 10 untransfected cells per coverslip and are representative of data obtained from at least six coverslips. RGS7-CFP-transfected cells were identified before calcium imaging, and the resultant calcium signals were compared between transfected and untransfected cells from the same field of view. FRET Spectroscopy—CHO-K1 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates as described earlier using a total of 8 μg of DNA. For RGS7 fusions, 4 μg of DNA was used for each plate, and for all other constructs (except YFP or CFP alone) 2 μg of DNA was used. For YFP or CFP alone, 0.5 μg of DNA was used for transfection. In all cases, lacZ was used as a carrier DNA to bring the total amount up to 8 μg. FRET spectroscopy was performed similar to previous experiments done in yeast (19Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To accurately measure FRET, each experiment required four types of cells. First, untransfected cells are needed to account for the background autofluorescence. Also, the YFP and CFP fusion proteins need to be expressed alone. Finally, the YFP and CFP fusions must be co-transfected. The cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection by washing twice with PBS and then gently scraped from the plate using 1 ml of PBS and stored on ice. Using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments), the cells were initially diluted to 2 ml, and the fluorescence spectra of the samples were recorded. First, the emission spectrum of untransfected cells from 450 to 550 nm was recorded upon excitation at 433 nm (CFP emission). Second, the cells containing YFP alone were scanned at 433 nm. The same kinds of cells were also scanned from 500 to 550 nm upon excitation at 488 nm (YFP emission). Next, the cells containing both the CFP and YFP fusions were scanned at both CFP and YFP emission. Last, the cells containing CFP only were scanned at CFP emission. To accurately measure changes in FRET between the samples, the amount of total CFP in the CFP only and the CFP + YFP cells was normalized. To achieve this, either the CFP alone or the CFP + YFP cells were diluted and rescanned until the fluorescence of the CFP peak at ∼480-nm emission was identical between the samples. In most cases, only slight dilutions with PBS were needed to achieve this normalization. After acquisition of the spectra, the data was transferred to a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) for further analysis. Mathematical manipulation of the spectral data was performed by initially subtracting the spectra acquired via excitation at 433 nm of the untransfected cells from the CFP alone and CFP + YFP emission spectra. Second, the CFP alone spectrum was subtracted from the CFP + YFP spectrum. To determine the amount of fluorescence due to background excitation of YFP, the spectra of YFP alone and the CFP + YFP pair at YFP emission were normalized. This normalization factor was then applied to the CFP + YFP trace. Subsequently, this trace and the YFP-alone trace were zeroed at 480 nm by adding or subtracting a constant to the entire trace. The resulting traces were then compared with the analysis of the final FRET data. FRET Microscopy—CHO cells were transfected as described earlier in 6-well plates containing a square glass coverslip (18-mm length, 0.15-mm thick). A total of 1 μg of DNA was used for each transfection. For RGS7·Gβ5 FRET, 0.5 μg of RGS7-YFP and 0.5 μg of Gβ5-CFP was used. For transfections with Gα, 0.4 μg of RGS7-YFP, 0.4 μg of GαCFP, and 0.2 μg of Gβ5 was used. Cells were washed twice with PBS 24 h after transfection and then fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then three times with water before being mounted onto slides using ProLong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). All imaging was performed using a fluorescence imaging work station consisting of a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope equipped with a 60× oil objective lens, cooled charge-coupled device CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics), z-step motor, dual filter wheels, and a Xenon 175-W light source, all controlled by MetaMorph 5.0r2 software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Filter sets used were YFP (excitation, 500/20 nm; emission, 535/30 nm), CFP (excitation, 436/20 nm; emission, 480/40 nm), and FRET (excitation, 436/20 nm; emission, 535/30 nm) along with an 86004BS dichroic mirror (all from Chroma Technology Corp.). To assay for FRET, cells of low to moderate expression of both YFP and CFP fusion proteins were selected. First, the cell was imaged with the FRET and CFP filters using an exposure time to produce significant, but non-saturating fluorescence of each representative pixel within the cell. For lower expressing cells, 2 × 2 binning was used to increase the sensitivity of the camera. Next, the cell was imaged for YFP, again making sure to obtain a non-saturating level of fluorescence. After YFP imaging, the field was then photobleached using YFP excitation light. Fluorescence was monitored live until the YFP signal was undetectable using the identical conditions as used to visualize YFP before bleaching. Immediately after photobleaching, FRET and CFP images of the same field were captured using identical parameters as used to obtain these images before photobleaching. After acquisition of the images, the data was interpreted by comparing the CFP levels before and after YFP photobleaching (20Siegel R.M. Chan F.K. Zacharias D.A. Swofford R. Holmes K.L. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/38/pl1)PubMed Google Scholar, 21Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). FRET was identified as an increase in CFP fluorescence after photobleaching due to the inability of the photobleached YFP to accept emission from CFP. Simply, the CFP image obtained after photobleaching was subtracted by the CFP image before photobleaching. Because the amount of energy transferred from CFP to YFP represents a small portion of the overall CFP energy, the change in intensity is quite subtle. Thus, for representing the subtracted image, the scale on which the subtracted image is displayed had to be adjusted to 20% of the original scale. Fluorescent Gβ5 and RGS7 Fusion Proteins Behave Similarly to Wild Type—We and others have previously shown that the RGS7·Gβ5 dimer can modulate G protein signaling, but a direct protein-protein interaction between the dimer and Gα could not be detected using traditional biochemical techniques such as immunoprecipitation and pull-downs (4Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To test the interaction of the Gβ5·RGS7 dimer with Gα subunits in living cells, we prepared various YFP and CFP constructs of the proteins to enable the proteins to be used for FRET studies (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis showed that all the fusion proteins express at the predicted size (Fig. 1B). Before testing the ability of RGS7 to interact with Gα subunits in FRET studies, we established the functional activity of the RGS7 fluorescent fusion protein. First, co-immunoprecipitation experiments carried out with RGS7 and Gβ5 fusion proteins show that presence of YFP (or CFP) on either RGS7 or Gβ5 does not affect the ability of the proteins to dimerize (Fig. 1C). It should be noted that YFP and CFP differ only in a few amino acid mutations that allow for the differences in fluorescent properties between the proteins. Thus, localization and functionality of the CFP construct is assumed to be identical to the YFP fusion protein. Second, similarly to wild-type RGS7, RGS7CFP was able to inhibit muscarinic M3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2A). The addition of Gβ5 did not influence the ability of RGS7 to attenuate M3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ release in cells (Fig. 2, B and C). This is in apparent contrast to the previous report in which Gβ5 appeared to enhance RGS7 function (11Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In those experiments, however, Gβ5 had a profound effect on the level of RGS7, most likely via protein stabilization. Here, the addition of the fluorescent tag on RGS7 stabilizes the protein, and co-transfection with Gβ5 does not noticeably increase the levels of RGS7CFP (data not shown). Thus, these experiments likely are more truly representative of the effect of the Gβ5 moiety within the RGS7/Gβ5 dimer. Localization of Fusion Proteins in Cells—After transfection in HEK 293 cells, confocal microscopy was used to visualize CFP fusions of the proteins of interest. RGS7CFP was expressed primarily in the cytosol (Fig. 3A). In native tissue such as the brain a significant fraction of RGS7 is known to be associated with the membrane (10Zhang J.H. Simonds W.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2002; 15: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, in HEK 293 cells and other non-neuronal cell lines, we have observed cytosolic staining, consistent with the observation in Fig. 3A. The pattern of immunostaining of wild-type RGS7 transfected in CHO cells as well as endogenous RGS7 in PC12 cells was consistent with the distribution of the YFP-tagged RGS7 (data not shown). GαoCFP-CT was primarily associated with the membrane, suggesting that the presence of CFP did not affect the ability of Gαo to be myristoylated and associate with the membrane (Fig. 3C). In contrast, GαqCFP-CT was largely cytosolic (Fig. 3D). We reasoned that the location of tag on the C terminus must inhibit its ability to be properly targeted. To compare FRET between Gαo and Gαq, we needed to place the fluorescent tag in the same place in both constructs; thus, despite its improper targeting, we used this construct for FRET spectroscopy experiments. However, to show that the interaction also occurs with Gαq on the plasma membrane, we used a GαqCFP construct in which CFP is placed between the αB/αC loop of the Gαq helical domain, similar to that described by Hughes et al. (24Hughes T.E. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Expression of this construct in cells showed that GαqCFP was indeed localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3E). We found localization of the Gα fusion proteins to be highly dependent on the level of expression. Cells expressing low amounts of the fluorescent proteins localized on the plasma membrane, as shown in Figs. 3, C and E. However, many cells in the overall population overexpressed the protein to a larger extent, in which case the protein could be found throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown). Interaction between RGS7 and Gβ5 in Living Cells—To validate FRET as a viable technique to study G protein subunits and RGSs in transfected cells, we initially tested the established interaction between Gβ5 and RGS7. Fluorescence spectra of untransfected cells, cells expressing RGS7YFP, Gβ5CFP alone, and co-expressing both were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4A shows the raw data obtained from excitation at 433 nm. To correct for the inherent background fluorescence of cells, the spectrum from the untransfected cells was subtracted from the other traces (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, the Gβ5CFP trace was subtracted from the RGS7YFP + Gβ5CFP trace to correct for any CFP fluorescence in the cells containing both fluorophores (Fig. 4C). Next, to normalize the amount of acceptor (RGS7YFP) present between samples, the amount of YFP in each sample was determined by YFP emission upon excitation of the samples at 488 nm (Fig. 4D). This shows the total amount of YFP in the cells, and these values are normalized so all the curves overlap (Fig. 4E). The constant used for normalization obtained in Fig. 4E was then applied to the RGS7YFP + Gβ5CFP trace in Fig. 4C to obtain the final data (Fig. 4F). The final data show FRET occurring between RGS7 and Gβ5, as seen by the increase in YFP fluorescence at ∼528 nm in cells containing the CFP-YFP FRET pair. A negative control between RGS7YFP and CFP showed no nonspecific energy transfer from CFP to the RGS7YFP fusion (data not shown). In addition to spectroscopy, FRET was also visualized in individual cells using epifluorescence microscopy. In these assays, FRET was detected by comparing the overall CFP levels in cells before and after acceptor (YFP) photobleaching. CHO-K1 cells transfected with both RGS7YFP and Gβ5CFP and visualized using CFP and YFP filter sets are shown in Fig. 5. After photobleaching of RGS7YFP, an increase in Gβ5CFP fluorescence was observed, indicative of FRET occurring between the proteins, confirming again that the proteins interact in cells. RGS7 Directly Interacts with Gαqin Cells—The Gβ5·RGS7 dimer has been implicated in regulation of both Gαo- and Gαq-mediated signaling. To determine whether either of these proteins interacts directly with RGS7 in cells, FRET spectroscopy between RGS7 and Gα was performed. Because FRET is highly dependent on the distance of the donor and acceptor fluorophores, we used Gα proteins tagged in the same place (the C terminus) on the protein to accurately compare them to each other. FRET spectroscopy analyzing these interactions is shown in Fig. 6. FRET was more strongly detected between RGS7 and GαqCFP-CT than with GαoCFP-CT. This result indicates that RGS7 and Gαq are proximal enough to each other to undergo FRET, almost assuredly due to their direct interaction in cells. We also were unable to detect FRET spectra in cells with GαqCFP-M, apparently because it is localized only at the membrane (Fig. 3E) or because the middle position of the tag makes it a less sensitive probe. RGS proteins are generally considered to have the highest affinity for Gα proteins in the transition state of GTP hydrolysis, a state mimicked by the addition of aluminum-magnesium-fluoride (20 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm magnesium chloride, and 10 μm aluminum chloride). Surprisingly, the addition of aluminum-magnesium-fluoride did not alter the fluorescence spectra of any of the traces and, therefore, did not change the FRET signal between the two proteins (data not shown). We hypothesized that receptor-G protein coupling might be necessary for increased RGS affinity to Gα. To test this idea, we transfected the constructs into CHO cells stably expressing the muscarinic type 1 (CHO-M1) or type 4 receptor (CHO-M4) and measured FRET in the presence and absence of muscarinic agonist. However, no effect of receptor presence or activation was observed (data not shown). After the determination that Gαq directly interacts with RGS7 in cells based on spectroscopy, we investigated this interaction using microscopy. In cells that do not express overwhelmingly high amounts of proteins, GαqCFP-M is localized primarily on the plasma membrane, whereas RGS7YFP is localized throughout the cell. FRET between RGS7 and Gαq is observed essentially only on the plasma membrane (Fig. 7, A–F). Interestingly, in FRET experiments performed with GαqCFP-CT, FRET was detected throughout the cell, suggesting that membrane localization of Gαq is not required for the interaction with RGS7 (data not shown). It appeared that in cells with GαqCFP-CT the overall FRET signal was higher than in cells with GαqCFP-M, where it was membrane-delimited. Conversely, for the RGS7-Gαo interaction, no discernable FRET was observed (Fig. 7, G–L). The results of FRET microscopy confirm that RGS7 directly interacts with Gαq in cells. Function of Gβ5·RGS Complexes—The hallmark function of RGS proteins is to serve as GAPs for Gα subunits, and studies have been performed to analyze the GAP activity of Gβ5·RGS dimers. Using recombinant complexes of Gβ5 with full-length RGS6 and RGS7, Posner et al. (16Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) show that the GAP activity of Gβ5·RGS dimers was remarkably specific toward Gαo; activity toward even the closely related Gαi could not be detected (16Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In cell-based assays, the specificity of RGS7 seems to be compromised. Both the RGS domain of RGS7 (17DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K. Cockett M.I. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5780-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Shuey D.J. Betty M. Jones P.G. Khawaja X.Z. Cockett M.I. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) inhibit Gαq-mediated calcium mobilization in transfected cells, suggesting that RGS7 also acts on Gαq. This controversy between the GAP and cellular assays can be reconciled by two considerations. First, it is possible that Gβ5·RGS7 acts on Gαq via a non-GAP mechanism, similarly to that described for RGS4 and GAIP (12Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Second, the interaction of Gβ5·RGS7 with the G protein may require the presence of other components of the pathway, such as effector or receptor. It is known that the photoreceptor RGS protein, RGS9, acts as a GAP ∼5 times more effectively in the presence of the G protein effector γ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (9Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 25He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Similarly, GRK2 GAP activity is dependent on the presence of a G protein-coupled receptor (26Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Indeed, the recent comprehensive study by Hooks et al. (27Hooks S.B. Waldo G.L. Corbitt J. Bodor E.T. Krumins A.M. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10087-10093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) shows that in the presence of receptors incorporated into lipid vesicles, RGS7 and other G protein γ-like RGS proteins have activity to Gαi subunits as well as Gαo. Thus, the lack of RGS7 GAP activity toward Gαq could be due to the lack of effector, receptor, or other necessary components that are present in a cell. These arguments could also explain the lack of a detectable interaction of the Gβ5·RGS7 dimer with other proteins through pull-downs and co-immunoprecipitation, as signaling complexes could be disrupted upon cell lysis (4Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 11Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To study the possible interaction between the Gβ5·RGS7 dimer and Gα subunits in cells, we used FRET spectroscopy and microscopy. We found that Gβ5·RGS7 interacts directly with Gαq, supporting previous work of Gβ5·RGS7 inhibition of Gαq signaling. Our inability to detect the interaction between Gβ5·RGS7 and Gαo could be explained by the possibility that the orientation of the CFP tag on Gαo is too distal from the YFP tag on RGS7 to detect their interaction. Additionally, the Gβ5·RGS7 interaction with Gαo might be dependent upon phosphorylation and the subsequent binding of 14-3-3 to RGS7 (28Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B.

It is also possible that the high protein concentration required in the GAP assay could drive the interaction to occur in vitro (16Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and in transfected cells the protein concentration is not high enough. The Gβ5·RGS7 Interaction with GαqOccurs in a Resting Cell—According to the currently accepted model, Gα binds to RGS domains in the transition state of GTP hydrolysis. In our experiments, the Gαq-RGS7 interaction was observed in a resting cell, arguing that it occurs with GDP-bound Gαq. Although Gα-GDP is not typically the preferred state for interaction with RGS proteins, such interactions have been previously reported. Some RGS proteins have a TPR motif, which binds to Gα-GDP and acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (14Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Similarly, G protein γ-like-RGS proteins have the Gβ5/G protein γ-like moiety, which should structurally resemble Gβγ and bind Gα-GDP. On the other hand, binding of monomeric RGS7 in vitro to Gαo-GDP has been detected in a pull-down assay, where it was as high as 50% that in the presence of aluminum-magnesium-fluoride (5Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The interaction between Gβ5L·RGS9 and Gαt-GDP has also been shown (29Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Earlier surface plasmon resonance studies of RGS16 and Gαt revealed that in the presence of γ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase the affinity of RGS16 to Gαt-GDP-aluminum-magnesium-fluoride is only 2-fold higher than to Gαt-GDP (30Wieland T. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), also illustrating measurable interaction of some RGS proteins to Gα-GDP. Finally, constitutively active Gα subunits interact with RGS proteins, again suggesting that the transition state is not required for RGS binding (31Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In a yeast two-hybrid assay, the interaction of RGS-GAIP was equally potent with wild-type Gαi3 and constitutively active Gαi3 (34De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that the requirement for the transition state is not mandatory. The RGS7-Gαq interaction we observed in the resting cells may represent a low affinity interaction of RGS7 with the GDP-bound state of Gαq or a small fraction of Gαq bound to GTP due to basal receptor activity. Upon agonist stimulation we expected to see changes in the FRET signal due an increase proportion of GTP-bound G protein. Why did our FRET recordings not detect these changes? One possibility is that agonist-induced desensitization was so rapid (35Sibley D.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) that the change in the interaction between Gα and RGS7 occurs faster than we can record the FRET data. Another explanation is that receptor stimulation does affect the functional interaction between Gα and RGS7 but does not result in the change of the distance between the fluorophore groups, which is required for the change in FRET. This idea is consistent with a model in which the receptor, G protein, and RGS do not physically dissociate but, rather, go through a series of conformational changes while progressing through the functional cycle. Such a model helps explain the rapid kinetics of many G protein cascades and the sub-second time constant of RGS-Gα interactions (36Lan K.L. Zhong H. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). At this point it is not clear whether the dynamics of RGS-Gα binding was not detected due the technical limitations of CFP-YFP FRET method or due to the true properties of Gαq-Gβ5·RGS7 complex in cells. However, this work shows the feasibility of this approach for studying these proteins, and in accord with the previous data of RGS7 inhibition of Gαq-mediated calcium mobilization, indicates a direct protein-protein interaction between RGS7 and Gαq. We acknowledge Dr. Mark Overton (Washington University School of Medicine) for helpful insights into the use of FRET spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2011811279,"Neurogenin3 (ngn3) is a transcription factor that is essential for the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells. To investigate the signaling pathway that regulates ngn3 expression, we used AR42J-B13 cells as a model of the differentiation of pancreatic islets. In these cells, treatment with activin A and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induced the expression of ngn3. Reporter gene analysis using human ngn3 gene (NEUROG3) promoter fragments of various lengths identified the region between –402 and –327 bp of NEUROG3 as an activin A- and HGF-responsive DNA sequence. This DNA sequence normally functions as a repressor in AR42J-B13 cells, but treatment with activin A and HGF negates the repressor activity. Interestingly, function of the activin A- and HGF-responsive sequence was not influenced by the overexpression of the Smad inhibitory factor, Smad7. Instead, activin A and HGF activation was inhibited by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3), or by treatment with a p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580. Activin A and HGF function through the TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK pathway to relieve transcription repressors located between –402 and –326 bp on the NEUROG3 promoter, and consequently activate ngn3 expression and endocrine differentiation of AR42J-B13 cells.

During development, formation of the pancreas and its subsequent differentiation into various types of exocrine and endocrine cells are controlled by the activation and extinction of a large number of genes. The expression of these genes is regulated by a well-organized cascade of transcription factors (1Edlund H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 2Wilson M.E.

Lindsell C. Weinmaster G. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In mice, the pancreas forms from evaginated buds generated by fusion of the dorsal and ventral gut endoderm at the foregut/midgut junction on embryonic days 9.5–10.5. At this stage, most of the cells located in the buds have the potential to differentiate into any of the mature pancreatic cell types (6Edlund H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The signal pathway from Notch and notch ligand delta-like 1 participates in determination of the fate of cells in the exocrine pancreas (4Apelqvist A. Li H. Sommer L. Beatus P. Anderson D.J. Honjo T. Hrabe de Angelis M. Lendahl U. Edlund H. Nature. 1999; 400: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). It is believed that cells eluding those signals start to express ngn3 and become endocrine cells. However, expression of ngn3 is not observed after the cells begin to express pancreatic hormones like glucagon or insulin (5Jensen J. Heller R.S. Funder-Nielsen T. Pedersen E.E. Lindsell C. Weinmaster G. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 6Edlund H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of ngn3 is restricted to immature endocrine cells and is considered to be a marker of endocrine progenitor cells during development of the pancreas. Interestingly, ngn3 is not just a marker of endocrine progenitor cells. When targeted disruption of ngn3 was performed in mice, the animals failed to generate pancreatic endocrine cells and did not express most of the transcription factors that are essential for endocrine differentiation (7Gradwohl G. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Guillemot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Conversely, the overexpression of ngn3 in pancreatic bud cells promoted differentiation into endocrine cells (4Apelqvist A. Li H. Sommer L. Beatus P. Anderson D.J. Honjo T. Hrabe de Angelis M. Lendahl U. Edlund H. Nature. 1999; 400: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 5Jensen J. Heller R.S. Funder-Nielsen T. Pedersen E.E. Lindsell C. Weinmaster G. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that ngn3 is an essential and sufficient factor for the differentiation of endocrine cells. Thus, investigation of the mechanisms regulating the expression of ngn3 is important to better understand the process of endocrine cell differentiation and probably also to understand the process of β cell regeneration. In addition to the Notch-delta signaling pathway, several studies have suggested the importance of activins, which are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, in signaling for development of the pancreas (8Kim S.K. Hebrok M. Li E. Oh S.P. Schrewe H. Harmon E.B. Lee J.S. Melton D.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1866-1871PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shiozaki S. Tajima T. Zhang Y.Q. Furukawa M. Nakazato Y. Kojima I. Biochim.

Invest. 1998; 102: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activins have diverse actions in a variety of mammalian tissues, including the pancreas, at many stages during development. It was recently reported that activin receptor type II (ActRII) A+/–B–/– mice showed a severe reduction of insulin and glucagon expression, but only a slight reduction of carboxypeptidase A (a marker of exocrine pancreas), as early as embryonic day 13.5 (8Kim S.K. Hebrok M. Li E. Oh S.P. Schrewe H. Harmon E.B. Lee J.S. Melton D.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1866-1871PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that activin signals might be involved in determining the fate of cells in the pancreatic primordium, but the signaling pathways downstream of the activin receptor that are involved in the differentiation of endocrine cells have not been investigated. AR42J cells were originally derived from a chemically induced pancreatic tumor and possess both exocrine and neuroendocrine properties. Upon treatment with activin A, AR42J cells stop growing and start to extend neurites. In the presence of betacellulin or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plus activin A, the cells differentiate into insulin-expressing cells (11Mashima H. Ohnishi H. Wakabayashi K. Mine T. Miyagawa J. Hanafusa T. Seno M. Yamada H. Kojima I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, AR42J cells provide a model system for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in β cell differentiation. Probably reflecting the physiological differentiation process, activin A and HGF can also provoke the expression of ngn3 (12Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Kojima I. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which activin A and HGF induce the expression of ngn3 using AR42J-B13 cells as a model for the differentiation of pancreatic islets. Our data revealed that the TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3)-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathway regulates the function of a critical region on the human ngn3 gene (NEUROG3) promoter and changes the binding of various transcription factors to the region. Reporter Gene Constructs and Expression Plasmids—To generate reporter plasmids, fragments of the 5′ region of NEUROG3 obtained by restriction digestion or PCR using the pFOX Luc1 NEUROG3–5.7kb plasmid (13Lee J.C. Smith S.B. Watada H. Lin J. Scheel D. Wang J. Mirmira R.G. German M.S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) as a template were ligated upstream of the luciferase gene in pFOX Luc1 plasmids or upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter in pFOX Luc1TK plasmids (14Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the reporter gene constructs was performed using a Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. An expression plasmid for dominant-negative MKK6 (SRalpha-HA-MKK6AA) was kindly provided by Dr. E. Nishida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Expression plasmids for dominant-negative MKK3 (pCS2+DN MKK3) and dominant-negative MKK4 (pCS2+DN MKK4) were kindly provided by Dr. K. Sugiyama (Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim Co., Kawanishi, Japan) and Dr. M. Hibi (Center for Developmental Biology, RIKEN, Kobe, Japan). Expression plasmids for TAK1 (pCMV-HA-TAK1) and dominant-negative TAK1 (pCMV-HA-TAK1 (K63W)) were kindly provided by Dr. K. Matsumoto (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan). Cell Culture and Transfection—AR42J-B13 cells were cultured in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 20 mm HEPES, and 5 mm NaHCO3. To cause conversion into insulin-producing cells, we treat AR42J-B13 cells with 2 nmol/l activin A (a generous gift from Dr. A. Okano; Ajinomoto Co. Kawasaki, Japan) and 100 pmol/l HGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. βTC3 cells (a generous gift from Dr. D. Hanahan, University of California, San Francisco, CA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 15% horse serum. For reporter gene assays, cells were plated in six-well tissue culture plates at 24 h before transfection. AR42J-B13 cells, with or without exposure to activin A and HGF, were transfected with 1.8 μg of each luciferase reporter plasmid using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To assess the effect of the Smad- or MAPK-related signal pathways on the NEUROG3 promoter, we co-transfected 1 μg of each expression vector with 1.8 μg of the reporter gene vector. Controls for the experiments using dominant-negative expression vectors always contained equal amounts of the empty vector (pcDNA3). At 36 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and the luciferase assay was performed as described previously (15Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was standardized by the protein concentration, which was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). NIH3T3 cells and βTC3 cells were transfected with 1.8 μg of each luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of pRL-TK plasmid using Trans Fast transfection reagent (Promega, Tokyo, Japan). At 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for firefly luciferase activity, which was standardized by Renilla luciferase activity. All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate on at least three separate occasions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from AR42J-B13 cells seeded in 10-cm dishes were prepared according to the procedure described by Sadowki and Gilman (16Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences in the NEUROG3 promoter were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotide was purified on a column and annealed to an excess of the complementary strand. The EMSA buffers and electrophoresis conditions have been described previously (17Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Leung J. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34224-34230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One microliter of in vitro reaction mixture or 1 μg of nuclear extract were used for each 10-μl binding reaction. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radioactive bands were visualized using Fuji BAS2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The oligonucleotides used in these experiments are as follows. Region 1, 5′-CAA AGT CCC CTC CAG GAC AGA TGC TAA GGA AAG-3′; region 2, 5′-CTA AAT TTC CCC ATG TGT AAC GTG CAG GCA TTG-3′. Western Blot Analysis—AR42J-B13 cells seeded in 10-cm dishes were starved in serum-free medium with or without SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 1 h, followed by incubation with or without activin A and HGF stimulation for different periods of time. Then 30 μg of total cell extract prepared from these cells was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Tokyo, Japan), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the specific antibody (Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-MKK3/6, JNK, and phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling, Tokyo, Japan)). Bound primary antibodies were detected with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, and immunoreactivity was visualized by chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mapping the Activin A- and HGF-responsive DNA Sequence in the NEUROG3 Promoter—To analyze the activin A-responsive cis-element of the NEUROG3 promoter, we constructed a series of progressive 5′ deletions of the promoter (each extending +261 bp on the 3′-end) linked to the firefly luciferase gene and transfected these constructs into AR42J-B13 cells. It has been shown already that activin A plus HGF can induce the expression of ngn3 in this cell line (12Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Kojima I. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although HGF alone, but not activin A, induced a modest increase of NEUROG3 promoter activity, the addition of activin A plus HGF induces a marked increase of its activity (Fig. 1A). Similar activation was observed with the reporter gene constructs containing –2.6 kbp, –461 bp, and –402 bp NEUROG3 promoter fragments (Fig. 1B). However, deletion of the fragment between –402 and –327 bp caused an increase in basal NEUROG3 promoter activity and a loss of responsiveness to activin A and HGF. These findings demonstrated that the region between –402 and –327 bp functions as a repressor and that activin A and HGF can negate its repressor effect. To investigate whether the DNA sequence between –402 and –327 bp was sufficient to function as a repressor and an activin A- and HGF-responsive element, we investigated the promoter activity of reporter constructs containing the DNA fragment upstream of a heterologous promoter, the TK minimal promoter (Fig. 2). In every cell lines that we tested, this fragment acted as a repressor, but activin A- and HGF-responsive transactivation was not observed. These data suggest that this fragment alone was sufficient to function as a repressor, but the basal promoter sequence of NEUROG3 seems to be essential for activity as an activin A- and HGF-responsive cis-element. Several Transcription Factors Are Possibly Involved in the Activin A- and HGF-induced Transactivation of ngn3—The activin A- and HGF-responsive region that we mapped had the following elements: one E-box, one repressor element 1/neuron-restrictive silencer element (RE1/NRSE)-like sequence (18Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and one AT-rich sequence (Fig. 3A). To identify the cis-elements required for activin A- and HGF-mediated transactivation of ngn3, we engineered mutations within the possible cis-elements located in the activin A- and HGF-responsive region (–402 to 327 bp), to investigate the function of each DNA sequence as a cis-element. When mutations were introduced into either the E-box or the RE1/NRSE-like sequence, basal NEUROG3 promoter activity was enhanced with reducing activin A and HGF responsiveness. On the other hand, mutations of the AT-rich sequence only had a modest effect on basal NEUROG3 promoter activity or on activin A- and HGF-responsive promoter activity (Fig. 3B). Next, to try to identify the factors mediating activin A- and HGF-responsive transactivation of ngn3, we investigated the nuclear protein that binds to each mutation-sensitive cis-element before and various times after treatment with activin A and HGF using EMSA (Fig. 4). EMSA was able to identify factors that bound to each site and gradually decreased in binding affinity after treatment with activin A and HGF (C1 and C3 in Fig. 4) as well as factors (C2 and C4 in Fig. 4) that bound to each cis-element and gradually increased in affinity after treatment. Antiserum directed against RE1-silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor antibody, basic helix-loop-helix protein E47, and c-Myc antibody did not recognize any of these protein-DNA complexes (data not shown). These results suggested that several factors with positive or negative effect on NEUROG3 promoter activity might be involved in the activin A- and HGF-induced transactivation of ngn3. Smad-dependent Signaling Is Not Required for Activin A- and HGF-induced Transactivation of ngn3—Activin A is a member of the TGF-β superfamily, and signaling for this family is mediated by a heteromeric complex of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. Binding of a ligand to the receptor complex leads to the phosphorylation of type II receptor kinase and thereby activates type I receptor kinase (19Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). The activated type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), such as Smad2 or Smad3, which bind to the related factor Smad4 and move into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, this Smad complex associates with other transcription factors to activate the transcription of target gene (19Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of a Smad-dependent pathway in activin A- and HGF-induced transactivation of ngn3, we transfected NEUROG3 promoter reporter plasmids along with a plasmid expressing the inhibitory-Smad (Smad7) (20Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). In AR42J-B13 cells, as in other TGF-β-responsive cells, treatment with activin A and HGF activated a reporter plasmid containing the Smad-binding site of the PAI-1 promoter (20Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar), and this activation was inhibited by Smad7. However, we could not find any influence of Smad7 on activin A- and HGF-induced stimulation of NEUROG3 promoter activity. These findings demonstrated that Smad signaling is not required for the induction of ngn3 by activin A and HGF. P38 MAPK Is Required for Activin A- and HGF-induced Transactivation of ngn3—In addition to Smad activation, members of the TGF-β family activate other signaling cascades, including MAPK pathways (19Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). TGF-β is known to activate the extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (Erk), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK pathways (19Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 21Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the MAPK pathway was involved in the signal transduction pathway for ngn3 induced by activin A and HGF, we tested for phosphorylation of Erk, JNK, and p38 MAPK after stimulation with activin A and HGF. As shown in Fig. 6, p38 MAPK and Erk were phosphorylated after treatment with activin A and HGF, although with different time courses. On the other hand, JNK was not phosphorylated. Next, we focused on the involvement of p38 MAPK in this signal transduction pathway. SB203580 is a well known p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)-specific inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 6, it inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK provoked by activin A and HGF, while showing no effect of the activity of Erk in this cell line. In this state, the typical morphological changes and promoter activity of NEUROG3 provoked by activin A and HGF were disturbed (Fig. 7, A and B). Furthermore, whereas C2 and C4 showed no definite changes of binding affinity after the addition of SB203580 (data not shown), SB203580 inhibited the decrease of C1 and C3 binding affinity provoked by activin A and HGF (Fig. 7C). These results suggested that signaling through p38 MAPK regulate the binding affinity of at least two transcription factors and thus may play an important role in activin A- and HGF-induced differentiation of AR42J-B13 cells. The involvement of p38 MAPK in the signal transduction pathway suggested that TAK1 (22Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 23Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) might be involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway. TAK1 is a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family. TAK1 activates several members of the MAPK kinase family, including MKK6, MKK3, MKK7, and MKK4. Among them, MKK6 and MKK3 activate p38 MAPK. To investigate the possible involvement of the TAK1 pathway in the process of differentiation into pancreatic βcells, we examined the effect of overexpression of TAK1 and its dominant-negative mutants. Interestingly, co-transfection of TAK1 modestly augmented the activin A- and HGF-responsive transactivation of the NEUROG3 promoter and co-transfection with dominant-negative mutants of TAK1 caused a reduction in activin A- and HGF-responsiveness (Fig. 8A). Next, we investigated the effect of dominant-negative mutants of MKK6, MKK3, and MKK4 on this pathway. In agreement with other findings, MKK3 and/or MKK6 were phosphorylated after addition of activin A and HGF to cultures of these cells. The time course of the phosphorylation of MKK3 or MKK6 resembled that of p38 MAPK, suggesting that MKK3 or MKK6 could directly activate p38 MAPK (Fig. 8B). Co-transfection with dominant-negative mutants of MKK3 reduced the activin A- and HGF-responsive transactivation of the NEUROG3 promoter (Fig. 8C), whereas co-transfection with dominant-negative mutants of MKK6 and MKK4 had no effect. These results suggested that induction of ngn3 expression by activin A and HGF involves the TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway. Previous studies have revealed that signals from the notochord are essential for the differentiation of endocrine cells in the early stage of pancreatic development. In fact, removal of the notochord disrupts endocrine cell differentiation in the pancreas. Interestingly, treatment with activin A can induce endocrine cell differentiation even without the notochord (24Hebrok M. Kim S.K. Melton D.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1705-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Thus, the signals triggered by activin A play an important role in endocrine cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the signal transduction pathway of activin A- and HGF-induced expression of ngn3 using AR42J-B13 cells as a model of endocrine cell differentiation. Our 5′ deletion analysis of the NEUROG3 promoter identified the region between –402 and –326 bp of the NEUROG3 as an activin A- and HGF-responsive DNA sequence. This region seems to function as a repressor in AR42J-B13 cells, whereas activin A and HGF relieve this repression. When this region was isolated from the NEUROG3 basal promoter sequence and ligated upstream of a heterologous promoter, it still repressed the transcription but was no longer responsive to activin A and HGF. These results suggested that some transcriptional repressors might bind directly to the DNA sequence within this region, but the response to activin A and HGF required the basal promoter of NEUROG3. The proximal NEUROG3 promoter may contain activin A- and HGF-responsive sequences that are required for relief of the distal repression activity. Alternatively, activin A and HGF signals may influence co-activators or co-repressors that interact with factors binding to both the proximal and distal sequences. For transmembrane signaling, activin requires two types of receptors containing the serine/threonine kinase domain, activin receptor type I (ActRI) and type II (ActRII) (25Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Activin directly binds to ActRII, and this complex associates with ActRI, resulting in hyperphosphorylation of ActRI by the kinase activity of ActRII (19Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 26Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The activated serine/threonine kinase of ActRI phosphorylates Smad proteins, especially Smad2 or Smad3, which activate transcription of the target genes of activin. In AR42J-B13 cells, Smad2 is far more abundant than Smad3; and the signals from activin A can activate Smad2 (27Zhang Y.Q. Kanzaki M. Furukawa M. Shibata H. Ozeki M. Kojima I. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In our study, treatment with activin A and HGF also activated a control DNA sequence containing a TGF-β-responsive element, showing that the activin-ActR-Smad pathway is intact in AR42-JB13 cells. However, Smad7 did not affect the transactivation of ngn3 by activin A and HGF. This demonstrated that Smad-dependent signals, although commonly considered the main signaling pathway for activin A, are not required for the transactivation of ngn3 by activin A and HGF. Instead of Smad-dependent signaling, the TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK pathway was involved in this transactivation process. Several studies have recently revealed a role for p38 MAPK in TGF-β signaling (21Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 28Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our findings show that the p38 MAPK pathway can play a role in activin A signaling as well. The existence of other, non-Smad pathways for TGF-β/activin signaling is reminiscent of Wingless/Wnt molecules, which also can signal through more than one pathway (29Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that known components of the canonical Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway can function independently of β-catenin to establish planer cell polarity through a JNK or RhoA signaling cascade (30Guger K.A. Gumbiner B.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Strutt D.I. Weber U. Mlodzik M. Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 32Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Like Wnt signals, diverse sets of signals might be needed to mediate the various cellular responses to activin A. Our data clearly show the importance of p38 MAPK in the signal transduction pathway for activin A- and HGF-induced expression of ngn3. However, because transfection of the dominant-negative forms of TAK1, MKK3, and p38 MAPK specific inhibitor did not completely inhibit activation of the NEUROG3 promoter, other pathways that do not involve TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK may also contribute to NEUROG3 promoter activation. Previous studies have shown that RAS GTPase, Rho-like GTPase (including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), and protein phosphatase 2A are activated by TGF-β (33Griswold-Prenner I. Kamibayashi C. Maruoka E.M. Mumby M.C. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mucsi I. Skorecki K.L. Goldberg H.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 13: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In this study, we detected the activation of Erk soon after the addition of activin A and HGF to AR42J-B13 cells, although its functional role was not investigated. Thus, assessment of other signal transduction pathways affected by activin A and HGF will be needed to complete our understanding of this process. HGF is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to have a variety of effects on different cells. The receptor for HGF is a heterodimeric tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-met proto-oncogene (37Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A.

Michalopoulos G.K. Birchmeier W. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2867-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). c-met signaling is mediated by autophosphorylation of its own receptor, which leads to marked up-regulation of its kinase activity. Previous studies have shown that MAPK, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are involved in HGF signaling (39Graziani A. Gramaglia D. Cantley L.C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22087-22090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Boccaccio C. Ando M. Tamagnone L. Bardelli A. Michieli P. Battistini C. Comoglio P.M.

Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), but no previous data have suggested that HGF activates the TAK1-MKK3 signaling pathway. Muller et al. (42Muller M. Morotti A. Ponzetto C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1060-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) found that HGF alone could activate p38 MAPK in MLP29 cells. We found that HGF by itself activates p38 MAPK in AR42J-B13 cells. 2T. Ogihara and H. Watada, unpublished observation. These results suggest that activation of p38 MAPK by HGF might enhance the activation from the activin A-TAK1-MKK3 signaling pathway. Recently, Mirk/Dyrk1B was identified as a transcriptional activator of HNF-1α (43Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mirk binds directly to DcoHm, a newly identified DcoH family member that stabilizes HNF-1α dimers. Thus, Mirk, DcoHm, and HNF-1α form a complex together. Mirk binds to a specific region within the CREB-binding protein-binding site of HNF-1α and phosphorylates HNF-1α at a site adjacent to this binding region. Interestingly, it has been shown that MKK3 enhances Mirk kinase activity and the transcriptional activation of HNF-1α by Mirk. Our findings demonstrated the involvement of TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK in activation of the NEUROG3 promoter by activin A, but the mechanism did not involve the simple activation of transcription factors by activin A and HGF. Accordingly, a complex mechanism like Mirk-mediated HNF-1α transcriptional activation could be involved in the regulation of ngn3 by activin A and HGF. This study is the first step toward clarification of the mechanism by which activin A and HGF activate ngn3 gene expression. Although our findings were obtained using a cell line, these data suggest that signaling via the ActR-TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK pathway might play an important role in determining the fate of early pancreatic precursor cells. Considering the fact that ngn3 controls the initiation of islet cell formation, a detailed understanding of these signaling pathways may eventually contribute to a method for generating new islet cells from pancreatic precursor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2117529001,"Humans exhibit an anisotropy in direction perception: discrimination is superior when motion is around horizontal or vertical rather than diagonal axes. In contrast to the consistent directional anisotropy in perception, we found only small idiosyncratic anisotropies in smooth pursuit eye movements, a motor action requiring accurate discrimination of visual motion direction. Both pursuit and perceptual direction discrimination rely on signals from the middle temporal visual area (MT), yet analysis of multiple measures of MT neuronal responses in the macaque failed to provide evidence of a directional anisotropy. We conclude that MT represents different motion directions uniformly, and subsequent processing creates a directional anisotropy in pathways unique to perception. Our data support the hypothesis that, at least for visual motion, perception and action are guided by inputs from separate sensory streams. The directional anisotropy of perception appears to originate after the two streams have segregated and downstream from area MT."
https://openalex.org/W2004456466,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors play an essential role in the formation and maintenance of the hematopoietic and vascular compartments. The VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) is expressed on a population of hematopoietic cells, although its role in hematopoiesis is still unclear. In this report, we have utilized a strategy to selectively activate VEGFR-2 and study its effects in primary bone marrow cells. We found that VEGFR-2 can maintain the hematopoietic progenitor population in mouse bone marrow cultured in the absence of exogenous cytokines. Maintenance of the hematopoietic progenitor population is due to increased cell survival with minimal effect on proliferation. Progenitor survival is mainly mediated by activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt pathway. Although VEGFR-2 also activated Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase, it did not induce cell proliferation, and blockade of this pathway only partially decreased VEGFR-2-mediated survival of hematopoietic progenitors. Thus, the role of VEGFR-2 in hematopoiesis is likely to maintain survival of hematopoietic progenitors through the activation of antiapoptotic pathways.

In VEGFR-2 knockout embryos, there are critical defects in both hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis that mirror those found in VEGF-deficient embryos (5Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P.

However, the mechanisms by which VEGFR-2 affects hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis remain unclear. Although VEGFR-2 is essential for the generation of endothelial and hematopoietic cells in vivo (6Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), these cell populations can arise in vitro in embryonic stem cells that are deficient for VEGFR-2 (7Hidaka M. Stanford W.L. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7370-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Schuh A.C. Faloon P. Hu Q.L. Bhimani M. Choi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2159-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), indicating that this receptor might play a conditional role in the generation of cells of the hematopoietic and endothelial lineage. This has led to the hypothesis that VEGFR-2 might exert its effects by promoting the survival, proliferation, and migration of the hemangioblast, precursor of both the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages, rather than acting as a switch that activates differentiation of the hemangioblast (8Schuh A.C. Faloon P. Hu Q.L. Bhimani M. Choi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2159-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that VEGF is known to promote proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and that most of its effects appear to be mediated through VEGFR-2 (9Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). VEGF and its receptors have also been shown to play an important role in adult hematopoiesis. VEGFR-2 has been found to be expressed on a subset of hematopoietic stem cells that can differentiate into hematopoietic or vascular endothelial cells, depending on the culture conditions (10Ziegler B.L. Valtieri M. Porada G.A. De Maria R. Muller R. Masella B. Gabbianelli M. Casella I. Pelosi E. Bock T. Zanjani E.D. Peschle C.

Recent studies have shown that VEGF can recruit both hematopoietic cells (mainly through VEGFR-1) and endothelial progenitors (through VEGFR-2) to distant sites in vivo. This recruitment of marrow precursors may be critical in tumor angiogenesis (13Hattori K. Dias S. Heissig B. Hackett N.R. Lyden D. Tateno M. Hicklin D.J. Zhu Z. Witte L. Crystal R.G. Moore M.A. Rafii S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of VEGF and/or its receptors has recently been shown to reduce the number of hematopoietic progenitors in vivo (14Gerber H.P. Malik A.K. Solar G.P. Sherman D. Liang X.H. Meng G. Hong K. Marsters J.C. Ferrara N. Nature. 2002; 417: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). However, because of the numerous members of the VEGF ligand and receptor family, it is difficult to study the specific effects of VEGFR-2 signaling without the interference of other VEGF receptors such as VEGFR-1, VEGFR-3 (Flt-4), and the neuropilins (15Larrivee B. Karsan A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the unique signaling effects of some hematopoietic receptors (Flt-3, Mpl, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor, c-Kit) have been studied by fusing the signaling domain of these receptors to an FK506-binding protein (FKBP) that can be specifically activated using synthetic FKBP ligands (16Blau C.A.

This system has permitted the demonstration that the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors can be influenced through distinct, receptor-initiated signaling pathways (23Zeng H. Masuko M. Jin L. Neff T. Otto K.G. Blau C.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we used this inducible dimerization strategy to specifically study the effects of VEGFR-2 signaling on hematopoietic progenitors. It has been shown that neuropilin-1 is a receptor for VEGF and acts as a co-receptor that enhances the function of VEGF through VEGFR-2 (24Zachary I. Gliki G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Furthermore, VEGFR-2 has been shown to heterodimerize with VEGFR-1 (25Kendall R.L. Wang G. Thomas K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The strategy we used allows us to study the unique signaling properties of VEGFR-2, without any interference from other VEGF receptors, allowing us to exclude the effects of neuropilin, or heterodimerization with VEGFR-1. To specifically study the unique signaling effects of VEGFR-2, we fused the cytoplasmic domain of this receptor, which contains the split tyrosine kinase domain, to a mutated FKBP12 domain that harbors a phenylalanine to valine mutation at amino acid 36. Although other studies have shown the signaling effects of VEGFR-2 by using VEGFR-2-specific ligands, such as VEGF-E (26Meyer M. Clauss M. Lepple-Wienhues A. Waltenberger J. Augustin H.G. Ziche M. Lanz C. Buttner M. Rziha H.J. Dehio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), the use of a nontoxic chemical inducer of dimerization, AP20187 (Ariad Pharmaceuticals), allows us to study with high specificity VEGFR-2 signaling pathways in a cell autonomous manner. This strategy also allows us to rule out any potential signaling effects that could be triggered by neuropilin-1, which acts as a co-receptor for VEGF, enhancing its binding to VEGFR-2 (15Larrivee B. Karsan A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, AP20187 is well tolerated in vivo, which allows its use in studying specific signaling pathways in vivo and evaluation of its potential use in therapeutic strategies. Our studies show that VEGFR-2 activation results in maintenance of the hematopoietic progenitor population in conditions of cytokine starvation. This effect is mainly due to increased survival of hematopoietic progenitors through the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, although the Erk1/2 MAP kinase pathway may also be involved. Our results suggest that VEGFR-2 may be important in maintaining hematopoiesis by promoting the survival of hematopoietic progenitors, through the activation of PI 3-kinase, and possibly through Erk1/2 MAP kinases. Retroviral Vectors and Packaging Cell Lines—The intracellular domain of VEGFR-2, which exhibits tyrosine kinase activity, was fused to a modified FKBP12 domain that can dimerize in response to an analog of FK1012, AP20187 (27Whitney M.L.

The construct we used in this study contained a myristoylation sequence, two modified FKBP12 domains, the signaling domain of VEGFR-2, and a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (Fig. 1A). A chimeric fusion protein containing an amino-terminal myristoylation signal, two copies of a mutated FKBP12, followed by a carboxyl-terminal HA epitope tag, was released from the PC4M-Fv2E vector (Ariad) using EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech, Mississauga, Canada). An SpeI-linked fragment encoding the intracellular domain of human VEGFR-2 was PCR-amplified from the full-length cDNA (gift of C. Patterson) using the following primer pairs: 5′-GACTAGTAAGCGGGCCAATGGAGGG-3′ and 5′-GACTAGTAACAGGAGGAGAGCTCAGTG-3′. The amplicon was digested with SpeI, gel-purified, and subcloned into SpeI-digested pBluescript. After sequence confirmation, the fragment was released from pBluescript by SpeI digestion, gel-purified, and subcloned into the SpeI site of the pEGFPC1-FKBP12 plasmid. The FKBP-VEGFR-2 fragment was released using HindIII-XbaI digestion, overhanging ends filled in with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and cloned into the HpaI site of a previously described murine stem cell virus-internal ribosome entry site-enhanced green fluorescent protein (MIG) vector based on an original vector kindly provided by R. Hawley (28Antonchuk J. Sauvageau G. Humphries R.K. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Ecotropic packaged virus was generated using the following procedure. Phoenix-AMPHO cells (R. Nolan) were transfected with the vector plasmids using Fugene (Roche Applied Science, Laval, Canada) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Medium was changed after 24 h, and transfected cells were cultured for another 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Supernatant was then harvested, filtered, and used for repeated infections of GP+E86 ecotropic packaging cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). After sorting for GFP expression, transduced GP+E86 cells were plated at limiting dilution. Individual clones were tested, and the highest titer clone was selected by titration of supernatants on NIH 3T3 cells. Cell Lines—HMEC-1 endothelial cells (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) were cultured in MCDB medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma). HMEC-1 cells were retrovirally transduced using amphotropic packaged virus obtained by harvesting the supernatant of Phoenix-AMPHO cells transfected with vector plasmids 48 h prior to supernatant collection. Hematopoietic progenitors were extracted from the femurs and tibias of C3Pep mice (cross between C3H/HeJ and Pep3b) treated 4 days previously with 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (Amersham Biosciences) and cultured for 48 h in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with a serum substitute (BIT (Stem Cell Technologies Ltd., Vancouver, Canada)), 10–4m 2-mercaptoethanol, 40 μg/ml low density lipoproteins (Sigma), 1 ng/ml Flt3-ligand, 300 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF), and 20 ng/ml interleukin-11 (Stem Cell Technologies). After stimulation, cells were harvested and infected by either cocultivation with irradiated (1500 centigrays, x-ray) GP+E86 viral producer cells or by the addition of virus-containing supernatant from the GP+E86 producer cells in fibronectin-coated dishes. Both infection protocols involved 48-h growth on tissue culture plates with the above cytokine combination and with the addition of 5 μg/ml protamine sulfate (Sigma). Following infection, bone marrow cells were plated in the same medium for another 2 days. Cells were then sorted for GFP expression (FACS 440; Becton Dickinson). Viability Assays—Sorted bone marrow cells were plated in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS with or without the addition of 100 nm AP20187. We found that this dose-induced maximal survival effect on hematopoietic progenitors (data not shown). Cells were harvested at various times and counted on a hemacytometer. CFC Assay—Transduced GFP-positive bone marrow cells were grown in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, with or without 100 nm AP20187, for 7 and 14 days. At these time points, hematopoietic clonogenic progenitor frequencies were determined by plating 20,000 bone marrow cells in methylcellulose medium containing 50 ng/ml SCF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-6, and 3 units/ml erythropoietin (Methocult GF M3434; Stem Cell Technologies). Resultant colonies were scored after 10 days of incubation. CFU-Spleen (CFU-S12) Assay—Transduced GFP-positive bone marrow cells were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS with or without 100 nm AP20187 for 7 days. 25,000 cells were injected in the tail vein of lethally irradiated (900 centigrays, using a 137Cs source) B6C3 mice (cross between C3H/HeJ and C57Bl/6J). 12 days later, mice were sacrificed, spleens were harvested and fixed in Telleyesniczky's solution, and hematopoietic colonies were counted. Immunofluorescence—For BrdUrd staining, sorted GFP-positive bone marrow cells were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 days and then treated for 2 h with 10 μm BrdUrd with or without 100 nm AP20187. Cytospin preparations of bone marrow cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 1 min. Slides were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 2 n HCl to denature DNA. Slides were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, followed by a 1-h incubation with primary antibody (anti-BrdUrd conjugated with AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), 1:50 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100). After washing, nuclear DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml), and slides were mounted in anti-fading solution. For activated caspase 3 staining, cytospin preparations of hematopoietic progenitors grown in culture for 14 days in IMDM containing 10% FBS were stained using the same protocol as above (the DNA denaturation step was omitted), and the following antibodies were used: anti-activated caspase 3 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated with Texas Red (Molecular Probes). Immunoblotting—Proteins from total cellular extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and assessed by immunoblotting as previously described (29Duriez P.J. Wong F. Dorovini-Zis K. Shahidi R. Karsan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18099-18107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Antibodies against phosphorylated VEGFR-2 and total and phosphorylated Akt and Erk MAP kinase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Mississauga, Canada). Anti-HA antibody was obtained from Babco (Richmond, CA). The kinase inhibitors LY294002 and U0126 were obtained from Calbiochem. Statistical Analysis—A two-tailed Student t test was used to determine differences between treated and untreated cultures. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Activation of VEGFR-2 Delays Loss of Murine Hematopoietic Progenitors—To study the effect of VEGFR-2 signaling in primary bone marrow cells independently of other VEGF receptors, including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-3, neuropilin-1, or neuropilin-2 (15Larrivee B. Karsan A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar), or the presence of endogenous VEGF, we used a strategy to dimerize the intracellular domain of VEGFR-2 with a chemical inducer, AP20187. This strategy has previously been used to study the functional role of hematopoietic receptors such as Mpl, Flt-3, and c-Kit (21Richard R.E. Wood B. Zeng H. Jin L. Papayannopoulou T. Blau C.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 430-436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Otto K.G. Jin L. Spencer D.M. Blau C.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 3662-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We cloned the intracellular domain of VEGFR-2 and fused it to a modified FKBP domain that can be specifically dimerized with a chemical inducer, AP20187 (Fig. 1A). When transduced into HMEC-1 cells or murine bone marrow cells, this construct gave a 110-kDa protein (Fig. 1B), which mainly localized to the cytoplasmic membrane when unstimulated (Fig. 1C). Stimulation of HMEC-1 cells with 10 nm AP20187 for 0–30 min, resulted in progressive translocation of the fused VEGFR-2 construct from the cytoplasmic membrane to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of the construct was observed as soon as 30 s after stimulation with 10 nm AP20187 in HMEC cells and remained over a period of at least 30 min (Fig. 1D). To investigate the effect of VEGFR-2 in hematopoietic cells, bone marrow from mice treated with 5-fluorouracil to activate bone marrow precursor cells was harvested and transduced with the VEGFR-2 fusion construct. As a control, the empty MIG vector was used. After sorting, transduced GFP-positive cells were plated in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS with or without 100 nm AP20187, and cell number was counted at days 5, 7, and 14. We found that cell number decreased rapidly, indicating the necessity of cytokines for the survival of bone marrow cells. However, in marrow cells in which the VEGFR-2 construct was dimerized by the addition of AP20187, we observed a smaller decrease in cell number (Fig. 2A). After two weeks in culture, cell numbers in bone marrow control cultures were 2.5-fold lower than the ones in which VEGFR-2 was dimerized. This effect was not observed in VEGFR-2-transduced cells that did not receive AP20187, indicating that dimerization of VEGFR-2 is required for maintaining hematopoietic cell numbers. We next tested whether dimerization of VEGFR-2 has an additive effect on medium supplemented with hematopoietic cytokines that provide optimal growth conditions (30Thorsteinsdottir U. Sauvageau G. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1999; 94: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transduced bone marrow cells were cultured in medium containing cytokines that are known to induce hematopoietic cell proliferation (IL-3, IL-6, and SCF), with or without 100 nm AP20187 (Fig. 2B). With these growth conditions, we did not observe any significant change when VEGFR-2 was dimerized in comparison with the control cells, suggesting that VEGFR-2 does not signal a proliferative effect that is synergistic with these hematopoietic cytokines. To test whether VEGFR-2 can preserve the viability and activity of hematopoietic progenitors in the absence of hematopoietic cytokines, VEGFR-2 and control cells were cultured in cytokine-free medium for 7 and 14 days with or without the addition of dimerizer, after which cells were plated in methylcellulose medium to assay for hematopoietic progenitors. We found that dimerization of VEGFR-2 maintained hematopoietic progenitor potential in liquid culture. Over a 2-week period in culture, we observed an 8-fold decrease in the number of progenitors in control bone marrow cultures. In contrast, when the FKBP-VEGFR-2 construct was dimerized with AP20187, we observed a 3-fold increase in the maintenance of progenitors over control cultures, consistent with the findings in Fig. 2 (Fig. 3A). Although VEGFR-2 dimerization maintained the hematopoietic progenitor population for a period of 2 weeks in the absence of other cytokines, we did not observe a significant change in the proportion of different hematopoietic progenitors as measured by the CFC assay (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that VEGFR-2 promotes hematopoietic cell survival and/or proliferation but does not affect differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. To confirm that VEGFR-2 can independently maintain the multipotent hematopoietic progenitor population, we utilized the CFU-S12 assay following liquid culture of bone marrow cells for 7 days in cytokine-free medium. Colonies were enumerated in each of the spleens harvested 12 days following injection of bone marrow cells (Fig. 4A). As seen in Fig. 4B, VEGFR-2 dimerization resulted in a 5-fold increase in the proportion of CFU-S12 cells, compared with bone control marrow cultures. These results suggest that VEGFR-2 can maintain the activity and viability of primitive hematopoietic progenitors in the absence of other exogenous cytokines. VEGFR-2 Does Not Increase S-phase Entry in Hematopoietic Precursors—It is known that, in endothelial cells, VEGF can induce cell proliferation. It has been suggested that this effect is mainly mediated through VEGFR-2 (9Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). We tested whether dimerization of VEGFR-2 also resulted in bone marrow cell proliferation, which could account in part for the delay in the loss of hematopoietic progenitors that we observed. Bone marrow cells were grown in cytokine-free medium for 2 days, then treated with BrdUrd with or without AP20187 for 2 h. Cytospins of cells were then labeled with an anti-BrdUrd antibody (Fig. 5A). We found that dimerization of VEGFR-2 did not result in a greater proportion of cells which incorporated BrdUrd, indicating that VEGFR-2 signaling alone may not be sufficient to induce proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors (Fig. 5B). VEGFR-2 Activation Reduces the Number of Apoptotic Cells in Hematopoietic Precursors—It has also been shown that VEGF can induce antiapoptotic signaling through phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in endothelial cells subjected to serum deprivation (31Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Since we observed a delay in loss of progenitors when VEGFR-2 is dimerized, we postulated that this effect was caused by an inhibition of apoptosis, since VEGFR-2 dimerization alone did not affect proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. It has been shown that caspase 3 is present in hematopoietic precursor cells and is activated during apoptosis (32Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 33Zermati Y. Garrido C. Amsellem S. Fishelson S. Bouscary D. Valensi F. Varet B. Solary E. Hermine O. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To test whether VEGFR-2 inhibits hematopoietic cell apoptosis, transduced bone marrow cells were subjected to cytokine deprivation and incubated with or without AP20187 for 14 days. At this point, cytospins were made and stained for the activated form of caspase 3 (Fig. 6A). We found that the proportion of apoptotic cells was 2-fold lower in bone marrow cells in which VEGFR-2 was dimerized compared with bone marrow control cultures (Fig. 6B). Hence, inhibition of apoptosis through VEGFR-2 signaling would explain in part the maintenance of hematopoietic progenitors observed. VEGFR-2 Activates the PI 3-Kinase and Erk MAP Kinase Pathways—Since VEGFR-2 dimerization reduces the amount of apoptotic cells, we examined signaling pathways known to be induced by VEGF in endothelial cells. In particular, the PI 3-kinase/Akt and the MAP kinase pathways are both implicated in VEGF signaling and have potential roles in cell survival (31Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10002-10007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of activation of Akt and Erk1/2 by VEGFR-2, endothelial cells transduced with MIG or MIG-FKBP/VEGFR-2 were starved overnight in medium supplemented with 5% FBS and then treated with AP20187 for 0–60 min. Membranes were reprobed with total Akt or Erk as a loading control. Following dimerization of VEGFR-2, we found that both Akt and Erk1/2 were activated. Akt phosphorylation peaked between 10 and 20 min (Fig. 7A), whereas maximum Erk1/2 phosphorylation was observed between 20 and 30 min (Fig. 7B). Activation of Akt was biphasic, with a second peak of phosphorylation after 60 min (Fig. 7A). This biphasic activation of Akt in response to VEGFR-2 dimerization was observed in three independent experiments. We next checked wheth"

The assembly mechanism of VLDL particles is a tightly regulated process where apoB, associated with an insufficient amount of lipids, is selectively degraded intracellularly. In this study we found that treatment of HuH-7 human hepatoma cells with verapamil inhibited secretion of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles through increasing degradation of apoB. Addition of N-acetylleucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, an inhibitor of proteasome and other cysteinyl proteases that are responsible for apoB degradation, restored apoB recovery from verapamil-treated cells. De novo synthesis of lipids from [14C]acetate was increased in the presence of verapamil, suggesting that verapamil decreases lipid availability for apoB thus leading to the secretion of apoB-containing lipoprotein. We prepared cytosolic fractions from cells preincubated with [14C]acetate and used as a donor of radioactive lipids. When this cytosolic fraction was incubated with microsomes isolated separately, radioactive triglyceride (TG) accumulated in the luminal space of the microsomes. The transfer of radioactive TG from the cytosolic fraction to the microsomal lumen was inhibited in the presence of verapamil, suggesting that there is a verapamil-sensitive mechanism for TG transfer across ER membranes that is involved in formation of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles in ER. Verapamil showed no inhibitory effect on microsomal TG transfer protein, a well known lipid transfer protein in ER. We propose from these results that there is novel machinery for transmembrane movement of neutral lipids, which is involved in providing TG for apoB during VLDL assembly in ER.

The liver plays a central role in lipoprotein metabolism through secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) 1The abbreviations used are: VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal; apoB, apolipoprotein B; apoAI, apolipoprotein AI; CE, cholesteryl ester; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FC, free cholesterol; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC, phosphatidylcholine; TG, triglyceride; DGAT, diglyceride:acyl-CoA acyltransferase; ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine., which carries neutral lipids to all peripheral tissues. VLDL, a large particle containing apolipoprotein B (apoB) and various lipids, including triglyceride (TG), free cholesterol (FC), and cholesteryl ester (CE), is assembled in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in hepatic cells. Mechanisms of VLDL particle formation are likely to be rigorously regulated, because association of lipids to apoB needs to occur cotranslationally, and poorly lipidated apoB-containing lipoprotein is degraded by proteasome or ER-resident proteases such as ER-60 prior to secretion (1Yeung S.J.

Thus it is thought that the association of lipids to apoB is a rate-limiting step for VLDL secretion, with regulation of this process controlled by as yet unknown mechanisms. One of the factors for this lipid transfer is microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a lack of which was identified as the cause of abetalipoproteinemia, an autosomal recessive disease with total loss of apoB-containing lipoprotein in plasma (4Watterau J.R.

MTP binds various lipid molecules, including TG and then presents those lipids to apoB (7Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.-H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol.

TG is synthesized from diglyceride and acyl-CoA by the action of diglyceride:acyl-CoA acyltransferase (DGAT). DGAT activity is detected in microsomes, and it is located on the cytosolic side of ER membranes (12Yang L.-Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.L. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 262-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Coleman R.A. Bell R.B. The Enzymes. 16. Academic Press, New York1983: 605-625Google Scholar). Recently, Owen et al. (14Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that the activity of DGAT was present also in the lumen of the ER; however, it is still unclear whether TG synthesis occurs physiologically within ER lumen. Enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis are present in the cytosol and on the cytosolic side of ER membranes. Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which catalyzes esterification of cholesterol to form CE, is also located primarily on the cytosolic side of ER membrane (15Suckling K.E. Stange E.F. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 647-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the active site of ACAT2, an isoform expressed primarily in liver and intestine, is predicted to be in the ER lumen (16Anderson R.A. Joyce C. Davis M. Reagan J.W. Clark M.

MTP can transfer these lipids from the ER membrane to apoB in the ER lumen. For proper assembly of VLDL particles to occur, however, these lipids must be moved from the site of synthesis into the luminal space of the ER where MTP is present. Little is known about the precise mechanism of lipid transfer in hepatic cells especially on lipid movement across ER membranes. There are many published reports that indicate that apoB secretion is dramatically affected by exogenous compounds (17Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in rat hepatocytes this is not the case (22Davis R.A. Boogaerts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTP inhibitors prevent association of lipids with apoB, which abolishes apoB secretion (18Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E.

It is thought that these compounds change the availability of neutral lipids necessary for lipoprotein formation not only by their amounts but also by decreasing the efficiency of intracellular movement of the lipids. During the search for possible hypolipidemic compounds, we found that verapamil inhibited secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins from human hepatoma cell line HuH-7 cells in culture. HuH-7 is well differentiated and is considered to be relevant to hepatic cells physiologically (23Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar). Although HepG-2, one of the widely used hepatic cell lines, secretes only high density lipoprotein-sized, lipid-poor particles (24Thrift R.N. Forte T.M. Cahoon B.E. Shore V.G. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 236-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), low density lipoprotein-sized lipoprotein particles containing apoB-100 are secreted from HuH-7 cells (25Higashi Y. Itabe H. Fukase H. Mori M. Fujimoto Y. Sato R. Imanaka T. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1581: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus we used the cell line as a good model to investigate human lipoprotein metabolism. Because apoB degradation within the HuH-7 cells was greatly enhanced with verapamil treatment, we speculate that verapamil reduces lipid availability for lipoprotein assembly. Verapamil did not inhibit either protein synthesis or lipid synthesis in the cells, but it inhibited lipid transfer from the cytosolic lipid pool to the luminal space in the ER across the ER membranes. Our present study provides the evidence for a novel transmembrane TG transfer system that is crucial for providing TG for VLDL assembly in ER. Cell Culture—HuH-7, a human hepatoma cell line, was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (cell no. JCRB0403; Osaka, Japan). Cells were maintained in “medium A” (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% 100× non-essential amino acids solution (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) and antibiotics (penicillin G potassium, final concentration, 0.2 mg/ml; streptomycin sulfate, final concentration, 0.1 mg/ml). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4 mg/ml heparin (PBS-heparin) and then once with PBS prior to performing the experiments, then the cells were incubated in medium A without serum during experimental schedules. Effects of Agents on ApoB and Albumin Secretion—Verapamil and reserpine (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) were dissolved in Me2SO to make stock solutions. After the solutions or vehicle were added to the cells under serum free condition, cells were cultured over 24 h. The final concentration of Me2SO in experimental media was 0.1%, which did not interfere with the cell conditions in our experiments. Conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g, at a temperature of 4 °C for 10 min to remove debris. Amounts of albumin and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) secreted in the medium were quantified following Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-human apoAI antibody (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) and a rabbit anti-human albumin antibody (Cappel, Aurora, OH), respectively. Amounts of apoB secreted into the medium were determined using a sandwich ELISA procedure as described previously (26Itabe H. Suzuki K. Tsukamoto Y. Komatsu R. Ueda M. Mori M. Higashi Y. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells precoated with an anti-human apoB monoclonal antibody (OEM Concepts, Toms River, NJ) were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin dissolved in 25 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0. Aliquots of conditioned media were added to the wells and allowed to stand for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the remaining apoB was detected using sheep anti-human apoB antibody (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Incorporation of [35S]Methionine into ApoB—The rate of apoB synthesis in the cells was studied by measuring incorporation of [35S]methionine into apoB synthesized de novo. HuH-7 cells grown in 35-mm dishes were incubated with serum-free DMEM containing 40 μm verapamil for 4 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for up to 30 min with Met-free medium supplemented with [35S]Met (Pro-Mix™ 35S cell labeling mix, 1.85 MBq/ml/dish; Amersham Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) containing 40 μm verapamil. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were homogenized using a probe-type sonicator in cell-lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 4 mm EDTA, and the following protease inhibitors: 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin, 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 80 μg/ml of N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN). Immunoprecipitation of apoB was carried out as described previously (21Sato R. Imanaka T. Takatsuki A. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11880-11884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium and cell lysate were incubated with rabbit anti-human apoB antibody (Calbiochem-Nova Biochem, San Diego, CA) at 4 °C, followed by further incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at 4 °C for 2 h. The autoradiogram after SDS-PAGE was visualized using a BAS-1500 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo). The relative intensity of radioactive spots was determined by BAS-1500 with photo-stimulating luminescence (PSL) as the unit of measure. Pulse Labeling and Chasing of Intracellular ApoB—HuH-7 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM containing 40 μm verapamil for 4 h. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with Met-free medium containing 40 μm verapamil for 1 h in the presence or absence of 40 μg/ml ALLN. The cells were then pulsed with [35S]Met for 30 min and washed once with PBS and twice with serum-free DMEM containing 5 mm Met. After incubation with serum-free DMEM containing 5 mm Met for up to 60 min, cells and conditioned media were collected. Immediately, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin and 40 μg/ml of ALLN were added to the conditioned media. The cells were lysed in cell-lysis buffer. Radioactivity in the apoB band was quantified using a BAS-1500 bio-imaging analyzer after immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE were carried out. Analysis of the Lipids Secreted into Conditioned Medium—HuH-7 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were cultured for 24 h with serum-free DMEM containing 40 μm verapamil or vehicle and 37 kBq/ml [2-14C]acetate (Amersham Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan). Lipids were extracted from the conditioned medium with chloroform and methanol. The lipids were separated on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) as described previously (25Higashi Y. Itabe H. Fukase H. Mori M. Fujimoto Y. Sato R. Imanaka T. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1581: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The radioactivities of the separated bands on TLC were quantified either using a BAS1500 bio-imaging analyzer or a liquid scintillation counter. Measurement of [14C]Acetic Acid Incorporation into Lipids—Cells were cultured for 12 h with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 5 mm HEPES and 40 μm verapamil or vehicle. Following this, [14C]acetate was added to the culture, and the mixture was incubated for up to 4 h. Lipids, extracted from the cells with chloroform and methanol, were separated and quantified using TLC as described above. To determine [14C]acetate incorporation into microsomal lipids, cells were labeled with [14C]acetate in the presence of 40 μg/ml ALLN to prevent proteolytic degradation of apoB. After 4-h incubation with [14C]acetate, cells recovered from culture dishes by trypsin treatment were washed extensively with ice-cold PBS. Cell fractionation was carried out as described previously (25Higashi Y. Itabe H. Fukase H. Mori M. Fujimoto Y. Sato R. Imanaka T. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1581: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in cell-homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.1% ethanol, and 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8) using a Teflon homogenizer. After centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 10 min (to exclude large organelles and cell debris), the homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to precipitate microsomes. The microsomes suspended in cell-homogenizing buffer were incubated with an equal volume of 200 mm Na2CO3 on ice for 60 min followed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min. After this, microsomal membranes (precipitates) and luminal contents (supernatant) were separately recovered. Lipids extracted from the precipitates and supernatants were analyzed by TLC. The radioactivities of the separated bands on TLC were quantified using a BAS1500 bio-imaging analyzer. Measurement of MTP Activity—HuH-7 cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS were washed three times with PBS and homogenized using a probe-type sonicator. MTP activity was determined using the MTP activity kit (Roar Biomedical, New York, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1 ml of cell homogenate (100 μg of protein), containing 10 μl each of suspensions of donor and acceptor particles, was incubated with either verapamil or vehicle in a water bath at 37 °C. The change of fluorescent intensity (excitation at 465 nm and emission at 535 nm) was subsequently monitored. The expression of MTP was determined by Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-human MTP polyclonal antibody (27Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Assay of Lipid Transfer Activity via a Microsomal Membrane—After culturing HuH-7 cells in serum-free DMEM with 37 kBq/ml [2-14C]acetic acid for 12 h, the cytosolic fraction was separated from the cells. Lipids extracted from the cytosol with chloroform/methanol (2/1) were dried under an argon gas stream. The lipids were re-suspended in PBS using a sonicator, and aliquots of the suspension were used as the donor lipids for this lipid transfer assay. The microsomal fraction was prepared from another batch of HuH-7 cells as described above except for HEPES-buffered solution (250 mm sucrose, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4), which was used as the acceptor of the lipid transfer assay. An aliquot of the microsomes was suspended in assay buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, together with an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 1 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.5 unit/ml creatine kinase), with the reaction started by addition of the lipid suspension. After an appropriate incubation time at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted with the same volume of ice-cold HEPES-buffered solution and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Precipitated microsomes were re-suspended in ice-cold HEPES-buffered solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) and then precipitated by centrifugation. Luminal contents of the microsomes were separated from membranes after treatment with Na2CO3 followed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min (28Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Lipids extracted from the luminal contents with chloroform/methanol were analyzed by TLC. The radioactivities of separated bands by TLC were quantified using a BAS1500 bio-imaging analyzer. Assay for Cholesterol Esterification—Plasma membrane FC was labeled by incubating HuH-7 cells with [14C]FC on ice for 90 min. Then the cells were incubated with medium containing 40 μm verapamil or 4 μm reserpine at 37 °C for up to 4 h. Lipid was extracted from the cells and separated on TLC to measure the radioactivities in CE and FC. Amounts of apoB secreted into conditioned medium were determined using sandwich ELISA procedure. Verapamil Specifically Inhibits the Secretion of ApoB-containing Lipoprotein in HuH-7 Cells—To study the regulatory mechanism of human apoB-100-containing lipoprotein formation, we tested various compounds on apoB secretion from the human hepatoma cell culture line HuH-7. HuH-7 cells secrete LDL-sized lipoprotein particles (density, ∼1.04), which contain apoB-100 but not apoB-48 judging by Western blotting (data not shown). The amount of apoB secreted into culture media was measured using sandwich ELISA procedure. We found that verapamil inhibited apoB secretion from the cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, circles). Because the secretion of albumin (Fig. 1, triangles) and apoAI (data not shown) was not decreased under the same conditions, it is very likely that verapamil has an inhibitory effect on assembly mechanisms of human apoB-100 but not on general protein secretory systems. This inhibitory effect of verapamil was readily detectable after 4 h of treatment and continued during 24 h of culture period (data not shown). When verapamil was washed out after 4 h of treatment, the apoB secretion was recovered to the control level (data not shown). During the treatment with verapamil, no significant change in amount of cellular protein was observed (ranging between 1.9 and 2.1 mg/dish). These results indicate that a short period of treatment with verapamil is enough to reduce apoB secretion and the effect of verapamil is reversible. Effects of Verapamil on the Synthesis and the Intracellular Degradation of ApoB—Lipoprotein secretion can be reduced either when synthesis of apoB is inhibited or when intracellular degradation of apoB is accelerated. ApoB is degraded before secretion when it is poorly lipidated, and it is proposed that the rate of degradation is the major determinant of the rate of apoB secretion (1Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchel D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22489-22494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The rate of apoB synthesis in HuH-7 cells was examined by counting [35S]Met incorporation into apoB. Treatment of the HuH-7 cells with verapamil showed no change in the levels of radioactivity incorporated in newly formed apoB (Fig. 2A). This suggests that verapamil does not change the rate of apoB protein synthesis. Next we examined the disappearing and secreting rate of apoB from the cell. When apoB synthesized de novo was pulse-labeled with [35S]Met and chased up to 60 min, verapamil treatment decreased the secretion of radiolabeled apoB without affecting the rate of disappearance from the cells (Fig. 2B). Then we examined whether the decrease in rate of apoB secretion by verapamil was due to increased degradation within the cells. ApoB is known to be degraded by proteasomes in the cytosol and by proteases in the ER. A cysteinyl protease inhibitor, ALLN, can block both of these protease activities (29Cavallo D. Rudy D. Mohammadi A. Macri J. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23135-23143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When the pulse-chase experiment was performed again in the presence of ALLN (Fig. 2C), ALLN completely prevented the degradation of apoB, as shown by the total recovery of apoB (sum of cellular fractions and media) being almost 100% in both the control and verapamiltreated cells. It is noteworthy that the cells treated with verapamil and ALLN still secreted lesser amounts of apoB than control cells, whereas the majority of apoB molecules prevented from being secreted remained within the cells (Fig. 2B, filled symbols). Addition of ALLN alone did not change the total recovery of apoB suggesting that apoB synthesis was not affected by ALLN. These results indicate that, with verapamil treatment, apoB was degraded by ALLN-sensitive protease activity, and hence secretion was prevented. Verapamil Affects Lipid Accumulation in ER—It is well-known that lipid availability is an important factor in apoB secretion from hepatic cells; thus we tested the effects of verapamil on lipid availability for lipoprotein assembly in HuH-7 cells using [14C]acetate as a tracer. During 4 h of culture, incorporation of radioactivity into TG and FC was not reduced but, rather, was higher in the cells treated with verapamil than control cells (Fig. 3). Treatment with verapamil also increased incorporation of radioactivity into phospholipids (data not shown). These results indicate that de novo synthesis of lipids in the cells was not inhibited by verapamil. After HuH-7 cells were incubated with [14C]acetate with or without verapamil for 24 h, incorporation of radioactivity in various lipids in the cells and medium was separately measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, relative amounts of radioactive lipids secreted in the medium, especially TG and CE, were decreased to about 40% of those of control cells following verapamil treatment; this is similar to the extent of inhibition as observed in apoB secretion (see Fig. 1). In the next experiments, HuH-7 cells were cultured for4hin serum-free medium containing [14C]acetate with or without verapamil. The microsomal fraction from the cells was treated with Na2CO3 to separate the luminal contents from the membranes. The radioactivities in TG, CE, and FC in both microsomal luminal and membrane fractions were lower in the verapamil-treated cells than in the control cells (Fig. 4B). The TG and FC in the total homogenate were increased more than 2-fold because of presumable up-regulation of de novo synthesis of lipids as shown in Fig. 3. Our data (Figs. 1, 2, 3) show that verapamil decreases lipoprotein secretion without inhibiting synthesis of apoB protein as well as lipids. The observations shown in Fig. 4 suggest that the relative amounts of neutral lipids present in ER are"

https://openalex.org/W2053204699,"The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter from <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (HP NhaA) is normally active within the pH range 6.0–8.5. In contrast, the NhaA from <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EC NhaA) is active only within the alkaline pH range 7.5–8.5. We studied structures of HP NhaA involved in ion transport and pH sensing by analyzing mutants with defects in NhaA activity. The 36 mutants were classified into three types. The first type exhibited very low or null activity at all pH levels and had amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane segments (TM) 4, 5, 10, and 11, implicating these TMs in ion transport. The second type, which had amino acid substitutions at Met-138, Phe-144, and Lys-347 in TM 4 and 10, exhibited very low antiporter activity at acidic pH but had significantly higher activity at alkaline pH. These results imply that TM 4 (Met-138 and Phe-144) and 10 (Lys-347) are involved in supporting transport activity at acidic pH, in addition to their essential role in the overall transport mechanism. The third type of mutant exhibited very low antiporter activity at alkaline pH but relatively normal activity at acidic pH and had amino acid substitutions in loop 7 (a hydrophilic region between TM 7 and 8) as well as in TM 8, suggesting that these regions are involved in antiporter activation at alkaline pH. Three revertants that suppress a Lys-347 mutation were identified. Two of three suppressor mutations were located in loops 2 and 4, suggesting a functional interaction between these regions (loops 2 and 4 and TM 10). Thus, HP NhaA activity may be modulated by two independent factors that are dependent on pH: an activation mechanism at acidic pH, which is regulated by residues within TM 4 and 10 and another mechanism functioning at alkaline pH regulated by residues within loop 7 and TM 8."

On the other hand, environmental conditions might affect the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of these cells. We report here, for the first time, that inorganic mercury affects the proliferative and differentiative capacity of adult neuronal stem cells (ANSCs). Actually, inorganic mercury increases apoptosis in ASNC. Furthermore, in stem cell-derived astrocytes, high levels of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-70) occur, while the levels of GTP-beta-tubulin activity dramatically decrease. Interestingly, when induced to differentiate, inorganic mercury modifies morphological proprieties of astrocytes, while the neuron population is reduced. These results demonstrate that inorganic mercury produces toxicity in the ANSC-derived neuronal population and affects the biological properties of the glial-derived population."

NTR domains have been identified in a wide range of proteins, including the netrin family of proteins, secreted frizzled-related proteins, complement proteins C3, C4, and C5, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP), and a number of putative Caenorhabditis elegans proteins (9Bányai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The putative C. elegans proteins K07C11.3 and K07C11.5 seem to consist only of single, isolated NTR domains, suggesting that NTR domains are stable structural entities. More frequently, however, NTR domains are found as modules in multidomain proteins, where they occur in association with epidermal growth factor-like repeats, CUB domains, fibulin-related domains, cysteine-rich domains related to the Wnt-binding domain of frizzled receptors, and domains homologous to the N-terminal domain VI of laminin B, whey acidic protein domains, follistatin domains, immunoglobulin domains, and Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains (9Bányai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Trexler M. Bányai L. Patthy L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3705-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Trexler M. Bányai L. Patthy L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence homologies, NTR domains present the core structural element of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP), although the sequence similarities are limited (9Bányai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The only structural information about NTR domains to date comes from several TIMP structures and the laminin-binding domain of agrin. The laminin-binding agrin domain is structurally homologous to the NTR subdomain in TIMPs, but its sequence homology to TIMPs and other NTR domains is so low that it escaped identification as an NTR domain before structure determination (12Stetefeld J. Jenny M. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Schumacher B. Frank S. Rüegg M.A. Engel J. Kammerer R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the NTR domain of PCOLCE1, NTRPCOLCE1, in solution. The NTRPCOLCE1 domain is one of the smallest NTR domains known and, in contrast to TIMPs and the laminin-binding agrin domain, contains the canonical set of three disulfide bonds typical of classical NTR domains (9Bányai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The structure establishes a set of characteristic residues that will assist the identification of similar folds from sequence alignments. Functional implications of the fold with regard to potential proteinase inhibitory activity are discussed. Materials—Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, thrombin, and M13 sequencing reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. PCR primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Ammonium 15N chloride was from Sigma. Human matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 proenzyme, active MMP-2, MMP-3 catalytic chain, and active MMP-9) were purchased from Calbiochem; human TACE/ADAM17 was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The TACE fluorogenic substrate (DABCYL-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Val-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg-EDANS) and the MMP fluorogenic substrate (DNP-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Trp-Ala-d-Arg-NH2) were from Calbiochem; p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) was from Sigma. Human plasma kallikrein (Calbiochem) and bovine trypsin (Sigma) were commercial preparations. The synthetic substrates d-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA and Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany) and Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), respectively. The pET15b expression vector was from Novagen Merck Kft (Budapest, Hungary). Escherichia coli strains JM109 and BL21(DE3) were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Novagen Merck Kft (Budapest, Hungary), respectively. The human liver cDNA library was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Cloning of NTRPCOLCE1—The DNA segment encoding the NTR domain of human PCOLCE1 was amplified by PCR from human liver cDNA, using the 5′-GCGAATTCATATGATATCTCCTGATGCACCCACCTG-3′ sense and 5′-GGCGAAGCTTGGATCCCTACACAGGTTGAGAGGGGCA-3′ antisense primers. The amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI and HindIII restriction endonucleases and ligated into M13mp18 Rf digested with the same enzymes. The sequence of the cloned DNA was determined by dideoxy sequencing on both strands. The expression vector pET15b was digested with XhoI, blunt-ended by filling in with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, and digested with BamHI restriction endonuclease. The DNA fragment encoding the NTRPCOLCE1 domain was excised from the sequencing vector with EcoRV and BamHI and ligated into the digested vector. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and plated on 2TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The sequences of the NTRPCOLCE1 inserts of the plasmids were verified by dideoxy sequencing after PCR amplification. Expression of NTRPCOLCE1—Ampicillin-resistant E. coli colonies were screened for protein expression in small volume cultures. Recombinant clones of E. coli were grown in 2-ml aliquots of 2TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °Ctoan A 600 of 0.4. Induction was started by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were grown for3hat37 °C, and the expression of recombinant protein was monitored by analyzing the cell lysates with SDS-PAGE. The clone secreting the largest amount of recombinant protein was chosen for large scale protein expression. 3 liters of 2TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with one colony of the appropriate E. coli clone and grown at 37 °Ctoan A 600 = 0.6. Cells were induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and were grown for 3 h at 37 °C. Isotopic Labeling of NTRPCOLCE1—Cells from 100-ml overnight cultures of the appropriate E. coli clone were collected by centrifugation (15 min 5000 × g), and the pellet was suspended in 3000 ml of M9 minimal medium containing 10 mm lactose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl and grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of about 1.2 to 1.6. Protein Purification—The cells were harvested by centrifugation with 5000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 180 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0. The cells were digested by addition of lysozyme to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml at 25 °C for 1 h and subsequently disrupted with an MSE ultrasonicator. Ribonuclease A was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 0.015 mg/ml, and the suspension was incubated for3hat37 °C. The insoluble material (containing the cloned protein in inclusion bodies) was collected by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 15 min) and washed three times with 150 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.0 buffer. The pellet was dissolved in 25 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm DTE and was incubated overnight at 25 °C with constant stirring. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 15 min), and the solubilized proteins were chromatographed on a Sephacryl S300 column equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the pure protein were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, diluted 10-fold with 100 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and dialyzed extensively against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. Dialyzed protein was filtered through a membrane (pore size 0.2 μm) and chromatographed on a 10-ml nickel-chelate column. The column was washed first with 100 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9), then with 100 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, pH 7.9), and finally with 100 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 m imidazole, pH 7.9). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing pure recombinant NTRPCOLCE1 were pooled, dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 buffer, and lyophilized. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, chromatographed on a Sephadex G-75 column, and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column. For enzymatic activity tests, the N-terminal His tag was removed by thrombin digestion. Recombinant protein was dissolved in 5 ml of PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated with 2 units of thrombin at 25 °C for 24 h. The reaction was arrested with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the digest was applied onto a nickel chelate column. Fractions containing the truncated protein were pooled, dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer at pH 8.0, and lyophilized. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column. The concentration of recombinant NTRPCOLCE1 was determined using a calculated extinction coefficient of 4200 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. N-terminal sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 471A protein sequencer with an on-line ABI 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Typical yields before thrombin cleavage were 5 mg of purified NTRPCOLCE1 per liter of cell culture. Activation of MMP-1 Proenzyme—10 μl of 0.1 μg/μl MMP-1 proenzyme was diluted in 40 μl of 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.005% Brij 35, pH 7.5 buffer, and 5 μl of 50 mm APMA dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH was added to the enzyme solution. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were made with a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) equipped with a thermoregulated sample chamber. The respective excitation (emission) wavelengths in the MMP assays were 280 (360) and 340 (490) nm in the TACE/ADAM17 measurements. 2-nm slits were used for both monochromators. Fluorescence assays were performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (TACE/ADAM17), or 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.05% Brij 35, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffers (MMPs) at 25 °C. The concentrations of the enzymes were 2–3 nm, and the thrombin-digested recombinant protein was used at concentrations of 1–15 μm. The concentrations of the fluorogenic substrates of TACE/ADAM17 (DABCYL-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Val-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg-EDANS) and MMPs (DNP-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Trp-Ala-d-Arg-NH2) were 5.3 and 5.6 μm, respectively. The enzyme reactions were followed for 10 min. Sequence Analyses—The sequences of human (Q15113; O14550), mouse (Q61398; O35113), and rat (O08628) PCOLCE1 sequences, human (Q9UKZ9) and mouse (Q8r4w6) PCOLCE2 sequences, and the sequence of the PCOLCE-related protein of the pufferfish Fugu rubripes (AF016494) were from the NCBI data bases. Iterative homology searches with PCOLCE1 and PCOLCE2 as query sequences identified several ESTs corresponding to PCOLCE1 of pig (e.g. BI345440); PCOLCE2 of cow (e.g. BE846217 and BE846216); PCOLCE1 of the frog Xenopus laevis (e.g. BC046734) and PCOLCE2 of the frog Xenopus tropicalis (e.g. AL628110T); and ESTs of PCOLCE-related proteins of zebrafish (e.g. BM316915, AW232258), salmon (e.g. CA055431, CA050779), and rainbow trout (e.g. BX082880 and BX081250). Multiple alignments of the amino acid sequences of NTR domains were constructed using ClustalW (13Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 12: 4673-4680Crossref Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—MMP-1 proenzyme was activated according to the protocol of the manufacturer as follows. 10 μl of 0.1 μg/μl MMP-1 proenzyme was diluted in 40 μl of 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.005% Brij 35 (Merck), pH 7.5 buffer; 5 μl of 50 mm APMA dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH was added to the enzyme solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The activities of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 (2–3 nm) were determined using DNP-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Trp-Ala-d-Arg-NH2 as substrate (5.6 μm) in 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.05% Brij 35, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0 buffer, at 25 °C. TACE/ADAM17 (2 nm) was assayed with DABCYL-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Val-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg-EDANS (5.3 μm) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. The reaction was followed for 10 min in the Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer. The activity of bovine trypsin and human plasma kallikrein on synthetic peptide-pNA substrates was monitored spectrophotometrically using a Cary 300 Scan spectrophotometer. Hydrolysis of peptide-pNA conjugates was monitored at 410 nm, and the initial rates of the reaction were determined. In the case of human plasma kallikrein the enzyme (3 nm) was preincubated for 30 min at 37 °Cin50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 7.5 buffer, in the presence of increasing concentrations of thrombin-digested recombinant NTRPCOLCE1 (10–60 μm), and the reactions were initiated by adding the substrate d-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA at 650 μm final concentration. Bovine trypsin (30 nm) was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5 buffer, with thrombin-digested recombinant NTRPCOLCE1 (1–10 μm), and the reaction was initiated by adding the substrate Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA at 100 μm final concentration. NMR Measurements—NMR spectra were recorded at pH 5.5 and 7.5, 28 °C, using ∼ 1 mm solutions of the NTRPCOLCE1 construct of Fig. 1A including the His tag. Samples were prepared in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O and measured at 1H NMR frequencies of 600 and 800 MHz on Bruker DMX 600 and Varian Unity INOVA 800 NMR spectrometers, respectively. The final structure determination was based on data recorded at pH 5.5. Sequence-specific resonance assignments (Fig. 2) were obtained from double-quantum filtered two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY), clean-TOCSY (70 ms mixing time), and NOESY (40 ms and 100 ms mixing time) spectra, recorded with unlabeled protein in H2O and D2O solution at 600 and 800 MHz. In addition, three-dimensional NOESY-15N-HSQC (60-ms mixing time) and TOCSY-15N-HSQC (80-ms mixing time) experiments were recorded in H2O solution on a 15N-labeled protein sample. Most of the NOE restraints were collected from a homonuclear NOESY spectrum recorded at 800 MHz with a sample of unlabeled PCOLCE1 in H2O at pH 5.5 (40-ms mixing time, t 1max = 100 ms and t 2max = 227.5 ms, 3:9:19 water suppression, 5 days total recording time). The NOE assignments were facilitated by comparison with data recorded at pH 7.5. Stereospecific assignments of CβH2-protons were obtained by a HNHB spectrum. 3 J(HN,Hα) couplings were measured by a CT-HMQC-HN experiment (14Ponstingl H. Otting G. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as well as by using the program INFIT to fit the line shapes observed in a 15N-HSQC spectrum recorded with a purge-pulse (15Szyperski T. Güntert P. Otting G. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 552-560Google Scholar). Residual 1H-15N dipolar couplings were measured in a liquid crystal formed with 8% C12E6/n-hexanol (16Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar), using a 15N-HSQC spectrum with α/β half-filter (17Andersson P. Weigelt J. Otting G. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Fig. 215N-HSQC spectrum of the NTRPCOLCE1 module. The spectrum was recorded using a 1 mm sample of uniformly 15N-labeled NTRPCOLCE1 at pH 5.5 and 28 °C at a 1H NMR frequency of 600 MHz. Backbone resonances are assigned with the amino acid types and sequence numbers. Side chain resonances are labeled with lowercase letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NMR Spectral Evaluation—The NMR data were processed with the program PROSA (18Güntert P. Dötsch V. Wider G. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 619-629Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The cross-peaks in the NOESY spectra were assigned and integrated using the program XEASY (19Bartels C. Xia T. Güntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). 3 J(Hα,Hβ) couplings were estimated as 11.0 and 4.0 Hz (±3.0 Hz), respectively, when COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY cross-peaks indicated the presence of large and small couplings, respectively, together with staggered conformations around the Cα-Cβ bond. Structure Calculations and Evaluation—The NMR structure was calculated using the program DYANA (20Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) starting from 50 random conformers. As no long range NOE could be observed for the first 23 residues, only residues 24–154 were included in the structure calculations. The 20 conformers with the lowest residual restraint violations were energy-minimized in water using the program OPAL (21Luginbühl P. Güntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 136-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with standard parameters. The program PALES was used for a best fit of experimental and residual 1H-15N dipolar couplings predicted from the structure (22Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot was analyzed using PROCHECK-NMR (23Laskowski M. Kato I. Ardelt W. Cook J. Denton A. Empie M.W. Kohr W.J. Park S.J. Parks K. Schatzley B.L. Schoenberger O.L. Tashiro M. Vichot G. Whatley H.E. Wieczorek A. Wieczorek M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 202-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Table I shows an overview of the restraints used and structural statistics. Secondary structure elements and root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values were calculated using the program MOLMOL (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) which was also used to create Figs. 3 and 4. Side chain solvent accessibilities were measured with a spherical probe of 1.4 Å radius and calculated in percent of the accessibilities measured for a fully extended side chain of residue X in a helical Gly-X-Gly peptide (25Sevilla-Sierra P. Otting G. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 235: 1003-1020Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

The superposition of BPTI and PSTI was achieved by superposition of the proteinases in the BPTI·thrombin-E192Q and PSTI·trypsinogen complexes, respectively. The NTRPCOLCE1 domain was superimposed for best fit of the backbone surrounding Lys-32. The arrow identifies the P1 site in BPTI and PSTI. In addition, two selected residues in the NTRPCOLCE1 domain are labeled.

The Cα atoms of the residues in the P1–P3 and P1′–P3′ sites of the inhibitors are identified. Spheres mark the N- and C-atoms of the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively, of the polypeptide segments. The following colors were used for the side chains: blue, Arg, Lys; yellow, Ala, Cys, Ile, Pro; gray, Asn, Gln, Thr, Tyr. C, sequence alignment of the inhibitor segments shown in B. Boxes identify residues with closely superimposable backbones.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NMR Spectra—The line widths observed in the NMR spectra of the NTRPCOLCE1 domain were characteristic of a monomeric protein (Fig. 2). Particularly narrow resonances were observed for the N-terminal 24 and the C-terminal 4 residues, indicating increased mobility for these polypeptide segments on a nanosecond time scale. Pro-25 and Pro-150 thus mark the boundaries of the structured domain. The amide proton resonances of the N-terminal 11 residues and of His-20 could not be observed, presumably because of exchange broadening. No NOEs could be observed for the side chain NH2 resonances of Gln-33, Gln-100, and Gln-152, prohibiting their assignment. The protein contains 17 proline residues. Because of spectral overlap, only incomplete resonance assignments were obtained for the proline residues 25, 86, 103, 125, and 126. Pro-102 is the only residue for which a cis-peptide bond was identified. Besides Pro-126, this is the only proline residue which is totally conserved in all known PCOLCE proteins (Fig. 1B). Structural Statistics—The number of restraints and the final r.m.s.d. values are characteristic of a well determined structure. No residue was found in th"
https://openalex.org/W2112586296,"Based on the hygiene hypothesis that lack of early childhood bacterial infections would favor development of allergic disease, we hypothesize that genes controlling antibacterial resistance may be important as well. We, therefore, studied whether Nramp1 alleles that determine resistance (Nramp1r) or susceptibility (Nramp1s) to intracellular bacteria at the macrophage level affect sensitivity to induction of allergic asthma. Nramp1s and congenic Nramp1r mice were sensitized with ovalbumin/alum on days 0 and 14 and challenged with ovalbumin or saline aerosols on days 42, 45, and 48. On day 49, airway responsiveness was assessed, blood was withdrawn, and lung lavage was performed. We demonstrated that ovalbumin sensitization and challenge of Nramp1s and Nramp1r mice caused comparable airway hyperreactivity and airway eosinophilia and a similar increase in serum levels of ovalbumin-specific IgG1 and IgG2a. Ovalbumin challenge, however, induced significantly lower serum levels of total and ovalbumin-specific IgE and significantly lower mast cell degranulation in Nramp1r mice as compared with Nramp1s mice. In addition, ovalbumin challenge of Nramp1r mice led to significantly less release of Th2 cytokines into the airways. Results show that Nramp1 can affect the development of allergy but not the development of airway hyperresponsiveness in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2060211243,"Recently, we reported the cloning and preliminary characterization of a novel human immunomodulator named PLIF (placenta immunomodulatory ferritin). PLIF has a unique molecular structure, which is composed of a ferritin heavy chain-like domain and a novel cytokine-like domain called C48. Both intact molecule and C48 inhibit T cell proliferation following allogeneic or anti-CD3 stimuli. PLIF is localized at the fetal-maternal interface of human placenta and might play a role in down-modulating the maternal immune reaction toward the embryo. The inhibitory effect of PLIF on T cell activation can be direct, indirect through cytokine mediators, or both. In the present study we investigated the possible indirect effects of PLIF by using its bioactive domain C48. Measurement of various cytokines revealed that C48, predominantly, induce pronounced and rapid IL-10 production in monocytes, which is immune activation-independent. Further, we discovered that C48-induced IL-10 production is mediated through a calcium/calmodulin-p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. However, extracellular signal-related kinases1,2 (ERK1,2), also activated by C48 stimulation, exhibited a limiting effect on IL-10 production."
