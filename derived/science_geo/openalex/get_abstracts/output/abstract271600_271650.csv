https://openalex.org/W2014323961,The outcome of competition among three species of anuran tadpoles in replicated artificial pond communities depends on the density of predatory salamanders present in the community. Predators differentially affect the survival of anuran species to metamorphosis and reverse the pattern of anuran relative abundance resulting from interspecific competition among tadpoles in the absence of predators.

The infants sometimes initiate these confrontations by approaching and provoking immigrant males when protective males are close by. Mothers rarely interfere during these interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2041544257,"Magnetotactic bacteria are present in fresh water and marine sediments of Fortaleza, Brazil, situated close to the geomagnetic equator. Both South-seeking and North-seeking bacteria are present in roughly equal numbers in the same samples. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the vertical component of the geomagnetic field selects the predominant polarity type among magnetotactic bacteria in natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W2059688353,"Cladistic analyses of chromosomal banding patterns from 48 species of cryptodiran turtles, combined with a fossil-based method for estimating rates of karyotypic change, show that karyotypic evolution was twice as fast and involved different types of rearrangements in Mesozoic turtles when compared to more recent forms. The deceleration in rate of karyotypic change is correlated with decelerated morphological change and is indicative of adaptive evolution. Comparisons of banded karyotypes reveal that some chromosomes have remained unchanged for at least 200 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2007326113,"A combination of equations describing diffusion, gas solubility, and mass conservation yields a general relation for oxygen transport in hemoglobin solutions. Total oxygen flux is shown to be the sum of the flux in the plasma and the flux due to transport by hemoglobin. The total flux depends not only on oxygen concentration gradient but also on absolute oxygen concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1998198377,"The combustion of western U.S. coals releases significant amounts of strontium, which is relatively enriched in the fine particles of fly ash. Fly ash-derived strontium is readily absorbed by agronomic and native plant species when incorporated in soil. The strontium-87 to strontium-86 ratios of fly ash and soils were significantly different, but similar ratios were found in fly ash and plants treated with fly ash. A technique for measuring and monitoring deposition from coal-fired power plants is inferred from the enhanced plant uptake of fly ash strontium and the similarity in the isotopic ratios of fly ash and treated plants."
https://openalex.org/W2071821809,Evoked electric responses of the auditory cortex of unanesthetized cats were studied by averaging techniques which enable us to detect responses in high-level background activity without sacrificing bandwidth. The results suggest that previous studies on evoked responses from behaving animals that are based upon ink-written electroencephalographic displays were chiefly concerned with a set of response components that differ from the classical evoked potentials in anesthetized animals.
https://openalex.org/W2016062938,Voltage-dependent outward current measured in the dark is reduced after illumination. This reduction can be blocked by tetraethylammonium and is associated with a decrease in total membrane conductance. The voltage dependence of the current reduced by light is the same as that of the delayed rectifier. These results indicate that light modulates the delayed rectifier. This modulation serves to maintain a stable voltage response to constant illumination.

https://openalex.org/W2033320832,"X-ray analyses of some Recent desert lacustrine sediments in Nevada, California, and Oregon show that illite and montmorillonite are the most abundant clay minerals and that chlorite and kaolinite are present in subordinate amounts in the sediments of many of the lakes. These clay suites are derived from source rocks."

https://openalex.org/W2064032612,"The effects of various dosages of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, monocalcium phosphate, calcium chloride, and potassium chloride on the uptake of radiostrontium by Thatcher wheat grown in Saskatchewan Oxbow loam soil containing strontium-85 were studied. Monocalcium phosphate at a dose level of about 600 lb/acre of soil effected a statistically significant reduction of strontium-85 uptake in each of the four plant fractions of grain, chaff, stem, and leaf. At the very reasonable dosage of about 60 lb/acre, monocalcium phosphate gave a statistically significant reduction in strontium-85 uptake in the grain and chaff."
