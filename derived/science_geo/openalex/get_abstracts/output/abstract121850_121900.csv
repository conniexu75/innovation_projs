https://openalex.org/W2025421728,"Liver regeneration stimulated by a loss of liver mass leads to hepatocyte and nonparenchymal cell proliferation and rapid restoration of liver parenchyma. Mice with targeted disruption of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene had impaired liver regeneration characterized by liver necrosis and failure. There was a blunted DNA synthetic response in hepatocytes of these mice but not in nonparenchymal liver cells. Furthermore, there were discrete G1 phase (prereplicative stage in the cell cycle) abnormalities including absence of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3) activation and depressed AP-1, Myc, and cyclin D1 expression. Treatment of IL-6-deficient mice with a single preoperative dose of IL-6 returned STAT3 binding, gene expression, and hepatocyte proliferation to near normal and prevented liver damage, establishing that IL-6 is a critical component of the regenerative response."

Melanoma cells were found to express Fas (also called Apo-1 or CD95) ligand (FasL). In metastatic lesions, Fas-expressing T cell infiltrates were proximal to FasL+ tumor cells. In vitro, apoptosis of Fas-sensitive target cells occurred upon incubation with melanoma tumor cells; and in vivo, injection of FasL+ mouse melanoma cells in mice led to rapid tumor formation. In contrast, tumorigenesis was delayed in Fas-deficient lpr mutant mice in which immune effector cells cannot be killed by FasL. Thus, FasL may contribute to the immune privilege of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1965252702,"Aminoglycoside antibiotics that bind to 30S ribosomal A-site RNA cause misreading of the genetic code and inhibit translocation. The aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin binds specifically to an RNA oligonucleotide that contains the 30S subunit A site, and the solution structure of the RNA-paromomycin complex was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The antibiotic binds in the major groove of the model A-site RNA within a pocket created by an A-A base pair and a single bulged adenine. Specific interactions occur between aminoglycoside chemical groups important for antibiotic activity and conserved nucleotides in the RNA. The structure explains binding of diverse aminoglycosides to the ribosome, their specific activity against prokaryotic organisms, and various resistance mechanisms, and provides insight into ribosome function."
https://openalex.org/W1991743392,"Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is a commonly prescribed drug with a wide pharmacological spectrum. At concentrations compatible with amounts in plasma during chronic anti-inflammatory therapy, acetylsalicylic acid and its metabolite sodium salicylate were found to be protective against neurotoxicity elicited by the excitatory amino acid glutamate in rat primary neuronal cultures and hippocampal slices. The site of action of the drugs appeared to be downstream of glutamate receptors and to involve specific inhibition of glutamate-mediated induction of nuclear factor kappa B. These results may contribute to the emerging theme of anti-inflammatory drugs and neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2012290967,"Despite its high prevalence, very little is known regarding genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. A genome-wide scan performed in 66 high-risk prostate cancer families has provided evidence of linkage to the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q24-25). Analysis of an additional set of 25 North American and Swedish families with markers in this region resulted in significant evidence of linkage in the combined set of 91 families. The data provide strong evidence of a major prostate cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 1."
https://openalex.org/W2060952287,"Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are small cytoplasmic proteins that are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner and bind to fatty acids such as oleic and retinoic acid. Mice with a null mutation in aP2, the gene encoding the adipocyte FABP, were developmentally and metabolically normal. The aP2-deficient mice developed dietary obesity but, unlike control mice, they did not develop insulin resistance or diabetes. Also unlike their obese wild-type counterparts, obese aP2-/- animals failed to express in adipose tissue tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a molecule implicated in obesity-related insulin resistance. These results indicate that aP2 is central to the pathway that links obesity to insulin resistance, possibly by linking fatty acid metabolism to expression of TNF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2038307719,"The regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by phosphorylation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that eNOS is tyrosine-phosphorylated in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) using 32P metabolic labeling followed by phosphoamino acid analysis and by phosphotyrosine specific Western blotting. Treatment of BAEC with hydrogen peroxide and the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, increases eNOS tyrosine phosphorylation. Utilizing a novel immunoNOS assay, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation is associated with a 50% decrease in the specific activity of the enzyme. Because eNOS is localized in plasmalemma caveolae, we examined if tyrosine phosphorylated eNOS interacts with caveolin-1, the coat protein of caveolae. Immunoprecipitation of eNOS from bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells resulted in the co-precipitation of caveolin-1. Conversely, immunoprecipitation of caveolin-1 resulted in the co-precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated eNOS. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is a novel regulatory mechanism for eNOS and caveolin-1 is the first eNOS-associated protein. Collectively, these observations provide a novel regulatory mechanism for eNOS and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may influence its activity, subcellular trafficking, and interaction with other caveolin-interacting proteins in caveolae.

https://openalex.org/W2088019468,"The Caenorhabditis elegans dauer larva is specialized for dispersal without growth and is formed under conditions of overcrowding and limited food. The daf-7 gene, required for transducing environmental cues that support continuous development with plentiful food, encodes a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily member. A daf-7 reporter construct is expressed in the ASI chemosensory neurons. Dauer-inducing pheromone inhibits daf-7 expression and promotes dauer formation, whereas food reactivates daf-7 expression and promotes recovery from the dauer state. When the food/pheromone ratio is high, the level of daf-7 mRNA peaks during the L1 larval stage, when commitment to non-dauer development is made."
https://openalex.org/W2082788676,"We have studied whether various agents that inhibit purified yeast and mammalian 26 S proteasome can suppress the breakdown of different classes of proteins in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The degradation of short-lived proteins was inhibited reversibly by peptide aldehyde inhibitors of proteasomes, carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132) and carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norvalinal (MG115), in a yeast mutant with enhanced permeability, but not in wild-type strains. Lactacystin, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, had no effect, but the β-lactone derivative of lactacystin, which directly reacts with proteasomes, inhibited the degradation of short-lived proteins. These inhibitors also blocked the rapid ubiquitin-dependent breakdown of a β-galactosidase fusion protein and caused accumulation of enzymatically active molecules in cells. The degradation of the bulk of cell proteins, which are long-lived molecules, was not blocked by proteasome inhibitors, but could be blocked by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This agent, which inhibits multiple vacuolar proteases, did not affect the proteasome or breakdown of short-lived proteins. These two classes of inhibitors can thus be used to distinguish the cytosolic and vacuolar proteolytic pathways and to increase the cellular content of short-lived proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2065568194,"The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family includes extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38/RK/CSBP (p38) as structurally and functionally distinct enzyme classes. Here we describe two new dual specificity phosphatases of the CL100/MKP-1 family that are selective for inactivating ERK or JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in COS-7 cells. M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases. Although stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKβ, p46 SAPKγ (JNK1) or p38 MAP kinases is abolished upon co-transfection with increasing amounts of M3/6 plasmid, epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1 is remarkably insensitive even to the highest levels of M3/6 expression obtained. In contrast to M3/6, the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-3 is selective for inactivation of ERK family MAP kinases. Low level expression of MKP-3 blocks totally epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1, whereas stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKβ and p38 MAP kinases is inhibited only partially under identical conditions. Selective regulation by M3/6 and MKP-3 was also observed upon chronic MAP kinase activation by constitutive p21ras GTPases. Hence, although M3/6 expression effectively blocked p54 SAPKβ activation by p21rac (G12V), ERK1 activated by p21ras (G12V) was insensitive to this phosphatase. ERK1 activation by oncogenic p21ras was, however, blocked totally by co-expression of MKP-3.

Although ERK1 is stimulated by EGF, H2O2, and menadione (vitamin K), p54 SAPKβ and p38 are activated following cellular exposure to anisomycin, sodium arsenite, H2O2, UV light, and sorbitol. p38 MAP kinase but not p54 SAPKβ also undergoes activation by menadione (Fig. 1). EGF (ERK1), UV (p54 SAPKβ), and H202 (p38) were selected as stimuli to test inhibitory regulation by dual specificity phosphatases.M3/6 has been expressed previously in COS cells and shown to be ineffective as an inhibitor of serum-stimulated ERK2 phosphorylation (44Theodosiou A.M.

In accordance with these observations, although increasing the concentration of Myc-M3/6 plasmid in transfections from 0.1 to 2.0 µg resulted in a dose-dependent increase in immunodetectable Myc-tagged protein (not shown), EGF-dependent enzymatic activation of ERK1 was inhibited less than 30% even at the maximum levels of M3/6 obtained (Fig. 2). Interestingly, however, parallel experiments demonstrated clearly that M3/6 blocks stress-induced activation of both p54 SAPKβ and p38 MAP kinases with maximal inhibition observed when cells were transfected using only 0.5-1.0 µg of plasmid (Fig. 2). Identical inhibition by M3/6 was observed when p54 SAPKβ and p38 MAP kinases were activated by UV, anisomycin, or H2O2. Also, p46 HA-SAPKγ (JNK1) activated by anisomycin is inhibited identically over the range of M3/6 expression levels obtained in COS-7 cells (not shown). Together, these observations demonstrate that M3/6 displays highly selective inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in mammalian cells.Fig. 2Selective inhibition of SAPKβ and p38 MAP kinases by M3/6. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with either HA-ERK1, HA-SAPKβ, or HA-p38 MAP kinase (1.0 µg of plasmid) together with 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 µg of Myc-M3/6 plasmid as indicated. Plasmid concentrations were maintained constant using PMT-SM vector. After 40 h of growth and 2 h of serum starvation, cells were stimulated using 10 nM EGF (ERK1), 100 J/M2 UV light (SAPKβ), or 0.5 mM H2O2 (p38) followed by immunoprecipation of the tagged MAP kinase and immune complex assay using myelin basic protein (ERK1), GST-c-Jun (SAPKβ), or GST-ATF-2 (p38) as substrate.

In a more detailed analysis we have now co-transfected ERK1 with a range of Myc-MKP-3 plasmid levels (0.1-2.0 µg), which results in a dose-dependent increase in immunodetectable protein (not shown). This approach demonstrates that MKP-3 also blocks EGF-stimulated ERK1 activation and that this inhibition is maximal when cells are transfected with 0.5-1.0 µg of MKP-3 plasmid (Fig. 3). Basal ERK1 activity is also abolished when cells are transfected with 1.0 µg or more of MKP-3 plasmid (Fig. 3). In contrast to observations with ERK1 and ERK2, stress-activated p54 SAPKβ or p38 MAP kinases were suppressed only partially using 0.5-1.0 µg of plasmid with near complete blockade observed only when cells were co-transfected with 2.0 µg of MKP-3 plasmid (Fig. 3). These observations demonstrate that MKP-3 appears highly selective for inactivation of the ERK family of MAP kinases.Fig. 3Selective inhibition of ERK1 activation by MKP-3. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-ERK1, HA-SAPKβ, or HA-p38 MAP kinases (1.0 µg of plasmid) together with 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 µg of Myc-MKP-3 plasmid as indicated with empty PMT-SM used to control total plasmid levels. Following 40 h of growth and 2 h of serum starvation, cells were stimulated with 10 nM EGF (ERK1), 100 J/M2 UV light (SAPKβ), or 0.5 mM H2O2 (p38) followed by immunoprecipitation and immuno complex assays using myelin basic protein (ERK1), GST-c-Jun (SAPKβ), or GST-ATF-2 (p38) as substrate.

For instance, constitutively active p21ras (G12V) stimulates activation of ERK (8Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and this may underlie mitogenesis and cellular transformation by this oncogene (19Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 46Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown that mutationally activated versions of the p21rho GTPase family members p21cdc42 and p21rac elicit enzymatic activation of both JNK/SAPK and p38 but not ERK MAP kinases (10Coso O.A.

Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p21cdc42 and p21rac also stimulate DNA synthesis and appear to play a critical role mediating mitogenesis and transformation by oncogenic p21ras (47Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 48Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). To test whether M3/6 or MKP-3 retain their activity and selectivity for inhibiting MAP kinases undergoing oncogenic activation, COS-7 cells were triple transfected with constitutively activate p21ras (G12V) or p21rac1 (G12V) together with different MAP kinases and increasing concentrations of plasmid for MKP-3 or M3/6. This experiment shows clearly that as with acute stimulation, M3/6 inhibited effectively p54 SAPKβ activation by constitutive p21rac (G12V) (Fig. 4). Also, as observed with short term exposure to growth factor, MKP-3 blocked ERK1 activation by oncogenic p21ras (G12V) (Fig. 4), whereas M3/6 was completely ineffective (not shown). Importantly, co-transfection with increasing concentration of either MKP-3 or M3/6 plasmid does not alter the level of immunodetectable p54 HA-SAPKβ or HA-ERK1 (Fig. 4). The ability of MKP-3 to suppress chronic MAP kinase activation by p21ras (G12V) together with its clear selectivity for ERK family members could indicate a physiological role as an inhibitor of proliferation or even a tumor suppressor.Fig. 4M3/6 and MKP-3 inhibit SAPKβ and ERK1 activation by constitutive p21rac (G12V) and p21ras (G12V). COS-7 cells were triple transfected with p21rac (RacV12) (0.5 µg of plasmid) or p21ras (RasV12) (0.25 µg of plasmid) as well as HA-SAPKβ or HA-ERK1 (1.0 µg of plasmid) together with 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 µg of plasmid expressing Myc-M3/6 or Myc-MKP-3 as indicated. Following 24 h of growth and 16 h of serum starvation, cells were homogenized, and the MAP kinases were immunoprecipitated for immune complex assays using GST-ATF2 (SAPKβ) or myelin basic protein (ERK1) as substrate. A, autoradiograph of phosphorylated substrates separated using a 15% gel. Bands were excised for counting by scintillation spectrometry and calculation of relative kinase activity, which is indicated numerically below each lane. Basal MAP kinase activity in cells not expressing p21rac (G12V) or p21ras (G12V) is defined as 1.0.

The remarkable inactivity of M3/6 against ERK family members indicates a high degree of specificity between MAP kinase family members and has not been demonstrated previously for any phosphatase of this class. These observations with M3/6 and MKP-3 are distinct from experiments using the dual specificity phosphatases PAC1, MKP-2, and CL100/MKP-1, which appear moderately selective when expressed in mammalian cells (49Chu Y.

Our data on selective enzymatic inhibition indicate that regulated expression of MKP-3 and M3/6 could be a critical parameter in both short and long term control of cell function by different MAP kinases. MKP-3 and M3/6 are unique amongst dual specificity phosphatases insofar that they are both localized in cytosolic compartments (40Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.-C. Martinou I. Camps M.

Nucleotide hydrolysis by some G proteins is controlled extrinsically by activating proteins known as GAPs, and the G protein GAPs described previously are known effectors of the α subunit with which they interact (1Ross E.M.

Thus, phospholipase C-β1 is activated by Gqα and, in turn, increases the kcat for nucleotide hydrolysis by Gqα by roughly 100-fold (2Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M.

We demonstrated that two of these proteins, RGS4 and GAIP, act as GAPs on several members of the Gi subfamily of α subunits (20Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this effect and the possibility of other functional relationships between these GAPs and their target G proteins remained unclear. We demonstrate herein that purified recombinant RGS4 acts catalytically to accelerate the GTPase activity of Gi protein family members, that RGS4 has high affinity for the transition state complex of the G protein α subunit bound to GDP-AlF4− (but low affinity for GTPγS-α and GDP-α), and that the rank order of affinities of RGS4 for transition state complexes of α subunits is Gi family > Gq≫ Gs. RGS4 has no detectable GAP activity toward Gsα or G12α. Gsα, Giα1, and Goα were expressed and purified as described (21Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), as were Gzα and G12α (22Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); Giα1 and Goα were myristoylated unless stated otherwise. Bovine retinal Gtα was the generous gift of Dr. Heidi Hamm (University of Illinois College of Medicine), while recombinant Gqα was supplied by Dr. John Hepler (this laboratory) (23Hepler J.R.

Goα was activated with 100 µM GTPγS and 10 mM MgSO4 by incubation at 30°C for 60 min. The indicated GDP-bound α subunits were activated with AlF4− by incubation with 20 µM AlCl3, 10 mM NaF, and 10 mM MgSO4 for 10 min on ice. RGS4 (hexahistidine-tagged at the amino terminus) was synthesized in Escherichia coli as described previously (20Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), except that cells were incubated for 12 h at 30°C after induction. The bacterial lysate was purified on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) as described, except that 500 mM NaCl was included in the first wash. Ammonium sulfate (1.2 M final concentration) was added to the Ni-NTA column eluate, and this solution was applied to a 15-ml Phenyl-Sepharose FPLC column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a 100-ml continuous gradient of 50 mM Tris-HCl and 1.2 to 0.84 M (NH4)2SO4. Fractions were analyzed electrophoretically, and protein was pooled and dialyzed into 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM dithiothreitol prior to concentration and storage. The yield was 4 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Purified RGS4 was homogeneous based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 5), had the anticipated amino-terminal amino acid sequence, and displayed a single mass spectroscopic peak (Mr = 24,183; predicted, 24,188). GAP assays were performed using Goα as the substrate as described previously (20Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). This assay relies on formation of a complex between Goα and [γ-32P]GTP in the absence of Mg2+ and subsequent initiation of nucleotide hydrolysis by incubation of this complex at 4°C with Mg2+ and RGS4. A single round of hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is then monitored over 5 min by quantification of release of 32Pi. Direct measurement of the kcat for GTP hydrolysis by G12α and Gzα required an alternative protocol because of their slow rates of nucleotide exchange. G12α and Gzα were incubated with 5 µM [γ-32P]GTP (20-50 cpm/fmol) and 5 mM EDTA at 30°C for 30 min. Samples were then gel-filtered at 4°C through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% C12E10 to remove free GTP and Pi. GTPase activity was measured at 15°C in 50 µl of the same solution with addition of 8 mM MgSO4, 1 mM GTP (unlabeled), and the indicated concentration of RGS4. We reported previously that RGS4 and GAIP accelerate the rate of the GTPase reaction catalyzed by selected members of the Gi subfamily of α subunits by at least 40-fold; the concentrations of RGS proteins utilized in that study were in excess of those of the Gα protein substrates. Other GAPs have been shown to act catalytically (4Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Harris P.M. Self A.J.

Nature. 1988; 335: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and the same is true of RGS4. Thus, concentrations of RGS4 as low as 2.9 nM were sufficient to enhance the GTPase activity of 70 nM GTP-Goα (Fig. 1A), and the initial slopes of the curves in Fig. 1A (from 0 to 29 nM RGS4) are directly proportional to the RGS4 concentration. Thus, in this experiment, 1 mol of RGS4 catalyzed the turnover of 6 mol of GTP-Goα/min at a substrate (GTP-Goα) concentration that is probably more than 20-fold below the Km of GTP-Goα for RGS4. It would be necessary to saturate the substrate with RGS4 to estimate the maximal enhancement of the rate of GTP hydrolysis; the rate of hydrolysis of GTP is then too fast to measure with the methods used herein to monitor release of 32Pi. The maximal enhancement of the rate of GTP hydrolysis observed in this experiment was greater than 40-fold. Variation of the substrate (GTP-Goα) concentration permitted estimation of the Km for the interaction of GTP-Goα with RGS4 and the maximal rate of turnover of GTP-Goα by RGS4 (Fig. 1B). These values are 2.5 µM and 14/s, respectively, but should be considered estimates, since the substrate concentration was varied over a relatively limited range. This turnover rate could be limited by the maximal intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by Goα. The crystal structures of the GDP-AlF4− complexes of Giα1 (27Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and Gtα (28Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) revealed that AlF4− occupies the position normally taken by the γ-phosphate of GTP but, remarkably, that the fluorine atoms assume a square planar configuration about the central aluminum atom, in contrast to the tetrahedral geometry of a phosphate group. The AlF4− complex is octahedrally coordinated to a β-phosphate oxygen and to the putative hydrolytic water molecule. Furthermore, an Arg residue and a Gln residue that are known to be critical for catalysis are dramatically reoriented in the GDP-AlF4− structure (compared to their positions in the GTPγS-bound protein), contacting the fluorine atoms and the hydrolytic water. These facts (and others) argue that GDP-AlF4− is not a GTP analog but rather mimics the trigonal-bipyramidal species that is presumed to appear at or near the transition state of the SN2 reaction. These considerations have prompted examination of the interactions of RGS4 with the GDP-, GTPγS-, and GDP-AlF4−-bound forms of Goα by testing the capacity of these proteins to compete with GTP-Goα for its GAP. The basic assay is seen in Fig. 2A. Addition of 2 µM GDP-Goα or GTPγS-Goα to 200 nM [γ-32P]GTP-Goα had little or no observable effect on nucleotide hydrolysis stimulated by 29 nM RGS4. However, 2 µM GDP-AlF4−-Goα completely blocked the effect of RGS4, presumably by formation of a high affinity complex with the GAP. Free guanine nucleotide or the combination of AlCl3, NaF, and MgSO4 had no effect on nucleotide hydrolysis in these assays. Competition assays (at 150 nM GTP-Goα) with different concentrations of GTPγS-Goα or GDP-AlF4−-Goα highlight the preferential affinity of RGS4 for the transition state conformation of the G protein (Fig. 2B). Stimulated GTP hydrolysis is nearly completely inhibited at concentrations of GDP-AlF4−-Goα that approximate those of RGS4. The apparent Kd of RGS4 for GDP-AlF4−-Goα is thus below 100 nM. Again, GTPγS-Goα is a poor competitor (Fig. 2B), consistent with the Km for GTP-Goα estimated in Fig. 1B, as were the GTPγS-bound forms of Gzα, Giα1, and Giα3 (not shown). The competition assay just described was utilized to examine the interactions of RGS4 with other G protein α subunit family members. We demonstrated previously that RGS4 stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Giα1, Giα2, Giα3, and Goα. Giα1 and Goα were similarly effective in the competition assay as the GDP-AlF4−-bound species (Fig. 3). Two additional Gi subfamily members were also tested for interactions with RGS4. GDP-AlF4−-Gtα was an effective competitor (Fig. 3), indistinguishable from Giα1 and Goα. The kcat for GTP hydrolysis by Gzα was measured directly and was increased from its normal low value of 0.02/min to 0.12/min by 12 nM RGS4 (Fig. 4A). It thus seems likely that the GTPase activity of all Gi subfamily members is stimulated by RGS4. We have attempted direct estimation of affinities between GDP-AlF4−-bound α subunits and RGS4 by observation of surface plasmon resonance (Pharmacia Biosensor). Appropriate protein-protein interactions were detected, but the rate of dissociation of hexahistidine-tagged RGS4 from the Ni-NTA-derivatized chips of the Biosensor instrument was faster than the rate of dissociation of GDP-AlF4−-Goα from RGS4. Thus, we can only estimate an upper limit for the Kd from these experiments, roughly 100 nM.Fig. 4RGS4 stimulates the GTPase activity of Gzα but not G12α. [γ-32P]GTP Gzα and G12α substrates were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, [γ-32P]GTP-Gzα (2.4 nM) was incubated with (•) or without (▪) 12 nM RGS4, and the rate of GTP hydrolysis was measured at 15°C. B, [γ-32P]GTP-G12α (3 nM) was incubated with (•) or without (▪) 0.6 µM RGS4, and the initial rate of GTP hydrolysis was measured at 15°C. In both panels, data shown are averages of duplicate determinations from a single experiment, which is representative of three such experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also noted previously the inability of RGS4 (or GAIP) to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Gsα; accordingly, the GDP-AlF4−-bound form of Gsα did not compete with Goα (Fig. 3). Of interest, GDP-AlF4−-Gqα did interact with RGS4, although its apparent affinity for the protein is 10- to 100-fold or more lower than are those of the Gi subfamily members. However, the assumption that GDP-AlF4−-bound complexes of all G protein α subunits are transition-state mimics may be unwarranted. Gq must be reconstituted with an appropriate receptor to examine the effect of RGS4 on nucleotide hydrolysis; the rate of nucleotide exchange is too low to permit preparation of GTP-Gqα substrate by the present methods. A high concentration of RGS4 did not stimulate GTP hydrolysis by G12α, which proceeded with a kcat of 0.06/min at 15°C (Fig. 4B). The data presented above strongly imply formation of a high affinity complex between RGS4 and the GDP-AlF4−-bound forms of various Giα proteins. To demonstrate this directly and to prepare material for crystallographic analysis, we have performed gel filtration chromatography on mixtures of RGS4 and nonmyristoylated Giα1; the latter protein has been crystallized previously in various conformations. Gel-filtered separately, Giα1 and RGS4 elute from a Superdex 200 column at positions consistent with their monomeric molecular weights (Fig. 5A). After incubation of GDP-AlF4−-Giα1 with a modest molar excess of RGS4 on ice for 10 min, the gel filtration profile reveals formation of a complex of the two proteins, migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 70,000; free, excess RGS4 is also seen in its monomeric position (Fig. 5B). The GTPase activity of the Gln204→ Leu mutant of Giα1 is impaired severely. This protein does not interact with AlF4−, and its GTPase activity is not affected by RGS4 (20Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 27Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, this protein does not form a high affinity complex with RGS4 when incubated with AlCl3, NaF, and MgSO4 (Fig. 5C); the elution profiles of the two proteins correspond to those observed in Fig. 5A. We conclude that RGS4 has a relatively low affinity (greater than 1 µM) for its substrates, GTP-Giα family members, but interacts directly and with high affinity with the transition-state conformations of these α subunits. Stabilization of the transition state lowers the activation energy barrier for hydrolysis of GTP, accounting for the large rate enhancements that are seen. We surmise that RGS4 is not an effector for Giα proteins, based on the relatively poor affinity of RGS4 for their GTPγS-bound forms compared to those of other known effectors of G protein α subunits. We note, however, that some other RGS proteins are considerably larger than are RGS4 or GAIP, and generalization of this point may be unwarranted. Finally, we call attention to the recent observation by Mittal et al. (29Mittal R. Zhmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) that wild-type p21ras protein interacts with AlF4− only in the presence of its GAPs. Thus, the ground state of p21ras must be too distant, conformationally, from the transition state to recognize AlF4− (unlike heterotrimeric G proteins), but GAPs for low molecular weight GTPases and RGS proteins both appear to act predominantly by stabilizing the transition states for nucleotide hydrolysis and not by elevating the energy level of the enzyme-substrate complex. We thank Drs. Andre Raw, Carmen Dessauer, Thomas Wilkie, and Stephen Sprang for helpful suggestions."

The identity of molecules communicating Rac1 and Cdc42 to JNK/SAPK is poorly understood. In this regard, the observations that a kinase termed Pak1 binds in vitro Rac1 and Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner and that both Rac1 and Cdc42 activate JNK in several cell lines provided strong evidence supporting a role for Pak1 as the most upstream kinase connecting these GTPases to JNK. However, although expression of certain mutated, constitutively activated forms of Pak can induce JNK to a limited extent (9Brown J.L. Stoweres L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr.

Xu S. Hutchinson M. Marcus S. Cobb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar and see below). These observations prompted us to explore the possibility that kinases in addition to Pak might participate in signaling from GTP-binding proteins to JNK. A computer-assisted search for proteins containing Pak-related Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domains (12Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 838-935Google Scholar) of highly related serine-threonine kinases as a potential candidate for this function. In this study, we found that MLK3 overexpression is sufficient to potently activate JNK. Furthermore, we present evidence that MLK3 binds the GTP-binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 in vivo and that a dominant negative mutant of MLK3 abolishes activation of JNK by Rac1 and Cdc42. In addition, we found that MLK3 does not activate p38, suggesting that JNK and p38 are regulated by distinct signaling pathways. Taken together, these data suggest that members of the MLK family of highly related kinases link small GTP-binding proteins to the JNK signaling pathway.

JNK assays in cells transfected with an epitope-tagged JNK (HA-JNK) were carried out as described previously (7Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Pak kinase and MLK3 kinase assays in cells transfected with an epitope-tagged Pak1 (HA-Pak1) and an epitope-tagged MLK3 (HA-MLK3) were determined upon immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA specific monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Babco). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in kinase reaction buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM MnCl2). Kinase assays were performed using myelin basic protein as a substrate, similar to that for HA-MAPK. Immunocomplex-kinase reactions were fractionated by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels, and autoradiography was performed with the aid of an intensifying screen. Lysates containing approximately 50 μg of total cellular protein or anti-HA (12CA5, Babco) or anti-AU5 (Babco) immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp.) using goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Cappel). Serum anti-Pak1, MLK3, MKK4 (SEK), ERK2, JNK1, and p38 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Pak-related kinases have been proposed to mediate the activation of JNK by two small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, Rac1 and Cdc42 (7Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). However, although expression of activated forms of Pak1 results in a limited increase in JNK activity (9Brown J.L. Stoweres L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), when wild type Pak1 was coexpressed with activated, GTPase-deficient forms of Rac1 and Cdc42, it diminished rather than enhanced JNK activation (Fig. 1). Similar results were recently reported by others (11Frost J. Xu S. Hutchinson M. Marcus S. Cobb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For our experiments, we used epitope-tagged forms of Rac1 and Cdc42, thereby allowing us to confirm that Pak1 overexpression does not affect the expression of these small GTP-binding proteins (Fig. 1). Thus, based upon these data, we hypothesized that a kinase in addition to or other than Pak might participate in JNK activation by small GTPases. We searched the GenBank™ for proteins containing areas of homology to that in Pak1 that is involved in binding to Rac1 and Cdc42 (17Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Similar analysis was recently reported by Burbelo et al. (12Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), leading to the identification of a conserved protein domain that was termed Pak-related CRIB domain (12Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Among these CRIB-containing proteins, only two kinases unrelated to Pak were identified, MLK3 (18Ing Y.L. Leung I.W.L. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Lassam N.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar), also known as PTK1 (13Ezoe K. Lee S.-T. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 838-935Google Scholar), or src-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase (19Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and MLK2 (20Katoh M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Teramda M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar), also known as MST (20Katoh M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Teramda M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar). MLK3 is expressed in most tissues and cell lines (13Ezoe K. Lee S.-T. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 838-935Google Scholar, 18Ing Y.L. Leung I.W.L. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Lassam N.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar) and is related to the previously described MLK1 and MLK2 (20Katoh M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Teramda M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar). MLK3 of human origin is a protein kinase containing a N-terminal SH3 domain followed by a CRIB domain, a kinase catalytic domain, a leucine zipper-like domain, and a carboxyl proline-rich region (12; 13). The function of the MLK family of related kinases is still unknown, but because kinases other than Pak might mediate JNK activation by small GTPases and the finding of a CRIB domain in MLK3 and MLK2, we set out to explore a role for this family of kinases in signaling to the JNK pathway. Initially, we asked whether co-expression of MLK3 could enhance the activity of an epitope-tagged JNK. We observed that MLK3 was highly expressed upon transfection in COS-7 cells, as judged by Western blotting with anti-MLK3 serum. A faint band of approximately 95 kDa was detected in control cells, and a very prominent band was readily observed in MLK3 transfected COS-7 cells (see below). Surprisingly, expression of MLK3 in COS-7 cells led to a nearly 20-fold increase in the in vitro phosphorylating activity of JNK (Fig. 1). Furthermore, MLK3 overexpression enhanced JNK stimulation when induced by Cdc42 QL and Rac1 QL. We next asked whether MLK3 can also activate MAPK or p38. As shown in Fig. 2, MLK3 was highly expressed when co-transfected with epitope-tagged MAPK, JNK, or p38 (Fig. 2). However, overexpression of MLK3 potently stimulated JNK activity, but not MAPK or p38, although these kinases were effectively activated by epidermal growth factor or anisomycin treatment, respectively. Thus, we conclude that MLK3, when overexpressed in COS-7 cells, can specifically activate the JNK signaling pathway. Interestingly, whereas the pathway controlling MAPK is well understood, the mechanism of activation of p38 remains unknown. Thus, our observation raises the possibility of the existence of distinct biochemical routes regulating JNK and p38, which is currently being investigated. Recently, it has been shown that the isolated CRIB domain of MLK3 can associate in vitro to Rac1 and Cdc42 (12Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Thus, we next asked whether the full-length MLK3 protein can associate in vivo with Rac1 and Cdc42. As an approach, we coexpressed Pak1 or MLK3 cDNAs with AU5 epitope-tagged forms of activated Ras, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Each AU5-tagged small GTP-binding protein was detectably expressed to nearly identical levels (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed that Pak1 and MLK3 coimmunoprecipitated only with activated Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we did not detect Pak1 or MLK3 in parallel experiments using AU5-tagged wild type forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 (data not shown), thus suggesting that both Pak1 and MLK3 can physically associate in vivo with Rac1 and Cdc42 only in their active state. We then asked whether activated small GTP-binding can stimulate MLK3 kinase activity. We found that the expression of activated Ras or Rho fails to elevate the enzymatic activity of either HA-tagged Pak1 or HA-tagged MLK3 (data not shown). In contrast, the MBP phosphorylating activity of both Pak1 and MLK3 was enhanced when coexpressed with activated forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig. 3b). These observations and the potent activating effect of MLK3 on the JNK pathway prompted us to investigate whether MLK3 participates in signaling from Rac1 and Cdc42 to JNK. For that, a mutant of MLK3 was generated by replacing a lysine in position 144 for arginine. This lysine represents a highly conserved residue among catalytic domains of most protein kinases and is known to be critical for binding of ATP (21Kamps M. Taylor S. Sefton B. Nature. 1984; 310: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Analogous mutations prevent the enzymatic activity of other kinases and in some cases confer dominant negative activity (22Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J. Kolch W. Beck T. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, this mutation, designated MLK3 KR, would be expected to act as a dominant negative, kinase-deficient MLK3. As shown in Fig. 3b, both MLK3 and MLK3 KR were detectably expressed, as judged by Western blotting using an anti-MLK3 serum. The slower mobility of wild type MLK3 is likely to result from post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation, because when expressed in bacteria both MLK3 and MLK3 KR have identical mobilities in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Faster mobility of kinase inactive forms of MLK3 has been recently reported by others (19Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, we observed that whereas MLK3 overexpression enhanced JNK stimulation induced by Cdc42 and Rac1, the kinase-deficient mutant of MLK3, MLK3 KR, drastically reduced JNK stimulation by these GTPases. In contrast, MLK3 KR had no effect on JNK activation by MEKK, a putative downstream kinase (23Lange-Carter C. Pleiman C. Gardner A. Blumer K. Johnson G. Science. 1994; 260: 315-319Crossref Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that MLK3 is downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 and probably upstream of MEKK in a biochemical route linking these GTPases to JNK. As discussed above, it has been proposed that Rac1 and Cdc42 communicate with JNK utilizing a kinase cascade sequentially including MEKK and SEK (7Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Because our findings strongly suggest that MLK3 can potently induce JNK activation, we asked whether the pathway linking MLK3 to JNK involves an independent kinase cascade or whether MLK3 acts upstream of SEK to enhance JNK activity. As an approach, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with plasmids expressing the N-terminal domain of GST fused to a wild type SEK or a kinase-deficient mutant of SEK, SEK KR (14Sanchez I Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Western blotting with anti-SEK antibodies revealed that both GST-SEK and GST-SEK KR were detectably expressed. Expression of SEK WT in COS-7 cells led to a 1-2-fold increase in the in vitro phosphorylating activity of JNK and enhanced JNK stimulation induced by MLK3 and MEKK. In contrast, the dominant negative mutant of SEK, SEK KR, decreased effectively JNK stimulation by MLK3 and MEKK. These observations strongly suggest that the signaling pathways activated by MLK3 and MEKK in COS-7 cells converge at the level of SEK. These observations together with the previous results led us to propose that the pathway linking the small GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 to JNK involves, sequentially, MLK3, MEKK, and SEK (Fig. 5). Whether Pak1 plays a major role in signaling to JNK or whether its primary role is to connect small GTP-binding proteins to cytoskeletal components, or both warrants further investigation.Fig. 5The pathway linking Rac1-Cdc42 to JNK. Schematic representation of protein kinase cascades leading to the activation of JNK. In the mammalian JNK signaling route, JNK, SEK, and MEKK represent the first three hierarchical levels, and we postulate that MLK3 and PAK represent the most upstream kinase in this cascade. The broken line corresponds to an unidentified signaling pathway that may be involved in JNK activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The biological function of the MLK family of kinases is not known, but recent available evidence suggests a role for MLK3 in melanocyte proliferation (13Ezoe K.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar), contain a CRIB domain (12Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol.

Commun. 1994; 202: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), lack an obvious Cdc42 or Rac1 binding domain. Thus, although it is still possible that these kinases can associate directly or indirectly with small GTPases, these observations suggest that the MLK family of related kinases may mediate JNK activation by different stimuli, acting on Rac1- and Cdc42-dependent as well as -independent pathways. This question, as well as the potential role for the different MLK-related kinases in signaling from distinct classes of cell surface receptors to JNK, are under current investigation. We thank R. A.

RAC effector loop mutants were identified that separate the ability of RAC to interact with different downstream effectors. One mutant of activated human RAC protein, RACV12H40 (with valine and histidine substituted at position 12 and 40, respectively), was defective in binding to PAK3, a Ste20-related p21-activated kinase (PAK), but bound to POR1, a RAC-binding protein. This mutant failed to stimulate PAK and JNK activity but still induced membrane ruffling and mediated transformation. A second mutant, RACV12L37 (with leucine substituted at position 37), which bound PAK but not POR1, induced JNK activation but was defective in inducing membrane ruffling and transformation. These results indicate that the effects of RAC on the JNK cascade and on actin polymerization and cell proliferation are mediated by distinct effector pathways that diverge at the level of RAC itself."

While TNF directly causes apoptosis of tumor cells and virally infected cells, normal cells are generally resistant. However, most resistant cells, including human endothelial cells, can be rendered susceptible to TNF by inhibiting RNA or protein synthesis. This finding suggests that TNF provides a cell survival signal in addition to a death signal. We have previously cloned a human Bcl-2 homologue, A1, and shown that it is specifically induced by proinflammatory cytokines but not by endothelial growth factors. In this study, we show that retroviral-mediated transfer of the A1 cDNA to a human microvascular endothelial cell line provides protection against cell death initiated by TNF in the presence of actinomycin D. The induction of A1 by TNF in this system is mediated via a protein kinase C pathway. Since TNF signaling has also been shown to proceed via ceramides, we tested whether exogenous ceramides could induce A1. Our findings indicate that ceramides do not induce A1 but do up-regulate c-jun and induce endothelial death. Ceramide-activated endothelial death is also inhibited by A1, suggesting that TNF may initiate divergent survival and death pathways via separate lipid second messengers.

A number of intracellular proteins including the EGF receptor itself are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in EGF-stimulated cells. Several autophosphorylation sites have been identified in the carboxyl-terminal region of the EGF receptor. These sites and their flanking regions constitute specific motifs that can be recognized by the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains or the phosphotyrosine binding/phosphotyrosine interaction domains of many intracellular signaling proteins (for review see 3Margolis B.

To determine the functional consequence of disrupting the EGFR/Grb2 protein-protein association in vivo, we delivered a peptide mimicking this EGFR autophosphorylation site into intact cells by using a nondestructive cell-permeable peptide import method (see 18Lin Y.-Z.

We showed in this report that this outside-in peptide formed an intracellular peptide-protein complex with endogenous Grb2, resulting in a substantial inhibition of EGF-stimulated EGFR/Grb2 association and Ras/MAP kinase activation. Our results demonstrate that intracellular tyrosine kinase signaling pathways can be studied and regulated in living cells by cell-permeable peptides carrying specific functional motifs, such as phosphotyrosine-containing sequences. Peptides were synthesized by a stepwise solid-phase peptide synthesis method (19Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6751) Google Scholar) using the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) protection. For phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, Boc-Tyr(PO3Me2) was used. Synthetic peptides were purified by C18 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described (18Lin Y.-Z. Yao S. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

A polyclonal anti-SP1068 peptide antibody was raised against the SP1068 peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate in rabbits and recognized in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay not only SP1068 but also P1068 and SY1068 peptides in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SAA cells are the NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human EGF receptor (21Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Subconfluent SAA cells grown on the chamber slides (Nunc) were serum-starved for 18 h and then treated with or without 0.5 ml of peptide solution (100 µg/ml) in DMEM containing 20 mM HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were washed and fixed, and intracellular peptide was detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay using anti-SP1068 peptide antibody and rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit antibody as described (18Lin Y.-Z.

Coverslips with stained cells were mounted in Poly/Mount (Polyscience) and analyzed in a fluorescence microscope using a × 100 oil immersion lens. SAA cells were grown to 95% confluency in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, serum-starved for 18 h, and then treated with or without peptides (100 µg/ml or as specified) in DMEM containing 20 mM HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with or without human EGF (50 ng/ml, Intergen) for 10 min and then extensively washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 2 M NaCl, pH 7.4, and 2 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4, to remove extracellularly associated peptides. In each case, 0.5 ml of cell lysates (0.3 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.5-1 µg of antibodies as indicated or with 20 µl of anti-SP1068 peptide serum. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies as indicated followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies according to ECL protocol (18Lin Y.-Z.

Serum-starved SAA cells were treated with or without peptides (100 µg/ml or as specified) for 30 min and washed extensively as indicated above to remove extracellularly associated peptides. Subsequently, cells were incubated in a permeabilization buffer containing 12.5 mM PIPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 37.5 mM NaCl, 6.25 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM ATP, 1 mM EGTA, 0.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.8 IU of streptolysin O for 5 min and then treated with or without EGF (50 ng/ml) along with 50 µCi/ml [α-32P]GTP (ICN) for 8 min in the same buffer. Cells were washed and lysed, and 0.3 ml of cell lysates (0.3 mg/ml) was immunoprecipitated with 0.6 µg of anti-Ras antibodies (Santa Cruz). The Ras proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-rat IgG-agarose (Sigma) were washed, and the radiolabeled nucleotide bound to Ras was Cerenkov counted. Serum-starved SAA or NIH 3T3 cells were treated with or without SP1068 peptide (100 µg/ml) for 30 min and then stimulated with or without EGF (10 or 50 ng/ml) for additional 5 min. Cells were washed and lysed, and 0.5 ml of cell lysates (0.3 mg/ml) were immunoprecipitated with 1 µg of anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz). The complexes on protein A-Sepharose beads were washed and incubated with 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and 0.25 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma) in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM ATP at 30°C for 30 min. The kinase reaction was quenched with sample buffer. The samples were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to autoradiography and phosphorimage analysis. Serum-starved SAA cells were treated with or without SP1068 peptide (100 µg/ml) for 30 min and then stimulated with or without EGF (10 or 50 ng/ml) for additional 10 min. Equivalent total cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Erk-1 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Sos-1, or anti-phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz) antibody. To study and influence intracellular protein-protein interaction between EGFR and Grb2 protein, we designed a peptide (referred as to SP1068, Fig. 1) comprised a cell membrane-translocating sequence (18Lin Y.-Z.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) at its amino terminus and the phosphotyrosine 1068-containing region of EGFR at its carboxyl terminus. Two control peptides (Fig. 1), a non-cell-permeable version (P1068) and an unphosphorylated version (SY1068) of the SP1068 peptide, were also prepared. We first examined whether cell-permeable SP1068 peptide can be taken up efficiently by living NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human EGF receptors (SAA cells (21Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Intracellular peptide was observed in a punctate staining pattern in cells treated with SP1068 peptide, as detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay using anti-peptide antibodies (Fig. 2). Immunodetection of the cell-permeable peptide was specific because untreated cells or cells incubated with non-cell-permeable P1068 peptide did not display intracellular fluorescence signals (Fig. 2). The same assay showed that SY1068 peptide was also taken up by SAA cells (not shown). Cell-permeable peptides within the concentration range used were not cytotoxic as determined by staining with fluorescein diacetate/ethidium bromide (18Lin Y.-Z. Yao S. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R.

Upon the EGF stimulation (see Fig. 3A), the Grb2 protein was coprecipitated with the phosphorylated EGFR in anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates. However, the amount of associated Grb2 protein was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with SP1068 peptide (Fig. 3A), indicating that intracellularly imported SP1068 peptide can inhibit the EGFR/Grb2 association by mimicking a specific EGFR autophosphorylation site. A similar inhibition pattern by this phosphopeptide was also seen in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B). Neither non-cell-permeable P1068 peptide nor unphosphorylated SY1068 peptide treatment showed any significant inhibition of the inducible EGFR/Grb2 association. Inhibition by SP1068 peptide was concentration-dependent, plateauing at about 50 µg/ml (18 µM, extracellular concentration) (Fig. 3B). The guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos-1 is involved in EGF-stimulated Ras activation cascades by forming a constitutive complex with Grb2 (5Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L.

Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). It is thus expected that SP1068 peptide treatment would have a similar inhibitory effect on the association of Sos-1 with EGFR in EGF-stimulated cells. To address this possibility, we analyzed the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR coprecipitated with Sos-1 in anti-Sos-1 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 3C, the association of activated EGFR with Sos-1 in EGF-stimulated cells was significantly attenuated by SP1068 peptide but not by SY1068 or P1068 peptide. It appears that cell-permeable SP1068 peptide is active because it contains a specific binding site for Grb2 protein that allows it to compete with endogenous EGFR for Grb2 protein binding. To determine whether an intracellular complex of SP1068/Grb2 can be isolated from SP1068 peptide-treated living cells, serum-starved SAA cells were incubated with SP1068 peptide, and the cell lysate was precipitated with anti-SP1068 peptide antibody. Immunoblotting analysis with anti-SP1068 peptide antibody showed that intracellular SP1068 peptide was isolated from the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4). When these anti-SP1068 peptide immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-Grb2 antibody, coprecipitated Grb2 protein was detected (Fig. 4), indicating that an intracellular complex of SP1068/Grb2 was indeed formed in the SP1068 peptide-treated SAA cells. The same in vivo peptide-protein complex was also observed in the SP1068 peptide-treated parental NIH 3T3 cells (not shown). The isolated SP1068 peptides represented roughly 1% of the extracellularly added peptide as estimated by cell-free immunoprecipitation of the SP1068 peptide. To further verify that the identified SP1068-Grb2 complex is not formed in vitro, we examined non-cell-permeable P1068 peptide-treated cells in the same assay and found no sign of a P1068-Grb2 complex (Fig. 4). Successful isolation of the SP1068-Grb2 complex from SP1068 peptide-treated cells demonstrates a feasible approach for studying various protein-protein interactions in living cells. To determine whether the inhibition by SP1068 peptide is specific for the direct EGFR/Grb2 protein-protein association, we first examined the effect of SP1068 peptide on EGF-induced EGFR/Shc association. Shc is an intracellular protein substrate for several protein tyrosine kinases, including the EGF receptor (23Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 25Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It contains an SH2 domain and a phosphotyrosine binding/phosphotyrosine interaction domain, which have been suggested to bind to EGFR autophosphorylation sites 1173 and 1148, respectively. Shc is also known to bind to Grb2 to mediate the indirect association of EGF receptor with Grb2-Sos signaling complex. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Shc antibodies demonstrated that SP1068 peptide treatment did not disrupt EGF-induced EGFR/Shc association (Fig. 5A). Correspondingly, cell-permeable phosphopeptides carrying autophosphorylation sites 1148 or 1173 (Fig. 1) were without significant effects on inducible EGFR/Grb2 association (Fig. 5B). These results thus indicate that the activated EGF receptor uses specific autophosphorylation sites to interact with distinct signaling substrates in vivo. We also examined the effect of SP1068 peptide on Grb2/Shc association. As shown in Fig. 5C, some Shc proteins formed a constitutive complex with Grb2 in SAA cells. SP1068 peptide treatment did not alter the Grb2/Shc association. EGF stimulates Ras guanine nucleotide exchange activity through signaling pathways that involve EGFR and Grb2/Sos-1 proteins (5Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

To determine whether the SP1068 peptide-mediated dissociation of EGFR from the Grb2-Sos complex has any effects on Ras activation, serum-starved SAA cells were pretreated with SP1068 peptide, washed, permeabilized with streptolysin O, and then stimulated with EGF in the presence of [α-32P]GTP. As shown in Fig. 6A, the α-32P-labeled nucleotide bound to Ras was significantly increased by EGF stimulation. This EGF-induced increase was substantially, although not completely, inhibited by pretreatment of cells with SP1068 peptides in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). In contrast, no significant inhibition was seen in non-cell-permeable P1068 peptide-treated or unphosphorylated SY1068 peptide-treated cells (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that the SP1068 peptide-mediated disruption of the EGFR/Grb2/Sos-1 protein-protein association leads to reduced Ras activation in EGF-stimulated cells. To examine whether partial inhibition of Ras activation by SP1068 peptide would affect EGF-induced activation of MAP kinases (26Wood K.W. Sarnecki D. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 27Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar), we employed a quantitative MAP kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP and myelin basic proteins as substrate. As shown in Fig. 7A, MAP kinases were fully activated in SAA cells treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) as assessed by their ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein. Pretreatment of cells with SP1068 peptide substantially inhibited the inducible MAP kinase activation (59% inhibition, see Fig. 7A). However, the peptide was not inhibitory when a higher dose (50 ng/ml) of EGF was applied. Similar results were obtained from SP1068 peptide-treated parental NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 7A). Peptide-mediated inhibition was verified in a MAP kinase gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 7B, two MAP kinase proteins (p42ERK2 and p44ERK1) were activated in EGF-treated SAA cells as assessed by their slower migrating electrophoretic mobilities due to EGF-induced phosphorylation. Consistent with the results of the kinase assay shown in Fig. 7A, pretreatment of cells with SP1068 peptide did not inhibit the inducible phosphorylations of the MAP kinases when cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 7B). However, in cells stimulated with a lower dose (10 ng/ml) of EGF, the peptide partially inhibited the phosphorylations of the MAP kinases as determined by their slightly faster migrating electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 7B). It has been suggested that Sos-1 can be phosphorylated by the activated MAP kinases (5Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which may lead to the dissociation of Sos-1 from membrane-bound receptor complex involved in Ras activation. As also characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 7B), the phosphorylation of Sos-1 can be stimulated with EGF (10 or 50 ng/ml). However, this Sos phosphorylation was not affected by SP1068 peptide treatment even in the cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 7B), suggesting that a low level of MAP kinase activation is sufficient to stimulate Sos-1 phosphorylation. The results reported here indicate that the phosphorylated tyrosine 1068 of EGFR is a major site for initiating EGF-induced Ras activation and MAP kinase activation in vivo. The intracellular interaction of this autophosphorylation site and its flanking region with the downstream signaling protein Grb2 is demonstrated by isolating from intact cells a high affinity complex between endogenous Grb2 and an outside-in cell-permeable phosphopeptide, which mimics the EGFR motif. The competition of this intracellular peptide with endogenous EGFR for Grb2 results in a significant, but not complete, disruption of EGFR/Grb2 association and reduced Ras activation and MAP kinase activation in EGF-stimulated cells. However, when a higher dose of EGF is used to stimulate cells, the intracellular peptide concentration is insufficient to block MAP kinase activation, suggesting that maximal activation of MAP kinase requires only a few activated EGF receptors. It is also possible that in the presence of high concentrations of EGF, alternative signaling pathway(s) involving the autophosphorylation sites of EGF receptor other than Tyr-1068 play important roles in EGF-induced MAP kinase activation. These alternative pathways could be mediated by Shc or other signaling proteins. Our findings using cell-permeable phosphopeptides demonstrate a feasible biochemical approach for studying and influencing the EGFR tyrosine kinase-initiated signal transduction pathway in intact cells. The precise key-lock in vivo interactions between phosphorylated EGF receptor and its signaling substrates are dissected by our study using cell-permeable peptides carrying different autophosphorylation sites. By introducing functionally distinct domains into living cells, it is expected that this peptide import approach can be employed to study and control various intracellular processes involved in signal transduction and gene transcription. The resulting information may constitute a basis for the design of therapeutic molecular drugs for tumors related to oncogenes. We thank G. Carpenter for the SAA cells and anti-EGFR antibody, C.

https://openalex.org/W1999144842,"Many catalytic activities of cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4, the major human liver P450 enzyme, require cytochrome b5 (b5) for optimal rates. The stimulatory effect of b5 on P450 reactions has generally been thought to be due to transfer of electrons from ferrous b5 to the ferrous P450-O2-substrate complex. We found that apo-b5, devoid of heme, could substitute for b5 in stimulating two prototypic activities, testosterone 6β hydroxylation and nifedipine oxidation. The stimulatory effect was not seen with albumin, hemoglobin, catalase, or cytochrome c. Apo-b5 could not substitute for b5 in a testosterone 6β hydroxylation system composed of NADH-b5 reductase and P450 3A4. Rates of electron transfer from NADPH-P450 reductase to ferric P450 3A4 were too slow (<2 min−1) to support testosterone 6β hydroxylation (∼14 min−1) unless b5 or apo-b5 was present, when rates of ∼700 min−1 were measured. The oxidation-reduction potential (Em,7) of the ferric/ferrous couple of P450 3A4 was unchanged (∼−310 mV) under different conditions in which the kinetics of reduction were altered by the addition of substrate and/or apo-b5. Rapid reduction of P450 3A4 required substrate and a preformed complex of P450 3A4, NADPH-P450 reductase, and b5; the rates of binding of the proteins to each other were 2-3 orders of magnitude less than reduction rates. We conclude that b5 can facilitate some P450 3A4-catalyzed oxidations by complexing with P450 3A4 and enhancing its reduction by NADPH-P450 reductase, without directly transferring electrons to P450.

The proteins constitute a superfamily and collectively contribute extensively to the oxidation of xenobiotic chemicals (e.g. drugs, carcinogens, pesticides, alkaloids, and other natural products) and also endobiotics (e.g. steroids, eicosanoids, fat-soluble vitamins, fatty acids) (3Wislocki P.G.

The contributions of these P450 enzymes to metabolism in humans are well recognized, particularly regarding issues of drug clearance (7Guengerich F.P. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N.

Plenum Press, New York1995: 473-535Crossref Google Scholar). There is general agreement that, in most humans, P450 3A4 is the most abundant of the P450s in both liver and small intestine (8Wrighton S.A. Stevens J.C. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 9Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed.

Toxicol. 1990; 3: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The intestinal enzyme has been implicated in variation in the bioavailability of many orally administered drugs (11Kolars J.C. Awni W.M. Merion R.M. Watkins P.B. Lancet. 1991; 338: 1488-1490Abstract PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).P450 3A4 has a very broad range of substrates, with more than 60 drugs having been already identified (9Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 473-535Crossref Google Scholar). These vary widely in structure, and one of the questions about this enzyme has been the molecular basis of its broad catalytic specificity (12Brian W.R. Sari M-A. Iwasaki M. Shimada T. Kaminsky L.S.

The purified enzyme, along with other P450 3A subfamily enzymes, is much more sensitive to its reconstitution environment than are most other P450s (19Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H.

Not all of these components are directly relevant to the membrane-bound enzyme, but Mg2+ has been shown to stimulate activity of the enzyme in microsomes (24Yamazaki H. Ueng Y-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Yamazaki H. Nakano M. Imai Y. Ueng Y-F. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, certain catalytic activities of P450 3A4 are quite refractory to alterations in lipids and b5 (24Yamazaki H. Ueng Y-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Holmans P.L. Estabrook R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11748-11752Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In order to better understand this complex but important system, we initiated a systematic investigation of some of the system components on individual steps in the catalytic cycle of purified recombinant P450 3A4 (14Ueng Y-F. Shimada T. Yamazaki H. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J.

Biophys. 1996; 325: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A general conclusion about the role of b5 in modulating P450 reactions has been that electron transfer from b5 to P450 occurs in step 4 of Scheme 1 (27Peterson J.A. Prough R.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P-450. 1st Ed. Plenum Press, New York1986: 89-117Crossref Google Scholar). Recently we found qualitative evidence that b5 could also stimulate the reduction of P450 3A4 by the flavoprotein NADPH-P450 reductase (24Yamazaki H. Ueng Y-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We now report that apo-b5 (devoid of heme) can replace b5 in the efficient oxidation of the prototypic P450 substrates testosterone and nifedipine and that apo-b5 can also replace b5 in the facilitating electron flow from NADPH-P450 reductase to P450 3A4, in the absence of electron transfer from b5 or modulation of the Em,7 of P450 3A4.DISCUSSIONEvidence for the involvement of b5 in a P450 catalytic system was first published in 1971 (44Hildebrandt A. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and the literature now contains numerous reports of P450 reactions in which there is either (i) enhancement, (ii) no effect, or (iii) inhibition by b5 (45Jansson I. Schenkman J.B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1987; 15: 344-348PubMed Google Scholar, 46Chiang J.Y.L. Malmer M. Hutterer F. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. 1994; 314: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Evidence for the role of b5 in the transfer of an electron to the P450 ferrous-O2 complex has been presented (44Hildebrandt A. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 53Bonfils C. Balny C. Maurel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9457-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this is almost universally accepted to be the basis for enhancement of catalysis by b5 (Scheme 1). In several studies, derivatives of b5 that were devoid of electron transfer capability were not effective in stimulating reactions catalyzed by other P450 s (21Shet M.S. Faulkner K.M. Holmans P.L. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 47Morgan E.T. Coon M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1984; 12: 358-364PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously presented qualitative evidence for the stimulation of the reduction of ferric P450 3A4 by b5 (24Yamazaki H. Ueng Y-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The possibility exists that this phenomenon could occur via transfer of electrons from b5 to P450 3A4, although the thermodynamics are unfavorable (i.e. the Em,7 of b5 is ∼+20 mV and that of most P450s is ∼−300 mV) (35Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 54Velick S.F. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 221: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of steady-state reactions and ferric P450 3A4 reduction in systems composed of NADH-b5 reductase and b5 are too slow to be compatible with the rates of NADPH-P450 reductase-dependent reactions (25Yamazaki H. Nakano M. Imai Y. Ueng Y-F. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that apo-b5, devoid of electron transfer capability, can stimulate steady-state catalytic activity and the reduction of P450 3A4 (Tables I-III, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). This effect on reduction rate may contribute to the enhancement of P450 3A4-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation. These effects were also seen with the substrates nifedipine and aflatoxin B1 (Fig. 3, Table IV), reactions that require b5 (14Ueng Y-F. Shimada T. Yamazaki H. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5051-5060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With ethylmorphine, a substrate whose oxidation does not require b5 (24Yamazaki H. Ueng Y-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Holmans P.L. Estabrook R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11748-11752Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the substrate enhanced P450 3A4 reduction to the rate seen with a combination of testosterone plus b5 (Table IV).The enhancement of the rate of P450 3A4 reduction is apparently not linked to a change in Em,7 of the ferric/ferrous couple (Fig. 5). Although the spin-state, kinetics, and thermodynamics of P450 reduction are often suggested to be linked, based upon work with bacterial P450 101 (55Fisher M.T. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 5018-5019Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), this is not generally the case with microsomal P450 s (35Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and it is not the case here. Neither testosterone, ethylmorphine, nor apo-b5 appeared to change the Em,7, even though about one-half of the P450 3A4 was converted from the low spin to high spin iron configuration by the addition of testosterone, and it appears possible to have two orders of magnitude difference in reduction rates in the absence of a change in Em,7. Other literature argues for lack of linkage of substrate binding, spin state, Em,7, and rate of reduction (35Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 39Huang Y.Y. Hara T. Sligar S. Coon M.J. Kimura T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1390-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Backes W.L. Eyer C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6252-6259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it would appear this dependence is not very common among P450s.Previously evidence has been presented for slow association and dissociation of P450s and NADPH-P450 reductase (40Oprian D.D. Vatsis K.P. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8895-8902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Backes W.L. Eyer C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6252-6259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that these were relatively slow processes with P450 3A4 for both NADPH-P450 reductase and b5 (Fig. 6). However, the kinetics vary among P450s. For instance, the rate measured for association of P450 3A4 and NADPH-P450 reductase was 1.2 min−1 with P450 3A4 in the experiment of Fig. 6A but 30 min−1 with human P450 1A2 in a separate experiment (results not shown, reduction rate of 720 min−1 for preformed complex). Such differences may have relevance when mixtures of P450s are considered in terms of competition for limiting reductase (56Kaminsky L.S. Guengerich F.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 57Cawley G.F. Batie C.J. Backes W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When limiting NADPH-P450 reductase was mixed with excess P450 3A4 and b5 and NADPH was added from a second syringe, a rapid burst of reduction was seen for each hemoprotein, followed by slow reduction dominated by association/dissociation kinetics (Fig. 6). It should also be pointed out that many of the kinetic traces of the reduction of preformed P450 or P450·b5 complexes could be fit to first order (single exponential) equations (e.g. Fig. 5). The first accounts of the reduction kinetics of P450s described biphasic kinetics (58Gigon P.L. Gram T.E. Gillette J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1969; 5: 109-122PubMed Google Scholar, 59Diehl H. Schädelin J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 247-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although one of these reports indicates that 90% of the reduction was done in the fast phase (60Backes W.L. Reker-Backes C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 247-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these studies were done at 25°C or less, and part of the reason we saw primarily single exponential reduction kinetics may be due to the 37°C temperature we used (for comparison to steady-state results). Lipid phase transitions and related phenomena may be operative at lower temperatures. However, in systems where the amount of reductase is limiting, diffusion is a likely explanation (42Peterson J.A. Ebel R.E. O'Keeffe D.H. Matsubara T. Estabrook R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4010-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than inherent properties of the P450(s) or reductase.The b5 stimulation of ferric P450 reduction does not seem to be general. We have not seen this effect in other studies with recombinant human P450 1A2 or 2E1. Reduction of P450 2E1 is slower in the presence of b5 (61Bell L.C. Johnson W.W. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A1498Google Scholar), an effect reported for P450 2B4 by Golly et al. (49Golly I. Hlavica P. Schartau W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Schenkman et al. (52Schenkman J.B. Voznesensky A.I. Jansson I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) also reported slower reduction of ferric P450 2B4 in the presence of b5, although the presence of P450 2B4 elevated the rate of NADPH-P450 reductase-catalyzed reduction of b5. The postulate of “simultaneous” 2-electron reduction of ferric P450 and b5 presented in that article (i.e. sequential rapid reduction of ferric P450, transfer of an electron from ferrous P450 to ferric b5, and reduction of ferric P450) is of interest in light of the similarity of the rates of reduction of P450 3A4 and b5 seen in some of the experiments described in Table IV. However, this hypothesis does not seem to generally apply here. CO traps ferrous P450 but b5 has a similar rate of reduction as P450 in the presence of CO. 2In many cases, we also measured the absorbance decrease at A390, indicative of P450 reduction whether the ferrous form was trapped or not, and obtained similar kinetics. Also, in other studies (not presented) with a recombinant P450 3A4:NADPH-P450 reductase fusion protein (62Chun Y-J. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), reduction of b5 was faster than P450.In conclusion, b5 has been shown to stimulate P450 3A4-catalyzed reactions without obligate electron transfer. In these cases (testosterone 6β hydroxylation, aflatoxin B1 oxidation) the mechanism of stimulation appears to involve enhancement of rates of ferric P450 reduction, a process which seems not to depend on the oxidation state of or transfer of electrons from b5. A mechanistic proposal has been presented previously (24Yamazaki H. Ueng Y-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and still appears to be valid as a working model. As suggested by Lipka and Waskell (48Lipka J.J. Waskell L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), different substrates may preferentially bind to a P450, P450 3A4 in this case, to induce b5 binding. Alternatively, b5 may bind to the P450 in the absence of the substrate but the mode of interaction may be altered in the ternary P450-substrate-b5 complex. This binding evidently influences the transfer of electrons from NADPH-P450 reductase to the ferric enzyme and probably the ferrous-O2 complex. However, some substrates such as ethylmorphine appear to be able to bind to P450 3A4 and induce rapid reduction in the absence of b5 (Table IV).

The contributions of these P450 enzymes to metabolism in humans are well recognized, particularly regarding issues of drug clearance (7Guengerich F.P. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N.

There is general agreement that, in most humans, P450 3A4 is the most abundant of the P450s in both liver and small intestine (8Wrighton S.A. Stevens J.C. Crit. Rev.

Awni W.M. Merion R.M. Watkins P.B. Lancet. 1991; 338: 1488-1490Abstract PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).P450 3A4 has a very broad range of substrates, with more than 60 drugs having been already identified (9Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 473-535Crossref Google Scholar). These vary widely in structure, and one of the questions about this enzyme has been the molecular basis of its broad catalytic specificity (12Brian W.R. Sari M-A. Iwasaki M. Shimada T. Kaminsky L.S.

https://openalex.org/W2039690068,"To date, no studies have described the import of proteins in mitochondria obtained from skeletal muscle. In this tissue, mitochondria consist of the functionally and biochemically distinct intermyofibrillar (IMF) and subsarcolemmal (SS) subfractions, which are localized in specialized cellular compartments. This mitochondrial heterogeneity in muscle could be due, in part, to differential rates of protein import. To evaluate this possibility, the import of precursor malate dehydrogenase and ornithine carbamyltransferase proteins was investigated in isolated IMF and SS mitochondria in vitro. Import of these was 3-4-fold greater in IMF compared with SS mitochondria as a function of time. This could account for the higher malate dehydrogenase enzyme activity in IMF mitochondria. Divergent import rates in IMF and SS mitochondria likely result from a differential reliance on various components of the import pathway. SS mitochondria possess a greater content of the molecular chaperones hsp60 and Grp75, yet import is lower than in IMF mitochondria. On the other hand, adriamycin inhibition studies illustrated a greater reliance on acidic phospholipids (i.e. cardiolipin) for the import process in SS mitochondria. Matrix ATP levels were 3-fold higher in IMF mitochondria, but experiments in which ATP depletion was performed with atractyloside and oligomycin illustrated a dissociation between import rates and levels of ATP. In contrast, a close relationship was found between the rate of ATP production (i.e. mitochondrial respiration) and protein import. When respiratory rates in IMF and SS mitochondria were equalized, import rates in both subfractions were similar. These data indicate that 1) import rates are more closely related to the rate of ATP production than the steady state ATP level, 2) import into IMF and SS mitochondrial subfractions is regulated differently, and 3) mitochondrial heterogeneity within a cell type can be due to differences in the rates of protein import, suggesting that this step is a potentially regulatable event in determining the final mitochondrial phenotype.

INTRODUCTIONThe mitochondrion is a unique cellular organelle containing a distinct and separate genome. However, the DNA contained within mitochondria is limited in size and does not possess sufficient information to encode all mitochondrial proteins. Thus, a great majority of these proteins must be encoded by the nuclear genome, translated in the cytosol, and imported to their final destinations within the mitochondrion (1Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). This import process of nuclear derived precursor proteins into mitochondria has been well studied in lower eukaryotes such as Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (cf. 2Schwarz E. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Lithgow T. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem.

Extensive work being conducted on these organisms continues to provide revealing insight into the mechanisms of protein import, as well as the identification of some of the key components involved in precursor-protein translocation. In contrast, limited work has been devoted to the examination of protein import in mammalian mitochondria (6Chien S-M. Patel H.V. Freeman K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13633-13636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chu T.W. Eftime R. Sztul E. Strauss A.W. J. Biol.

Naylor D.J. Hartman D.J. Høj P.B. Hoogenraad N.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and no studies exist that have investigated the mitochondrial protein import process in mammalian skeletal muscle. This is important for two reasons. First, skeletal muscle has a great capacity for mitochondrial biogenesis in response to physiological stimuli such as thyroid hormone treatment (14Winder, W., Fitts, R., Holloszy, J., Kaiser, K., Brooke, M., Pette, D., (eds) (1980) Plasticity of Muscle, pp. 581–591, Walter de Gruyter and Co., Berlin.Google Scholar) or chronic contractile activity (cf. 15Hood D.A. Balaban A. Connor M.K. Craig E.E. Nishio M.L. Rezvani M. Takahashi M. Can. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 19: 12-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 16Essig D.A. Exerc. Sport Sci. Rev. 1996; 24: 289-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar for reviews), and the composition of mitochondria is altered as a result of these treatments (17Hood D.A. Kelton R. Nishio M.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 101A: 597-605Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These compositional changes include increases in the expression of mitochondrial chaperonins, which are critical components of the mitochondrial import and assembly process (18Ornatsky O.I. Connor M.K. Hood D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and altered composition may be due, in part, to an acceleration of protein import, thereby implicating protein import as a physiologically regulated step in organelle synthesis. Second, skeletal muscle mitochondria consist of two distinct, heterogeneous subfractions, the subsarcolemmal (SS) 1The abbreviations used are: SSsubsarcolemmalIMFintermyofibrillarMDHmalate dehydrogenaseOCTornithine carbamyl transferasemthspmitochondrial heat shock proteinATRatractyloside. and intermyofibrillar (IMF) mitochondria, located in distinct cellular compartments. Each subfraction possesses different protein and lipid compositions as well as differing capacities for mitochondrial respiration and endogenous protein synthesis (19Cogswell A.M. Stevens R.J. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 33: C383-C389Crossref Google Scholar, 20Krieger D.A. Tate C.A. McMillin-Wood J. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1980; 48: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the SS mitochondrial subfraction contains a greater cardiolipin content than the IMF subfraction (19Cogswell A.M. Stevens R.J. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 33: C383-C389Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is now established that mitochondrial phospholipids, particularly cardiolipin, play an early role in the binding of precursor proteins destined for the mitochondrion (21Eilers M. Endo T. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2945-2950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Leenhouts J.M. Török Z. Chupin V. de Kruijff B. Biochem. Soc.

If cardiolipin is uniquely important for import into mammalian mitochondria, the SS subfraction should demonstrate a greater rate of protein import than the IMF mitochondria.The rate of precursor protein import is also dependent on both external and internal ATP supply (25Beasley E.M. Wachter C. Schatz G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Stuart R.A. Gruhler A. van der Klei I. Guiard B. Koll H. Neupert W. Eur. J.

H., (eds) (1993) Molecular Chaperones, pp. 99–105, Chapman and Hall, London.Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, an approximate 3-fold greater rate of ATP synthesis occurs in IMF, compared with SS mitochondria (19Cogswell A.M. Stevens R.J. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 33: C383-C389Crossref Google Scholar). This may be an important determinant of protein import and could account for some of the observed differences in protein composition between these two subfractions. Thus, the primary purpose of the present study was to establish the measurement of protein import into skeletal muscle IMF and SS mitochondrial subfractions and to examine mechanisms of import related to the abundance of intramitochondrial chaperones, the ATP dependence of import, and the potential role of cardiolipin in the translocation process.DISCUSSIONMorphological, biochemical, and functional investigations of mitochondria have clearly established the existence of organellar heterogeneity in a variety of tissues, including brain (39Lai J.C.K.

Studies of skeletal muscle subject to conditions of chronic use or disuse have indicated that SS mitochondria are synthesized or degraded in more dramatic fashion than IMF mitochondria (20Krieger D.A.

Slocum G.R. Sedlak F.R. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This heterogeneous response of the two mitochondrial subfractions implies that a different pattern or regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis exists in distinct regions of the muscle cell, perhaps influenced by surrounding nuclear domains (58Ralston E. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or the proximity to environmental factors (e.g.. PO2; 59Mainwood G.W. Rakusan K. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1982; 60: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since most of the proteins within mitochondria are derived from the nuclear genome and imported into the organelle, we wanted to establish whether the import process could be responsible for a portion of the specific phenotypic differences between the IMF and SS mitochondria.Our study is the first to report on the kinetics and characteristics of the protein import pathway in skeletal muscle mitochondria. As expected, the import processes in these mitochondria have similar characteristics (dependence on membrane potential, requirement for an intact inner membrane, proteolytic processing of precursors, and accessibility of bound, external precursor proteins to trypsin digestion) to those observed in other widely studied cellular systems (i.e. N. crassa and S. cerevisiae) as well as those found in commonly studied mammalian tissues such as liver and heart. Importantly, we have documented that mitochondria obtained from different cellular regions demonstrate remarkably divergent import kinetics, which can, in part, account for the phenotypic differences observed. For example, the 2-fold greater MDH enzyme activity found in IMF mitochondria is likely attributable in part to the 3-4-fold higher rate of MDH precursor protein import in this mitochondrial subfraction. Additional studies will address the role that endogenous proteolysis plays, relative to the rate of import, in determining the final concentrations of proteins within mitochondria.We have also defined some of the factors that are important in determining the differential rate of import into the IMF and SS mitochondria. Since the extent of precursor binding is not different between the two subfractions, we examined other, more specific components of the import machinery. Previous work in other cellular systems has shown the essentiality of the molecular chaperone hsp60 for cell survival (60Baker K.P. Schatz G. Nature. 1991; 349: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and protein refolding (29Neupert, N. W., Pfanner, N., Ellis, R. J., Laskey, R. A., Lorimer, G. H., (eds) (1993) Molecular Chaperones, pp. 99–105, Chapman and Hall, London.Google Scholar) and the role of mthsp70 (Grp75) acting as an ATP-dependent import “motor” in drawing the precursor into the matrix space during the initial import steps (61Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We show that both of these chaperones are present in muscle mitochondrial subfractions but that the levels of these are not directly related to the magnitude of MDH or OCT import. Both hsp60 and Grp75 are found in greater abundance in SS mitochondria, despite lower rates of protein import compared with IMF mitochondria. These data suggest that mthsp70 may be differentially involved in the import process within the two mitochondrial subfractions. Further, although it appears that hsp60 is involved in the refolding of MDH into a mature, catalytically competent enzyme (62Miller A.D. Maghloui K. Albanese G. Kleinjan D.A. Smith C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the level of hsp60 is not a likely factor regulating the difference in MDH enzyme activity between SS and IMF mitochondria.Of greater importance in the regulation of protein import into muscle mitochondrial subfractions is the content of acidic phospholipids such as cardiolipin. Cardiolipin has been implicated in the preliminary binding of precursors and as a mediator of conformational changes in the presequences via electrostatic interactions (22Leenhouts J.M. Török Z. Chupin V. de Kruijff B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23MacLachlan L.K. Haris P.I. Reid D.G. White J. Chapman D. Lucy J.A. Austen B.M. Biochem.

Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12860-12867Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast mitochondria have indicated that blockage of acidic phospholipid-precursor interactions with the drug adriamycin has the potential to inhibit protein import (21Eilers M. Endo T. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2945-2950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have taken advantage of the naturally occurring 60% higher cardiolipin content in SS, compared with IMF, mitochondria (19Cogswell A.M. Stevens R.J. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 33: C383-C389Crossref Google Scholar) to evaluate the role of phospholipids in the import process. Our data indicate a greater reliance of SS mitochondria on acidic phospholipids such as cardiolipin for import; they establish the importance of precursor-phospholipid interactions for protein import in subtypes of mammalian mitochondria; and they represent another indication that the regulation of import in these two mitochondrial subfractions differs. These data also have implications for mitochondrial biogenesis, since we have previously shown that large and rapid increases in cardiolipin content occur in muscle responding to chronic contractile activity prior to substantial increases in mitochondrial enzyme activity (36Takahashi M. Hood D.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 74: 934-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, an initial increase in cardiolipin content within the organelle could facilitate the subsequent import of proteins, particularly in SS mitochondria. This may represent an important mechanism responsible for the rapid increases in the content of SS mitochondria responding to contractile activity signals (20Krieger D.A. Tate C.A. McMillin-Wood J. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1980; 48: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 55Howald H. Hoppler H. Claassen H. Mathieu O. Straub R. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1985; 403: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 56Martin T.P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 88B: 273-276Google Scholar).It is well established in other cellular systems that internally derived ATP is essential for the import of matrix and inner membrane proteins (25Beasley E.M. Wachter C. Schatz G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Stuart R.A. Gruhler A. van der Klei I. Guiard B. Koll H. Neupert W. Eur. J.

However, it is unknown whether it is the absolute level of ATP or the rate of ATP production as determined by mitochondrial respiration that is most important for the import process. In addition, we wanted to determine whether the discrepant rates of protein import into IMF and SS mitochondrial subfractions could be equalized by modifying the respiration rate. The approximate 3-fold difference in import rate between IMF and SS mitochondria was reasonably well matched with the difference in endogenous, steady state ATP concentrations as well as differences in state 3 respiratory rates. However, import remained about 5-fold higher in IMF mitochondria when ATP levels were reduced to comparably low values in SS and IMF mitochondria by preincubation with ATR. IMF import in the presence of 100 µM ATR was very similar to that found in untreated SS mitochondria, in which respiration in the two subfractions was the same. In the presence of oligomycin a similar dissociation between ATP levels and import was found. These data support the contention that precursor import is more closely related to the rate of ATP production (Fig. 4C) rather than the steady state amount of ATP available (Table I). The ATP formed by respiration could be used internally to drive the mthsp70-mediated translocation of the precursor into the matrix (68Kronidou N.G. Oppliger W. Bolliger L Hannavy K. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Horst M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12818-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ATP could be extruded by the adenine nucleotide translocase to the cytoplasm and immediately coupled to an ATP-dependent chaperone-mediated release reaction, thus permitting import of the precursor, as proposed for the function of mitochondrial import stimulation factor (9Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This hypothesis remains to be tested, but it is a concept similar to that described for the metabolic coupling of ATP to hexokinase (69de Cerqueira Cesar M. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or mitochondrial creatine kinase (70Saks V.A. Khuchua Z.A. Vasilyeva E.V. Belikova O.Y. Kuznetsov A.V. Mol. Cell.

Our data confirm and extend those obtained in other tissues, and indicate that the capacities of IMF and SS mitochondrial subfractions for MDH import are greater than those of OCT. Differences in the in vitro import of matrix-destined proteins have been noted previously (10Nguyen M. Argan C. Lusty C.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 800-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Shore G.C. Rachubinski R.A. Argan C. Rozen R. Pouchelet M. Lusty C.J. Raymond Y. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 396-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the case of MDH and OCT import, this is not likely, due to large variations in their import pathways, since competition assays with isolated presequence peptides indicate that they share some common steps in the import process (7Chu T.W.

The differences observed are more likely associated with 1) the amino acid compositions of the amino-terminal presequences and interactions with membrane anionic phospholipids, 2) the affinity of the presequences for protein factors (9Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) located in the reticulocyte lysate that promote import, or 3) differences in the targeting signals inherent to the mature portion of these proteins (75Hartmann C.M.

Our current work is focusing on potential alterations in this pathway during conditions of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle with the goal of identifying whether or not import could represent a potential rate-limiting step in the gene expression pathway of nuclear encoded proteins destined for mitochondrial compartments. INTRODUCTIONThe mitochondrion is a unique cellular organelle containing a distinct and separate genome. However, the DNA contained within mitochondria is limited in size and does not possess sufficient information to encode all mitochondrial proteins. Thus, a great majority of these proteins must be encoded by the nuclear genome, translated in the cytosol, and imported to their final destinations within the mitochondrion (1Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). This import process of nuclear derived precursor proteins into mitochondria has been well studied in lower eukaryotes such as Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (cf. 2Schwarz E. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Lithgow T. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem.

The phenomenon was oxygen- and temperature-dependent. However, D1 protein degradation rate was similar in both preparations and slower than that found in non-oxygen evolving PSII particles (i.e. Mn-depleted photosystem II). These results seem to indicate that during illumination Cu(II)-inhibited samples do not behave as a typical non-oxygen evolving photosystem II. Cytochrome b559 was functional in the presence of Cu(II). The effect of Cu(II) inhibition decreased the amount of photoreduced cytochrome b559 and slowed down the rate of its photoreduction. The presence of Cu(II) during illumination seems to protect P680 against photodamage as occurs in photosystem II reaction centers when the acceptor side is protected. The data were consistent with the finding that production of singlet oxygen was highly reduced in the preparations treated with Cu(II). EPR spin trapping experiments showed that inactivation of Cu(II)-treated samples was dominated by hydroxyl radical, and the loss of oxygen evolution activity was diminished by the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase. These results indicate that the rapid loss of oxygen evolution activity in the presence of Cu(II) is mainly due to the formation of ˙OH radicals from superoxide ion via a Cu(II)-catalyzed Haber-Weiss mechanism. Considering that this inactivation process was oxygen-dependent, we propose that the formation of superoxide occurs in the acceptor side of photosystem II by interaction of molecular oxygen with reduced electron acceptor species, and thus, the primarily Cu(II)-inhibitory site in photosystem II is on the acceptor side.

Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of photoinhibition remains to be elucidated. However, it seems clear that the primary target of photoinhibition is the PSII RC. There has been a great deal of discussion on the processes involved in photoinhibition, which has focused on differentiating between whether the continuous strong illumination damages electron transport at the acceptor or the donor side of the initial charge transfer reaction between P680 and pheophytin (Pheo). It is possible that both of these mechanisms operate in vivo with a relative balance being dependent on other factors besides light intensity (2Prasil, O., Adir, N., Ohad, I., Barber, J., (eds) (1992) Topics in Photosynthesis, The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology, Vol 11, pp. 220–250, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam.Google Scholar, 4Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In the donor side-mediated photoinhibition, the electron donation to P680+ is inhibited and the functioning of TyrZ and/or P680 is affected. Electron transfer from TyrZ to P680+ is slowed down leading to an accumulation of long-lived highly oxidizing radicals at the donor side (P680+ and TyrZ+), which in turn would have a high probability of inducing rapid inactivation of PSII electron transport activity and oxidation of nearby pigments, redox components, or amino acids (3Aro E.-M.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6179-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, acceptor side-mediated photoinhibition seems to be due to an overaccumulation of reduced QA. Indeed, the presence of nonfunctional primary quinone electron acceptor QA, which in an intact system stabilizes charge separation (6Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Barber J. Chapman D.J. Telfer A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 67-73Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar), induces the primary radical pair (P680+Pheo−) recombination either to the excited singlet state (P680*Pheo) or via a radical pair mechanism to the triplet state (3P680Pheo). A direct recombination to the ground state (P680Pheo) is also possible (8Renger, G., Barber, J., (eds) (1992) Topics in Photosynthesis, Vol 11, pp. 45–99, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Oxygen has been implicated in photoinhibition processes (2Prasil, O., Adir, N., Ohad, I., Barber, J., (eds) (1992) Topics in Photosynthesis, The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology, Vol 11, pp. 220–250, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam.Google Scholar, 9Asada, K., Takahashi, M., Kyle, D.

The involvement of such species in photoinhibition has been concluded on the basis of detection of photoinduced 1O2 formation using both steady-state and time-resolved measurements of its emission at 1270 nm (10Telfer A. Bishop S.M. Philips D. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 266: 1-10Google Scholar).

It was suggested that P680 triplet was quenched by molecular oxygen leading to the production of its first excited state O2 (1Δg) which is highly reactive. When this reaction occurs, it has been shown that there is a irreversible bleaching of chromophores within the PSII RC (12Telfer A. Barber J.

De Las Rivas J. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 106-114Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The primary damage is to the chlorophylls (Chls) of P680, but further exposure to illumination results in the bleaching of other bound chromophores and in the D1 protein degradation (15Durrant J.R. Giorgi L.B. Barber J. Klug D.R. Porter G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 167-175Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Shipton C.A. Barber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6691-6695Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this process has not been fully characterized yet.Photosynthetic organisms are normally protected from damage by 1O2 by carotenoids (17Mathews M.M. Nature. 1964; 20: 1092Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Koka P. Song P.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 509-515Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Cogdell R. Frank H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). This fact has been demonstrated by the susceptibility to oxygen-dependent photodamage of carotenoid-less mutants of higher plants (20Anderson I.C. Robertson D.A. Plant Physiol.(Bethesda). 1960; 35: 531-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), algae (21Sager R. Zalokar M. Nature. 1958; 182: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and bacteria (22Griffith M. Sistrom W.R. Cohen-Bazire G. Stainer R.Y. Nature. 1955; 176: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Carotenoids can directly interact with Chl triplets to form the carotenoid triplet to bring about a rapid disposal of singlet oxygen before it causes any damage (23Macpherson A.N. Telfer A. Barber J. Truscott T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 301-309Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been proposed that cytochrome (Cyt), which is a protein closely associated with the PSII RC, protects against photodamage. The most accepted suggestion for its function is that Cyt b559 can be reversibly converted between its high potential (Em = +400 mV) and low potential (Em = +60-80 mV) forms and that it mediates cyclic electron transfer within PSII (24Buser C.A. Diner B.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11449-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is able to accept electrons from the reduced plastoquinone pool or QB and then be oxidized by P680+ directly or via a monomeric Chl.Many data on photoinhibition have been obtained using modified PSII preparations where the electron transport at the donor side of PSII was impaired by treatment with some reagents (i.e. NH2OH, Tris-washed, Cl−-depleted (5Jegerschöld C. Virgin I. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6179-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Klimov V.V. Shafiev M.A. Allakhverdiev M.A. Photosynth.

Rutherford A.W. Etienne A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3087-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). However, the region close to Pheo have not been studied. Our previous works (28Yruela I.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that low concentrations (few µM) of Cu(II) inhibited electron transport at the acceptor side of PSII close to the Pheo-QA-Fe domain and that Cu(II)-inhibited PSII RCs are photochemically inactive. Higher concentrations of Cu(II) also affected the donor side (32Jegerschöld C. Arellano J.B. Schröder W.P. Van Kan P.J.M. Barón M. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12747-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Schröder W.P. Arellano J.B. Bittner T. Barón M. Eckert H.-J. Renger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32865-32870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONStrong illumination of PSII membranes preincubated with copper resulted in a faster inactivation of the oxygen evolution activity. This phenomenon was dependent on the temperature and the presence of oxygen. It has been reported that acceptor side-induced photoinactivation of oxygen evolving PSII is oxygen-dependent. Reactive oxygen species generated at the acceptor side of PSII contribute to the irreverible inactivation of oxygen evolving PSII during illumination (1Andersson, B., Styring, S., Lee, C. P., (eds) (1991) Current Topics in Bioenergetics, Vol 16, pp. 1–8, Academic Press, San Diego.Google Scholar, 11Vass I. Styring S. Hundall T. Koivuniemi A. Aro E.-M. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, photoinhibition of non-oxygen evolving PSII is independent of molecular oxygen (3Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). According to that, our results seem to indicate that photoinhibition of Cu(II)-inhibited PSII occurs as in PSII preparations that evolve oxygen, at least under the experimental conditions used in this work. In addition, no differences in the D1 protein degradation were observed between both Cu(II)-treated and nontreated PSII samples, which in turn was slower than that in manganese-depleted PSII preparations.It has been described that using similar illumination conditions to those in our experiments, photoinhibition results in a fully reduced acceptor side that induces the impairment of PSII electron transport and D1 protein damage (3Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). An additional inactivation process occurs when the donor side of PSII is unable to supply electrons to P680 leading to an accumulation of abnormally long-lived oxidizing radicals (i.e. P680+, TyrZ+) on the donor side of PSII (3Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). Recently, a preferential Cu(II) inhibition of the donor side compared with the acceptor side was reported (32Jegerschöld C. Arellano J.B. Schröder W.P. Van Kan P.J.M. Barón M. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12747-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Schröder W.P. Arellano J.B. Bittner T. Barón M. Eckert H.-J. Renger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32865-32870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors proposed that Cu(II) binds to TyrZ, so the electron transfer to P680 becomes blocked as is the case for manganese-depleted PSII membranes. However, in these conditions we observed a much faster D1 degradation compared with what happened in Cu(II)-treated samples (Fig. 2). The findings indicated that at least Cu(II)-inhibited PSII membranes did not behave as a typically donor side-damaged PSII. In such case, a protective secondary electron donor that could reduce the photoinduced positive charges on the donor side, which inhibited the additional D1 degradation, should be postulated. Jegerschöld et al. (32Jegerschöld C. Arellano J.B. Schröder W.P. Van Kan P.J.M. Barón M. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12747-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have in fact reported that a new electron donor instead of TyrZ+ appears in the Cu(II)-inhibited samples using EPR spectroscopy. However, no Chl or carotenoid radicals with a lifetime longer than 1 ms could be detected by flash absorption measurements (33Schröder W.P. Arellano J.B. Bittner T. Barón M. Eckert H.-J. Renger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32865-32870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If we assume a model for Cu(II)-inhibited RCs where Cu(II) blocks TyrZ oxidation and an alternative electron donor reducing P680 appears, then D1 degradation differences between a nontreated and Cu(II)-treated non-oxygen evolving PSII (i.e. manganese-depleted PSII membranes) should be observed. However, no such differences were found. Besides no restoration by DPC of the activity in the Cu(II)-treated samples was measured. Considering that DPC is an artificial electron donor that restores the PSII activity in donor side photoinhibited samples (26Eckert H.-J. Geiken B. Bernarding J. Napiwotzki A. Eichler H.J. Renger G. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 27: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), our data suggested that the site affected during illumination must be located after the DPC donation site. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the experimental conditions used in other recent works (32Jegerschöld C. Arellano J.B. Schröder W.P. Van Kan P.J.M. Barón M. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12747-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Schröder W.P. Arellano J.B. Bittner T. Barón M. Eckert H.-J. Renger G. J. Biol.

Res. 1995; 45: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are quite different to those used in this report and in our previous works (28Yruela I. Montoya G. Alonso P.A. Picorel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22847-22850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yruela I. Montoya G. Picorel R. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 33: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Yruela I.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Particularly, the Cu(II) concentrations used in our measurements (Cu(II)/RC ≃250) were much lower than those used by these authors (Cu(II)/RC ≃1,000-1,500).The importance of Cu(II) concentration to evaluate the effects of Cu(II) inhibition is also shown in Cyt b559 photoreduction experiments. In our experimental conditions, Cyt b559 was functional, and the ratio Cytred/Cytox was not modified in the presence of CuCl2 in contrast to the results of Jegerschöld et al. (32Jegerschöld C. Arellano J.B. Schröder W.P. Van Kan P.J.M. Barón M. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12747-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Light-induced difference spectra in the 540-585-nm range and kinetics of Cyt b559 at 560 nm were drastically modified in Cu(II)-treated samples compared with those of intact preparations. Copper treatment inhibited the photoreduction of Cyt b559. Buser et al. (24Buser C.A. Diner B.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11449-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) proposed that the reducing equivalent for Cyt b559 reduction must come from the electron acceptor side of PSII. They suggested reduced QB as the direct source of reductant to oxidize Cyt b559. The fact that in the presence of Cu(II) no reduction of Cyt b559 is observed after 20 s illumination indicates that this ion may modify the reducing side of PSII. We also measured a slower rate of Cyt b559 reduction in Cu(II)-inhibited samples as reported by these authors in PSII membranes inhibited by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. In addition to Cu(II) effect on the photoreduction of Cyt b559, the data showed a second Cu(II) effect at higher concentrations (≥50 µM, Cu(II)/RC = 185) which provides the photooxidation of Cyt b559. In nontreated O2-evolving PSII membranes, the rate of electron transfer from YZ to P680+ is several orders of magnitude faster than the rate of electron donation from Cyt b559 to P680+, and the quantum yield of Cyt b559 oxidation by P680+ is very low. However, in inactivated O2-evolving complexes the YZ to P680+ electron donation kinetics is significantly slowed down and the oxidation of Cyt b559 accelerated (24Buser C.A. Diner B.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11449-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Assuming that P680+ is the oxidant to Cyt b559, our results are consistent with the suggestion that in the conditions of excess of Cu(II) the P680+ formation is stabilized and a faster rate of Cyt b559 photooxidation should occur as is the case in non-oxygenic (i.e. NH2OH-treated) PSII membranes (24Buser C.A. Diner B.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11449-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This finding corresponds well with data published by Schröder et al. (33Schröder W.P. Arellano J.B. Bittner T. Barón M. Eckert H.-J. Renger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32865-32870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where higher concentrations of Cu(II) (Cu(II)/RC = 400-2300) were used and they would correspond with a donor side Cu(II) inhibition.On the other hand, the absorption spectral changes during illumination suggest that a significant protection against pigment photobleaching was achieved in the presence of Cu(II) as occurs when the acceptor side is protected by some electron acceptors (13Telfer A. He W.-Z. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 143-151Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Addition of the artificial acceptor silicomolybdate, which takes electrons close to the Pheo-QA domain (7Barber J. Chapman D.J. Telfer A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 67-73Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar), delays P680 photodamage at expense of 670 nm Chls and inhibits P680 triplet formation (13Telfer A. He W.-Z. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 143-151Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, we have measured the influence of Cu(II) inhibition on the primary reactions of PSII electron transport (31Yruela I. Gatzen G. Picorel R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results indicated that Cu(II) strongly impaired the formation of a relaxed radical pair probably by neutralizing the negative charge on QA− and eliminating the repulsive interaction between Pheo− and QA− and/or by modifying the general dielectric properties of the protein region surrounding these cofactors. A similar charge compensating effect has been observed upon double reduction of QA and subsequent protonation (54Vass I. Gatzen G. Holzwarth A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 388-396Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in our system the decrease of the free energy difference for the radical pair relaxation was even stronger than that reported by Vass et al. (54Vass I. Gatzen G. Holzwarth A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 388-396Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on these findings we postulated that a close attractive interaction between Pheo− and Cu2+ can occur. In addition, the fluorescence decay from Cu(II)-inhibited PSII centers did not show a long-lived component in the range of about 10 ns which is characteristic of a double reduction of QA (31Yruela I. Gatzen G. Picorel R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 54Vass I. Gatzen G. Holzwarth A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 388-396Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that facilitates the light-induced formation of a 3P680 due to charge recombination P680+/Pheo− (11Vass I. Styring S. Hundall T. Koivuniemi A. Aro E.-M. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). According to these results no higher production of 3P680 should be expected in the presence of Cu(II). This prediction is consistent with our singlet oxygen measurements where a lower yield of this oxygen species was detected during illumination in the presence of Cu(II) compared with the control. However, the findings of a lower photobleaching at 680 nm (Fig. 4) and a lower yield of singlet oxygen production (Fig. 6) are in agreement with the fact that Cu(II) may act in the acceptor side.Schröder et al. (33Schröder W.P. Arellano J.B. Bittner T. Barón M. Eckert H.-J. Renger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32865-32870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Cu(II) inhibition induced a shift of the P680+ reduction from ns to µs time domain, much slower than in the case of NH2OH-treated PSII. This phenomenon would lead to the accumulation of long-lived oxidizing radicals on the donor side and irreversible photobleaching of the accessory Chls absorbing at 670 nm during illumination, finally promoting a faster final P680 damage. However, the presence of Cu(II) during illumination prevented the blue shift of the long wavelength absorption band in both PSII membranes and OECC compared with that of NH2OH-treated PSII samples (data not shown). In Cu(II)-treated samples the carotenoid bleaching was much more rapid than the Chl loss. This phenomenon can be achieved by (a) a direct interaction with Chl triplets to form the carotenoid triplet that would avoid the formation of the reactive singlet oxygen species, or (b) a direct oxidation by P680+. The former possibility does not explain our results where the triplet yield would be lower than in intact samples, the second possibility is in accordance to our results.Previous reports are in favor of the importance of oxygen radicals in photoinhibition, and it is known that superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide can be generated by reactions with molecular oxygen in the acceptor side of PSII from oxidation of the quinones electron acceptors (52Barenyi B. Krause G.H. Planta. 1985; 163: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 55Kyle, D. J., Kyle, D. J., Osmond, C. B., Arntzen, C. H.

Photobiol. B Biol. 1993; 19: 19-29Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our experiments using EPR spin traps and oxygen radical scavengers suggest that photodamage in Cu(II)-treated PSII membranes is dominated by ˙OH which is produced from superoxide via Cu(II)-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction. According to that Cu(II) reduces the P680 triplet formation in our experimental conditions, and it is possible that the accumulation of reducing components at the acceptor side promotes the formation of superoxide species that yields hydroxyl radicals in Cu(II)-treated samples. Recently, in non-oxygen evolving PSII has been proposed that superoxide (57Chen G.-X. Kazimir J. Cheniae G.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11072-11083Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and hydroxyl (58Hideg É. Spetea C. Vass I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 143-152Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) radicals contribute to photodamage; however, these processes were non-oxygen-dependent in contrast to our data. Cu(II) could partially affect the donor side of PSII, and a potential H2O2 formation via H2O oxidation should also be taken into account (59Taoka S. Jursinic P.A. Seibert M. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as a source of ˙OH production causing PSII inactivation. However, this mechanism is also non-oxygen-dependent. Considering that ˙OH is an even more reactive species than 1O2 (48Haliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press-Oxford, London1989Google Scholar) and the production of active oxygen species during a donor side-induced photoinhibition does not require the presence of oxygen (58Hideg É. Spetea C. Vass I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 143-152Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 60Jegerschöld C. Styring S.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we postulate that the faster inactivation of PSII in the presence of Cu(II) compared with that of nontreated samples is due to damage by hydroxyl radicals generated at the acceptor side of PSII.

A 140-kDa matrix protein, ladsin, which appears to be identical to the laminin β2 chain, has been shown to promote scattering of carcinoma cells, stimulate cell migration, and bind to α3β1 integrin (9Miyazaki K.

Thus, it is possible that laminin/integrin interactions function not only in cell adhesion but also to transduce biochemical signals that modulate surface activities of degradation and invasion (11Ramos D.M.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis using fibronectin, laminin, type IV collagen, type I collagen, and Matrigel substrata demonstrated that degradation of these ECM components by transformed and tumor cells occurred at invadopodia, suggesting membrane association and activation of latent proteases during invasion (15Monsky W.L. Lin C.-Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Akiyama S.K. Chen W.-T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Yeh Y. Chen W.-T. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 158: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, no specific membrane-associated or secreted protease has yet been associated with an induced invasion. Recently, a systematic screening for cell binding sites with 113 overlapping synthetic peptide beads covering the laminin α1 chain carboxyl-terminal globular domain (G domain amino acid residues 2111-3060) resulted in the identification of 19 potential adhesion-active sequences (17Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20583-20590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here, we identified the peptides designated AG-10 and AG-32 that ligated α6β1 integrin in a similar manner as anti-β1 and α6 integrin antibodies promote melanoma invasiveness independently of the adhesion function of integrin receptors. These soluble peptides and antibodies could signal cell invasion at sites of ECM contact. We found that, accompanying the induced invasiveness, there was an increased organization of seprase on invadopodia, but the expression levels of seprase, gelatinase A, and β1 integrins were not altered.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that soluble AG-10 and AG-32 laminin G peptides and anti-integrin β1 and α6 mAbs can increase LOX human melanoma cell invasion by stimulating invadopodial activity. The peptides ligated predominantly the α6β1 integrin receptor that induced the subsequent recruitment of seprase to invadopodia found on the leading edge of invading cells, along with a concomitant increase of melanoma cell invasiveness. Our data suggest a mechanism for melanoma cell invasion in which cell invasiveness can be triggered when β1 integrins, particularly α6β1, on ECM-free surfaces of the cell are ligated by laminin G peptides or antibodies.The biochemical mechanisms by which laminin peptides exert their effect on invasion are less understood. In this report, we showed that binding of laminin peptides to the available integrin triggers a signal necessary for expression of cell invasiveness. Clustering and ligand occupancy of cell surface integrins are both involved in the activation of intracellular signaling (26Schwartz M.A. Lechene C. Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, fragments of laminin and fibronectin and antibodies against integrin stimulate cellular production of collagenases (8Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Thorgeirsson U.P. Rao C.N. Liotta L.A. J.

Ligation and perturbation of the αvβ3 or α5β1 integrins of human melanoma cells by an antibody or soluble adhesion protein promote secretion of Gelatinase A and cell migration/invasion regardless of whether the adhesion function of integrins was affected (12Seftor R.E.B.

In addition, there were no detectable changes in the expression level of either β1 integrins or membrane proteases, or their localization in focal contact sites, suggesting that the laminin peptides were functioning specifically to signal the recruitment of proteolytic molecules to invadopodia. Thus, the observed effects of the laminin peptides are independent of possible effects on cell adhesion or gene expression.Tumor cell invasiveness has been linked with either an increased production of ECM-degrading enzymes or surface association and activation of latent proteases. Using long term (72 h) Boyden chamber migration/invasion assays, laminin SIKVAV peptide was shown to stimulate invasive melanoma cells to either produce or activate gelatinase A (4Kanemoto T.

In addition, ligation of the α5β1 integrin of invasive C8161 human melanoma cells and the αvβ3 integrin of A375 human melanoma cells promotes invasion and a concurrent increase in secretion of gelatinase A (12Seftor R.E.B.

In contrast, we show here the involvement of AG-10 and AG-32 peptides via the α6β1 integrin in shorter term assays (within 5 h) that resulted in re-organization of seprase at invadopodia, increase in local fibronectin degradation, and invasion but not protein expression. We suggest that receptor binding or clustering of available integrins of adherent melanoma cells affected the invasive process via re-organization of cell surface seprase, that leads to enzyme activation (15Monsky W.L.

The factor that promotes cell invasiveness is not known. However, increasing evidence indicates that laminin, a major basement membrane glycoprotein, and its peptide fragments are able to promote cell invasion. One active peptide, IKVAV, is located on the COOH terminus of the long arm of the laminin α1 chain and promotes cell attachment, migration, tumor growth, metastasis (4Kanemoto T. Reich R. Royce L.

NIH-3T3 cells treated with the highly specific FTase inhibitor FTI-277 had no effect on PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or PDGF activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) at doses that completely inhibit FTase-dependent processing. In contrast, treatment of these cells with GGTase I inhibitor GGTI-298 strongly inhibited receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and co-treatment with FTI-277 had no additional effect. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of GGTI-298 on PDGF activation of MAPK was only partial. Furthermore, although lovastatin, which inhibits both protein geranylgeranylation and protein farnesylation, blocked PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, co-treatment with GGOH, but not FOH, reversed the lovastatin block. In addition, although lovastatin was observed to block MAPK activation by PDGF, co-treatment with GGOH, but not FOH, restored its activation. Further investigations indicated that inhibition of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to decreased expression of the receptor or to inhibition of GGTase II.

Using species-specific antisera, we selected human VAChT expressing cells by immunocytochemistry and identified the human VAChT protein by Western blotting. Active transport of [3H]ACh by, and binding of [3H]vesamicol to, human VAChT in storage organelles of PC-12 cells was significantly higher than levels mediated by the endogenous rat VAChT. This ATP-dependent uptake of ACh mediated by human VAChT was vesamicol-sensitive and was dependent on the proton gradient generated by the vesicular H+-ATPase. These results provide the first kinetic analysis of mammalian VAChT and demonstrate that ATP-dependent vesicular ACh transport can be studied in a cell-free assay following transfection of VAChT cDNA.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRecently, we cloned an ∼2.4-kilobase homolog of the rat VAChT cDNA from a human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH cells) cDNA library (6Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K.-H. Diebler M.-F. Weihe E. Modi W. Rand J.B. Eiden L.E. Bonner T.I. Usdin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21929-21932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we expressed the human VAChT cDNA in CV-1 fibroblasts and neuroendocrine PC-12 cells in an effort to develop an in vitro assay for ATP-dependent vesicular accumulation of ACh.Initially, the human VAChT cDNA was transiently expressed in CV-1 fibroblasts by the recombinant vaccinia/T7 polymerase system to ensure that VAChT protein was made and capable of binding [3H]vesamicol as described for the rat and Torpedo homologs as well as for unc-17 (5Varoqui H.

Human VAChT-expressing CV-1 cells contained a high affinity binding site for [3H]vesamicol which displayed a Kd of ∼3 nM and a Bmax of 2.4 pmol/mg (n = 2). The level of human VAChT expression in CV-1 fibroblasts was relatively low when compared with the level of expression of VMAT2 using the recombinant vaccinia virus assay. While the affinity of [3H]TBZOH for human VMAT2 was similar (Kd∼6.6 nM), the abundance of human VMAT2 expressed in this assay (Bmax∼12 pmol/mg) was approximately 5 times greater than that observed with human VAChT. Uptake of [3H]ACh by permeabilized fibroblasts or in postnuclear supernatants from CV-1 cells expressing the human VAChT cDNA was less than 2-fold greater than uptake observed in the presence of vesamicol (data not shown). This is in contrast to the ATP-dependent transport of monoamines by VMAT2 where specific uptake in permeabilized fibroblasts (21Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2314-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Erickson J.D. Schäfer M.K.-H. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is approximately 10-50 times greater than uptake observed in the presence of reserpine or tetrabenazine.Rat PC-12 cells possess storage vesicles, and their neuroendocrine background might be important to achieve high levels of VAChT expression and ATP-dependent transport of ACh in a cell-free system. By Western analysis, an abundant ∼75-kDa protein was recognized by an anti-human VAChT peptide antibody in human VAChT-expressing PC-12 cells (Fig. 1). The binding of [3H]vesamicol in postnuclear supernatants of PC-12 cells expressing human VAChT was significantly higher than levels detected in PC-12 cells containing only the endogenous rat VAChT (Fig. 2). The affinity of [3H]vesamicol for human VAChT expressed in PC-12 cells was similar to that found in human VAChT-expressing CV-1 cells exhibiting a Kd of 4.1 ± 0.6 nM (n = 4). However, the number of human VAChT transporters expressed was greatly increased, and the Bmax (8.9 ± 0.6 pmol/mg) was similar to that found for [3H]TBZOH binding to human VMAT2 in vaccinia-infected CV-1 cells.Fig. 2Binding of [3H]vesamicol to human VAChT. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared from human VAChT-expressing PC-12 cells (•) and control PC-12 cells (∘). Specific binding was measured as a function of increasing [3H]vesamicol concentration (0.8-116 nM) minus binding in the presence of 30 µM unlabeled vesamicol. Data are from a representative experiment performed in duplicate that was repeated four times. Inset, specific binding of [3H]vesamicol to human VAChT. The binding of [3H]vesamicol to the endogenous rat VAChT in control PC-12 cells (Kd 34.5 nM; Bmax 3.6 pmol/mg) was subtracted from the total binding observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The time course of vesamicol-sensitive vesicular [3H]ACh accumulation by human VAChT-expressing PC-12 cells and control PC-12 cells is shown in Fig. 3. Specific uptake mediated by human VAChT cDNA was linear for approximately 10 min with maximal steady-state levels attained by 30-60 min. Human VAChT-dependent uptake of [3H]ACh was completely inhibited by 2 µML-vesamicol. Approximately 20 times more [3H]ACh uptake was observed in the stable PC-12 cell line expressing human VAChT cDNA than in control PC-12 cells which only express the endogenous rat VAChT protein. Uptake mediated by the endogenous rat VAChT protein was less than 2-fold greater than that observed in the presence of 2 µML-vesamicol or at 4°C.Fig. 3Vesamicol-sensitive uptake of [3H]ACh by human VAChT.

The transport of [3H]ACh by human VAChT was dependent on exogenous ATP at 37°C with uptake reduced approximately 90% in its absence. Uptake was abolished by low temperature (4°C), the proton ionophore FCCP (2.5 µM), and bafilomycin A1 (1 µM), a specific inhibitor of the vesicular H+-ATPase (27Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Uptake was specifically inhibited by L-vesamicol, a noncompetitive inhibitor of vesicular ACh uptake in Torpedo (28Bahr B.A. Parsons S.M. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Diebler M.-F. MorotGaudry-Talarmain Y. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), exhibiting an IC50 of 14.7 ± 1.5 nM (Fig. 3, inset). The (L) isoform of vesamicol is approximately 20 times more potent than the (D) isoform to inhibit active transport of ACh in vesicles isolated from Torpedo (30Bahr B.A. Parsons S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). D-Vesamicol at 0.5 µM concentration reduced [3H]ACh uptake by human VAChT by only 20%. [3H]ACh uptake was not significantly affected by 0.5 µM reserpine or tetrabenazine which are selective inhibitors of vesicular monoamine transport (31Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. Hoffman B. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, [3H]ACh accumulation was not affected by chloride ions (10 mM), which stimulate transport of monoamines and glutamic acid by mammalian synaptic vesicles (33Erickson J.D. Masserano J.M.

The initial rate of [3H]ACh uptake was measured during the linear portion of the time course (6 or 10 min) and was saturable with an apparent Km of 0.97 ± 0.1 mM and Vmax = 0.58 ± 0.04 nmol/min/mg (n = 4). The turnover of human VAChT (Vmax/Bmax) was approximately 65/min. The turnover of ATP-dependent ACh transport in vesicles purified from Torpedo has been reported to be as high as 10/min (2Parsons S.M. Prior C. Marshall I.G. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 35: 279-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The turnover determined for VMAT1 and VMAT2 in postnuclear supernatants from transfected CHO endothelial cells is approximately 10/min and 40/min, respectively (26Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 4Kinetic analysis of uptake by human VAChT.

Kinetic parameters of [3H]ACh transport in portnuclear supernatants of control PC-12 cells could not be accurately determined as this uptake represented less than 5% of the total vesamicol-sensitive uptake observed in the human VAChT-expressing PC-12 cell line and was subtracted. Data are from a representative experiment performed in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated four times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A comparison of the time course of active transport by human VAChT at various subsaturating concentrations of [3H]ACh in the medium reveal that different levels of maximal steady-state accumulation of [3H]ACh were attained at equilibrium (Fig. 5, inset). At each ACh concentration, uptake was linear for about 10 min and then leveled off by 30-60 min of incubation. Thus, the vesicles in human VAChT-expressing PC-12 cells in vitro do not simply accumulate [3H]ACh until the vesicular compartment is full but rather seems to reflect the concentration of [3H]ACh present in the medium. Using a wide range of ACh concentrations, we find that the maximal accumulation of [3H]ACh at 30 min increased linearly up to 1 mM exogenous [3H]ACh and saturated at approximately 4 mM (Fig. 5). The concentration of ACh in the cytoplasm of nerve terminals of mammalian brain is estimated to be at 0.2 to 1 mM (2Parsons S.M. Prior C. Marshall I.G. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 35: 279-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Given the Km of ACh for VAChT (∼1 mM), active transport of ACh by synaptic vesicles may not be saturated in vivo.Fig. 5Maximal levels of [3H]ACh accumulation by human VAChT. Saturation isotherm of [3H]ACh (0.06-6.4 mM) accumulation at 30 min by human VAChT. Uptake of [3H]ACh by control PC-12 cells was subtracted. Inset, time courses of vesamicol-sensitive [3H]ACh uptake by human VAChT at four subsaturating concentrations of ACh. In all cases, the amount of ACh accumulated represents less than 1% of the total ACh added to the medium. The data are from a representative experiment performed in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice with essentially identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Vesicular levels of ACh in vivo may reflect the cytoplasmic concentration of ACh in cholinergic nerve terminals. Hence, treatments that increase brain choline levels result in increased synthesis and release of ACh in vivo (36Koshimura K. Miwa S. Lee K. Hayashi Y. Hasegawa H. Hamahata K. Fujiwara M. Kimura M.

Furthermore, transfected rat PC-12 cells which overexpress the ACh biosynthetic enzyme ChAT show increased vesicular ACh levels and increased stimulated release of ACh following choline loading (40Misawa H. Shoji-Kasia Y. Takahashi R. Sugiyama T. Takagi H. Yoshida A. Yoshioka T. Takahashi M. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1994; 20: 890Google Scholar).

Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is possible that this results from a decrease in synthesis and vesicular storage of ACh. Recent studies indicate that [3H]vesamicol binding to VAChT and [3H]hemicholinium binding to the high affinity choline uptake transporter are unchanged or increased despite the marked reduction in ChAT mRNA and protein in surviving neurons of Alzheimer's disease brain (43Kish S.J.

Uncoupling of ChAT and VAChT gene expression may lead to a reduction in vesicular ACh pools resulting in presynaptic cholinergic hypofunction. An analysis of the abundance of human VAChT mRNA and protein relative to the expression of ChAT in cholinergic neurons in normal and in pathological conditions may provide important information regarding the potential uncoupling of this “cholinergic” gene locus.In the present study, we determined the functional parameters of ATP-dependent vesicular accumulation of ACh by human VAChT. The low apparent affinity of ACh for VAChT and the concentration-dependent steady-state levels of vesicular ACh accumulation attained in vitro support the notion that perturbation in the level of ACh synthesis would have corresponding effects on the storage and release of ACh in vivo.

Using species-specific antisera, we selected human VAChT expressing cells by immunocytochemistry and identified the human VAChT protein by Western blotting. Active transport of [3H]ACh by, and binding of [3H]vesamicol to, human VAChT in storage organelles of PC-12 cells was significantly higher than levels mediated by the endogenous rat VAChT. This ATP-dependent uptake of ACh mediated by human VAChT was vesamicol-sensitive and was dependent on the proton gradient generated by the vesicular H+-ATPase. These results provide the first kinetic analysis of mammalian VAChT and demonstrate that ATP-dependent vesicular ACh transport can be studied in a cell-free assay following transfection of VAChT cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1987814120,Available thermodynamic data and seismic models favor perovskite (MgSiO3) as the stable phase in the mantle. MgSiO3 was heated at temperatures from 1900 to 3200 kelvin with a Nd-YAG laser in diamond-anvil cells to study the phase relations at pressures from 45 to 100 gigapascals. The quenched products were studied with synchrotron x-ray radiation. The results show that MgSiO3 broke down to a mixture of MgO (periclase) and SiO2 (stishovite or an unquenchable polymorph) at pressures from 58 to 85 gigapascals. These results imply that perovskite may not be stable in the lower mantle and that it might be necessary to reconsider the compositional and density models of the mantle.
https://openalex.org/W2034126977,"During the yellowing of leaves the porphyrin moiety of chlorophyll is cleaved into colorless linear tetrapyrrolic catabolites, which eventually are deposited in the central vacuoles of mesophyll cells. In senescent cotyledons of rape, Brassica napus, three nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs), accounting for practically all the chlorophyll broken down, were found to be located in the vacuoles (vacuoplasts) prepared from protoplasts. Transport of catabolites across the tonoplast was studied with vacuoles isolated from barley mesophyll protoplasts in conjunction with a radiolabeled NCC, Bn-NCC-1, prepared from senescent rape cotyledons. The uptake of Bn-NCC-1 into vacuoles was against a concentration gradient and strictly dependent on MgATP and it followed saturation kinetics with a Km of approximately 100 µM. Although the hydrolysis of ATP was required, transport was apparently independent of the vacuolar proton pumps: accumulation of the NCC occurred both in the presence of the H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin and after destroying the ΔpH between the vacuolar sap and the medium. ATP could be replaced by GTP or UTP, and the transport was inhibited in the presence of vanadate. Chlorophyll catabolites isolated from senescent barley leaves competed with the rape-specific substrate for uptake into the vacuoles. Compounds such as the glutathione conjugate of N-ethylmaleimide and taurocholate, which are known to be transported across the tonoplast in a primary active mode, did not significantly inhibit uptake of Bn-NCC-1. Although the heme catabolites biliverdin and bilirubin inhibited the uptake of the NCC, this effect is caused by unspecific binding to the vacuolar membrane rather than to the specific inhibition of carrier-mediated transport. Taken together, the results demonstrate that barley mesophyll vacuoles are constitutively equipped with a directly energized carrier that transports tetrapyrrolic catabolites of chlorophyll into the vacuole."

A tricorn-shaped protease was isolated from the archaeon Thermoplasma and was shown to form a multisubunit proteolytic complex. The 120-kilodalton monomer assembled to form a hexameric toroid that could assemble further into a capsid structure. Tricorn protease appeared to act as the core of a proteolytic system; when it interacted with several smaller proteins, it displayed multicatalytic activities."

The present study was undertaken to further characterize the role of the macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR) in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth. The growth-stimulating effect of Ox-LDL on murine resident peritoneal macrophages was inhibited by maleylated bovine serum albumin (maleyl-BSA), a non-lipoprotein ligand for MSR but a poor carrier of lyso-PC, while maleyl-BSA itself failed to induce macrophage growth even in the presence of lyso-PC. Moreover, it competitively inhibited the endocytic uptake of 125I-Ox-LDL and the specific uptake of lyso-PC by MSR, whereas nonspecific lyso-PC transfer to cells was not affected. Furthermore, the Ox-LDL-induced cell growth of peritoneal macrophages obtained from MSR knockout mice was significantly weaker than that of macrophages obtained from their wild-type littermates.

Here we tested this hypothesis using primary cultures of hippocampal neurons derived from cathepsin D-deficient (knock out) mice and expressing wild-type human APP and two clinical APP variants via recombinant Semliki Forest virus. We demonstrate APP secretory processing, production of carboxyl-terminal amyloid fragments, and secretion of the βA4-amyloid peptide in the complete absence of cathepsin D.

The results indicate that 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex supports L-selectin-mediated adhesion much better than sialyl Lex similarly tagged on the cell surface. In contrast, 6-sulfo sialyl Lex containing a sulfate group on the N-acetylglucosamine residue did not support adhesion with either selectin.

Several lines of studies indicate, however, that a sulfated sialylated and fucosylated oligosaccharide(s) is the natural ligand for L-selectin. For example, the binding of L-selectin was abolished by pretreatment of high endothelial venules with neuraminidase (8Rosen S.D. Singer M.S. Yednock T.A. Stoolman L.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1005-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Fucoidin, a highly sulfated fucose polymer, efficiently inhibits L-selectin binding (9Stoolman L.M. Tenforde T.S. Rosen S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibition of sulfation in those cells expressing L-selectin ligands resulted in the loss of L-selectin binding to ligands (10Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D.

The binding of L-selectin and P-selectin with high affinity, however, can be achieved only when the ligands are presented on specific glycoproteins. For L-selectin, it has been shown that GlyCAM-1, CD34, and MadCAM-1 are the major glycoproteins that express L-selectin ligands with high affinity (11Lasky L.A. Singer M.S. Dowbenko D. Imai Y.

These three glycoproteins contain amino acid sequences that carry mucin-type O-glycans, allowing multiple presentation of oligosaccharide ligands. It has been also demonstrated that sialyl Lex in O-glycans can be formed only in N-acetyllactosamine extensions formed by core 2 branches (14Fukuda M. Carlson S.R. Klock J.C. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12796-12806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24379-24386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later it was shown that core 2 branches could be newly expressed in CHO cells by introducing core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, C2GnT (16Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that GlyCAM-1 contains the sulfated forms of sialyl Lex, and the major sulfated oligosaccharide appears to be NeuNAcα2→3(sulfate→6)Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3) GlcNAc→, 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex (17Hemmerich S.

In addition, sulfate→6 GlcNAc was detected in the acid hydrolysate of the oligosaccharides derived from GlyCAM-1 (19Hemmerich S. Bertozzi C.R. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4820-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting that NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4(sulfate→6)GlcNAc, 6-sulfo sialyl Lex could be present in GlyCAM-1 oligosaccharides. Although these studies demonstrate that 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex and possibly 6-sulfo sialyl Lex are present in GlyCAM-1, no studies have been published so far demonstrating that either of these structures actually supports the L-selectin-mediated adhesion. In order to form a sulfated, sialylated Lex from the precursor N-acetyllactosamine, a sialyltransferase(s), a fucosyltransferase(s), and a sulfotransferase(s) are required. Although a sialyltransferase (20Sasaki K. Watanabe E. Kawashima K. Sekine S. Dohi T. Oshima M. Hanai N. Nishi T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol.

In order to test if a sulfated sialylated oligosaccharide serves as a ligand for L-selectin, we thus elected in the present study to employ a novel method for transferring oligosaccharides to the cell surface of CHO cells by a combination of synthetic chemistry and enzymatic transfer (25Srivastava G. Kaur K.J. Hindsgaul O. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22356-22361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, oligosaccharides attached to C-6 of GDP-fucose can be transferred to C-3 or C-4 of N-acetyllactosamine or Galβ1→3GlcNAc as an intact oligosaccharide unit linked to C-6 of fucose (25Srivastava G. Kaur K.J. Hindsgaul O. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22356-22361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Because a milk fucosyltransferase can add fucose to 3′-sialylated oligosaccharides as well (26Priells J.P. Monnom D. Dolmans M. Beyer T.A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10456-10463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Johnson P.H. Watkins W.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1982; 10: 445-446Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), many terminal oligosaccharides can be acceptors for this reaction. We then tested the resulting CHO cells expressing 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex or 6-sulfo sialyl Lex for adhesion to E- or L-selectin chimeric protein. The results clearly demonstrate that 6′-sulfo Lex is a better ligand for L-selectin than sialyl Lex, and 6-sulfo sialyl Lex does not support the adhesion to either L-selectin or E-selectin. CHO DG44 cells expressing C2GnT and leukosialin, CHO-leu·C2GnT, were established as described (16Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Cell lines which were positive for CD34 were further tested for the expression of C2GnT and leukosialin using T305 antibody that recognizes core 2 branched oligosaccharides attached to leukosialin (16Bierhuizen M.F.A.

Hindsgaul, manuscript in preparation. These oligosaccharides were attached to C-6 of GDP-fucose through a new linker as described (32Hällgren C. Hindsgaul O. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1995; 14: 453-464Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These oligosaccharides are called GDP-Fuc-6′-sulfo sialyl Lex and GDP-Fuc-6sulfo sialyl Lex, respectively. Similarly, GDP-Fuc-sialyl Lex was synthesized. α1→3/4-Fucosyltransferase was partially purified from human milk as described (25Srivastava G. Kaur K.J. Hindsgaul O. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22356-22361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-leu·C2GnT·CD34 (4 × 106) cells, attached to each of 6-well chambers, were incubated with 2.4 milliunits of the purified fucosyltransferase and 174 nmol of the GDP-Fuc-oligosaccharide derivatives in 1 ml of Opti-minimum essential medium containing 7 mM MnCl2, which was titrated to pH 7.0 by 1 N HCl. After incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37°C for 16 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in α-minimum essential medium. Resultant CHO cells were labeled with Tran35S as described (30Sawada R. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1425-1431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells tagged with sialyl Lex, 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex, and 6-sulfo sialyl Lex oligosaccharides are named CHO-sialyl Lex, CHO-6′-sulfo sialyl Lex, and CHO-6-sulfo sialyl Lex, respectively. E-selectin-Fc chimera and L-selectin-Fc chimera were purified as described (30Sawada R. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

The above-mentioned monodispersed CHO cells (5 × 104 cells) were suspended in 100 µl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and added to each of 96 wells coated with E-selectin-Fc chimera protein or L-selectin-Fc chimera protein, coated as described (33Sueyoshi S.

The remaining adherent cells were released by the cell dissociation solution (Specialty Media, Lavallette, NJ), and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (30Sawada R. Tsuboi S.

Moreover, anti-sialyl Lex antibody (CSLEX-1, Becton Dickinson) is IgM, which is a pentameter, and the number of oligosaccharides cannot be accurately determined by using anti-sialyl Lex antibody. This antibody did not react with 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex or 6-sulfo sialyl Lex, either. In order to circumvent the problem, we determined the number of binding sites of Maachia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) (34Wang W.-C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4576-4585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to α-2,3-linked sialic acid in the oligosaccharides. For this, sialyl Lex-BSA conjugates (25Srivastava G. Kaur K.J. Hindsgaul O. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22356-22361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were first coated on plates, and the number of binding sites of mouse monoclonal anti-BSA antibody (Sigma) to the conjugates was measured according to the procedure of Ho and Springer (35Ho M.-K. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 636-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described (36Saitoh O. Wang W.-C. Lotan R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5700-5711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit serum albumin (Organon Teknika) was used to block nonspecific binding because anti-BSA antibody did not cross-react with rabbit serum albumin. From this experiment, the amount of BSA in each well was estimated as 0.034 pmol of BSA. Since, on average, 15 oligosaccharides were attached to each molecule of BSA,2 this predicts that 0.509 pmol of oligosaccharides are present in each coated well. In parallel, the number of binding sites of MAA to sialyl Lex-BSA conjugates was determined by addition of biotinylated MAA (Vector) followed by 125I-streptavidin (Amersham). At the saturation levels, the amount of bound MAA should be equivalent to 0.509 pmol/well. This measurement thus allowed us to build a calibration curve. To estimate the amount of the sialyl Lex or sulfo sialyl Lex oligosaccharides on the cell surface, various amounts of biotinylated MAA were added at 4°C to various CHO cells tagged with oligosaccharides. The amount of bound MAA was determined by binding of 125I-streptavidin at 4°C. CHO cells were incubated with the fucosyltransferase and GDP-Fuc-sialyl Lex, GDP-Fuc-6′-sulfo sialyl Lex, or GDP-Fuc-6-sulfo sialyl Lex. As shown in Fig. 2A, the resultant CHO-sialyl Lex cells express a substantial amount of sialyl Lex, detected by immunofluorescent staining using anti-sialyl Lex antibody. Fig. 2B shows the corresponding immunostaining of CHO-FTIII cells, which were produced by gene transfer of Fuc-TIII (22Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 31Jain R.K. Vig R. Rampal R. Chandrasekaran E.V. Matta K.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 12123-12124Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The staining pattern of CHO-sialyl Lex is distinct from that of CHO-FTIII cells in that CHO-sialyl Lex cells show more clustered staining (Fig. 2A). In order to estimate how much sialyl Lex, 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex, or 6-sulfo sialyl Lex oligosaccharides were transferred, the binding assays using MAA were performed on these cells. Control CHO cells were found to have 1.84 × 105 binding sites of MAA (Fig. 3A), since they express α-2,3-linked sialic acid (37Sasaki H. Bothner B. Dell A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12059-12076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Smith D.F. Larsen R.D. Mattox S. Lowe J.B. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6225-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that α-2,3-linked sialic acid in sialyl Lex, 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex, and 6-sulfo sialyl Lex equally bind to MAA, the binding sites of MAA in these three CHO cells were determined. The results demonstrated almost identical numbers of binding sites of MAA (4.39 × 105, 4.35 × 105, and 4.64 × 105) in CHO-sialyl Lex, CHO-6′-sulfo sialyl Lex, and CHO-6-sulfo sialyl Lex (Fig. 3, B, C, and D). By subtracting the amount of α-2,3-linked sialic acid present in control CHO cells, it can be concluded that 2.51 to 2.80 × 105/cell of sialyl Lex, 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex, and 6-sulfo sialyl Lex were transferred to the cell surface of CHO cells. These results also corroborated our hypothesis that α-2,3-linked sialic acid in different oligosaccharides bind almost equally to MAA, providing that the efficiency of oligosaccharide transfer is not influenced by their structural differences. Fig. 4 demonstrated clearly that CHO-sialyl Lex adhered well to E-selectin chimera (column 2), while the adhesion was minimum to control human IgG proteins (column 3). The adhesion was completely inhibited by preincubation of the cells with anti-sialyl Lex antibody (column 4), anti-E-selectin antibody, or by the addition of 5 mM EDTA (data not shown), but not by control mouse IgM (column 5). Surprisingly, CHO-6′-sulfo sialyl Lex cells adhered well to E-selectin (column 7). However, almost no adhesion was detected for CHO-6-sulfo sialyl Lex cells (column 10). As shown in Fig. 5, CHO cells expressing 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex adhered well to L-selectin chimera (column 5). This adhesion could be inhibited by preincubation with anti-L-selectin antibody (column 7), but not by control mouse IgG (column 8). In contrast, sialyl Lex oligosaccharides on CHO cells modestly supported the adhesion to L-selectin (column 2). Apparently, the expression of CD34 is critical since CHO cells which were not transfected with CD34 cDNA did not support the adhesion to L-selectin (data not shown). More strikingly, CHO cells expressing 6-sulfo sialyl Lex did not adhere to L-selectin at all (column 10). These combined results indicate that 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex is a much better ligand for L-selectin than sialyl Lex while it is a slightly less efficient ligand for E-selectin than sialyl Lex. 6-Sulfo sialyl Lex on the other hand is hardly bound to either E- or L-selectin. Previous studies have demonstrated that GlyCAM-1, which carries L-selectin ligands, can have a sulfate group in C-6 of galactose, 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex and C-6 of N-acetylglucosamine, 6-sulfo sialyl Lex (17Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 19Hemmerich S. Bertozzi C.R. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4820-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The present study clearly indicates that 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex is a better ligand for L-selectin than sialyl Lex. These results are consistent with the previous report that sulfation was required for efficient binding of L-selectin to GlyCAM-1 (10Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, we also found in the present study that sialyl Lex is an inefficient yet moderate ligand for L-selectin. These results are consistent with the recent report on the inhibition of L-selectin-mediated adhesion using synthetic oligosaccharides; their results indicate that sialyl Lex is as effective as sulfate→3(sulfate→6)Galβ1→4Glc for inhibiting the binding of L-selectin to GlyCAM-1 (39Bertozzi C.R. Fukuda S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14271-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The present study also demonstrated that 6-sulfo sialyl Lex is not an efficient ligand for either E- or L-selectin. It is possible that the 6-sulfo sialyl Lex structure present in GlyCAM-1 does not serve well as a ligand for L-selectin. It was also reported that 6-sulfo sialyl Lex inhibits L-selectin binding to adressin (42Scudder P.R. Shailubhai K. Duffin K.L. Streeter P.R. Jacob G.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In those studies, however, only inhibition assay was employed, and the comparison with 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex was not tested. Recent crystallographic studies showed the structure of the carbohydrate-binding domain of E-selectin (40Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In that study, sialyl Lex tetrasaccharide was tentatively modeled based on the structure of the complex of mannose oligosaccharide-mannose-binding protein (41Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) and NMR data on sialyl Lex oligosaccharide (40Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). These results suggest that one of the critical amino acids involved in its binding may be glutamic acid 92 (40Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 41Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that a sulfate group at C-6 of N-acetylglucosamine in 6-sulfo sialyl Lex causes steric hindrance as well as charge repulsion to glutamic acid 92. It is also noteworthy that E- and L-selectin have a strong homology in the carbohydrate-binding domain, including those amino acids critical for their binding to carbohydrate ligands shown for mannose-binding protein (40Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 41Weis W.I.

Science. 1989; 243: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). It is thus not surprising that only quantitative differences in efficiency can be found between sialyl Lex and 6′-sulfo sialyl Lex for L-selectin- and E-selectin-mediated adhesion, as shown in the present study. As described in the introduction, the chemical and enzymatic tagging is powerful when testing the activity of oligosaccharides that cannot be synthesized on cells by gene transfer. We expect that the method employed in the present study will be an important tool in determining the roles of oligosaccharides on the cell surface in various studies. We would like to thank Dr. John Lowe for useful discussion, Dr. Monica M. Palcic for providing a partially purified milk fucosyltransferase, Dr. Edgar Ong for critical reading of the manuscript, and Susan Greaney for organizing this manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W1963792000,"Engagement of the T cell receptor induces the activation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase modules, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascades. Whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase is activated by T cell receptor/CD3 ligation alone, activation of JNK requires co-stimulation by the CD28 receptor. Activation of MEKK-1, which acts as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase in the JNK pathway, was also induced by CD3 plus CD28 (CD3/CD28) ligation in Jurkat cells. To study the significance of the JNK cascade in T lymphocytes, we established stable Jurkat cell lines that inducibly express dominant active (DA) or dominant negative (DN) MEKK-1. Whereas expression of DA-MEKK-1 resulted in the constitutive activation of JNK along with the transcriptional activation of the minimal interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter, DN-MEKK-1 inhibited JNK responsiveness during CD3/CD28 co-stimulation. In addition to inhibiting CD3/CD28-induced IL-2 mRNA expression, DN-MEKK-1 abrogated the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter and the distal nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-activating protein 1 (AP-1) response element in that promoter. A c-Jun mutant lacking activation sites for JNK also interfered with the activation of the distal NFAT/AP-1 complex, suggesting that the JNK pathway functions by controlling AP-1 response elements in the IL-2 promoter. Using inducible stable expression of DA- and DN-Ras in Jurkat cells, we found that Ras regulates JNK activation in these cells.

The requirement for dual receptor ligation to activate the JNK cascade is unique for T cells and raises the important question of whether both receptors contribute to the JNK cascade, e.g. by activating a component that is shared by both receptor types. In this regard, it is known that both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs induce GTP/GDP exchange on Ras (8Izquierdo M. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Cantrell D. J. Exp.

In addition, JNKs up-regulate c-Fos expression by phosphorylation of the ternary complex factor, p62TCF (Elk-1), which binds the c-fos promoter (23Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J.

Both c-Fos and c-Jun contribute to the expression of the IL-2 gene, which, as for JNK activation, is dependent on co-ligation of CD3 and CD28 (10Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M.

To this end, it is known that in the absence of CD28 co-stimulation, TCR ligation may lead to the induction of anergy and the inability to produce IL-2 (13Mueller D.L. Jenkins M.K. Curr. Opin.

Moreover, the defect in IL-2 production in anergic T cells has been correlated with the failure to activate AP-1 response elements in the IL-2 promoter (36Kang S.-M. Beverly B. Tran A.-C. Brorson K. Schwartz R.H. Lenardo M. Science. 1992; 257: 1134-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The minimal IL-2 promoter, consisting of the first 326 base pairs immediately upstream of the start site of the IL-2 gene, is sufficient to confer TCR and CD28 responsiveness (32Fraser J.D.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Occupancy of the distal NFAT/AP-1 site requires the cooperative interaction of NFAT proteins with the adjacent AP-1 complex (42Rooney J.W. Sun Y.-L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 43Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R.

Nature. 1993; 365: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Suggestive evidence for the involvement of JNKs in regulation of the distal NFAT/AP-1 element is provided by the observation that a dominant negative (DN) c-Jun mutant lacking a transactivation domain, was able to block the activation of the distal NFAT site (45Petrak D. Memon S.A. Birrer M.J. Ashwell J.D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2046-2051PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the above, we were interested in determining whether the simultaneous ligation of TCR/CD3 and CD28 activates the JNK pathway in T lymphocytes in an MEKK-1-dependent fashion and whether this pathway contributes to activation of the IL-2 promoter. In order to accomplish our goals, we established stable transfected Jurkat cell lines with inducible expression of dominant active (DA)-MEKK-1, dominant negative (DN)-MEKK-1, DA-Ras, or DN-Ras under a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) protein. We used these cell lines to study the effect of MEKK-1 on IL-2 mRNA expression, including the effect of this kinase on transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter and the distal NFAT response element. Our data show that DA-MEKK-1 expression leads to constitutive activation of the JNK cascade in Jurkat cells, whereas DN-MEKK-1 expression abrogated JNK activation during CD3/CD28 co-stimulation. Moreover, DN-MEKK-1 inhibited the induction of IL-2 mRNA expression along with inhibition of transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter and distal NFAT site. In contrast, DA-MEKK-1 enhanced transcriptional activation of these reporter constructs. DN-Ras interfered with activation of the JNK cascade during CD3/CD28 co-ligation, whereas DA-Ras enhanced JNK activation by the same stimulatory combination, including treatment with anti-CD3 mAb alone. The anti-CD3 mAb, OKT3, was from Ortho Pharmaceuticals (Raritan, NJ). Anti-CD28 (clone 9.3) was a generous gift from Brystol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Seattle, WA). Anti-MEKK-1 polyclonal antiserum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A was purchased from Amersham Corp. The glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun construct was generously provided by Dr. J. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Ontario, Canada). G418, hygromycin, PMA, and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma. The tetracycline-repressible system, including the pUHD15.1, pUHD10.3, pTPH, and pUHC13.3 vectors, was a kind gift from Dr. H. Bujard (Heidelberg, Germany). The pUHD15.1 plasmid encodes for the tTA, whereas the pUHD10.3 plasmid contains a tTA-dependent promoter upstream of a minimal PhCMV-1 promoter and a multiple cloning site (46Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muler G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar, 47Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The pTPH plasmid was derived from pUHD10.3 and includes the hygromycin resistance gene. The reporter plasmid, pUHC13.3, also includes the tet operator sequences and the PhCMV promoter upstream of a luciferase gene (46Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muler G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for DA-MEKK-1 (MEKKΔ) and DN-MEKK-1 (MEKKΔ K432M) were a gift from Dr. G. Johnson (National Jewish Center for Immunology and Research, Denver, CO). The cDNAs for N17Ras and V12Ras were kindly provided by Dr. G. Cooper (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and Dr. F. Tamanoi (University of California, Los Angeles, CA), respectively. DA-MEKK-1, DN-MEKK-1, V12Ras, and N17Ras were subcloned into the pUHD10.3 multiple cloning site in order to establish an inducible expression system. The distal NFAT and minimal IL-2 promoter (−326 to 46) reporter constructs were kindly provided by Dr. C. Zacharchuck (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Dr. G. Crabtree (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), respectively. A subclone of Jurkat cells, BMS2, selected for its strong responsiveness to CD28 coligation, was a generous gift from Dr. R. Mittler (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA). An aliquot of 107 Jurkat BMS2 cells was transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of pUHD15.1 plasmid. Electroporation was performed as described (45Petrak D. Memon S.A. Birrer M.J. Ashwell J.D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2046-2051PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were selected in 2 mg/ml G418, cloned, and tested for the expression of the tTA by transient transfection of the reporter construct, pUHC13.3. A Jurkat clone with elevated expression of tTA, designated Jurkat-tTA, was transfected with 20 μg of pUHD10.3 encoding DA- or DN-MEKK-1, in the presence of 5 μg of pTPH plasmid. Cells were selected in 270 μg/ml hygromycin for 4 weeks prior to the start of experiments. Ten μg of NFAT- and IL-2p-luciferase constructs were transiently transfected into 107 Jurkat cells, stably transfected with DA- or DN-MEKK-1. Duplicate samples were pooled and rested for 16 h. The cells were stimulated for 8 h with 100 nM PMA plus 1 μg/ml ionomycin in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 or 2 μg/ml anti-CD28, as indicated. The cells were lysed in luciferase buffer (Analytical Luminescence, Ann Arbor, MI), and luciferase activity was measured by using 100 μg of proteins in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence). Intersample variation in efficiency of transfection was monitored by cotransfection with 5 μg of pSVβGal reporter plasmid (Promega Corp, Madison, WI). Aliquots of 4 × 107 Jurkat-tTA cells stably transfected with DN-MEKK-1 were grown in the presence (tet(+)) or absence (tet(−)) of 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. The cells were stimulated for 8 h with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3, 2 μg/ml anti-CD28, a combination of anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, or a combination of 100 nM PMA plus 1 μg/ml ionomycin. The cells were washed, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription was performed at 42°C in the presence of 2 units of murine mammary tumor virus and 20 μg of RNA. Semiquantitative PCR was carried out with Taq polymerase for 30 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94°C and 2 min at 55°C. The primers used for β-actin amplification were as follows: sense, 5′-AATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACA, and antisense, 5′-CGACGTAGCACAGCTTCTCCTTA. The IL-2 primers were as follows: sense, 5′-ACTCACCAGGATGCTCACAT, and antisense, 5′-AGGTAATCCATCTGTTCAGA. The PCR product was separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the gels were viewed by UV transillumination. Tetracycline was withdrawn for 24 h from aliquots of 107 Jurkat-tTA cells stably transfected with DA- or DN-MEKK-1. 100 μg of cell lysates were prepared for blotting as described previously (48Faris M. Ensoli B. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G. Nguyen A. Wang S. Nel A. AIDS. 1996; 10: 370-377Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed using 0.1 μg/ml anti-MEKK-1 and a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-coupled protein A. 5 × 106 parental or transfected Jurkat BMS2 cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3, 2 μg/ml anti-CD28, or with 100 nM PMA plus 1 μg/ml ionomycin for 10 min. ERK, JNK, and MEKK-1 kinase assays were performed as described previously (48Faris M. Ensoli B. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G. Nguyen A. Wang S. Nel A. AIDS. 1996; 10: 370-377Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that TCR/CD3 ligation by itself does not activate MEKK-1 in Jurkat cells (9Gupta S. Weiss A. Kumar G. Wang S. Nel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TCR/CD3 ligation does, however, activate Raf-1, MAP or ERK kinase-1, and ERK2 in Jurkat cells (9Gupta S. Weiss A. Kumar G. Wang S. Nel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Whitehurst C.E. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.G. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3230-3273PubMed Google Scholar). When the CD3 receptor was ligated in the presence of anti-CD28 mAb, induction of MEKK-1 activity was seen in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1). Treatment with anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 alone (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4) did not induce the phosphorylation of the substrate, recombinant kinase-inactive MAP or ERK kinase-1 (Fig. 1, lane 5). Simultaneous treatment with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb did, however, induce MEKK-1 activity as compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 2, respectively). In addition to co-ligation of the above receptors, it has been shown that a combination of PMA and ionomycin will also activate JNK activity in T cells (10Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The latter combination also induced MEKK-1 activity in Jurkat BMS2 cells (Fig. 1, lane 6). These results suggest that MEKK-1 acts as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase in the TCR/CD28-inducible JNK cascade in T cells. Jurkat BMS2 cells were transfected with 10 μg of the pUHD15.1 neo vector, which encodes for the tTA protein (46Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muler G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar, 47Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). After stable selection and subcloning in G418, we wished to ascertain that the selected clones express tTA protein. This was determined by co-transfecting the pUHC13.3 vector and performing luciferase assays on cells grown in the absence or presence of tet. pUHC13.3 contains seven tet operator sequences upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Whereas in the presence of tet there was a minimal expression of luciferase activity, there was a 17-fold increase in luciferase activity in the cell clone designated as Jurkat-tTA in the absence of tetracycline. We co-transfected Jurkat-tTA cells with pUHD10.3, which contains seven tet operator sequences upstream of a minimal promoter and a polylinker site. We used either empty vector or pUHD10.3, into which we subcloned DA-MEKK (MEKKΔ) or DN-MEKK (MEKKΔ K432M). A vector with a selectable hygromycin-resistant cassette was co-transfected and used to select hygromycin-resistant populations. When the cells were grown in the absence of tetracycline (tet(−)), abundant DA-MEKK-1 or DN-MEKK-1 protein could be seen to be expressed (Fig. 2). In contrast, no mutant protein was expressed in the same populations grown in the presence of tetracycline (tet(+)) (Fig. 2). To determine the possible effect of stable expression of DA-MEKK-1 on Jun kinase activity, we employed an in vitro kinase assay, which utilizes glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1-79) as substrate (Fig. 3A). In cells stably transfected with DA-MEKK-1 and grown under tet(+) conditions (Fig. 3A, lanes 6-10), treatment with anti-CD3 (lane 7) or anti-CD28 alone (lane 8) did not induce JNK activity compared with untreated cells (lane 6). Stimulation with a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb stimulated JNK activity 14-fold (lane 9), whereas treatment with PMA and ionomycin stimulated JNK activity 12-fold (lane 10). Identical results were obtained in DN-MEKK-1 or empty vector cells grown in the presence of tet (data not shown). When tetracycline was withdrawn from the DA-MEKK-1 population for 24 h, JNK activity in unstimulated cells was increased 10-fold compared with basal activity in tet(+) cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 6). Whereas treatment with anti-CD3 alone (13-fold, lane 2), anti-CD28 alone (8-fold, lane 3), or a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (11-fold, lane 4) showed little additional stimulation, PMA plus ionomycin treatment increased activation to 17-fold (Fig. 3A, lane 5). These results show that JNKs were constitutively active in DA-MEKK-1-expressing cells and that receptor stimulation had very little additional effect. The specificity of DA-MEKK-1 on JNK activation was confirmed by conducting in vitro ERK-2 assays (Fig. 3B). Whereas in vector-only cells, anti-CD3-induced ERK-2 activity compared with that in untreated cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2), no increase above background level was seen in DA-MEKK-expressing cells, which maintained their CD3 inducibility (lanes 3 and 4). These results show that stable expression of DA-MEKK-1 selectivel"

MPS VI has also been described in the Siamese cat. As an initial step toward enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant feline 4S (rf4S) in MPS VI cats, the feline 4S cDNA was isolated and expressed in CHO-KI cells and rf4S was immunopurified from the culture medium. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the precursor form of immunopurified rf4S was a 66-kDa polypeptide that underwent maturation to a 43-44-kDa polypeptide. Endocytosis of rf4S by cultured feline MPS VI myoblasts was predominantly mediated by a mannose 6-phosphate receptor and resulted in the correction of dermatan sulfate storage. The mutation causing feline MPS VI was identified as a base substitution at codon 476, altering a leucine codon to a proline (L476P). The L476P allele displayed no detectable 4S activity when expressed in CHO-KI cells and was observed only as a “precursor” polypeptide that was not secreted into the medium.

https://openalex.org/W2105108972,"Atherosclerosis involves the arterial accumulation of lipid-laden “foam cells” containing oxidized and unoxidized sterols and their esters (Mattsson-Hulten, L., Lindmark, H., Diczfalusy, U., Bjorkhem, I., Ottosson, M., Liu, Y., Bondjers, G., and Wiklund, O. (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97, 461-8). Oxidized sterols are probably critical to atherogenesis because they inhibit cholesterol removal from cells and are cytotoxic. We recently reported that there is deficient induction of cellular cholesterol efflux by apolipoprotein A-I, the main initial acceptor of cellular cholesterol from macrophages loaded in vitro with oxidized low density lipoprotein (Kritharides, L., Jessup, W., Mander, E., and Dean, R. T. (1995) Arterioscler. Thromb. 15, 276-289). There was an even more marked impairment of the release of 7-ketocholesterol which is a major oxysterol in these cells and in human atherosclerotic lesions. Here we show that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin can induce selective efflux of 7-ketocholesterol. Efflux of 7-ketocholesterol was time and concentration dependent, and the rate of its removal was 50-fold greater for hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin than for apolipoprotein A-I. Over a defined range of concentrations (0-5 mg/ml), efflux of 7-ketocholesterol was preferred over that of cholesterol and occurred without cell toxicity. Efflux of free 7-ketocholesterol was associated with decreased intracellular free and esterified 7-ketocholesterol. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin also enhanced efflux of other oxysterols. The physical solubilization of 7-ketocholesterol by the cyclodextrin was much greater than that of cholesterol, in accordance with its differential effects on efflux. These data highlight the importance of extracellular sterol solubilization in the efflux of cellular oxysterols and the mobilization of intracellular free and esterified oxysterol pools in macrophages loaded with oxidized low density lipoprotein. Synthetic sterol-solubilizing agents such as hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin are thus potential prototypes for the further development of oxysterol-removing agents. Atherosclerosis involves the arterial accumulation of lipid-laden “foam cells” containing oxidized and unoxidized sterols and their esters (Mattsson-Hulten, L., Lindmark, H., Diczfalusy, U., Bjorkhem, I., Ottosson, M., Liu, Y., Bondjers, G., and Wiklund, O.

We recently reported that there is deficient induction of cellular cholesterol efflux by apolipoprotein A-I, the main initial acceptor of cellular cholesterol from macrophages loaded in vitro with oxidized low density lipoprotein (Kritharides, L., Jessup, W., Mander, E., and Dean, R. T. (1995) Arterioscler. Thromb. 15, 276-289). There was an even more marked impairment of the release of 7-ketocholesterol which is a major oxysterol in these cells and in human atherosclerotic lesions. Here we show that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin can induce selective efflux of 7-ketocholesterol. Efflux of 7-ketocholesterol was time and concentration dependent, and the rate of its removal was 50-fold greater for hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin than for apolipoprotein A-I. Over a defined range of concentrations (0-5 mg/ml), efflux of 7-ketocholesterol was preferred over that of cholesterol and occurred without cell toxicity. Efflux of free 7-ketocholesterol was associated with decreased intracellular free and esterified 7-ketocholesterol. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin also enhanced efflux of other oxysterols. The physical solubilization of 7-ketocholesterol by the cyclodextrin was much greater than that of cholesterol, in accordance with its differential effects on efflux. These data highlight the importance of extracellular sterol solubilization in the efflux of cellular oxysterols and the mobilization of intracellular free and esterified oxysterol pools in macrophages loaded with oxidized low density lipoprotein. Synthetic sterol-solubilizing agents such as hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin are thus potential prototypes for the further development of oxysterol-removing agents.

Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major product of sterol oxidation found in oxidized LDL (OxLDL) is 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) (3Zhang H. Bastra H.J.K. Steinbrecher U.P. J.

Biophys. Acta. 1966; 125: 620-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and is the principal oxysterol in macrophages loaded with OxLDL in vitro (3Zhang H. Bastra H.J.K. Steinbrecher U.P. J.

Oxysterols, including 7KC, are enriched in plaque compared with circulating lipoproteins, and there is a further relative concentration of oxysterols in plaque macrophage foam cells than in total human plaque sterols (7Mattsson-Hulten L.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that there is deficient induction by apo A-I of cellular cholesterol efflux from macrophages loaded in vitro with OxLDL (9Kritharides L. Jessup W. Mander E. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 15: 276-289Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). There was an even more marked impairment of the release of 7KC, the major oxysterol in these cells (9Kritharides L. Jessup W. Mander E. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 15: 276-289Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Intracellular accumulation of oxysterols (including 7KC) in endothelial cells (10Kilsdonk E.P.C. Morel D.W. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 505-516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and macrophages (11Gelissen I.C. Brown A.J. Mander E.L. Kritharides L. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17852-17860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) can impair cholesterol efflux. Additionally, 7KC is a major contributor to OxLDL-mediated cytotoxicity (12Hughes H. Mathews B. Lenz M.L. Guyton J.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and oxysterols may contribute to the generation of the highly thrombogenic necrotic core of advanced atherosclerotic plaque (13Guyton J.R. Black B.L. Seidel C.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 425-434PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, removal of oxysterols such as 7KC in vivo might facilitate physiological cholesterol efflux, prevent cell death, and hence reverse or stabilize atherosclerosis.Cyclodextrins are cyclical sugar polymers known to solubilize a range of hydrophobic compounds within their hydrophobic core (14Bender M.L. Komiyama M. Cyclodextrin Chemistry. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1978Crossref Google Scholar). They can interact with and precipitate lipoproteins, solubilize pharmacological agents, and form inclusion complexes with lipids (15Irie T. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Sharma A. Janis L.S. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 199: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). β-Cyclodextrins (containing 7 D-glucopyranose units) solubilize cholesterol from erythrocyte membranes (17Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Several β-cyclodextrins have been recently found to promote cellular cholesterol efflux (18Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), and we have independently investigated a means for facilitating removal of 7KC from OxLDL-loaded macrophages in vitro, using these agents (Part of this work has already been published in preliminary form (19Kritharides L. The Oxidation and Metabolism of Low Density Lipoprotein by Macrophages. Ph.D. thesis, University of Sydney1994Google Scholar).).It was hypothesized that solubility may be limiting for efflux of 7KC from OxLDL-loaded macrophages and that certain cyclodextrins might efficiently solubilize 7KC and thus induce its efflux from cells. We have specifically investigated hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (hp-β-CD) in facilitating efflux of 7KC for three reasons: (a) chemically hydroxyalkylated cyclodextrins such as hp-β-CD are >50 times more water soluble than native β-cyclodextrins and do not precipitate lipoproteins; (b) hydroxyalkylated cyclodextrins are virtually nontoxic to animals, whereas native β-CD can be quite toxic; and (c) and hp-β-CD has been shown to solubilize both cholesterol and, importantly for our studies with 7KC, oxysterols such as 7α-hydroxycholesterol (20Brewster M. Simpkins J.W. Hora M.S. Stern W.C. Bodor N. J. Parenteral Sci. Technol. 1989; 43: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar, 21Petrack B. Latario B.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 643-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We here report the results of studies showing that hp-β-CD removes 7KC from macrophages loaded with OxLDL more effectively than apo A-I and solubilizes and removes 7KC preferentially compared with cholesterol.DISCUSSIONOxLDL and oxysterols in particular may contribute to various component processes of atherogenesis. These include monocyte recruitment, cell toxicity, endothelial dysfunction, and inhibition of cholesterol efflux (2Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kritharides L. Jessup W. Mander E. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 15: 276-289Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Kilsdonk E.P.C.

Thromb. 1995; 15: 1968-1974Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Facilitating the removal of oxysterols may therefore be important for reversing or limiting these consequences in vivo. These data are the first to identify that hp-β-CD removes 7KC from OxLDL-loaded macrophages, thereby overcoming the deficient efflux of 7KC mediated by apo A-I. They have also identified a relative selectivity of hp-β-CD in removing 7KC in preference to cholesterol and demonstrate that the efflux of oxysterols (such as 7KC) by cyclodextrins promotes the mobilization of intracellular oxysteryl esters.Cyclodextrins function as encapsulating and solubilizing agents for hydrophobic compounds. Cyclodextrin-mediated cellular sterol efflux would therefore be expected to be independent of binding to cellular proteins such as high density lipoprotein-binding proteins (31Oram J.F. Brinton E.A. Bierman E.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) but would more probably arise from the capacity of these agents to solubilize sterols derived from the plasma membrane. The diffusion of sterols from the plasma membrane across the unstirred water layer is rate limiting for efflux (28Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that limited solubilization of 7KC may restrict its diffusion from OxLDL-loaded macrophages to apo A-I and have demonstrated that hp-β-CD enhances efflux of 7KC at least in part by enhancing its solubility.It is well known that oxysterols, including 7KC, desorb into the aqueous phase from lipid layers such as the cell surface, more rapidly than does cholesterol. For example, this is expressed in the more rapid movement of 25-hydroxycholesterol than cholesterol from red blood cells to plasma lipoproteins (32Lange Y. Ye J. Strebel F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by the faster transfer of oxysterols than cholesterol between phospholipid liposomes (33Kan C.C. Yan J. Bittman R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consequently, if cholesterol and 7KC were to associate with the cyclodextrin cavity with equal affinity, the potential for faster desorption of 7KC could explain the more rapid accumulation of 7KC than of cholesterol in cell culture media containing hp-β-CD. Since apo A-I induces less efficient release of 7KC than cholesterol from macrophages, it is apparent that factors other than desorption are important in regulating efflux of 7KC from OxLDL-loaded macrophages. In the case of hp-β-CD, we assessed the possibility that an additional crucial factor might be the solubilization of sterols, as must occur subsequent to desorption for net mass efflux to be observed, lest the sterol resorb to the cell membrane. We demonstrated that hp-β-CD far more efficiently solublized 7KC from aqueous suspension in comparison with cholesterol, an observation that paralleled its more effective induction of cellular efflux of 7KC than of cholesterol. Apo A-I did not induce demonstrable solubilization of sterols in aqueous suspensions; rather, it apparently promoted their aggregation. We conclude that differential solubilization of sterols by hp-β-CD may be a key factor in its capacity to preferentially induce efflux of 7KC and other oxysterols from macrophages. This implies differential affinity for the cyclodextrin cavity for different sterols in aqueous solution, but these data also suggest that simple solubilization does not readily explain the sterol-binding properties of apo A-I.We have observed that cells and hp-β-CD reach an equilibrium with respect to efflux of 7KC quickly but not instantaneously, consistent with the data of Kilsdonk et al. (18Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) for cholesterol efflux. This equilibrium did not result in nonspecific leakage of sterols from the cells following defined short incubations with hp-β-CD, but it required the ongoing supply of cyclodextrin. Physicochemical complexes between cholesterol and β-cyclodextrins vary in stoichiometry from 1:1 to 1:3 (34Claudy P. Létoffé J.M. Germain P. Bastide J.P. Bayol A. Blasquez S. Rao R.C. Gonzalez B. J. Therm. Anal. 1991; 37: 2497-2506Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Frömming K-H. Fridich R. Mehnert W. Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 1993; 39: 148-152Google Scholar), but near complete sequestration of a sterol or other “guest” by cyclodextrins in solution is usually achieved only at high cyclodextrin:guest concentration ratios (>50:1), even with preferred guests such as phenolphthalein (36Barcza L. Buvari-Barcza A. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 192: 103-109Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our solubilization and cell data indicate that guest occupancy of hp-β-CD by 7KC is substantially greater than that by cholesterol. In the complex system involving intact cells and many different potential guest molecules, it is not surprising that even higher ratios of hp-β-CD to sterol are observed. More selective and efficient acceptors of 7KC derived from hp-β-CD may lower this ratio.Most important is our observation that intracellular 7-ketocholesteryl esters in OxLDL-loaded and 7KC-AcLDL-loaded cells decrease in response to free 7KC efflux to hp-β-CD. This indicates that synthetic sterol-capturing agents such as cyclodextrins can cause net hydrolysis of intracellular esters simply by accepting sterols from the cell membrane. For oxysterols in particular, this fact is novel in confirming that that oxysterol efflux almost certainly promotes the hydrolysis of oxysteryl esters by cytosolic hydrolase, in a manner analogous to that described by apo A-I and high density lipoprotein for cholesteryl esters. Thus, at least for oxysterols such as 7KC, binding of apolipoproteins to specific cell protein receptors is not essential for some mobilization of intracellular esters. In addition, the extent of decline in detectable cell unesterified 7KC and 7KC ester in response to incubation with hp-β-CD implies that much intracellular 7KC in OxLDL-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages is not sequestered lysosomally, as had been suggested in J774 cells (37Maor I. Aviram M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 803-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of cyclodextrin-mediated efflux on other unquantified pools of steryl esters (5Brown A.J. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 320-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) requires further investigation.Presently understood hp-β-CD plasma-membrane interactions (15Irie T. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) suggest that hp-β-CD promotes the release of 7KC without partitioning into the plasma membrane. The capacity of synthetic agents such as hp-β-CD to overcome deficient oxysterol efflux may facilitate oxysterol transfer to lipoproteins. In vivo oxysterol efflux by hp-β-CD or its derivatives has the potential to prevent the inhibition of sterol efflux and cytotoxicity caused by oxysterols and could facilitate the reversal of the foam cell phenotype by normal reverse cholesterol transport mechanisms.

The enzyme-DNA complexes formed in the presence of manganese were not reversed by subsequent addition of EDTA, indicating that the divalent metal required for integrase catalysis is tightly bound in a ternary enzyme-metal-DNA complex.

Recently, it was shown to belong to a larger gene family, members of which play an important role in programmed cell death. A common feature of the ICE family proteases is the presence of a prodomain that has been hypothesized to keep the enzyme in an inactive form. Expression analysis in yeast revealed autocatalytic degradation of p45ICE, but not of p30ICE lacking a prodomain. We further demonstrate that p45ICE, in which the critical cysteine has been mutated, is still able to dimerize in vivo. Dimerization requires the prodomain and occurs prior to autoprocessing.

Expression analysis in yeast revealed autocatalytic degradation of p45ICE, but not of p30ICE lacking a prodomain. We further demonstrate that p45ICE, in which the critical cysteine has been mutated, is still able to dimerize in vivo. Dimerization requires the prodomain and occurs prior to autoprocessing. These results provide evidence for a regulatory role of the prodomain of ICE.

Interestingly, while transient overexpression of all these cDNAs can induce apoptotic cell death, ICE only is able to cleave the prodomain of IL-1β efficiently. This has been demonstrated clearly with mice deficient in ICE, which do not produce mature IL-1β and are fairly resistant to endotoxic shock, but which show completely normal apoptotic features (23Li P.

Comparison of the cleavage sites in the proform of IL-1β and several other ICE substrates reveals an absolute requirement for an Asp residue at position P1 in order to function as a substrate for ICE (25Howard A.D.

ICE is made as a 45-kDa precursor protein (p45), the maturation of which involves removal of an N-terminal prodomain and an internal linker sequence separating a p20 and a p10 subunit. Cleavage of the p45 precursor occurs at four distinct Asp residues, suggesting a role for autocatalytic processing (5Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P.

The crystal structure of ICE as a complex with a tetrapeptide inhibitor revealed that active ICE, lacking the prodomain and linker, is a tetramer of two p20 subunits surrounding two adjacent p10 subunits that form the dimer-dimer interface (26Walker N.P.C. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenz C.R. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Hackett M.C. Hammill L.D. Herzog L. Hugunin M. Houy W. Mankovich J.A. McGuiness L. Orlewicz E. Paskind M. Pratt C.A.

The active site of ICE is composed of amino acid residues from both p20 and p10 with Cys-285 and His-237 forming a catalytic dyad (27Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P.

Starting from the specific quaternary structure of ICE, two models for the maturation of the ICE proenzyme were proposed. The first model assumes an association of two p45 precursor proteins and subsequent processing. The p20 and p10 subunits forming one active site are derived from two distinct precursor proteins after autoprocessing of interdigitating precursors (27Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The second model supposes processing followed by association of mature proteins (27Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the molecular events leading to active ICE is important in view of the development of specific ICE inhibitors. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to study ICE/ICE interaction in vivo and demonstrate that the prodomain of ICE is absolutely required for dimerization and autoactivation of ICE. The yeast two-hybrid system was purchased from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Polyclonal antibodies recognizing the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding region were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole was purchased from Sigma. XGal was obtained from Saxon Biochemicals (Hannover, FRG). Transformation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c was achieved with the lithium acetate method (28Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's directions. Yeast colonies carrying putative interacting proteins were selected by growth on synthetic minimal media, lacking Trp, Leu, and His, in the presence of 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and by screening for βGal activity in a filter assay using XGal as a substrate. Murine ICE cDNA was isolated from an L929r2 cDNA library, 2M. Van de Craen, manuscript in preparation. and an NdeI-BamHI fragment was fused in-frame to Gal4DB in the yeast expression vector pAS2 (Gal4DBp45ICE). Gal4DBp30ICE was obtained by cloning an Eco0109-BamHI fragment corresponding to ICE lacking the N-terminal prodomain (p30ICE) in combination with a small linker joining NdeI and Eco0109 in pAS2. The above NdeI-BamHI fragment of p45ICE and p30ICE was also ligated to an EcoRI-NdeI adaptor and cloned in-frame of Gal4AC into pGAD424, resulting in Gal4ACp45ICE and Gal4ACp30ICE, respectively. Similarly, Gal4AC-PRO was prepared by cloning the NdeI-BamHI fragment, in which a stop codon was created between the prodomain and p20 by cutting with SacI and religation, in-frame of Gal4AC into pGAD424. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with a kit from Clontech Laboratories in the pMa plasmid containing a chloramphenicol-sensitive gene (29Stanssens P. Opsomer C. Mc. Keowny Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fretz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). By using two oligonucleotides containing the mutation of interest and a mutation which inactivates the chloramphenicol-sensitive gene, respectively, one can then select for mutants by growing transformants in the presence of chloramphenicol. Cloning and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. After transformation of the appropriate pAS2 plasmid encoding Gal4DB fusion proteins into S. cerevisiae strain HF7c and incubation on plates lacking Trp, single colonies were inoculated into 15 ml of synthetic medium lacking Trp. At A600 between 1.3 and 1.5, the culture was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min, the pellet was washed in distilled water and boiled for 3 min in 200 µl of 2 × Laemmli loading buffer. 50 µl of this sample was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, FRG). Detection of the expressed fusion proteins was performed with polyclonal anti-yeast Gal4DB antibody and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody using ECL (Amersham Life Science, Amersham, UK). To study the role of the prodomain in dimerization and autoactivation of murine ICE we used the yeast two-hybrid system (30Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4875) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of p45ICE or ICE lacking the N-terminal prodomain (p30ICE) was fused in-frame to Gal4DB or Gal4AC in the yeast expression vectors pAS2 and pGAD424, respectively. As estimated by multiple sequence alignment with its human counterpart, the prodomain of ICE comprises the first 122 amino acids. A schematic representation of the fusion proteins used is given in Fig. 1. After transformation into HF7c of pAS2 encoding Gal4DB fusion proteins, single colonies were used to prepare lysates that were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Subsequent Western blot analysis with antibodies against the N-terminal Gal4DB revealed a band of the expected size (51 kDa) in the case of Gal4DBp30ICE. Remarkably, a slightly faster migrating band (50 kDa) was visible in the case of Gal4DBp45ICE (Fig. 2). Considering its size and recognition by an anti-Gal4DB antibody, the latter band likely resulted from cleavage between p20 and p10 ICE subunits. To determine whether this degradation was due to autocleavage or to a (aspecific) yeast factor, a point mutation was introduced at position 285 to convert Cys in the active site of the conserved QACRG sequence to Ser (C285S). This mutation has previously been shown to result in complete inactivation of the proteolytic activity of ICE (31Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 32Howard A.D. Palyha O.C. Griffin P.R. Peterson E.P. Lenny A.B. Ding G.J. Pickup D.J. Thornberry N.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2321-2332PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of lysates of yeast cells transformed with the active site mutants Gal4DBp30ICE-C285S or Gal4DBp45ICE-C285S (Fig. 1) only showed bands corresponding to the expected full-length fusion proteins (51 and 62 kDa, respectively; Fig. 2), which means that the previously observed degradation product of wild-type p45ICE was due to autoprocessing at its C-terminal end. The absence of a smaller degradation product corresponding to a fusion of Gal4DB and the prodomain of ICE (30 kDa) suggests that prior removal of the prodomain is not required for autoproteolysis at a site between the p20 and p10 subunits (Fig. 2). This was also confirmed by mutating two Asp residues to Glu at the end of the prodomain, corresponding to potential cleavage sites. Expression of the obtained mutein Gal4DBp45ICE-2DE (Fig. 1) in yeast still revealed a band corresponding to a degradation product of 50 kDa as observed after expression of Gal4DBp45ICE (data not shown). These results further indicate that removal of the N-terminal prodomain is not a prerequisite for autoprocessing at the C terminus. The importance of the prodomain in ICE dimerization was investigated by the yeast two-hybrid system. Several combinations of plasmids, encoding fusions between Gal4DB or Gal4AC and wild-type or mutated p45ICE and p30ICE or the prodomain as such (Fig. 1), were cotransformed in S. cerevisiae strain HF7c which contains the his3 and lacZ reporter genes under control of a Gal4 promoter. Cotransformation of the yeast expression vectors pVA3 and pTD1, which encode Gal4 fusion proteins of the strong interacting p53 and SV40-LT oncogene, respectively, served as a positive control. The ability of transformed cells to grow on His-deficient plates in the presence of 5 mM 3-aminotriazole and the expression of βGal activity were used as parameters for interaction. Single plasmid transformation or cotransformations using the appropriate empty plasmids pGAD424 or pAS2 did not result in (auto)activation of the reporter genes. The specificity of the interactions was verified by cotransforming cDNAs coding for interacting irrelevant proteins, viz. p53 or SV40-LT (Table I). None of the transformations with wild-type constructs resulted in His auxotrophy or βGal activity, indicating that there were no interacting ICE proteins present. In contrast, after cotransformation of Gal4DBp45ICE-C285S-encoding and Gal4ACp45ICE-C285S-encoding plasmids, both reporter genes were activated. These results show that there is interaction only between the full-length p45ICE molecules and that autocatalytic processing leads to truncated proteins that are no longer able to interact. Moreover, Gal4DBp45ICE-C285S and Gal4ACp30ICE-C285S were unable to interact, indicating that the prodomain is absolutely required for interaction. Finally, cotransformation of the prodomain of ICE as such (Gal4AC-PRO) with either Gal4DBp30ICE-C285S or Gal4DBp45ICE-C285S did not result in reporter gene activity, suggesting that the prodomain is required, but not sufficient, for dimerization of p45ICE.Table ISummary of cotransformations analyzed in the yeast two-hybrid assayGal4DBGal4DBp45ICEGal4DBp45ICE-C285SGal4DBp45ICE-C285S-2DEGal4DBp30ICEGal4DBp30ICE-C285SGal4DBp53Gal4AC−−−−−−−Gal4ACp45ICE−−−−−−−Gal4ACp45ICE-C285S−−++−−−Gal4ACp30ICE−−−−−−−Gal4AC-PRO−−−−−−−Gal4AC-SV40-LT−−−−−−+ Open table in a new tab ICE is synthesized as a precursor protein with an N-terminal prodomain of 11 kDa and a linker sequence which separates a p20 and a p10 subunit (5Thornberry N.A.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Crystal structure analysis of ICE in complex with a tetrapeptide inhibitor revealed that ICE lacking the prodomain and linker between the p20 and p10 subunits, is a tetramer of two p20 subunits surrounding two adjacent p10 subunits forming the dimer-dimer interface. The active site is composed of amino acid residues of both p20 and p10 subunits (27Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Structural data of p45ICE have not been presented yet, but two models for maturation of p45ICE have been proposed. In the first model, one assumes an association of two p45 precursor proteins and subsequent processing. The second model proposes processing followed by association of mature proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that the prodomain of ICE is absolutely required, although not sufficient, for dimerization and autoproteolytic cleavage of ICE. Dimerization could only be observed with functionally inactive mutants, demonstrating that dimerization occurs prior to autoproteolysis. Interestingly, autoproteolysis could only be observed with p45ICE, but not with p30ICE lacking its prodomain. It has been demonstrated previously that separate expression of the p20 and p10 subunits in Sf9 cells results in functional ICE, which suggests a regulatory, rather than a structural, role for the prodomain (16Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contradistinction with numerous other proenzymes, where the prodomain is necessary for proper maturation or folding of the protein (33Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Further evidence for a regulatory role of the prodomain is based on the fact that the evolutionary divergence between ICE and the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog CED-3 is larger in the prodomain. Although we demonstrated a role of the prodomain of ICE in dimerization and autoprocessing, other regulatory mechanisms mediated by the prodomain, such as interaction with an inhibitor, post-translational modification, or subcellular localization, cannot be excluded. The fact that the prodomain of ICE is separated from the p20 subunit by two Asp residues which are potential cleavage sites for ICE has led to the general assumption that the prodomain is removed by autocatalytic processing (5Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). However, after expression of p45ICE, we could not detect any degradation products resulting from prodomain removal. Similarly, only ICE precursor forms have been detected in mammalian cell lines, although biological ICE activity was present (34Miossec C. Decoen M.C. Durand L. Fassy F. Diu-Hercend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 3W. Van Criekinge, R. Beyaert, M. Van de Craen, P. Vandenabeele, P. Schotte, D. De Valck, and W. Fiers, unpublished results. Our results suggest that removal of the prodomain is not an absolute requirement for biological activity of ICE. It is, however, conceivable that p45ICE and processed ICE might have different substrate specificities and activities (35Yamin T.T. Ayala J.M. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13273-13282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). When the presence of different ICE homologs is considered, the situation becomes even more complex. It is not unlikely that the prodomain of ICE can be removed by another ICE homolog. The large family of ICE proteases can, based on phylogenetic comparison, be divided in three subgroups: the ICE group (ICE/TX/ICErel3), the ICH group (ICH), and the CPP32 group (CPP32/MCH-2/MCH-3). The members of the ICE and ICH group all contain large prodomains, while those of the CPP32 group have only a minimal prodomain which needs to be removed for activation. Comparable to the Bcl-2 family, where hetero-oligomerization between the different members is crucial for the biological outcome (36Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Therefore, our observation that the prodomain of ICE is absolutely required for dimerization and subsequent autoprocessing might have important implications for the understanding of a possible interplay between prodomains of different ICE homologs and for the development of specific ICE inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2084634327,"Treatment of HeLa cells with retinoic acid (RA) gives rise to a marked stimulation in the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into an ∼87-kDa cytosolic protein that cross-reacts with a monoclonal antibody raised against tissue transglutaminases. In the absence of RA treatment, the transglutaminase immunoreactivity elutes from a gel filtration column with an apparent size of ∼600 kDa (designated TGa), whereas following RA treatment, a second peak of transglutaminase immunoreactivity (designated TGb) is detected with an apparent size of ∼150 kDa. The TGa fractions show little or no GTP-binding or GTP hydrolytic activity and very little transglutaminase activity. However, the TGb fractions show all three activities. Retinoic acid treatment also promotes the association of the GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase with membrane fractions, as detected by Western blotting and photoaffinity cross-linking with [α-32P]GTP. In addition, the TGb fraction shows a markedly enhanced ability (relative to TGa) to associate with membranes from control (non-RA-treated) cells. The ability of the GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase to bind to membranes is correlated with the stimulation of a membrane-associated phospholipase C activity. Thus, these findings indicate that RA treatment results in a number of changes in the biochemical properties of a GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase which strongly enhance its ability to bind GTP, associate with plasma membranes, and stimulate phosphoinositide lipid turnover. Treatment of HeLa cells with retinoic acid (RA) gives rise to a marked stimulation in the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into an ∼87-kDa cytosolic protein that cross-reacts with a monoclonal antibody raised against tissue transglutaminases. In the absence of RA treatment, the transglutaminase immunoreactivity elutes from a gel filtration column with an apparent size of ∼600 kDa (designated TGa), whereas following RA treatment, a second peak of transglutaminase immunoreactivity (designated TGb) is detected with an apparent size of ∼150 kDa. The TGa fractions show little or no GTP-binding or GTP hydrolytic activity and very little transglutaminase activity. However, the TGb fractions show all three activities. Retinoic acid treatment also promotes the association of the GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase with membrane fractions, as detected by Western blotting and photoaffinity cross-linking with [α-32P]GTP. In addition, the TGb fraction shows a markedly enhanced ability (relative to TGa) to associate with membranes from control (non-RA-treated) cells. The ability of the GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase to bind to membranes is correlated with the stimulation of a membrane-associated phospholipase C activity. Thus, these findings indicate that RA treatment results in a number of changes in the biochemical properties of a GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase which strongly enhance its ability to bind GTP, associate with plasma membranes, and stimulate phosphoinositide lipid turnover.

A number of different members of the TGase family have been identified and characterized. These include TGase1, a membrane-associated activity that appears to be involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope of the epidermis (3Thacher S.M. Rice R.H.

Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).Clues to the mechanisms that underlie the biological functions of the TGase2 enzyme have come from two lines of research. The first was the realization that TGase2 is in essence a dual function GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase. Achyuthan and Greenberg (15Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first reported that TGase2 activity was regulated by guanine nucleotides, and then subsequently it was demonstrated that purified TGase2 preparations were capable of hydrolyzing GTP (16Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that a GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase that shares sequence similarity with TGase2 is present in the nucleus (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and that the TGase activity of this protein is specifically inhibited by GTP but not by GDP. It also appears that a GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase with similar characteristics is present in plasma membranes and is capable of stimulating phosphoinositide lipid turnover (18Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This protein, originally named Gh (19Im M.-J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), shares strong sequence similarity with TGase2 and appears to be responsible for mediating the coupling of the α1-adrenergic receptor to a potentially new isoform of phospholipase C (20Im M.-J. Riek R.P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18952-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A second important clue to the biochemical mechanisms that regulate TGase2 function has come from the findings that retinoic acid (RA) and other retinoids induce TGase activity in different cells (21Uuspa S.H. Ben T. Steinert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9906-9908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lichti U. Ben T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoids have been shown to play a potentially important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (23Chiocca E.A. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bertram J.S. Cancer Surv. 1983; 2: 243-262Google Scholar, 27Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3034-3040PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular effects of RA are felt to be elicited by changes in gene expression as an outcome of the interactions of RA with its cellular binding proteins and nuclear receptors (28Ragsdale C.W. Petkovic M. Gates P.B. Chambon P. Brockes J.P. Nature. 1989; 341: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Zelent A. Krust A. Petkovic M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 339: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, the RA-induced stimulation of TGase2 activity in HeLa cells appeared to occur independently of any change in the levels of TGase2 mRNA (30Piacentini M. Fesus L. Farrace M.G. Ghibelli L. Piredda L. Melino G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the RA-induced stimulation of enzyme activity represented a direct effect on the TGase2 protein, rather than simply an increase in TGase2 expression. Nonetheless, it was proposed that the stimulation of TGase2 activity and the ensuing cross-linking of cellular proteins was directly related to the apoptotic activity of RA.Our laboratory has for some time been interested in the mechanisms by which GTP-binding proteins are regulated. The tissue TGases represent a potentially new class of GTP-binding proteins where high affinity GTP-binding and GTPase activity is coupled to a possible effector (TGase) activity within the same molecule. The reported effects of RA on cellular TGase activity suggested that this differentiation/apoptotic agent might exert regulatory effects on the biochemical and GTP-binding activities of TGase2 enzymes. In the present study, we show that RA treatment of HeLa cells results in a variety of effects on the biochemical properties of GTP-binding protein/transglutaminases. These include a change in the elution properties of the GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase from a gel filtration column, suggestive of a change in the oligomeric state of the protein and/or in its ability to associate with other cellular proteins. This change is accompanied by stimulated GTP-binding, GTPase activity, and TGase activity. Treatment with RA also results in the appearance of a GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase in membranes, which is accompanied by a marked stimulation of GTP-binding activity and the stimulation of phosphoinositide lipid turnover.DISCUSSIONIn the studies described above, we have demonstrated that RA treatment of HeLa cells elicits a variety of changes in the biochemical properties of a GTP-binding protein/TGase that appears to be highly related if not identical to TGase2. Among the most notable changes is a (RA-induced) stimulation of the GTP-binding activity of two proteins of apparent size 87 kDa and 36 kDa. The properties of these two GTP-binding proteins from HeLa cell cytosol are very similar to a pair of GTP-binding proteins (∼80 kDa and 36 kDa) that we initially identified in rabbit liver nuclei (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and showed to be highly similar in sequence to the tissue TGase2 protein. We proposed that the rabbit liver 36-kDa nuclear GTP-binding protein was a proteolytic fragment of the 80-kDa nuclear protein (based on microsequence analysis), such that the 36-kDa protein represented the amino-terminal half of a GTP-binding protein/TGase and included the entire GTP-binding domain. We suspect that the HeLa cell 87-kDa and 36-kDa GTP-binding proteins represent a similar case.The RA-stimulated increase in GTP-binding activity of the cytosolic 87-kDa protein was accompanied by changes in its elution properties during gel filtration chromatography. In the absence of RA treatment, the protein eluted as part of a larger protein complex with an apparent mass of ∼600 kDa (designated TGa). However, upon RA treatment, the cytosolic GTP-binding protein eluted with an apparent size of ∼150 kDa (TGb). This is close to the predicted size for a dimeric version of the 87-kDa protein and may be related to the situation for the keratinocyte TGase (TGase1) which typically exists as a dimer of apparent molecular mass 190 kDa (34Rice R.H. Rong X. Chakravarty R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we find that the TGb species contains virtually all of the GTP-binding activity as well as a markedly enhanced GTP hydrolytic activity and transglutaminase activity. Thus, taken together, our results would suggest that RA treatment causes some kind of change in the oligomeric state and/or state of association of the 87-kDa GTP-binding protein/TGase with other cellular proteins, such that when the GTP-binding protein/TGase dissociates from this larger molecular mass complex, it is able to bind GTP. The RA-induced change that elicits this effect could either be due to a change in the post-translational modification of the 87-kDa GTP-binding protein/TGase or of another protein that binds to the 87-kDa GTP-binding protein/TGase within the larger molecular mass complex. Such a change could be caused by an increased expression of a protein kinase or an enzyme responsible for fatty acid modification. This would be consistent with our findings that inhibitors of protein synthesis block the ability of RA to stimulate the GTP-binding activity of the 87-kDa GTP-binding protein/TGase 2U. S. Singh, unpublished data. and that 1-3 days are necessary for the RA-induced effects reported here. Both protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation (35Chakravarty R. Rong X. Rice R.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and palmitoylation (and myristoylation) (36Chakravarty R. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 625-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of keratinocyte TGase have been reported. However, the RA-induced changes shown here do not appear to be simply due to alterations in the total protein levels of the GTP-binding protein/TGase because such a change is not indicated by Western blot analysis nor would it easily account for the changes in the behavior of the protein during gel filtration chromatography or for the increased ability of the TGb fractions to bind more effectively to membranes (see below).An important mechanistic question that is raised by these findings concerns the relationship between the RA-stimulated GTP-binding activity of the GTP-binding protein/transglutaminases and the accompanying increases in GTP hydrolytic activity and transglutaminase activity. It seems most likely that the apparent increase in GTP hydrolytic activity is a consequence of the stimulated GTP-binding, rather than due to a direct effect on GTPase activity. That is, in the presence of RA, more of the 87-kDa protein is able to bind GTP and so more total GTP hydrolysis is measured. This would be exactly analogous to the situation for heterotrimeric G proteins, where it has been well documented in reconstitution studies that hormone receptors that activate a particular G protein by stimulating the exchange of tightly bound GDP for GTP also give rise to an apparent stimulation of GTP hydrolytic activity (37Cerione R.A. Codina-Salada J. Benovic J.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Birnbaumer L. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between RA-stimulated GTP-binding activity and RA-stimulated TGase activity reported here and observed by other investigators (15Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) is more difficult to understand, in light of previous studies (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) that indicated that GTP binding significantly inhibited TGase activity. Taken together, these different findings point to a more complicated mechanism for the regulation of TGase activity in cells. GTP binding may induce a conformational change in the GTP-binding protein/TGase that enables it to undergo a GTP hydrolytic event and releases some kind of inhibitory constraint on TGase activity perhaps through the actions of a cellular regulatory factor (also, see below).Another important outcome of RA treatment of HeLa cells is the appearance of the 87-kDa GTP-binding protein/TGase in membrane fractions. Although we have not been able to definitively determine that the membrane-associated pool of the 87-kDa protein represents a translocation from the cytosol, we have found that the cytosolic 87-kDa protein from RA-treated cells, which elutes as an apparent dimer from gel filtration columns (i.e. the TGb species), shows a markedly enhanced capability to associate with membranes (relative to the 87-kDa protein from control, non-RA-treated cells). Thus, perhaps the simplest interpretation is that whatever (RA-stimulated) change in the 87-kDa protein that enables it to dissociate from a larger molecular mass complex and to bind GTP more effectively, also enables it to bind to membranes. This may simply reflect the dissociation of the 87-kDa protein from other proteins that tend to maintain it in the cytosol.We also have found that under conditions where the 87-kDa protein is able to associate with membranes, there is a stimulation of phospholipase C activity as measured by the production of [3H]inositol trisphosphate. Previously, it had been reported that a GTP-binding protein with sequence similarity to TGase2 was able to mediate hormonal stimulation of phospholipase C activity in rat liver plasma membranes (18Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Thus, we would suggest that the RA-promoted increase in the membrane association of the 87-kDa protein provides this GTP-binding protein with proximity to one of its target/effector molecules, e.g. a member of the phospholipase C family. The identity of the specific isoform of this family of enzymes which is responsible for mediating the RA-stimulated phosphoinositide lipid turnover reported here has not yet been determined. However, recent studies suggest that the GTP-binding protein/transglutaminase originally designated Gh is capable of specifically stimulating phospholipase Cδ1 (26Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).An intriguing possibility is that the ability of RA to stimulate the association of a GTP-binding protein/TGase with phospholipase C molecules provides a mechanism for increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels, which is necessary for TGase activity. It has often been suggested that RA-stimulated TGase activity, which gives rise to protein cross-linking events that can impact on a number of pathways as well as overall membrane structure (1Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), is responsible for RA-promoted differentiation and/or apoptosis (23Chiocca E.A. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bertram J.S. Cancer Surv. 1983; 2: 243-262Google Scholar, 27Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

However, among a number of important future questions are whether the biochemical changes in the GTP-binding protein/TGase stimulated by RA are entirely directed toward changes in phosphoinositide lipid turnover, and, if so, what consequences does this have in the nucleus with regard to the 80-kDa GTP-binding protein/TGase that appears to be present in the nuclear envelope and pore/lamina fractions (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the presence of phospholipase C enzymes and phosphoinositide lipid turnover has been reported in the nucleus (38Divecha N. Rhee S.G. Lechter A.J. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), thus far, we have not found any significant stimulation of this nuclear activity by RA. 3U. S. Singh, unpublished data. This then raises the possibility that there may be other important target/effector molecules for GTP-binding protein/TGases (i.e. in addition to phospholipase C enzymes) that may play a role in mediating the various biological responses associated with RA treatment of cells. Related to these issues is the question of the identities of the regulatory proteins that mediate the effects of RA on the different activities of GTP-binding protein/TGases and whether it will be possible to purify one or more of these regulators from the higher molecular mass complexes eluted from gel filtration columns.

However, the RA-induced stimulation of TGase2 activity in HeLa cells appeared to occur independently of any change in the levels of TGase2 mRNA (30Piacentini M. Fesus L. Farrace M.G. Ghibelli L. Piredda L. Melino G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the RA-induced stimulation of enzyme activity represented a direct effect on the TGase2 protein, rather than simply an increase in TGase2 expression. Nonetheless, it was proposed that the stimulation of TGase2 activity and the ensuing cross-linking of cellular proteins was directly related to the apoptotic activity of RA.Our laboratory has for some time been interested in the mechanisms by which GTP-binding proteins are regulated. The tissue TGases represent a potentially new class of GTP-binding proteins where high affinity GTP-binding and GTPase activity is coupled to a possible effector (TGase) activity within the same molecule. The reported effects of RA on cellular TGase activity suggested that this differentiation/apoptotic agent might exert regulatory effects on the biochemical and GTP-binding activities of TGase2 enzymes.

Detergent extracts of Lec4 cells have no detectable GlcNAc-TV activity, but Lec4A extracts have activity equivalent to that of parental Chinese hamster ovary cells. This discrepancy occurs because Lec4A GlcNAc-TV activity co-localizes with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) instead of with Golgi membranes (Chaney, W., Sundaram, S., Friedman, N., and Stanley, P. (1989) J. Cell. Biol. 109, 2089-2096). cDNAs from the coding region of the GlcNAc-TV gene have now been isolated from each mutant line. Lec4 GlcNAc-TV cDNA was found to possess two insertions, the first of which shifts the open reading frame and codes for a truncated transferase missing 585 amino acids from the catalytic domain. By contrast, Lec4A GlcNAc-TV cDNA possesses a single point mutation from T to G, which results in a change from Leu to Arg at position 188. When transfected into Lec4 cells, both cDNAs gave the appropriate phenotype; Lec4 cDNA was unable to restore GlcNAc-TV activity, whereas Lec4A cDNA converted Lec4 cells to the Lec4A phenotype, with an active GlcNAc-TV mislocalized to ER membranes. Moreover, Lec4A cDNA cured of its mutation restored a functional, Golgi-localized GlcNAc-TV to Lec4 cells. The results demonstrate that a single change in the 740 amino acids of GlcNAc-TV serves to functionally inactivate the transferase in an intact cell by causing it to localize to the ER instead of the Golgi compartment. The mislocalized transferase retains full enzyme activity, showing that it is well folded and stable and suggesting that the L188R mutation either prevents association with exit complexes from the ER or causes retrograde transport from a Golgi compartment.

https://openalex.org/W2085866388,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the in vitro folding pathway of Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase has both monomer and dimer intermediates that are stable for periods of minutes to hours at 4°C (Cai K., Schirch, D., and Schirch, V. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19294-19299). Single Trp mutant enzymes were constructed and used in combination with other methods to show that on the folding pathway of this enzyme two domains rapidly fold to form a monomer in which the amino-terminal 55 amino acid residues and a segment around the active site region of Lys229 remain in a largely disordered form. This partially folded enzyme can form dimers and slowly undergoes a rate-determining conformational change in which the unstructured segments assume their native state (Cai, K., and Schirch, V. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2987-2994). To further assess the kinetics and structural details of the intermediates during folding, fluorescence energy transfer and fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made of the three Trp residues and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, attached covalently to the active site by reduction to a secondary amine by sodium cyanoborohydride. These studies confirmed that the basic kinetic folding pathway remained the same in the reduced enzyme as compared to the earlier studies with the apoenzyme. Both equilibrium and kinetic intermediates were identified and their structural characteristics determined. The results show that the active site Lys229-bound pyridoxyl 5′-phosphate remains more than 50 angstroms from any Trp residues until the final rate-determining conformational change when it approaches each Trp residue at the same rate. The environment of each Trp residue and the pyridoxyl phosphate in both an equilibrium folding intermediate and a kinetic folding intermediate are described."
https://openalex.org/W1967534234,"To obtain data of the bradykinin B2 receptor's agonist binding site, we used a combined approach of affinity labeling and immunoidentification of receptor fragments generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage. Domain-specific antibodies to the various extracellular receptor domains were applied to detect receptor fragments with covalently attached [125I-Tyr8]bradykinin. As a cross-linker we used the homobifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl tartarate (DST), which reacts preferentially with primary amines. With this technique a [125I-Tyr8]bradykinin-labeled receptor fragment derived from the third extracellular domain was identified. The epsilon-amino group of lysine (Lys172) of the human B2 receptor provides the only primary amino group within this receptor fragment. This strongly suggests that DST attached the N-terminal amino group of [Tyr8]bradykinin to Lys172 of the human B2 receptor. Next we asked whether DST attaches [Tyr8]bradykinin to the analogous residue, Lys174 of the rat B2 receptor, which is 81% identical to the human B2 receptor, and we attempted to label the wild-type rat B2 receptor and a rat B2 receptor mutant where Lys174 had been exchanged for alanine. Affinity labeling of the wild-type rat B2 receptor worked efficiently, whereas DST did not attach detectable amounts of [125I-Tyr8]bradykinin to the K174A rat B2 receptor mutant. Taken together these observations indicate that the N-terminal amino group of [Tyr8]bradykinin is bound to analogous positions of the rat and of the human B2 receptor, i.e. [Tyr8]bradykinin's N terminus is bound adjacent to Lys172 of the human and Lys174 of the rat B2 receptor."

With IL-3 and Epo costimulation, IL-3-induced signaling appears to be dominant since no increase in β-globin mRNA occurs.

Arguing against the former, a truncated EpoR lacking an intracellular domain was incapable of promoting proliferation or differentiation.

Interestingly, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocks both Epo-induced proliferation and β-globin mRNA accumulation in this model system. In contrast, inhibition of protein kinase C by Compound 3 suppresses only Epo-induced differentiation without affecting proliferation (16Krosl J. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 50-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that protein phosphorylation events play a critical role in Epo-induced differentiation and that the proliferative and differentiating functions of the EpoR can be uncoupled. Interestingly, both the extra- and intracellular domains of the EpoR have been implicated in Epo-induced differentiation. Maruyama et al. (20Maruyama K. Miyata K. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5680-5976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for example, showed that a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the intracellular domain of the EpoR could induce hemoglobin synthesis in TSA-8 cells, consistent with a role for the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR in differentiating signaling. In apparent contradiction to this, chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of the EpoR and the transmembrane and intracellular domain of the interleukin-3 receptor β subunit (EpoR/IL-3Rβ) were also found to be capable of increasing β-globin mRNA levels in Ba/F3 cells (18Carroll M.

This latter result was particularly surprising in view of the observation that IL-3 inhibited the Epo-induced accumulation of β-globin mRNA in Ba/F3 cells expressing EpoRs. To examine in more detail the regions within the EpoR that might be responsible for eliciting differentiation-specific signals, we have monitored the effects of various mutant and chimeric EpoRs on the induction of β-globin mRNA accumulation in Ba/F3 cells. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic domains of the EpoR and the IL-3Rβ subunit are equivalent in mediating β-globin mRNA induction. Our results further suggest that the IL-3Rα subunit is responsible for the IL-3-induced suppression of β-globin mRNA accumulation and that, at least in this model system, late stage erythroid differentiation is contingent upon both EpoR-mediated signaling and the absence of IL-3R-mediated signaling. The mutant and chimeric EpoRs used in this study are depicted in Fig. 1. The null EpoR mutant in which all cytoplasmic tyrosines were replaced with phenylalanines was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis as described by Damen et al. (10Damen J.E. Wakao H.

The EpoR/IL-3RβIL-3 and EpoR/IL-3Rα chimeras and the C-terminal truncated EpoR(−230) contain the EpoR cDNA-derived extracellular domain encoded by a KpnI-NheI fragment of pXM EpoR (provided by A. D'Andrea, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The EpoR/IL-3RβIL-3 encompassing the extracellular domain of the EpoR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the IL-3RβIL-3 subunit was constructed by ligating a KpnI-NheI fragment of the EpoR to a fragment spanning the transmembrane region of the IL-3RβIL-3 subunit, generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification, and an NdeI-NotI fragment of pAIC2-26 (provided by A. Miyajima, DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA), encoding the intracellular domain of the IL-3RβIL-3 subunit. To generate the hybrid EpoR/IL-3Rα gene, a 255-bp fragment encoding the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the IL-3Rα subunit was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pSUT-1 (provided by A. Miyajima, DNAX Research Institute) as a template and ligated to the KpnI-NheI fragment of the EpoR cDNA. The C-terminal truncated EpoR(−230) encompassing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EpoR was constructed using a cDNA-derived extracellular domain and a polymerase chain reaction-amplified transmembrane region. To generate the JZenEpoR/IL-3RβIL-3 retroviral vector, a 2279-bp KpnI-NotI fragment encompassing the coding region of the chimeric receptor was isolated from pBS-EpoR/IL-3RβIL-3 and inserted by blunt end ligation into the XhoI site of JZen TKneo upstream of the neor gene. Expression of the hybrid gene was thus under control of the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. To create MSCV-EpoR/IL-3Rα, a 1010-bp KpnI-NotI fragment encompassing the hybrid EpoR/IL-3Rα gene was isolated from the pBS-EpoR/IL-3Rα and inserted by blunt end ligation into the HpaI site of the MSCV PGKpac vector upstream of the PGKr cassette. A MSCV-EpoR(−230) PGK retroviral vector was generated by subcloning a blunted 843-bp KpnI-BamHI fragment of pBS-EpoR(−230), encoding the truncated EpoR, into the HpaI site of the MSCV PGKneo vector upstream of the PGKr cassette. The JZen null EpoR TKneo vector was constructed as reported previously (10Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G.

Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. A. Banks (Columbia University, New York) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4500 mg/liter glucose and 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum, supplemented with 15 µg/ml hypoxanthine, 250 µg/ml xanthine, and 25 µg/ml mycophenolic acid (HXM selective medium). GP+E-86 subclones transfected with recombinant retroviral vectors were selected and maintained in HXM medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Canadian Life Technologies, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) or 2 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma), as appropriate for selection of the virus-encoded selectable marker. The IL-3-dependent murine cell line, Ba/F3, was kindly provided by Dr. A. Miyajima (DNAX Research Insitute) and was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 3 nmol/liter COS cell-derived murine IL-3. The retrovirally infected cells were maintained in the same medium, supplemented with 1.8 mg/ml G418 and/or 2 µg/ml puromycin. All media were obtained from StemCell Technologies Inc. (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The generation of GP+E-86 clones producing recombinant retrovirus and the infection of IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells were as described previously (10Damen J.E.

Blood. 1995; 85: 50-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clones expressing various chimeric and mutant EpoRs were selected by plating the infected cells in standard methylcellulose (StemCell Technologies Inc.) supplemented with IL-3 and 1.8 mg/ml G418 or 2 µg/ml puromycin. Selection of clones coexpressing WT EpoR or EpoR/IL-3RβIL-3 with the EpoR/IL-3Rα chimera was carried out in the presence of 1.8 mg/ml G418 and 2 µg/ml puromycin. Cells were grown for 2-4 days in the absence of G418, washed, and then deprived of IL-3 and fetal calf serum for 6 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Cells were then washed, resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA, and aliquoted into 96-well U-shaped microtiter plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well, and growth factors were added to a final volume of 0.1 ml/well. Following 22 h of incubation at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, cells were pulsed with 1 µCi of [3H]thymidine (3H-Tdr, 2 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) for 2 h. The cells were then harvested onto filter mats using an LKB 1295-001 Skatron cell harvester, and 3H-Tdr incorporation was determined in an LKB 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter (LKB Wallac, Turku, Finland). Ba/F3 cells expressing chimeric or mutant EpoRs were incubated for 4 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Cells were then washed with RPMI 1640 and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA, or in the same medium supplemented with Epo (0.05 or 0.5 unit/ml) or 3 nmol/liter COS cell-derived IL-3, or a combination of 0.5 unit/ml Epo and 3 nmol/liter IL-3. After 18-20 h of incubation at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, cells were lysed in RNAzol (Canadian Life Technologies), and the total cellular RNA was isolated as recommended by the manufacturer. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Krosl J. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 50-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probes used for hybridization were a 295-bp Sau3AI-AccI fragment encompassing the first exon and intron of the murine β-major globin gene (provided by Dr. P. Lebouche, MIT, Boston, MA) and either a 1.3-kilobase pair PstI fragment of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (provided by P. Jeanteur, Centre Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France) or a 1.6-kilobase pair PstI fragment of chicken β-actin cDNA used to test for loading equivalence. To examine the regions within the EpoR that might be inducing β-globin mRNA, we engineered retroviral vectors carrying coding regions for various mutant and chimeric EpoRs that could be compared with the WT EpoR. The forms of the various receptors studied are illustrated in Fig. 1. These included a full-length EpoR in which all eight intracellular tyrosines were exchanged for phenylalanines (null EpoR) (10Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L.

Following retrovrial infection, IL-3-responsive Ba/F3 cells expressing the various EpoR forms were then selected for assessment of Epo-stimulated proliferation and differentiation. To determine the importance of EpoR tyrosine phosphorylation to Epo-induced β-globin gene expression, we tested the mutant EpoR in which all eight cytoplasmic tyrosines were substituted with phenylalanines (null EpoR). Several independent Ba/F3 clones were obtained following retroviral mediated gene transfer and assessed for expression of cell surface null EpoRs by both flow cytometry using biotin-labeled Epo and by Scatchard analysis using 125I-labeled Epo. Following selection of clones expressing similar numbers of cell surface WT or null EpoRs (approximately 3000/cell, as determined by Scatchard analysis), the Epo-induced proliferation and induction of β-globin message were compared. Null EpoR-expressing Ba/F3 cells proliferated in response to Epo as determined by 3H-Tdr incorporation assays but required approximately 5-fold higher concentrations of Epo to achieve levels of 3H-Tdr incorporation comparable with those obtained with WT EpoR-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). The null and WT EpoR-expressing cells accumulated comparable levels of β-globin mRNA upon stimulation with Epo, and for both, no induction of β-globin mRNA could be detected in response to IL-3 or to IL-3 plus Epo (Fig. 2B, representative Northern blot analysis). Interestingly, this Epo-induced differentiating response could be detected in both cell types at concentrations of Epo that stimulated proliferation of WT EpoR cells but were markedly less effective in promoting proliferation of null EpoR cells, consistent with recently published observations that Epo-induced differentiation of Ba/F3 cells can occur in the absence of proliferation (16Krosl J. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 50-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Carroll M. Zhu Y. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our results further suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the EpoR itself is not required for induction of β-globin mRNA. IL-3 was previously reported to inhibit the Epo-induced increase in β-globin mRNA seen in Ba/F3 cells engineered to express the normal, wild-type EpoR (16Krosl J. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 50-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Carroll M. Zhu Y. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To identify domains within the EpoR and/or the IL-3R that might be involved in regulating β-globin mRNA induction in this model system, we first examined a chimeric receptor (EpoR/IL-3Rβ), consisting of the extracellular domain of the EpoR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the major signal transducing component of the IL-3R complex, the IL-3RβIL-3 subunit. Ba/F3 cells engineered to express this chimeric receptor proliferated as well as cells expressing similar numbers of WT EpoRs (3000/cell as determined by Scatchard analysis) in response to Epo (Fig. 3A); moreover, the β-globin message was induced in these cells in response to Epo (Fig. 3B) but not in response to IL-3 or IL-3 plus Epo, consistent with results obtained by other groups (18Carroll M. Mathey-Prevot B. D'Andrea A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Chiba T. Nagata Y. Kishi A. Sakamaki K. Miyajima A. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Todokoro K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11593-11597Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One possibility suggested by these observations is that a second as yet unidentified subunit associates with the extracellular domain of the EpoR and provides the differentiating signal. Another intriguing possibility is that the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-3β subunit on its own is permissive for differentiation, but signaling through the intact IL-3R suppresses differentiation, thus pointing to a specific inhibitory role for the α subunit of the IL-3R. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we tested a C-terminal truncated EpoR (EpoR(−230)) possessing only 2 amino acids within the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). The differentiating and proliferative capacity of this truncated EpoR was examined in several independent EpoR(−230)-transduced Ba/F3 clones, expressing between 8000 and 12,000 cell surface EpoRs (determined by flow cytometry and Scatchard analyses, data not shown). Viability of these cells decreased in Epo-supplemented medium within 24 h to approximately 25-30%, and no viable cells could be detected by 48 h (Fig. 4A). Moreover, no accumulation of β-globin mRNA by the EpoR(−230)-transduced cells could be detected in response to Epo or Epo plus IL-3 (Fig. 4B). This indicates that an EpoR lacking the intracellular domain is not capable of promoting the survival and differentiation of Ba/F3 cells in response to Epo and argues against differentiating signaling being activated through molecules associated with the extracellular domain of the EpoR, at least not in the absence of a functional cytoplasmic domain. To test the hypothesis that the IL-3Rα subunit can suppress Epo-induced differentiation, we examined the differentiating and proliferative capacities of a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domain of the EpoR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the IL-3Rα subunit (EpoR/IL-3Rα). Ba/F3 cells expressing this EpoR/IL-3Rα chimera proliferated in Epo-supplemented medium but required approximately 5-fold higher concentrations of Epo to achieve 3H-Tdr incorporation levels comparable with those obtained by WT EpoR-expressing cells (Fig. 5A). β-Globin mRNA levels were then examined in several independent EpoR/IL-3Rα clones, and no accumulation of β-globin mRNA could be detected in a variety of experimental conditions, including different concentrations of Epo (Fig. 5B) and different times of exposure to Epo (data not shown), suggesting that this EpoR/IL-3Rα chimeric receptor was not capable of promoting differentiation. To test whether the absence of the Epo-induced accumulation of β-globin mRNA by EpoR/IL-3Rα cells reflected an inability of this chimeric receptor to induce β-globin gene expression or an ability to actively suppress expression of the β-globin gene, two additional types of Ba/F3 clones were created. First, EpoR/IL-3Rβ cells, shown to accumulate high levels of β-globin mRNA in response to Epo (Fig. 3B, clone 4), were engineered to coexpress the EpoR/IL-3Rα chimera, and several clones expressing 2-5-fold higher levels of cell surface EpoRs than the parental EpoR/IL-3Rβ cells were identified by Scatchard analysis. Ba/F3 clones coexpressing EpoR/IL-3Rβ and EpoR/IL-3Rα proliferated in response to Epo (Fig. 6A) but failed to accumulate β-globin mRNA upon Epo stimulation (Fig. 6C). Regeneration of the IL-3R signaling complex thus prevented Epo-induced differentiation despite the capacity of the IL-3Rβ subunit alone to transduce a differentiating signal. Lastly, the capacity of the IL-3Rα subunit to inhibit β-globin gene expression was examined in WT EpoR cells engineered to coexpress the EpoR/IL-3Rα chimera. Several clones expressing 2-4-fold higher numbers of cell surface EpoRs (than the parental WT EpoR cells) were identified by Scatchard analysis (i.e. 3300 WT EpoRs/cell plus 7000-12,000 EpoR/IL-3Rα/cell). These cells required 5-30-fold higher concentrations of Epo to achieve proliferation levels comparable with those obtained by the parental WT EpoR cells (Fig. 6B). More importantly, cells coexpressing WT EpoR and EpoR/IL-3Rα ceased to accumulate β-globin mRNA in response to Epo (Fig. 6C) suggesting that the IL-3Rα subunit inhibited the differentiating function of the EpoR. In this study, we expressed various mutant and chimeric EpoRs in the IL-3-responsive cell line, Ba/F3, to examine the functional roles of the EpoR and IL-3R in regulating β-globin gene induction in Ba/F3 cells. Surprisingly, EpoRs totally lacking in potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (null EpoR) were found to be capable of inducing β-globin mRNA as well as the normal EpoR. This finding is compatible with our previously published results showing that Epo-induced differentiation was blocked by genestein (16Krosl J. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 50-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), since null EpoRs mediate tyrosine phosphorylation (and activation of Jak2) as well as WT EpoRs (10Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, but not the EpoR, is critical for Epo-induced differentiation. Null EpoRs, however, were severely compromised in their ability to promote proliferation of Ba/F3 cells, consistent with our previous results (10Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the reduced ability of the null EpoR to promote proliferation of Ba/F3 cells could create conditions permissive for differentiation. In this regard, Ba/F3 cells, although originally described as a pro-B cell line (23Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), express eythroid-specific transcription factors such as GATA-1 and NF-E2 (17Liboi E. Carroll M. D'Andrea A.D. Mathey-Prevot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11351-11355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and very low levels of endogenous EpoRs (7Damen J. Mui A.L. Hughes P. Humphries K. Krystal G. Blood. 1992; 80: 1923-1932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may thus have evolved in culture toward an erythroid phenotype or have always been erythroid in nature. The Epo-induced delay in progression through G1 of the cell cycle, shown previously for the WT (16Krosl J. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 50-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Carroll M. Zhu Y. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and currently for the null EpoR-expressing cells (data not shown), may simply be triggering a predetermined erythroid differentiating program, as seems to be the case for MEL cells engineered to express p53 (24Johnson P. Chung S. Benchimol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, a simple delay in G1 of parental Ba/F3 cells does not induce β-globin mRNA (16Krosl J. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 50-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that induction of this gene depends on EpoR-mediated signaling. The Epo-induced accumulation of β-globin mRNA in cells expressing the EpoR/IL-3Rβ chimera is consistent with the previously published findings of Carroll et al. (18Carroll M. Mathey-Prevot B. D'Andrea A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and Chiba et al. (21Chiba T. Nagata Y. Kishi A. Sakamaki K. Miyajima A. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Todokoro K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11593-11597Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This observation pointed to the possibility that Epo-specific signaling might depend on the interactions of the extracellular domain of the EpoR (25D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Wong G.G. Cell. 1989; 57: 277-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) with a second as yet unidentified subunit of the EpoR complex. However, cells expressing high levels of a truncated EpoR(−230) lacking the cytoplasmic domain neither survived nor accumulated β-globin mRNA upon Epo stimulation, suggesting that the cytoplasmic region of the EpoR is indispensable for EpoR function. The differentiating capacity of the EpoR/IL-3Rβ chimera, however, also suggested that the cytoplasmic domains of the EpoR and the βIL-3 subunit of the IL-3R were interchangeable in providing for the differentiating signal, which argues against the existence of a differentiation-specific domain within the cytoplasmic region of the EpoR and points to a permissive rather than an instructive role for the EpoR in Epo-induced differentiation. Our finding that the EpoR/IL-3Rα chimera was capable of supporting proliferation of Ba/F3 cells was somewhat surprising since Kitamura and Miyajima (26Kitamura T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1992; 80: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the human IL-3Rα subunit alone was unable to support proliferation of IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells. These cells proliferated in response to human IL-3 only when engineered to coexpress human IL-3Rα and murine IL-3Rβc suggesting that IL-3-induced mitogenic signaling depends on interactions between α and β subunits of the IL-3R complex likely mediated by their extracellular domains (27Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seems unlikely that a similar association occurs between the extracellular domains of IL-3Rβ and EpoR. Our results are consistent with a steadily growing body of data suggesting that the membrane proximal region conserved among α subunits of receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor is essential for mitogenic signaling (28Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 29Weiss M. Yokoyama C. Shikama Y. Naugle C. Druker B. Sieff C.A.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Takaki S. Kanazawa H. Shiiba M. Takatsu K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7404-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the Epo-induced dimerization of EpoR/IL-3Rα chimeras results in activation of a mitogenic signal through the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-3Rα subunit that is not compatible with differentiation. Several possible mechanisms could account for the observed inhibitory effect of the EpoR/IL-3Rα on the partial Epo-induced differentiation of Ba/F3 cells. First, EpoR/IL-3Rα chimeras could be forming unproductive heterodimers with EpoR/IL-3RβIL-3 or WT EpoRs. This mechanism seems unlikely since EpoR/IL-3Rα also inhibited the Epo-induced accumulation of β-globin mRNA in a clone expressing 3300 WT EpoRs and 7000 EpoR/IL-3Rα. Random dimerization of cell surface EpoRs in this clone would be expected to yield 9% or approximately 1000 WT EpoR dimers/cell. Second, EpoR/IL-3Rα chimeras, when overexpressed, could shorten the duration of the G1 phase of cell cycle required for induction of β-globin mRNA. This was, however, not the case since exposure to Epo of all EpoR/IL-3Rα-expressing Ba/F3 clones led to a marked delay in G1 to S progression (data not shown). Thus, a delay in G1 is not sufficient for β-globin mRNA induction. Third, the Epo-induced di- or oligomerization of EpoR/IL-3Rα chimeras could activate IL-3-specific pathways involved in inhibition of β-globin gene expression. Our results favor this last possibility and are consistent with the concept that the α subunits of the IL-3 (27Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IL-5 (32Takaki S. Kanazawa H. Shiiba M. Takatsu K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7404-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (33Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) receptors initiate distinct ligand-induced events. The data presented in this study suggest both a permissive role for Epo in inducing β-globin mRNA in Ba/F3 cells expressing EpoRs and an active role for the IL-3Rα subunit in the IL-3-induced inhibition of Epo-induced differentiation. Based on these findings, ongoing studies are aimed at identifying effectors that are, through interaction with the IL-3Rα subunit, involved in suppression of β-globin gene expression in Ba/F3 cells.

It has been shown that the endocytic sorting signal for newly synthesized αβ·Ii complexes resides in the Ii cytoplasmic tail (3Bakke O. Dobberstein B.

Recently, specialized sites for peptide loading have been described in both human and murine B cells. In human B cells, these specialized sites have been termed MIIC or MIIC-related compartments (11Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). MIIC appear as dense multimembrane vesicles (0.2-0.5-µm diameter) containing lysosomal markers such as Lamp1, CD63, and β-hexosaminidase, suggesting that they correspond to late endocytic compartments. In murine B cells, several different compartments for peptide loading have been described. Some of them are similar to MIIC-related compartments containing late endosomal-lysosomal markers (13Qiu Y. Xu X. Wandinger-Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Rudensky A.Y. Maric M. Eastman S. Shoemaker L. DeRoos P.C. Blum J.S. Immunity. 1994; 1: 585-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Other have been identified as low density membrane vesicles (CIIV) positive for the transferrin receptor, a well known marker for both early and recycling endosomes, and negative for lysosomal markers (15Amigorena S. Drake J.R. Webster P. Mellman I. Nature. 1994; 369: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that antigen processing and loading on MHC class II molecules might involve several compartments along the endocytic pathway characterized by their low to dense densities (16Castellino F. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 73-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We previously showed that, in the presence of hen egg lysozyme (HEL), newly synthesized SDS-stable class II molecules are first detected in a dense compartment called the lysozyme-loading compartment (LLC) (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). LLC does not have the characteristics of early endosomes (EE), late endosomes (LE), and lysosomes. Indeed, it is negative for the Rab4, Rab5, and Rab7 GTPases and does not contain detectable amounts of lysosomal markers. In this paper, we show that LLC is connected to the recycling pathway. Bidimensional gel mapping reveals that its protein composition is similar to that of EE, but different from that of LE. At the ultrastructural level, LLC membrane fraction corresponds to a homogeneous population of 0.5-µm diameter multimembrane vesicles containing both IAk molecules and the transferrin receptor. LLC is accessible to transferrin and the horseradish peroxidase fluid-phase marker after 15 min of internalization. In the presence of concanamycin B, an inhibitor of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, the formation of SDS-stable dimers in LLC and the transport of class II molecules out of LLC are impaired. In addition, the transport of class II molecules from LLC is independent of the microtubule network. Altogether, these data suggest that LLC is a specialized compartment of the recycling pathway involved both in the loading of lysozyme and in the routing of the lysozyme-MHC class II complexes to the cell surface. 2A4 B lymphoma cells expressing Ia molecules of the H-2k haplotype have been described earlier (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). 2A4 B cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM Hepes (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mM nonessential amino acids (NEM, Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 mM penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Pierres (Centre d'Immunologie, Marseille, France), respectively. Concanamycin B was obtained from Dr. P. Benaroch (Paris, France). HEL, nocodazole, and horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma. [35S]Methionine/[35S]cysteine mixture and [35S]cysteine were obtained from DuPont NEN. Subcellular fractionation of 2A4 B lymphoma cells has been previously detailed (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells that had been precultured for 2 h with 2 mg/ml HEL were gently homogenized, and post-nuclear supernatants were prepared. Post-nuclear supernatants were adjusted to 40.6% sucrose; loaded at the bottom of an SW 60 centrifugation tube; and then sequentially overlaid with 1.5 ml of 35% sucrose, 1 ml of 30% sucrose, and finally 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, and 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). Gradients were centrifuged for 60 min at 35,000 rpm at 4°C. Early and late endosome-enriched fractions were collected at the 35/30% sucrose interface and at the uppermost region of the 30% sucrose cushion, respectively. LLC was separated from early endosomes by loading the early endosome-enriched fractions recovered from the flotation gradient onto a 27% Percoll gradient (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). LLC fractions correspond to Percoll gradient fractions 9-11, whereas Rab5-positive EE and Rab7-positive LE correspond to fractions 3-7. 2A4 cells were incubated in prewarmed cysteine/methionine-deficient RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, cells were pelleted at room temperature and resuspended in 3 ml of the cysteine/methionine-deficient medium containing 0.5 mCi of an 80% [35S]methionine and 20% [35S]cysteine mixture and 0.5 mCi of [35S]cysteine in the presence of HEL for 18 h at 37°C. EE, LE, and LLC were prepared as described above, adjusted to 40.6% sucrose, and submitted to a second flotation step gradient to remove the excess of Percoll. After centrifugation, LLC and EE were collected at the 35/30% sucrose interface, whereas LE were harvested from the 30% sucrose/homogenization buffer interface. Membrane fractions were incubated with 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4°C and centrifuged in a TLA-100.3 rotor at 70,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) at 4°C. Supernatant proteins were submitted to trichloroacetic acid precipitation (10% final concentration) for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, pellets were washed three times with acetone and resuspended in 9.8 M urea, 4% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 2% (v/v) Ampholine, pH 7-9, and 100 mM dithiothreitol. A combination of isoelectric focusing and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to resolve proteins in two dimensions. Tube gels used for the isoelectric focusing gels were 25 cm long and 2.5 mm in internal diameter. Isoelectric focusing gels were run at 1200 V for 17 h. The pH gradient was linear between pH 4.5 and 7.4. The second dimension resolving gels were 10% (w/v) acrylamide and were prepared for autoradiography using Intensify (DuPont NEN). LLC were prepared after flotation and Percoll step gradients. LLC fractions were pooled and submitted to a second flotation gradient to eliminate the Percoll. After centrifugation, LLC membrane pellets were treated for electron microscopic observation. For class II molecule and transferrin receptor labeling, LLC fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde were resuspended in 10% gelatin before infusion with a mixture of 1.8 M sucrose and 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone (18Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For single labeling experiments, thawed ultrathin cryosections were labeled using either the mouse monoclonal anti-class II molecule antibody followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and protein A-coated colloidal gold or the rat monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibody followed by rabbit anti-rat IgG (Cappel) and protein A-coated colloidal gold (19Griffiths G. Simons K. Warren G. Tokuyasu K.T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 466-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Double labeling was performed using the anti-transferrin receptor antibody followed by rabbit anti-rat IgG and 15-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs (GAR15) (BioCell). Then, sections were incubated with the anti-class II molecule antibody followed by 20-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs (GAM20) (BioCell). For Epon-embedded sections, LLC were fixed using 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer. After centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4°C in an Airfuge (Beckman Instruments), post-fixation of membrane pellets was performed using 2% OsO4 and 1.5% potassium ferricyanide in H2O for 30 min, followed by an overnight incubation with 1.5% uranyl acetate in water (20Parton R.G. Prydz K. Bomsel M. Simons K. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3259-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The LLC membrane pellets were dehydrated in an ethanol series before embedding and polymerization. Epon sections were stained using lead citrate. 2A4 cells were incubated for 5 min at 37°C with 1.5 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase. Then, horseradish peroxidase was chased for 10, 25, and 40 min at 37°C (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). LE, EE, and LLC were prepared, and external media were collected and assayed for horseradish peroxidase enzymatic activity (21Beaufay H. Amar-Corstesec A. Feytmans E. Thins-Sempoux D. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). To study the effect of concanamycin B on horseradish peroxidase internalization and transport, cells were pretreated for 2 h with 1 µM concanamycin B, followed by horseradish peroxidase internalization, and were chased in the presence of 1 µM concanamycin B. After endogenous transferrin depletion, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 12 ml of a 20 µg/ml solution of mouse transferrin-conjugated peroxidase (Pierce). After extensive washings, cells were separated into six different samples corresponding to 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min of internalization performed by incubating the cells at 37°C in culture medium. After each time point, external media were collected, and cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 25 mM acetic acid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 4.5, in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4°C to remove surface-bound transferrin. After homogenization, LE, EE, LLC, and external media were assayed for peroxidase enzymatic activity associated with the mouse transferrin (21Beaufay H. Amar-Corstesec A. Feytmans E. Thins-Sempoux D. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). For nocodazole experiments, 108 cells were metabolically labeled for 20 min at 37°C, and radioactivity was chased for 30, 60, 120, and 240 min. In each sample, nocodazole was added at a 10 µM final concentration only after a 30-min chase to allow the transport of class II molecules along the secretory pathway. After subcellular fractionation, class II molecules were immunoprecipitated from fractions 9-11 of the Percoll gradient. In the presence of concanamycin B, cells were preincubated for 2 h at 37°C with both 1 µM concanamycin B and 2 mg/ml HEL; metabolically labeled for 20 min; and chased at 37°C for 30, 60, and 240 min in the presence of concanamycin B and HEL. After subcellular fractionation, 0.8-ml Percoll gradient fractions were collected, pooled two by two, and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of protease inhibitors, and class II molecules were immunoprecipitated. Samples were treated under nonboiling conditions for the detection of SDS-resistant class II molecules (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized EE, LE, and LLC proteins were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes before incubation with the anti-transferrin receptor antibody H129-121-6.8, detected by an indirect chemiluminescence system as described previously (22Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the relationship among LLC, EE, and LE, we analyzed their respective protein compositions. EE, LE, and LLC were prepared from cells metabolically labeled to equilibrium and analyzed using high resolution two-dimensional gels (23Bravo R. Celis J.E. Bravo R. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis: A Guide for the Beginner. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1984: 3-36Google Scholar, 24Celis J.E. Gesser B. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Honore B. Olsen E. Ratz G. Lauridsen J.B. Basse B. Mouritzen S. Hellerup M. Andersen A. Walbum E. Celis A. Bauw G. Puype M. van Damme J. Vanderckhove J. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 989-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. The polypeptide patterns are shown in Fig. 1. We can detect ∼150 polypeptides in LLC. About 100 are found in the three compartments (EE, LE, and LLC). Among these, actin, heat shock proteins, and tubulins can be identified by their typical mobilities (24Celis J.E. Gesser B. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Honore B. Olsen E. Ratz G. Lauridsen J.B. Basse B. Mouritzen S. Hellerup M. Andersen A. Walbum E. Celis A. Bauw G. Puype M. van Damme J. Vanderckhove J. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 989-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The remaining 50 LLC polypeptides were analyzed in more detail. We do not find polypeptides specifically associated with LLC. Strikingly, all of them can be detected in EE, but not in LE, and can be separated in three groups depending on both their electric mobility and molecular mass. The first group corresponds to basic and low molecular mass proteins (10-15 kDa). Among them, the SNARE-like 14-kDa protein cellubrevin, shown to be enriched in the recycling endosomes (25McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelman L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 26Robinson M.S. Watts C. Zerial M. Cell. 1996; 84: 13-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the p11 protein, known to be associated with annexin II in early endosomes (27Harder T. Gerke V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1119-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), can be identified by their typical electrophoretic mobility. The second group of proteins has an acidic mobility with a molecular mass of 10-30 kDa, whereas the third group corresponds to glycoproteins of high molecular mass (45-90 kDa). LLC membrane fractions were loaded onto a second flotation gradient to eliminate the Percoll (see “Experimental Procedures”), allowing electron microscopic observations. Fig. 2a shows that LLC membrane vesicles are ∼0.5 µm in diameter, with internal membrane structures containing IAk molecules. As LLC protein composition was closely related to that of EE, we also investigated the presence of the transferrin receptor, a well known marker for EE and recycling endosomes (28Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1983; 35: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 30Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunolabeling using the anti-transferrin receptor antibody shows that the transferrin receptor is also present in LLC vesicles (data not shown) and colocalizes with IAk molecules (Fig. 2b). The presence of the transferrin receptor in LLC was confirmed by Western blotting on isolated membrane fractions (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Transferrin receptor present in LLC, EE, and LE membrane fractions. 10 µg of LLC, EE, and LE proteins were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes before incubation with the anti-transferrin receptor antibody, detected by an indirect chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Corp.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the kinetics of horseradish peroxidase transport in EE, LE, and LLC, horseradish peroxidase was internalized for 5 min at 37°C and chased for various periods of time (Fig. 4A). After 5 min of internalization at 37°C, horseradish peroxidase enzymatic activity is first detected in low density EE. No significant horseradish peroxidase activity is detected in either LLC or LE. After a 15-min chase, horseradish peroxidase is clearly shifted from EE toward LLC, showing that LLC is accessible to horseradish peroxidase only after 15 min of internalization. After a 1-h chase, horseradish peroxidase is detected in LE, whereas almost none remains in EE and LLC. The presence of the transferrin receptor in LLC prompted us to investigate the transferrin accessibility to LLC, EE, and LE. Fig. 4 (C and D) shows clearly that ∼20% of internalized transferrin transits through LLC between 10 and 15 min. At 30 min, transferrin is no longer detectable in LLC, whereas small amounts start to appear in LE. These results favor the hypothesis defining LLC as a recycling compartment. The proton pump vacuolar ATPase, known to generate the acidic luminal environment of endosomes, lysosomes (31Banta L.M. Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is directly inhibited by low concentrations of concanamycin B or bafilomycin A1 (36Bowman E.J. Altendorf K. Siebers A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 37Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Upon concanamycin B treatment, it has been shown that the formation of endosomal carrier vesicles ensuring the transport between early and late endosomes in baby hamster kidney cells is impaired (40Clague M.J. Urbé S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line, bafilomycin A1 did not prevent the transport of horseradish peroxidase to LE, but almost totally inhibited the transport from LE to lysosomes (39van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We first investigated the effects of concanamycin B on horseradish peroxidase endocytosis (Fig. 4B). Concanamycin B causes a 25% decrease in the amount of horseradish peroxidase internalized in EE after 5 min at 37°C (data not shown), probably by reducing the rate of horseradish peroxidase internalization as previously observed (39van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). After horseradish peroxidase internalization in EE, horseradish peroxidase recycling from EE to the external medium and horseradish peroxidase transport from EE to LE are partially inhibited (Fig. 4B). In contrast, LLC is accessible to horseradish peroxidase after 5 min of internalization followed by a 15-min chase as in control cells, suggesting that concanamycin B does not alter the transport of horseradish peroxidase to LLC (Fig. 4B). However, horseradish peroxidase transport out of LLC is slowed down, consistent with the reduced amounts of recycled horseradish peroxidase in the external medium. We then investigated the effect of concanamycin B on the formation of SDS-stable dimers in LLC and the transport of class II molecules out of LLC (Fig. 5). 2A4 cells were metabolically pulse-labeled for 20 min and chased for 30, 60, or 240 min in the presence or absence of 1 µM concanamycin B. After a 30-min chase, class II molecules are detected only in membrane fractions 4-8 of the Percoll gradient. No difference is observed in the presence or absence of concanamycin B. After a 1-h chase, class II molecules appear in the dense fractions 10-12 of the Percoll gradient, indicating that the transport of class II molecules to LLC occurred. Even though this transport is not impaired in the presence of concanamycin B, concanamycin B inhibited SDS-stable dimer formation (compare fractions 10-12 in the presence and absence of concanamycin B). Interestingly, after a 4-h chase, unstable class II molecules (α- and β-chains) accumulate in LLC in the presence of concanamycin B, whereas without concanamycin B, SDS-stable dimers are no longer detected in LLC, but are found in a low density membrane compartment as described previously (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that the formation of SDS-stable dimers normally occurs in an acidic environment and that the transport of class II molecules out of LLC is inhibited by concanamycin B. In addition, we analyzed the effects of concanamycin B on the morphology of LLC at the electron microscopic level (Fig. 6). Without concanamycin B, LLC is composed of multivesicular and multilaminar vesicles containing membrane bud profiles with internal vesicles (Fig. 6a). Interestingly, in the presence of concanamycin B, we observe a central core containing intramembrane structures with extended tubules at the LLC periphery (Fig. 6b). One explanation might be that the budding of transport vesicles generated from LLC is impaired in the presence of concanamycin B, leading to the formation of tubular structures, as has already been observed for the formation of endosomal carrier vesicles (40Clague M.J. Urbé S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now well established that the transport of endocytosed materials from early to late endosomes depends on an intact microtubule network, whereas the recycling pathway from early endosomes to the plasma membrane does not (41Matteoni R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3259-3272Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 42DeBrabander M. Nuydens R. Geerts H. Hopkins C. Cell Motil.

We tested the effect of nocodazole on (i) the transport of class II molecules in LLC, (ii) the formation of SDS-stable dimers, and (iii) their transport out of LLC (Fig. 7). Cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min, and radioactivity was chased for 1, 2, and 4 h. For each experiment, after a 30-min chase, nocodazole was added to allow the exit of class II molecules from the Golgi apparatus since it is believed that depolymerization of microtubules affects the transport of macromolecules in this organelle (47Dabora S.L. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1988; 54: 27-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 48Turner J.R. Tartakoff A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2081-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Fractions 9-11 of the Percoll gradient were pooled, and class II molecules were immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 7, nocodazole treatment affects neither the transport of class II molecules to the LLC compartment nor the formation of SDS-stable dimers. Class II molecules (unstable and compact forms) appear in LLC after a 1-h chase, as already shown in Fig. 5. After a 4-h chase, SDS-stable dimers are no longer detected in LLC. These results suggest that the transport of class II molecules through LLC is independent of the microtubule network. We have previously shown that LLC is involved in the formation of SDS-stable dimers between HEL and IAk molecules. LLC is a dense compartment different from EE (Rab4/Rab5-positive), LE (Rab7-positive), and lysosomes (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper, we have further characterized LLC, and we propose that LLC is a specialized compartment of the recycling pathway in murine B cells. LLC corresponds to 0.5-µm diameter vesicles containing multivesicular and multilaminar structures (Fig. 2). These structures were previously observed in B lymphocytes (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 49Raposo G. Nijman H. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R.L. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp.

Geuze H.J. Melief C.J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and it has been postulated that multivesicular and multilaminar vesicles might correspond to various stages of MIIC maturation (12West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 49Raposo G. Nijman H. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R.L. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp.

Dermatol. 1994; 103: 516-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) even if the relationship between these different stages still remains unclear. One of the major LLC characteristics is that this compartment is morphologically different from tubulovesicular EE and LE (28Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1983; 35: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 43Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J.

Hollinshead M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 635-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that transport of endocytic material from EE to LE involves the multivesicular endosomal carrier vesicles (43Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Their formation can be prevented by concanamycin B treatment (40Clague M.J. Urbé S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an inhibitor of the proton pump vacuolar ATPase. In our study, the biogenesis of LLC was not affected by concanamycin B (Fig. 6), indicating that LLC is probably different from endosomal carrier vesicles. Strikingly, we present morphological and biochemical evidence that LLC contains the transferrin receptor (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), a well known marker for both early and recycling endosomes, suggesting that LLC is associated with the early endosomal network, but is different from EE. More indications come from biochemical studies. Comparative analyses of the protein compositions of LLC, EE, and LE indicate that the LLC polypeptide pattern analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is closely related to that of EE, but is different from that of LE (Fig. 1), suggesting that LLC may be generated from EE. This has been also suggested for the peptide-loading compartment CIIV (15Amigorena S. Drake J.R. Webster P. Mellman I. Nature. 1994; 369: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 55Amigorena S. Webster P. Drake J.R. Newcomb J. Cresswell P. Mellman I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1729-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in murine B cells, whose characteristics are very similar to those of LLC except for their physical properties (high density for LLC versus low density for CIIV). Comparative studies of their respective protein compositions would be helpful to address the similarity between LLC and CIIV. More information is given by fluid-phase internalization of horseradish peroxidase and transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis. Indeed, the kinetics of internalization of both the horseradish peroxidase fluid-phase marker and transferrin demonstrate that LLC is rapidly accessible to horseradish peroxidase in a 10-15-min range, but after EE (Fig. 3). We then studied the role of LLC in the HEL-IAk class II molecule association. When 2A4 B cells are treated with concanamycin B, the formation of LLC is not affected, and class II molecules are detected in LLC after a 1-h chase (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). In contrast, the formation of SDS-stable dimers is impaired, as described previously in human B cells (38Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This shows that the inhibition of SDS-stable dimer formation depends on the direct inactivation of the vacuolar proton pump, confirming that low pH is required for antigen processing and association with class II molecules in vitro (56Germain R.N. Rinker Jr., A.J. Nature. 1993; 363: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 57Calafat J. Nijenhuis M. Janssen H. Tulp A. Dusseljee S. Wubbolts R. Neefjes J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After a 4-h chase, concanamycin B induces an accumulation of unstable class II molecules in LLC (Fig. 5). This strongly suggests that the transport of class II molecules out of LLC occurs only after SDS-stable dimers have been generated, leading to the conclusion that the transport mechanism of class II complexes from LLC to the plasma membrane can be triggered by the tight association of HEL with class II molecules. We then used nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent known to affect the transport of endocytosed material from EE to later stages of the endocytic pathway, but not the recycling of receptors and solutes from EE to the plasma membrane (41Matteoni R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3259-3272Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 42DeBrabander M. Nuydens R. Geerts H. Hopkins C. Cell Motil.

In our study, nocodazole did not have any effect on class II molecule transport in and out LLC (Fig. 7), suggesting that those transport mechanisms occur in a microtubule-independent manner. The facts that LLC contains the transferrin receptor and possesses a protein composition similar to that of EE and that nocodazole does not affect the transport of class II molecules in and out of LLC strongly suggest that LLC might be a compartment related to the recycling pathway. Without underestimating the possibility that part of the class II molecules transit directly from the trans-Golgi network to LLC, we favor a model of the transport of class II molecules from the trans-Golgi network to LLC through EE. This model hypothesis is also supported by several lines of evidence. Newly synthesized αβ·Ii complexes can be digested by transferrin-coupled neuraminidase before reaching the cell surface (58Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 59Neefjes J.J. Stollorz V. Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In mouse B cells, at least 50% of the αβ·Ii complexes transit through early endosomes (16Castellino F. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 73-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 60Romagnoli P. Layet C. Yewdell J. Bakke O. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We propose that, when leaving EE, class II molecules could be transported to the recycling LLC compartment, where they associate with HEL peptides. The formation of HEL-class II SDS-stable complexes might induce their targeting to the plasma membrane. This process could involve a direct fusion of LLC with the plasma membrane or vesicle-mediated membrane traffic between LLC and the plasma membrane. In human B cells, multivesicular MIIC have the propensity to fuse directly with the plasma membrane and to deliver internal vesicles called exosomes in the extracellular medium able to stimulate Th lymphocytes (49Raposo G. Nijman H. Stoorvogel W. Leijendekker R.L. Harding C.V. Melief C.J.M. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). This direct fusion has not been described in murine B cells, yet. However, LLC membrane fractions prepared for electron microscopy show the presence of budding areas with internal membranes (Fig. 6). The significance of these buds is not clear, but they could generate vesicular compartments containing internal vesicles en route to the cell surface in a microtubule-independent manner. Upon fusion with the plasma membrane, these vesicular compartments will release their content of vesicles in the external medium. Therefore, they could constitute a potential source of microvesicles with IAk molecules exposed at their surface interacting with T lymphocytes. Another possibility would be that these vesicles could fuse with EE or the tubular recycling compartment before reaching the plasma membrane since, after a 4-h chase, SDS-stable dimers cosediment with Rab4- and Rab5-positive early endosomal fractions (Fig. 5) (17Escola J.M. Grivel J.C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are required to investigate the mechanisms of the biogenesis of these vesicles. In particular, in vitro assays reconstituting LLC biogenesis and vesicle transport out of LLC will certainly be an important issue for the coming years. We thank Drs. S. Amigorena, O. Bakke, H. Geuze, and J. Gruenberg for helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. P. Benaroch for providing concanamycin B as well as for helpful suggestions."

Conjugation of reactive substrates with glutathione by GST serves primarily to prevent deleterious reactions with nucleophilic centers in cellular macromolecules. As first shown by Benson et al. (1Benson A.M. Batzinger R.P. Ou S.Y. Bueding E. Cha Y.N. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4486-4495PubMed Google Scholar), overexpression of GST often provides protection against the effects of electrophile exposure. In contrast, depletion of glutathione can increase cellular damage caused by GST substrates (2Monroe D.H. Eaton D.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1988; 94: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the cytosolic GSTs consist of four classes of isoenzymes: alpha, mu, pi, and theta, which all have similar three-dimensional structures (3Ji X. Zhang P. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10169-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 4Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schaffer J. Gallay O. Huber R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The active form of GST is a dimer, either a homodimer or a heterodimer, composed of two subunits from the same class (7Kitahara A. Sato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Hayes J.D. Strange R.C. Percy Robb I.W. Biochem.

Structural and functional studies have clearly shown that the GST homodimer has two identical binding sites (one per subunit) which act independently rather than cooperatively. Structures have been solved for numerous crystals of GST isoenzymes complexed with different GST products or product analogs in the active site. These crystals do not display any significant structural differences between the two subunits in the dimer, which might suggest differences in activity of the subunits (4Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schaffer J. Gallay O. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 5Sinning I. Kleywegt G.T. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L.

Biol. 1994; 237: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, many of these structures clearly show two products bound per dimer, one in the active site of each subunit (4Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schaffer J. Gallay O. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 5Sinning I. Kleywegt G.T. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Birgit O.

Biol. 1992; 227: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Ligand binding experiments have shown noncooperative substrate and product binding with a stoichiometry of two ligands per dimer (12Jakobson I. Warholm M. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7085-7089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, steady state kinetic experiments with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene are consistent with two identical, independent active sites (13Ivanetich K.M. Goold R.D. Sikakana C.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, the ability to predict substrate turnover and specificity of heterodimers from homodimer activities provides further evidence that each subunit in the dimer has an independent active site (14Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the reported ligand binding and kinetic studies of GST generally support a model where GST dimers have two independent active sites, this model has not been extensively tested using different isoenzymes and substrates. In particular, binding studies using large substrates or products have not been reported in the literature. One relatively large, bulky substrate for certain GSTs is the epoxide of aflatoxin B1 (AFB). AFB, one of a group of related mycotoxins produced by the common fungal mold Aspergillus flavus, is a well documented rat and human carcinogen (15Hall A.J. Wild C.P. Eaton D.L. Groopman J.D. The Toxicology of Aflatoxins: Human Health, Vetrinary and Agricultural Significance. Academic Press, New York1994: 233-258Crossref Google Scholar, 16Eaton D.L. Gallagher E.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). AFB is activated to the highly reactive aflatoxin 8,9-exo-epoxide (AFBO) by certain cytochromes P450. AFBO then serves as a substrate for some, but not all, GST isoenzymes (16Eaton D.L. Gallagher E.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Mice constitutively express glutathione S-transferase mGSTA3-3 in liver, which possesses high activity toward AFBO, protecting them from aflatoxin B1-induced hepatocarcinogenicity by conjugating AFBO with glutathione to form 8,9-dihydro-8-(S-glutathionyl)-9-hydroxyl-aflatoxin B1 (AFB-GSH; Fig. 1) (17Buetler T.M. Slone D. Eaton D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies have suggested that mGSTA3-3 has a very high affinity for AFB-GSH, and thus AFB-GSH may be a useful ligand with which to evaluate the turnover of large compounds by GST. In this study we report that AFB-GSH binds mGSTA3-3 with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol of dimeric enzyme. The mouse GSTA3 cDNA was previously cloned (18Buetler T.M. Eaton D.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 314-318PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pET11d was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Aflatoxin B1, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, and glutathione were purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from various commercial sources. AFBO was synthesized, separated from the endo-epoxide, and reacted with glutathione to form AFB-GSH, using the procedure developed by Raney et al. (19Raney K.D. Coles B. Guengerich F.P. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Synthesized AFB-GSH was purified by HPLC using a protocol also described by Raney et al. (19Raney K.D. Coles B. Guengerich F.P. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which allows separation of exo-epoxide conjugate from endo-epoxide conjugate. The synthesized exo-epoxide conjugate did not contain detectable amounts of endo-epoxide conjugate. The purified AFB-GSH coeluted from the HPLC column with enzymatically generated conjugate. The concentration of purified AFB-GSH was determined by measuring the absorbance at 365 nm using the extinction coefficient 21,800 M−1 (20Moss E.J. Judah D.J. Przybylski M. Neal G.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with the pET11d plasmid containing the mGSTA3 cDNA and optimized for high levels of mGSTA3-3 protein expression. mGSTA3-3 was expressed using a procedure modified from Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 17.11-17.28Google Scholar). All purification steps were conducted at 4°C. Bacteria expressing recombinant protein were lysed with a Heat Systems Ultrasonics model W-220 sonicator at power level five three times for 20 s each. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g two times for 20 min each. Bacterial supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione agarose affinity column and washed overnight with ≥10 column volumes of 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4; 200 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. GST proteins were eluted with 50 mM glutathione in 200 mM Tris, pH 9.0. The proteins were dialyzed against 4 × 2 liters of 40 mM Na2HP04, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol over a period of 40 h. All bacterially expressed GSTs yielded a single band that migrated at the predicted size on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Molar concentrations of homodimeric mGSTA3-3 were calculated from protein mass measurements using a molecular mass of 50.5 kDa (17Buetler T.M. Slone D. Eaton D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Apparent dissociation constant, Kd, and binding stoichiometry for AFB-GSH were determined by measuring quenching of the fluorescence of AFB-GSH upon binding to mGSTA3-3. AFB-GSH is fluorescent when free in aqueous solution with a fluorescence maximum at excitation 365 nm, and emission 440 nm. This fluorescence is completely quenched when AFB-GSH is bound to mGSTA3-3 (see Fig. 2). Thus, fluorescence intensity of a solution containing both the enzyme mGSTA3-3 and the ligand AFB-GSH is proportional to the concentration of free (unbound) AFB-GSH. The measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer LS50 luminescence spectrometer in the presence of 1 µM mGSTA3-3 dimer and 0.125-3 µM AFB-GSH in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Measurements were performed at 37°C, maintained by a Lauda MS circulating water bath. The excitation wavelength was 365 nm and emission was detected at 440 nm. Concentration of free AFB-GSH was determined by comparison to a standard curve. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of mGSTA3-3 upon ligand binding was also monitored by excitation at 280 nm and emission at 330 nm. The dissociation constant, Kd, and binding stoichiometry for p-nitrobenzyl glutathione and AFB-GSH were determined by equilibrium dialysis. The two compartments in each cell were separated by Mr 12,000-14,000 cut off Spectra/Por dialysis membrane from Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc. (Houston, TX). One compartment was loaded with 300 µl of mGSTA3-3 enzyme in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. For analysis of p-nitrobenzyl glutathione binding, a protein concentration of 3.0-4.3 mg/ml (61-86 µM dimeric enzyme) was used; for analysis of AFB-GSH binding, a protein concentration of 0.15-0.21 mg/ml (3.0-4.3 µM dimeric enzyme) was used. The other compartment was loaded with 300 µl of ligand (60-1500 µM p-nitrobenzyl glutathione or 1-16 µM AFB-GSH) in the same buffer. In each control cell, one compartment was loaded with 300 µl of ligand in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and the other compartment was loaded with only buffer. The cells were rotated for 4.5 h at 37°C for equilibration. The control cells were used to confirm that equilibrium had been achieved and to measure nonspecific binding of the ligand. Aliquots from both compartments of the control cells and from the ligand-only compartment of the enzyme-containing cells were recovered, and ligand concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm (p-nitrobenzyl glutathione) or fluorescence at excitation 365 nm/emission 440 nm (AFB-GSH). Activity toward CDNB was measured as described by Habig and Jakoby (22Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Binding parameters, the dissociation constant (Kd), and binding capacity (n) for binding of AFB-GSH to mGSTA3-3 and Ki for inhibition of AFB-GSH binding by glutathione were determined by nonlinear regression using the program ENZFITTER (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The dissociation constant (Kd) and binding capacity of AFB-GSH to mGSTA3-3 were measured directly by monitoring the quenching of AFB-GSH fluorescence. The fluorescence of AFB-GSH in buffer was proportional to AFB-GSH concentration from 0-3 µM AFB-GSH (Fig. 2, inset). This fluorescence was quenched by binding of AFB-GSH to mGSTA3-3 (Fig. 2). AFB-GSH fluorescence was not efficiently quenched by rGSTA3-3, which is 86% identical to mGSTA3-3 (results not shown). Table I summarizes the parameters for AFB-GSH binding to mGSTA3-3. The data were fit to a model for noncooperative ligand binding: y=(n⋅x)/(Kd+x)(Eq. 1) Table I.Binding parameters of products for mouse glutathione S-transferase A3-3LigandnKdµMAFB-GSHaData obtained by direct measurement of AFB-GSH fluorescence quenching as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1.31 ± 0.0880.72 ± 0.11bParameter values ± standard error.AFB-GSH1.12 ± 0.0780.86 ± 0.19p-nitrobenzyl glutathione2.24 ± 0.1759 ± 17a Data obtained by direct measurement of AFB-GSH fluorescence quenching as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Parameter values ± standard error.

The data were fit by nonlinear regression using the program ENZFITTER (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Analysis of ligand binding from quenching of AFB-GSH fluorescence yielded a Kd of 0.72 ± 0.11 µM and a binding capacity of 1.31 ± 0.088 mol/mol of dimer. The intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan in mGSTA3-3 was also monitored (23Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 342-362Google Scholar), and this fluorescence decreased with increasing concentrations of AFB-GSH, indicating that AFB-GSH was binding to mGSTA3-3 in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). Data from quenching of tryptophan fluorescence were not used to estimate binding parameters, because ligand binding capacity cannot be determined from changes in spectroscopic properties of the protein which rely on fractional change (24Klotz I.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Function, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 25-54Google Scholar). Jakobson et al. (12Jakobson I. Warholm M. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7085-7089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that glutathione and small substrates inhibit binding of the small reaction product S-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)glutathione to GST in a competitive manner. To verify that AFB-GSH was binding to the active site of the enzyme, the ability of glutathione and CDNB to compete with AFB-GSH for binding to mGSTA3-3 was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, glutathione inhibits binding of AFB-GSH to mGSTA3-3 in a competitive manner, with a Ki of 1.5 mM. Inhibition of AFB-GSH binding by CDNB also appeared to be competitive (data not shown). To further explore the surprising result suggesting that binding capacity was saturated at a stoichiometry of 1 mol of AFB-GSH/mol of dimer, ligand binding was remeasured by equilibrium dialysis. An equilibrium dialysis apparatus was used to measure binding of two ligands, AFB-GSH and p-nitrobenzyl glutathione, to mGSTA3-3. Binding curves obtained for both ligands were hyperbolic, consistent with noncooperative binding (Fig. 4). The residuals appeared to be normally distributed, indicating that the model used was appropriate to describe the observed binding. As shown in Table I, the binding stoichiometry for AFB-GSH was 1.12 ± 0.078 mol/mol of dimer, while binding stoichiometry for p-nitrobenzyl glutathione was 2.24 ± 0.17. Given our finding that 1 molecule of AFB-GSH binds per molecule of mGSTA3-3 homodimer, we measured the ability of AFB-GSH to inhibit activity toward CDNB. Based on previous studies, CDNB conjugation occurs in the active site of each subunit in a noncooperative manner (14Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the inhibition of activities toward CDNB by AFB-GSH under standard assay conditions for both mGSTA3-3, an enzyme with high activity toward AFBO, and rGSTA3-3, an enzyme with low activity toward AFBO. Although mGSTA3-3 and rGSTA3-3 have similar CDNB activities (9.9 and 15.7 µmol/mg/min respectively), they have very different activity toward AFBO (265 nmol/mg/min and <0.2 nmol/mg/min). 2T. E. McHugh and D. L. Eaton, unpublished results. AFB-GSH inhibited activity toward CDNB in mGSTA3-3 in a concentration dependent manner; however, it did not inhibit activity toward CDNB in rGSTA3-3 (Fig. 5). The results of this study show that p-nitrobenzyl glutathione binds to mGSTA3-3 with the expected stoichiometry of 2 mol/mol of dimer, while the much larger glutathione conjugate AFB-GSH binds with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol of dimer. This is the first study to show different binding stoichiometries with two different glutathione conjugates. Although Schramm et al. used a spin-labeled product analog (S-[[(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxy-3-pyrrolidinyl)cambamoyl]methyl]glutathione) to study ligand binding and found a binding stoichiometry of one per dimer in rGSTA1-1, they did not attempt to measure the binding stoichiometry of any alternative ligands (25Schramm V.L. McCluskey R. Emig F.A. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 714-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Schramm et al. (25Schramm V.L. McCluskey R. Emig F.A. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 714-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that their results were indicative of one active site per dimer or of generalized half-sites reactivity for GSTs, conclusions which have not been supported by subsequent research (4Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schaffer J. Gallay O. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 5Sinning I. Kleywegt G.T. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R.

J. 1985; 231: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we have verified the previous findings that small glutathione conjugates bind to GST with a stoichiometry of two per dimer (12Jakobson I. Warholm M. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7085-7089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have found a large glutathione conjugate which binds to mGSTA3-3 with a stoichiometry of one per dimer. In addition to the well defined active site, which consists of the glutathione binding site and the hydrophobic binding site (26Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1985; 57: 357-417PubMed Google Scholar), GSTs also contain at least one non-substrate binding site. Many non-substrate ligands have been shown to bind GST with a stoichiometry of one per dimer, or two per dimer with a single high affinity site and a single low affinity site (27Vander Jagt D.L. Wilson S.P. Dean V.L. Simons P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1997-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact location of the non-substrate binding site has not been identified. However, a recent crystal structure of GST from Schistosoma japonica shows the anti-schistosomal drug praziquantel bound to a site in the dimer interface, identifying this cleft as a binding site for at least some non-substrates (28McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A binding stoichiometry of one mole ligand per mole dimeric enzyme could be interpreted as evidence that AFB-GSH is binding to the non-substrate binding site. However, we found that AFB-GSH completely inhibits activity toward CDNB in mGSTA3-3, but fails to inhibit activity toward CDNB in rGST A3-3 (which is 86% identical to mGSTA3-3 but has no detectable activity toward AFBO). In addition, we found that the binding of AFB-GSH to mGSTA3-3 is competitive with glutathione and CDNB. These data indicate that AFB-GSH is most likely binding to the catalytic site of one subunit. Sinning et al. (5Sinning I. Kleywegt G.T. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Birgit O. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) reported that the hydrophobic binding site in alpha class hGSTA1-1 is relatively small, capable of holding molecules with ten or fewer carbons. Larger substrates bound to this site would likely extend into the cleft of the dimer interface. Aflatoxin B1 is a difuranocoumarin compound with 22 heavy atoms (see Fig. 1), thus it is likely that a large portion of the molecule extends into the cleft formed by the dimer interface. It is possible that the glutathione moiety of AFB-GSH is bound to the G-site of one subunit, and the aflatoxin moiety extends into the non-substrate binding site identified by McTigue et al. (28McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The binding of AFB-GSH to an alpha-class isoenzyme was modeled using coordinates from the crystal structure of human GSTA1-1 (74% identical to mGSTA3-3) complexed with S-benzyl glutathione (5Sinning I. Kleywegt G.T. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Birgit O. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The glutathione moiety of S-benzyl glutathione was used to anchor the glutathione moiety of AFB-GSH in the active site of each subunit. The aflatoxin moiety was rotated about the sulfur bond without regard to steric conflicts with the enzyme. With the glutathione moieties anchored in the G-sites, no binding conformation resulted in a steric conflict between the aflatoxin moiety from one subunit and any part of AFB-GSH bound to the other subunit. The two ligands were separated by at least 7 Å. Although a single AFB-GSH does not appear to physically interact with both enzyme active sites, the binding of AFB-GSH to one subunit may block access to the other subunit active site or may induce a conformational change which lowers the affinity for substrates at the other subunit active site. Our findings do not support the generally accepted model of GST function, an enzyme with two independent active sites, one on each subunit. Although there have not been previous reports of GST reaction products which bind to GST with a stoichiometry of one per dimer, the available alpha-class crystal structures (5Sinning I. Kleywegt G.T. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Birgit O. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 7085-7089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have utilized glutathione conjugates that are much smaller than AFB-GSH. We propose that the presence of AFB-GSH in one subunit active site either physically blocks access to the active site on the other subunit or induces a conformational change which prevents binding to the other subunit. There are a number of other large substrates which are metabolized by various GST isoenzymes to form glutathione conjugates; for example benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide, 7-hydroxymethylbenz[a] anthracene, and cholesterol-5,6-oxide (see Hayes and Pulford (30Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. CRC Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar) for review). Additional study is needed to determine whether our result is specific to AFB-GSH and mGSTA3-3 or is generally applicable to large glutathione conjugates binding to GST. We thank Eric Dietze for computer modeling of AFB-GSH in the active site of alpha class glutathione S-transferase. We also thank Dr. Theo Bammler for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."

The first proven tricyclic intermediate in the biosynthesis of 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol has been shown by in vivo studies to be isotrichodermin, a natural metabolite of F. culmorum. Indeed, the feeding of ring-deuterated isotrichodermin resulted in ring-deuterated 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol as shown by NMR studies.In this work, we have shown that the 3-acetyl group of isotrichodermin is mostly lost in its metabolism to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol. We have shown by two different approaches that the deacetylation occurs at an early step after the first oxygenation step at C-15. Derivatives of isotrichodermin lacking the 3-acetyl such as 3-deacetyl isotrichodermin or 3-oxo-12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene are not precursors to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol.

Fusarium culmorum has been shown to produce two main secondary metabolites (Fig. 1): 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADN) 1The abbreviations used are: 3-ADN3-acetyldeoxynivalenolSOLsambucinolEPT12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-eneHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyITDisotrichoderminDONdeoxynivalenoltRretention time. and sambucinol (SOL) (1Greenhalgh R.

There seems to be no metabolic interconversion between EPT and ITD (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, many of the oxidative metabolic products of isotrichodermin were elucidated (5Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol.

We have recently investigated the fate of the 3-acetyl group in isotrichodermin conversion to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol. It has always been assumed without any proof that the 3-acetyl in 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol originates from the 3-acetyl in isotrichodermin. This was based on the seemingly textbook definition of a biosynthetic precursor: it was produced by F. culmorum cultures (4Greenhalgh R. Levandier D. Adams W. Miller J.O. Blackwell B.A. McAlees A.J. Taylor A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1986; 34: 98-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it was 27% incorporated into 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, and the incorporation site was rigorously determined by 2H NMR of ring-deuterated isotrichodermin feedings (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to ensure that we could use the easily synthesized [1′-14C]acetyl isotrichodermin as a marker to isolate enzymes, we decided to confirm that indeed the 3-acetyl in isotrichodermin is retained in its conversion to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol. We obtained surprising results, which will be discussed here. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer series 3B instrument coupled to a LC-75 variable wavelength detector (Perkin-Elmer) set at 204 nm and a Berthold LB 505 HPLC radioactivity monitor (Labserco, Oakville, Ontario). Thin layer chromatography separations using LHP-KF thin layer chromatography plates (Whatman) were analyzed with a Bioscan Imaging Scanner System 200 (Bioscan, Inc., Washington, D.C.). A Tracor Analytic Delta 300 instrument was used for liquid scintillation counting. Homogenization of F. culmorum cells was accomplished with a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Centrifugation was done using a Dupont-Sorvall 5C centrifuge with an SS-34 rotor and a Beckman Instruments L5-75 ultracentrifuge with a 60 Ti rotor. A Perkin-Elmer model 559A uv-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a digital temperature controller was used for all spectrophotometric measurements. Proton NMR spectra were run on JEOL CPF-270 (270 MHz), while the deuterium NMR spectra were run on XL-300 operating at 46 MHz. The samples (2-5 mg) were dissolved in CDCl3 (in CHCl3 for deuterium NMR), and their spectra were recorded at ambient temperature (22°C). For routine 1H NMR, a 45° pulse was used with an acquisition time of 4 s (no relaxation delay). The data were zero-filled, and resolution enhancement techniques were used to help resolve small couplings. The two-dimensional matrix was 1024 × 1024 data points after processing. The data were pseudoecho-shaped and symmetrized prior to plotting. The 2H NMR spectra were acquired using 80° pulse and 1-s acquisition times. The data were zero-filled and processed with 1-Hz line broadening. The solvent (CHCl3), used as internal reference, was set at 7.26 ppm. F. culmorum strain HLX 1503 was grown as described previously (9Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15348-15353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The seed cultures (50 ml of seed medium in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask) were incubated for 3 days. The production cultures (25 ml of production medium in a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask) were incubated for 2 days. Analytical HPLC was performed with two Whatman partisil 10 ODS-2 analytical columns in series (4.6 × 500 mm). Semipreparative HPLC was performed with two Whatman partisil 10 ODS-2 Mag 9 semipreparative columns in series (9.4 × 500 mm). Preparative HPLC was performed with one partisil 10 ODS-2 MAG-20 preparative column (22 × 500 mm). Program 1 consisted of a linear gradient that lasted for 50 min with an initial concentration of 15% methanol, 85% water and a final concentration of 75% methanol, 25% water, which was then held for 40 min. All ultraviolet detectors were set at 204 nm. Program 2 consisted of a linear gradient lasting 50 min with an initial concentration of 15% methanol, 85% water and a final concentration of 75% methanol, 25% water, which was held for 30 min and then increased linearly for 10 min to 100% methanol. The concentration was held for 20 min at 100% methanol before equilibration to 15% methanol, 85% water. Program 3 consisted of a linear gradient from 15% methanol, 85% water to 75% methanol, 25% water over 25 min. This concentration of methanol was held for 20 min and then increased linearly for 5 min to 100% methanol and maintained for 20 min. [1′-14C]Acetyl isotrichodermin was prepared and purified according to 6Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar. The radioactivity of the pure [1′-14C]acetyl isotrichodermin was 7.2×105 dpm, and the specific activity was 9.1 × 105 dpm/mg or 2.53 × 105 dpm/µmol. Eight 54-h-old 25-ml production cultures of F. culmorum were each fed 2.7×106 dpm of (3R)-[2-14C]mevalonate (2.3 GBq/mmol) and then were incubated for another 20 h (9Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15348-15353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [4,8,14-14C]isotrichodermin was isolated as described previously (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified [4,8,14-14C]isotrichodermin and standard isotrichodermin were both subjected to HPLC with 65% methanol, 35% water as eluting solvent. The tR of standard isotrichodermin was 57.6 min, and the tR of [4,8,14-14C]isotrichodermin was 57.4 min. Finally, both standard isotrichodermin and [4,8,14-14C]isotrichodermin (20 µl/1000 µl) were spotted on a LHP-KF plate. The plate was developed with ethyl acetate/methanol (98:2) and then analyzed with the Bioscan Imaging Scanner System. One symmetrical radioactive peak was detected, which had an Rf of 0.67. The standard isotrichodermin was detected with iodine vapor and had an Rf of 0.66. The yield of [4,8,14-14C]isotrichodermin was 2.6 × 104 dpm. Both [1′-14C]acetyl ITD (6.5 × 104 dpm) and [4,8,14-14C]ITD (1.9 × 104 dpm) in methanol were added to a sterile 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. The methanol was evaporated under nitrogen, and 0.1 ml 5% Brij 35 was added. Next, a 55-h-old 25-ml production culture of F. culmorum was added, and the culture was shaken at 220 rpm in the dark at 25°C for an additional 70 h. The culture medium was extracted on two 1020 Chemelut tubes with 8 × 12 ml of ethyl acetate for each tube. The extract was fractionated by analytical HPLC on program 1 at 1 ml/min, and the peak corresponding to 3-ADN (tR = 44.6 min) was collected and further purified by analytical HPLC using 35% methanol, 65% water as solvent (tR = 45.8 min) (1.33 × 104 dpm). NMR analysis confirmed the structure to be that of 3-ADN. Two portions (5% each) of the 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol were subjected to HPLC using program 1, and the 3-ADN collected was analyzed for radioactivity. The average radioactivity obtained of the two injections of 3-ADN was 524 ± 13 dpm. In addition, two portions (5% each) were each incubated in 50 µl of methanol and 100 µl of 0.1 N NaOH for 17 h at 25°C to hydrolyze the ester at the 3-position of 3-ADN. Each of these samples was subjected to analytical HPLC using program 1. All of the radioactivity corresponded to the deoxynivalenol (DON) peak produced by hydrolysis (tR = 29.7 min). The average radioactivity obtained of the two injections of DON was 376 ± 14 dpm. The ratio of the radioactivity of 3-ADN before hydrolysis to the radioactivity of 3-ADN after hydrolysis was 1.39:1. Two aliquots of the mixture were injected individually onto the HPLC, and the radioactivity collected under the acetyl ITD region was 1941 dpm for one injection and 597 dpm for the second injection. Two aliquots of the mixture were hydrolyzed. The radioactivity collected under the deacyl ITD region was 567 dpm for the first injection and 164 dpm for the second injection. From these data the average ratio of 3.5:1 for radioactivity in [14C]acetyl ITD to radioactivity in [4,8,14-14C]ITD was calculated. The [4β,15-2H]3-deacetyl ITD (1) was prepared as described previously (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was subsequently used for the synthesis of [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H] ITD (2, Fig. 3) and of [4β,15-2H]3-oxo-EPT (3, Fig. 3).

A solution of [4β,15-2H]3-deacetyl ITD (1) (0.061 g; 0.24 mmol) in 3.6 ml of pyridine was treated with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.008 g; 0.065 mmol) and [2H6]acetic anhydride (0.064 ml; 0.64 mmol). The acetylation was completed after stirring at 25°C for 90 min. The pyridine was coevaporated with heptane. The residue was flash-chromatographed on silica (10Still W.C. Kahn M. Mitra A. J. Org. Chem. 1978; 43: 2923-2925Crossref Scopus (8001) Google Scholar) using hexane/ethyl acetate (80:20) as the eluting solvent. [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) was obtained (0.070 g; 97%) as a white crystalline powder (m.p.: 145.5-147°C) (Fig. 3, Table II).Table II.Proton and deuterium NMR analyses of doubly deuterated isotrichodermin, [2′-2H3 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) and its unlabeled counterpart, ITDaThe letters s, d, t, q, and m following the signals stand for singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, and multiplet signals. br and o show broad or overlapping linesbFive deuterium signals appear in the deuterium spectrum, one at 2.11 ppm for D-4 (integrating for one deuterium), one signal at 0.83 ppm for D-15A and -B protons (integrating for one deuterium together), and one at 2.11 ppm for D-2′ (integrating for three deuteriums). aThe letters s, d, t, q, and m following the signals stand for singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, and multiplet signals. br and o show broad or overlapping lines bFive deuterium signals appear in the deuterium spectrum, one at 2.11 ppm for D-4 (integrating for one deuterium), one signal at 0.83 ppm for D-15A and -B protons (integrating for one deuterium together), and one at 2.11 ppm for D-2′ (integrating for three deuteriums). A solution of [4β,15-2H]3-deacetyl ITD (1) (0.014 g; 0.055 mmol) in 2.2 ml of dry dichloromethane was cooled to 0°C and was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (0.050 g; 0.23 mmol). The oxidation was completed after stirring at 0°C for 30 min and at 25°C for 60 min. The heterogeneous mixture was filtered through a column of dry silica gel, and the desired compound was eluted using hexane/ethyl acetate (75:25). [4β,15-2H]3-Oxo-EPT (3) was obtained (0.010 g; 72%) as a white crystalline powder (Fig. 3, Table I). Different amounts of 1, 2, and 3 were fed in duplicate. The compounds were dissolved in methanol. An appropriate aliquot of each solution was added to a sterile 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. The methanol was allowed to evaporate from the stoppered flasks overnight. [4β,15-2H]3-Deacetyl ITD (1) was fed in five 1-mg, three 2.5-mg, and two 5-mg quantities. [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H] ITD (2) was fed in two 2.5-mg, 5.0-mg, and 10.0-mg quantities. [4β,15-2H]3-Oxo-EPT (3) was fed in two 5-mg quantities. A 0.25-ml sterile 5% Brij 35 solution was added to each flask. Next, a 2-day-old 25-ml production culture was added to each flask, and the cultures were incubated at 25°C and 220 rpm for a further 5 days.Two controls each containing only 0.25 ml of 5% Brij 35 and a 2-day-old production culture were also incubated as above. The samples from each individual feeding experiment were pooled, filtered, saturated with NaCl, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and then evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The extracts were then dissolved in methanol for fractionation by semipreparative HPLC using program 2 at 3 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to 3-ADN from the individual feeding experiments were further purified using two ODS-2 analytical columns at 1 ml/min with 35% methanol, 65% water (tR = 45.6 min). The NMR of 3-ADN (4, Fig. 4) was then recorded (Table III).Table III.Proton and deuterium NMR analyses of dideuterated 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol 4 obtained from the feedings of the following labeled substrates: [4β, 15-2H]3-deacetyl isotrichodermin (1), [2′-2H3, 4β, 15-2H]isotrichodermin (2) and the epoxytrichothecene derivative [4β, 15-2H]3-oxo-12, 13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (3)Table III.Proton and deuterium NMR analyses of dideuterated 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol 4 obtained from the feedings of the following labeled substrates: [4β, 15-2H]3-deacetyl isotrichodermin (1), [2′-2H3, 4β, 15-2H]isotrichodermin (2) and the epoxytrichothecene derivative [4β, 15-2H]3-oxo-12, 13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (3)aThe letters s, d, t, q, and m following the signals stand for singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, and multiplet signals. br and o show broad or overlapping lines. aThe letters s, d, t, q, and m following the signals stand for singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, and multiplet signals. br and o show broad or overlapping lines. The fractions corresponding to SOL were further purified using two ODS-2 analytical columns at 1 ml/min with 50% methanol, 50% water (tR = 38.3 min). The purified SOL was acetylated by incubating at 25°C for 16 h with 90 µl of acetic anhydride and 60 µl of pyridine. The diacetylated SOL was purified using two ODS-2 analytical columns at 1 ml/min with 65% methanol, 35% water (tR = 40.3 min). The 2H NMR of the diacetylated SOL was taken and showed no deuterium incorporation. From the feeding of a large amount of 2 (10 mg) (Fig. 4), no peaks corresponding to 3-ADN or SOL were found. On the other hand, two peaks with tR in the range of calonectrin and isotrichodermin were detected. The peak corresponding to calonectrin was isolated and purified on analytical HPLC (tR = 58.4 min) at 1 ml/min with 55% methanol, 45% water. The conditions for the purification of isotrichodermin (tR = 47.5 min) were as follows: analytical HPLC using 65% methanol, 35% water at 1 ml/min.

From the feeding of a large quantity of 1 (5 mg), no peaks corresponding to 3-ADN or SOL were found. The only compound recovered from that feeding was isotrichodermin, which was purified using the same conditions outlined before (tR = 47.2 min; analytical HPLC using 65% methanol, 35% water at 1 ml/min). Its NMR corresponds to compound 7, [4β,15-2H]ITD (Table IV). Production cultures of F. culmorum, which were 48 h old were harvested by gentle filtration through Miracloth (9Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15348-15353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of microsomes (5Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was done by an adaptation of a published procedure (11Schenkman J.B. Cinti D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction was either used immediately or stored at −80°C in 1-ml aliquots. Conversion of [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) in Microsomes—To each of two 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks were added 8 mg of [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) dissolved in methanol. The methanol was evaporated with a stream of nitrogen. To each flask was added 0.160 ml of 1% Brij 35, 1.54 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 containing 0.1 M KCl and 30% glycerol, 1.15 ml of 20 mM NADPH, 1.15 ml of 20 mM NADH. The mixture was incubated with 4 ml of microsomes, at 220 rpm, 25°C for 18 h. The contents of each flask were added to two CE 1020 tubes and were extracted with ethyl acetate (7 × 15 ml). The ethyl acetate extracts were pooled and rotavaporated. The residue was fractionated by semipreparative HPLC using program 3 at 3 ml/min. A peak with a retention time of 26.0 min was characterized by NMR and was identified as 15-deacetylcalonectrin (8, Fig. 5 and Table V).Table V.Proton and deuterium NMR analyses of deuterated 15-deacetylcalonectrin (8) derived from in vitro feeding of doubly deuterated isotrichodermin, [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2)Table V.Proton and deuterium NMR analyses of deuterated 15-deacetylcalonectrin (8) derived from in vitro feeding of doubly deuterated isotrichodermin, [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2)aThe symbols s, d, t, and m following the signals stand for singlet, doublet, triplet, and multiplet signals. br and o show broad or overlapping lines.bFive deuterium signals appear in the deuterium spectrum, one at 2.20 ppm for D-4 (integrating for one deuterium), one signal at 3.69/3.50 ppm for D-15A and -B protons (integrating for one deuterium together), and one at 2.10 ppm for D-2′ (integrating for three deuteriums). aThe symbols s, d, t, and m following the signals stand for singlet, doublet, triplet, and multiplet signals. br and o show broad or overlapping lines. bFive deuterium signals appear in the deuterium spectrum, one at 2.20 ppm for D-4 (integrating for one deuterium), one signal at 3.69/3.50 ppm for D-15A and -B protons (integrating for one deuterium together), and one at 2.10 ppm for D-2′ (integrating for three deuteriums). In order to take advantage of the great sensitivity of radiolabeled compounds we first decided to prepare isotrichodermin ring-labeled with 14C and mix it with isotrichodermin with 14C on the 1′-position of the acetyl at C-3 (Fig. 2). Since the radiolabeled compounds are used as tracers, the feeding of this mixture is equivalent to feeding doubly radiolabeled isotrichodermin (at the ring at C-4, C-8, and C-14 and at the 1′-acetyl). The ring-labeled compound at positions 4, 8, and 14 was derived from the feeding of (3R)-[2-14C]mevalonate to production cultures of F. culmorum. The [1′-14C]acetyl isotrichodermin was prepared by acetylating unlabeled deacetyl-ITD (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 14C-acetic anhydride. A mixture of these two labeled isotrichodermins (made by mixing approximately 3 times the amount of radioactivity of the [1′-14C]acetyl-ITD for one [4,8,14-14C]ITD to account for the number of 14Cs) leads to virtually doubly radiolabeled isotrichodermin at the ring (at positions 4, 8, and 14) and on the 1′-acetyl position. The accurate ratio of radioactivity in the doubly labeled isotrichodermin (ring-radiolabeled + 1′-14C-acetyl) versus the ring-radiolabeled isotrichodermin was rigorously determined to be 3.5:1. This value was obtained by averaging the radioactivity values obtained by injecting different aliquots of the mixture onto the HPLC before and after chemical hydrolysis of the ester at the 3-position. Before chemical hydrolysis, the counts are equal to counts from the doubly labeled ITD. After chemical hydrolysis, all of the 1′-14C-acetyl radioactivity has been lost, and the radioactivity detected in deacetyl-ITD is only due to [4,8,14-14C]ITD. The doubly radiolabeled isotrichodermin was fed to F. culmorum cultures, and the resulting 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol and sambucinol were isolated and purified as described for other substrates (5Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sambucinol isolated and purified showed no radioactivity, confirming our previous finding that isotrichodermin is not a biosynthetic precursor to sambucinol (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The 3-ADN isolated and purified was radioactive as expected. In addition, the incorporation of isotrichodermin was also on the order of 30% as previously found (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to understand the fate of the 3-acetyl of isotrichodermin in the conversion to 3-ADN, the following experiments were done: (i) the radioactivity of an aliquot of the pure 3-ADN derived from the doubly radiolabeled isotrichodermin feeding was measured and recorded; and (ii) an equivalent aliquot of that pure 3-ADN derived from the doubly radiolabeled isotrichodermin feeding was hydrolyzed. The ester at the 3-position of 3-ADN was hydrolyzed, the DON obtained was purified, and the DON radioactivity was counted. The ratio of radioactivity in 3-ADN before hydrolysis to the radioactivity in DON after hydrolysis was calculated and found to be 1.39:1. If the 3-acetyl of isotrichodermin had been converted to the 3-acetyl of 3-ADN with no physiological hydrolysis and reacylation at the 3-position, the ratio would have remained 3.5:1. Complete physiological hydrolysis would have given a ratio of 1:1. However, the result obtained indicates that ∼89% of the acetyl groups initially at the 3-position of ITD were lost during its conversion to 3-ADN by F. culmorum cells (Fig. 2). This result was very reproducible with various aliquots of doubly radiolabeled ITD-derived 3-ADN, with the values varying from 84 to 89% loss of acetate (Fig. 2). The result obtained with the doubly radiolabeled isotrichodermin was unexpected. We therefore decided to confirm it with isotrichodermin labeled with stable isotopes in the ring as well as the acetate in the 3-position. The method is less sensitive than radiolabeled experiments, but the locus of incorporation can be easily and accurately determined by 2H NMR. In addition, if indeed the 3- acetyl in isotrichodermin is not retained in its conversion to 3-ADN, then two other isotrichodermin derivatives, 3-deacetyl ITD and 3-oxo-EPT, could be substrates. We therefore had to prepare them with deuterium labeling. Their syntheses were accomplished in the following manner: the [4β,15-2H]3-deacetyl ITD (1, Fig. 3) was prepared as described previously (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was subsequently used for the synthesis of [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) and of [4β,15-2H]3-oxo-EPT (3, Fig. 3). In the first case, this necessitated an acetylation with [2H6]acetic anhydride and in the second case an oxidation of the 3-hydroxyl to a keto-group. After extensive purification and analyses by 1H and 2H NMR, the three deuterated compounds were ready to be fed to F. culmorum cultures (Table I., Table II.). -We have previously shown that feeding an excess of substrate enables us to accumulate biosynthetic intermediates that are otherwise undetected or present in minute quantities (5Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore fed in duplicate three different amounts of [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) to F. culmorum production cultures. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The size of the structures in Fig. 4 emphasizes the amounts fed. When small amounts of [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) were fed, 3-ADN was obtained with deuteriums only in the ring-positions at C-4 and C-15 and absolutely no deuteriums in the 3-acetyl group (4, Fig. 4 and Table III). This confirms our preliminary results with the radiolabeled compounds. The discrepancy between 100% loss of the 3-acetyl in the deuterium study versus 89% loss in the radiolabeled investigation emphasizes the relative sensitivity of the methods. The feeding with radiolabeled substrates uses trace amounts, and the detection via radioactivity is so sensitive that very small incorporations (11%) can be detected. On the other hand, the inferior sensitivity of deuterium labeling is compensated with definite determination of the site of incorporation, with no danger of easy contamination. When larger amounts of [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) were fed, the production of the end product 3-ADN was inhibited, and one of its known (5Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) biosynthetic intermediates, calonectrin (5, Fig. 4 and Table IV), accumulated. It is interesting to note that in this case two-thirds of the calonectrin obtained from the feeding had no deuteriums in the 3-acetyl group, whereas one-third retained the three deuteriums (Fig. 4 and Table IV). In addition, the isotrichodermin recovered from the feedings of excess substrate had the same distribution as the calonectrin; two-thirds had lost the deuteriums at C-3 (6, Fig. 4 and Table IV). This last result suggests that the loss of deuteriums in the 3-acetyl of isotrichodermin occurs at the initial stages of its metabolism to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (the first oxidation step at C-15) (Fig. 4 and Table IV). The almost complete loss of the 3-acetyl group in isotrichodermin in its in vivo conversion to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol led us to consider two other possible substrates: 3-deacetyl isotrichodermin (with a hydroxyl at C-3) or the isotrichodermin derivative with a ketone at C-3 (3-oxo-EPT). They were synthesized with deuteriums at positions 4β and 15 (1 and 3, Fig. 3) and fed to F. culmorum. The first observation on these two feedings was that the compounds inhibited considerably the production of the end products: 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol and sambucinol. For example, when 5 mg of [4β,15-2H]deacetyl isotrichodermin (1, Fig. 3) were fed, the only metabolites detected were the recuperated starting material and [4β,15-2H]isotrichodermin (7, Table IV). Nevertheless, enough 3-ADN and SOL were isolated from the 1- and 2.5-mg feedings. As expected in the feeding of both substrates, the sambucinol isolated contained no deuteriums. On the other hand, these deuterated isotrichodermin derivatives were incorporated into 3-ADN (4, Fig. 4), as could be easily observed from the deuterium NMR (Table III). -In order to determine the fate of the 3-acetyl group of isotrichodermin in its cell-free metabolism, doubly deuterated isotrichodermin (in the ring and in the 3-acetyl group), [2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD (2) was fed to a microsomal fraction of F. culmorum. After the incubation period, the extract was fractionated by HPLC (using program 3), and a major single peak was obtained (tR = 26.0 min). This new peak was purified by analytical HPLC. Proton and deuterium NMR established rigorously this compound to be 15-deacetylcalonectrin deuterated at positions 4 and 15 and at the C-3-O-acetyl position (8, Fig. 5 and Table V). Therefore, in the microsomes where isotrichodermin is only metabolized to 15-deacetylcalonectrin (8), the acetyl moiety is retained. Isotrichodermin was first detected as a metabolite of various Fusarium species including F. culmorum (4Greenhalgh R. Levandier D. Adams W. Miller J.O. Blackwell B.A. McAlees A.J. Taylor A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1986; 34: 98-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Investigating the sequence of appearance of metabolites in F. culmorum by the kinetic pulse-labeling method (9Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15348-15353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the disappearance of isotrichodermin with time coincided with the formation of 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol and had no effect on the biosynthesis of sambucinol (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, radiolabeled and deuterated isotrichodermin (ring-deuterated) were very good precursors (27-30% total incorporations) (3Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6713-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nonincorporation of the 3-acetyl group of isotrichodermin into the 3-acetyl of the product 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) might suggest that 3-deacetyl isotrichodermin is in fact the real biosynthetic intermediate. This compound was therefore synthesized with two deuteriums at C-4 and C-15 (1, Fig. 3). Our feeding experiments in this work showed that 1 inhibited the growth of the fungi and was incorporated into the product 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol but at a much lower extent than isotrichodermin. In addition, 3-deacetyl isotrichodermin was never isolated as a natural product, whereas isotrichodermin is produced by F. culmorum (4Greenhalgh R. Levandier D. Adams W. Miller J.O. Blackwell B.A. McAlees A.J. Taylor A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1986; 34: 98-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A second possibility for a biosynthetic intermediate close to isotrichodermin but with no acetyl at C-3 was 3-oxo-12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene. Similarly, the labeled 3-oxo-12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (also not a natural metabolite) (3, Fig. 3), inhibited the growth of F. culmorum and was incorporated into 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol to a lower extent than isotrichodermin. Therefore, isotrichodermin must be the biosynthetic precursor, but on its metabolism to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol it loses its acetate and is reacetylated de novo by an acetylase. The biosynthetic step where the initial deacetylation occurs has been determined by the feeding of excess doubly deuterated isotrichodermin (two deuteriums positioned on the ring and three on the 3-acetyl). As we have seen previously (5Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when an excess of substrate is fed, the metabolic turnover is repressed, causing the enzymes to be saturated. This results in the accumulation of intermediates generally found in trace amounts. Therefore, when we fed an excess of doubly deuterated isotrichodermin (Fig. 4), the end product 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol was not detected. The starting material (6, Fig. 4) was recovered with two deuteriums on the ring and partly deuterated on the 3-acetyl. In addition, calonectrin, a known precursor of 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (5Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Sauriol F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14992-15000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also obtained with the same label distribution (5, Fig. 4): the deuteriums in the ring are retained, but two-thirds of the deuteriums on the 3-acetyl have been lost. We therefore may conclude that the deacetylation occurs at an early step, either just prior to the first oxygenation step at C-15 or thereafter. We therefore decided to reinvestigate this result with an in vitro system. In Vivo and in Vitro Metabolism of ITD (Figs. 2, 4, and 5)−In vivo experiments have demonstrated that during metabolism the 3-acetyl of ITD is mostly lost in its metabolism to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Feeding with large amounts of precursor (Fig. 4) suggested that the deacetylation occurs after the first hydroxylation at C-15. Due to the importance of this result, we wanted to confirm it with a different experiment. We know that with microsomal preparations, the main product obtained is 15-deacetyl isotrichodermin (15-DAC) (6Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. Nikolakakis A. Sauriol F. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with no traces of the end product, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol. This is probably due to the extensive washing of the microsomes during their preparation, hence disappearance of the enzymes required for the subsequent steps between 15-DAC and 3-ADN. Since 15-DAC is the end product, we could investigate with this system the fate of the 3-acetyl in the metabolism of isotrichodermin. Feeding the doubly labeled isotrichodermin ([2′-2H3, 4β,15-2H]ITD, indicated as 2 in Fig. 3) to a cell free preparation could demonstrate if the 3-deacetylation occurs prior to the 15-hydroxylation or after. The result shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates that in the 15-DAC derived from that feeding, the 3-acetyl of ITD is fully retained. Thus, this experiment with microsomal preparation confirms what was suggested by the in vivo experiments, namely that the loss of acetate occurs after the first oxygenation step of isotrichodermin. The loss of acetate is probably linked to the acetate turnover, i.e. it is hydrolyzed off and then is put back on again using ATP and coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA, which can acetylate deacetylated intermediates in the cell. We have shown earlier that DON can be acetylated to 3-ADN by F. culmorum cells (9Zamir L.O. Devor K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15348-15353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have seen that ITD is a better precursor than deacetylated ITD. Therefore, despite the existence of an acetyl exchange mechanism, the acetyl seems to have an essential role that is not clear presently."

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the CKS1 gene codes for a protein, p18CKS, suppressor of Cdc28 mutations (Reed, 57Reed S.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 529-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), while in the early studies on HeLa cells (Draetta et al., 18Draetta G. Brizuela L. Potashkin J. Beach D. Cell. 1987; 50: 319-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), Cdc2 protein kinase was found associated with a 13-kDa polypeptide. More recently, the human homologues of the p13suc1/p18CKS proteins, p9CKShs1/p9CKShs2, have been identified as the products of the genes CKShs1 and CKShs2, respectively (Richardson et al., 58Richardson H.E. Stueland C.S. Thomas J. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1332-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). According to these findings p13suc1 and its homologous proteins appear to be as ubiquitous as the p34 family of kinases, thus suggesting the essential role of p13suc1 as components of the cell cycle control mechanisms.The relevance of the biological function of p13suc1 has been advanced by several intriguing observations. The p34cdc2-p13suc1-Sepharose complex is active as protein kinase (Brizuela et al., 13Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4362-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

In addition, p13suc1 inhibits the entry into mitosis in Xenopus extracts (Dunphy et al., 22Dunphy W.G. Brizuela L. Beach D. Newport J. Cell. 1988; 54: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and, microinjected in mammalian oocytes, inhibits the entry into meiosis (Gavin et al., 28Gavin A.C. Vassalli J.D. Cavadore J.C. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 33: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro activation of the inactivated precursor of MPF (pre-MPF) from Xenopus oocytes results in tyrosine dephosphorylation of the p34cdc2 protein. p13suc1 completely blocks p34cdc2 tyrosine 15 dephosphorylation and kinase activation (Dunphy and Newport, 21Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed in which a Cdc2-specific tyrosine kinase and phosphatase, as well as p13suc1, might interact to regulate the Cdc2 kinase (Dunphy and Newport, 21Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).Although these data suggest that p13suc1 plays a significant role in the regulation of p34cdc2, there is no clear agreement about the involvement of the suc1 product and its homologues in the steps of p34cdc2 biochemistry (Dunphy, 20Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Fluorescence methods provide a useful tool to obtain dynamic and static information on the structure of proteins and macromolecular assemblies (Beechem and Brand, 6Beechem J.M. Brand L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar; Eftink, 23Eftink M.R. Suelter C.H. Methods of Biochemical Analysis.Vol 35. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 127-205Google Scholar). In addition, these techniques can be used to investigate molecular interactions in the living cell. In this paper, we describe steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence studies on the intrinsic fluorescence of p13suc1. A characterization of its photophysics and hydrodynamic properties is presented. These information, combined with the recent characterization of the protein crystal structure (Endicott et al., 26Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Brown N. Rasmussen B. Nurse P. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), will be useful for future studies on p13suc1 structure/function relationships.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe E. coli [BL21(DE3)]LysS strain expressing the suc1 gene product was kindly provided by Dr. Giulio Draetta (Mitotix, Cambridge, MA). Bacterial growth, induction by isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and purification of the protein were performed following the procedure described by Brizuela et al. (12Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A final gel filtration step on a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (80 × 2 cm, flow rate: 0.1 ml/min) eluted with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mM EDTA was added to obtain full homogeneity of the purified material. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (Lowry et al., 48Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by a bicinchoninic acid-based method (Smith et al., 62Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18442) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Routinely, purity of p13suc1 was evaluated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac 208TP column (25 × 1.0 cm) eluted in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at increasing acetonitrile concentrations (0-80% of a 70:30, acetonitrile:H2O solution). The protein had an apparent Mr of ∼13.100 on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) as measured on a Bio-Rad model GS-670 videodensitometer and using the Molecular Analyst software package. Isoelectrofocusing was performed on LKBAmpholine® PAGplates with a LKB apparatus. The measured pI = 5.84 was in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of pI = 5.80 obtained from the SWISS-PROT data base (ExPASy.WWW) of the Geneva University. The NH2-terminal region of the protein, blotted onto Pro-Blot (Applied Biosystem), was sequenced by Edman degradation up to 43 residues in a pulsed liquid Applied Biosystem model 476A protein sequencer. The obtained, 2-43, 2The NH2-terminal methionine residue was not detected by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing (C. Menna, personal observation) as confirmed by Endicott et al. (26Endicott J.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). primary structure shared 100% identity with the nucleotide sequence of suc1 as determined by Hindley et al. (34Hindley J. Phear G. Stein M. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Bacto-Agar, Tryptone, and yeast extract were obtained from Difco. isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was obtained from Fluka. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, leupeptin, tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma and stored following the instructions of the supplier.Sephadex G-25, G-50, Sepharose CL-6B, and Sephacryl S-100 HR were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.Fluorescence Spectroscopy MeasurementsTechnical steady-state fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were obtained with a Jasko FP-550 spectrofluorometer using excitation and emission slit widths of 5 nm each. Fluorescence polarization measurements were performed using two Polacoat dichroic polarizers (Jasko FP-2010) installed in the excitation and the emission paths to record the relative intensities for the four combinations of vertically (v) and horizontally (h) polarized beams (Ivv, Ivh, Ihh, Ihv). The resulting steady-state emission anisotropy, <r>, was calculated as follows, 〈r〉=Ivv⋅G−IvhIvv⋅G+2Ivhwhere G = Ihh/Ihv is the grating correction factor introduced to normalize for the different sensitivity of the system to detect the horizontally and vertically polarized emission (Azumi and McGlynn, 4Azumi T. McGlynn S.P. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 2413-2420Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar; Paoletti and LePecq, 54Paoletti J. LePecq J.-B. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 31: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Fluorescence quenching measurements of p13suc1 were performed using acrylamide and potassium iodide as quenchers. With acrylamide, protein samples at increasing concentrations of the quencher were prepared by adding small aliquots from a 8 M stock solution. At the excitation wavelength of 295 nm no corrections for the optical density of the samples were required. With KI, protein samples at increasing concentrations of the quencher were prepared at constant ionic strength using KCl as a counter-ion. Stock solutions of KI (4 M) were freshly prepared in the presence of ≈1 × 10−4M Na2S2O3 to avoid 3− formation (Lehrer, 46Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Fluorescence decay experiments were recorded at increasing quencher concentrations (0-0.42 M). Curves were collected at three emission wavelengths (330, 340, and 350 nm) for each concentration of the quencher, and the data were analyzed by the global procedure. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence results were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation (Lehrer, 46Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar; Lakowicz, 42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar), F0F=1+KSV[Q]=τ0τwhere F0 and F and τ0 and τ are the fluorescence intensity and the lifetime in the absence and the presence of the quencher Q. KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant and represents a measure of the quenching of the fluorescence intensity. In the case the total emitted fluorescence can be separated in discrete intensity contributions, f(i), from distinct species, the overall KSV is the weighted sum of the specific quenching constant/species, Σf(i)KSV(i). The expression for the collisional quenching ratio is, then, given by Equation 3 (Laws and Contino, 44Laws W.R. Contino P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 448-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), F0F=∑i=1nf(i)1+KSV(i)[Q]−1=τ0τ(Eq. 3) while in the presence of a static contribution and considering the sphere of action model, the complete expression for the quenching ratio is given by Equation 4 (Laws and Contino, 44Laws W.R. Contino P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 448-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), F0F=∑i=1nf(i)1+KSV(i)[Q]eV(i)(Q]−1(Eq. 4) where V(i) represent the volume of the species-associated interaction sphere.Moreover, KSV is equal to kqτ0; where kq is the apparent rate constant for the collisional quenching process and represents a measure of the overall accessibility of the fluorophores. Relative bimolecular collisional quenching constants, kq(τi), can be obtained for each fluorescence lifetime. In this case, a simple modified form of the Stern-Volmer plot of 1/τi versus [Q] directly provide the kq(τi) as the slope of the graph.Nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements were obtained by the time-correlated single photon counting method (O'Connor and Philips, 53O'Connor D.V. Philips D. Time Correlated Single Photon Counting. Academic Press, London1984Google Scholar) using a model 5000U Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer (IBH Consultants Ltd., Glasgow, United Kingdom). Hydrogen (0.50 bar) was used as a filling gas of the thyratron-gated flash lamp. The instrument response function determined from a scattering solution of Ludox was typically 1.4 ns (full width at half-maximum) using a Hamamatzu R3235 photomultiplier. The channel width was 0.106 ns/channel, and data were collected in 1024 channels. The decay of the total fluorescence intensity (104 counts in the peak) was recorded under “magic angle” conditions (Badea and Brand, 5Badea M.G. Brand L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 378-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and the wavelength-dependent time shift of the photomultiplier (Wahl et al., 66Wahl Ph. Auchet J.C. Donzel B. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1974; 45: 28-32Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was determined in a separate experiment using melatonin (Sigma) as a standard. To resolve the excitation (EDAS) and the emission (DAS) spectra associated with the individual decay constants (Knutson et al., 38Knutson J.R. Walbridge D.G. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4671-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), experimental curves were collected for equal dwell times and by stepping the excitation and the emission monochromators in increments of 2-5 nm. Time-resolved parameters were normalized with respect to the relative excitation and emission steady-state spectra.The decay of the emission anisotropy of p13suc1 was measured as described previously (Badea and Brand, 5Badea M.G. Brand L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 378-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), using a combination of two Polacoat dichroic polarizers parallel (vv) and crossed (vh) with respect to the excitation and the emission paths. A depolarizer DPU-15 (Optics for Research, Caldwell, NJ) placed in front of the emission monochromator slit was used to minimize “G-factor” corrections (G ≈ 1.007). Decay curves of the polarized components of the emitted fluorescence were separately collected within the same experimental time course by alternative collection of the “Ivv” and “Ivh” curves, plus the exciting function “lamp”.Fluorescence Data AnalysisFluorescence intensity decay. The decay data were analyzed by nonlinear least square method (Knight and Selinger, 1971; Grinvald and Steinberg, 30Grinvald A. Steinberg I.Z. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), and decay curves collected at multiple emission wavelengths were simultaneously analyzed according to the global procedure described by Knutson et al. (39Knutson J.R. Beechem J.M. Brand L. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1983; 102: 501-507Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). When appropriate, the decay constants were linked across spectral regions. The experimental data (counts/channel > 0.5% of the total counts in the peak) were analyzed assuming that the fluorescence decay follows a multiexponential law, I(t)=∑i=1nαi⋅e−t/π(Eq. 5) where the relative amplitudes, αi, and the decay constants, τi, are the numerical parameters to be recovered. The best fit between the theoretical curve and the data was evaluated from the plot of residuals, the autocorrelation function of the residuals, and the reduced Chi-square (χ2) (Bevington, 9Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Science. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1969Google Scholar). The DAS and the EDAS were obtained by the global procedure (Beechem et al., 7Beechem J.M. Ameloot M. Brand L. Anal. Instr. 1985; 14: 379-402Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the fluorescence relative intensities at the various wavelengths were expressed as αi·τi products. Percent fractional contributions of each decay component to the total emitted fluorescence was, then, calculated as, αi·τi/Σαi·τi.Fluorescence Anisotropy DecayThe anisotropy decay can be described by a sum of discrete exponential terms as follows (Wahl, 65Wahl Ph. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 175: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar; Tao, 64Tao T. Biopolymers. 1969; 8: 609-632Crossref Scopus (469) Google Scholar), r(t)=∑i=1nβi⋅e−t/ϕi(Eq. 6) where the sum of the pre-exponential terms βi is the anisotropy in the absence of rotation, r0, and the Φi values are the rotational correlation times. For a globular protein that approximates the spherical symmetry, the anisotropy decay is reduced to a single exponential. Under this condition the correlation time can be related to the hydrated volume of the rotating protein, V, by the Einstein-Stokes relation, Φ = Vη/kT; where η is the solvent viscosity, k is the Boltzman constant, and T is the experimental temperature. Alternatively, complex anisotropy decays suggest deviation from simple spherical symmetry.The parameters for the decay of anisotropy, r(t), were recovered from the analysis of the experimental decays of the polarization components, Ivv(t) and Ivh(t), by the system analysis approach introduced by Gilbert (29Gilbert C.W. Cundall R.B. Dale R.E. Time-resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy in Biochemistry and Biology. Plenum Press, New York1983: 605-606Google Scholar). According to this method, the fitting functions to obtain r(t) are the following (Ameloot et al., 1Ameloot M. Hendrickx H. Herreman W. Pottel H. Van Cauwelaert F. Van Der Meer W. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 525-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar; Cross and Fleming, 14Cross A.J. Fleming G.R. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 45-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), Ivv(t)=1/3s(t)⋅(1+2r(t))(Eq. 7) Ivh(t)=1/3s(t)⋅(1−r(t))(Eq. 8) where s(t) represents the decay of the total fluorescence intensity and does not depends on molecular reorientation. Common parameters were linked, and η/T terms were introduced in the analysis of anisotropy decay curves obtained at multiple temperatures.The variability of the decay parameters was evaluated by determining the joint confidence intervals (Johnson, 35Johnson M.L. Biophys. J. 1983; 44: 101-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence experiments were run at least twice using different preparations of p13suc1. The inter-experimental variability was less than 10′.Circular DichroismCircular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. Protein samples (0.15 mg/ml) in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA were measured in a 1-mm path length cell at 0.5-nm interval. Eight spectra were accumulated and averaged to achieve appropriate signal-to-noise ratios. The fractional composition of the secondary structure of p13suc1 in terms of α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil was evaluated according to the procedure described by Andrade (1993). According to that procedure, neural network analysis of the protein topological map in the 200-230 nm wavelength range was performed using the k2d.PC software.RESULTSThe isolated protein resulted homogeneously pure as judged by the amino acids sequence of its 2-43 NH2-terminal region, by high performance liquid chromatography, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by the measure of its pI (see “Materials and Methods”).Circular DichroismThe CD spectra of p13suc1 recorded at 20°C (curve 1), at 56°C (curve 2), and at 20°C after incubation at 100°C for 10 min (curve 3) is presented in Fig. 1. The data were recorded in the 180-300 nm spectral range. The protein was dialyzed overnight against 50 mM phosphate buffer, 2 mM EDTA, at pH 7.4, to remove Tris-HCl. From these data a secondary structure composition of 23%α-helix, 19%β-sheet, and 58% random coil was obtained for the native protein at 20°C. At 56°C, an expected loss of ordered secondary structure is observed. However, when the spectrum is recorded at 20°C, with a sample previously incubated at 100°C, a small fraction of secondary structure is recovered and the intensity of the aromatic band (235 nm) is completely restored to the native level.Steady-state Intrinsic Fluorescencep13suc1 contains two tryptophan (Trp-71 and Trp-82) and seven tyrosine residues (Tyr-27, Tyr-31, Tyr-36, Tyr-38, Tyr-55, Tyr-85, and Tyr-103). The steady-state emission spectra of the intrinsic fluorescence of p13suc1 recorded under native and denaturing conditions are presented in Fig. 2. Under native conditions, emission spectra were obtained exciting the protein in both the tryptophan, 295 nm (curve 1), and the tyrosine, 275 nm (not shown), absorption bands. No differences of the steady-state emission spectra profiles were observed, suggesting a very poor contribution of the tyrosine residues. The maximum of the fluorescence intensity was centered at 336 nm, as expected for chromophores partially buried inside the protein. In 4.0 M GdnHCl, curve 2, the emission spectrum of p13suc1 was shifted to 355-360 nm, and its intensity was decreased of approximately 70%. Higher guanidinium concentrations (6.0 M) did not cause further effects on the fluorescence spectrum. Emission spectra were also recorded in the absence of GdnHCl, at 56°C, curve 3; at 20°C, by cooling the same sample, curve 4; and finally at 20°C, with a sample previously incubated at 100°C for 10 min, curve 5. These data suggest that, up to 56°C, the structural transitions induced on p13suc1 by heat are mostly reversible and even more severe temperature treatments do not denature the protein completely.Fig. 2Steady-state emission spectra of the intrinsic fluorescence of p13suc1. The native protein (0.1 mg/ml) was dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, at 20°C, in the absence (solid line 1) and the presence of 4.0 M GdnHCl (solid line 2). Emission spectra were also recorded in the absence of GdnHCl: at 56°C (dotted line 3), at 20°C by cooling the same sample (dotted line 4), and at 20°C with a sample incubated at 100°C for 10 min (dotted line 5).
