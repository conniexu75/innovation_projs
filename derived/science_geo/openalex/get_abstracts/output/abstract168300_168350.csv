https://openalex.org/W1593759117,"Treatment of cocaine addiction is hampered by high rates of relapse even after prolonged drug abstinence. This relapse to compulsive cocaine use can be triggered by re-exposure to cocaine, by re-exposure to stimuli previously associated with cocaine or by exposure to stress. In laboratory rats, similar events reinstate cocaine seeking after prolonged withdrawal periods, thus providing a model to study neuronal mechanisms underlying the relapse to cocaine. The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including drug addiction. The active ingredient of marijuana, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, activates the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) reward system and has rewarding effects in preclinical models of drug abuse. We report here that the synthetic cannabinoid agonist, HU210 (ref. 13), provokes relapse to cocaine seeking after prolonged withdrawal periods. Furthermore, the selective CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716A (ref. 14), attenuates relapse induced by re-exposure to cocaine-associated cues or cocaine itself, but not relapse induced by exposure to stress. These data reveal an important role of the cannabinoid system in the neuronal processes underlying relapse to cocaine seeking, and provide a rationale for the use of cannabinoid receptor antagonists for the prevention of relapse to cocaine use."

To identify genes downstream of p53 that might mediate these effects, we assessed global patterns of gene expression following 5-FU treatment of isogenic cells differing only in their p53 status. The gene encoding mitochondrial ferredoxin reductase (protein, FR; gene, FDXR) was one of the few genes significantly induced by p53 after 5-FU treatment. The FR protein was localized to mitochondria and suppressed the growth of colon cancer cells when over-expressed. Targeted disruption of the FDXR gene in human colon cancer cells showed that it was essential for viability, and partial disruption of the gene resulted in decreased sensitivity to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. These data, coupled with the effects of pharmacologic inhibitors of reactive oxygen species, indicate that FR contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis through the generation of oxidative stress in mitochondria."

There are increasing lines of evidence that NF-κB/Rel activity is controlled to a great extent by its phosphorylation state. In this study, we demonstrated that RelA physically associated with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunit A (PR65). Both the N- and C-terminal regions of RelA were responsible for the PP2A binding. RelA co-immunoprecipitated with PP2A in melanocytes in the absence of stimulation, indicating that RelA forms a signaling complex with PP2A in the cells. RelA was dephosphorylated by a purified PP2A core enzyme, a heterodimer formed by the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) and PR65, in a concentration-dependent manner. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A at lower concentration, increased the basal phosphorylation of RelA in melanocytes and blocked the dephosphorylation of RelA after interleukin-1 stimulation. Interestingly, PP2A immunoprecipitated from melanocytes was able to dephosphorylate RelA, whereas PP2A immunoprecipitated from melanoma cell lines exhibited decreased capacity to dephosphorylate RelA in vitro. Moreover, in melanoma cells in which IκB kinase activity was inhibited by sulindac to a similar level as in melanocytes, the phosphorylation state of RelA and the relative NF-κB activity were still higher than those in normal melanocytes. These data suggest that the constitutive activation of RelA in melanoma cells (Yang, J., and Richmond, A. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 4901–4909) could be due, at least in part, to the deficiency of PP2A, which exhibits decreased dephosphorylation of NF-κB/RelA.

For example, tumor necrosis factor-α induces phosphorylation of RelA at serine 536 by IKK (18Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) and at serine 529 through casein kinase II (19Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have suggested that phosphorylation of NF-κB transcription factors, including RelA and p50, enhances DNA binding ability (20Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 21Li C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In vivo, the inducible phosphorylation on NF-κB is correlated with dimerization, release from IκB, nuclear translocation, or activation of the transcription function of NF-κB (19Wang D.

Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Inhibition of interleukin-1-stimulated RelA phosphorylation by mesalamine is accompanied by decreased transcriptional activity of NF-κB (23Egan L.J. Mays D.C. Huntoon C.J. Bell M.P. Pike M.G. Sandborn W.J. Lipsky J.J. McKean D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26448-26453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).The phosphorylation of NF-κB transcription factors is regulated not only by protein serine/threonine kinases, but also by protein serine/threonine phosphatases. Compared with the well established mechanisms for the phosphorylation of NF-κB transcription factors, the mechanisms underlying the dephosphorylation of these transcription factors are still poorly understood. Four major classes of protein phosphatases have been described, include PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), and PP2C. PP2B is calcium-dependent, and PP2C is magnesium-dependent, whereas PP1 and PP2A are not dependent upon divalent cations. PP1 and PP2A are widely expressed in mammalian cells and are involved in the regulation of signaling pathways by a mechanism of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation with a variety of protein kinases (24Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The predominant form of PP2A in cells is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme. The core components (core enzyme) of all trimeric forms are the 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and a 65-kDa regulatory subunit (PP2Aa or PR65). In addition, there are several associated variable regulatory subunits (B subunits) that bind to the core enzyme and confer substrate specificity to its dephosphorylating activity (24Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). PP2A has been shown to form a complex with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (25Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1997; 280: 1258-1261Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar); casein kinase (26Heriche J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); p21-activated kinase-1 and -3 and p70 S6 kinase (27Westphal R.S. Coffee Jr., R.L. Marotta A. Pelech S.L. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); and certain G-protein-coupled receptors such as the β2-adrenergic receptor and CXCR2 (28Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 29Fan G.-H. Yang W. Sai J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16960-16968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, a previous study demonstrated that the SV40 small t antigen, which associates with PP2A and specifically inhibits its phosphatase activity, enhances the activity of NF-κB (30Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment of Jurkat cells with okadaic acid (OA), a specific inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, induces translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and activation of NF-κB (31Thevenin C. Kim S.J. Rieckmann P. Fujiki H. Norcross M.A. Sporn M.B. Fauci A.S. Kehrl J.H. New Biol. 1990; 2: 793-800PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potential involvement of PP2A in the regulation of NF-κB signaling. To determine whether PP2A plays a direct role in the regulation of phosphorylation of RelA, we examined the interaction of RelA with PP2A. Here, we provide evidence that RelA physically interacts with the PR65 subunit of PP2A. The purified PP2A core enzyme directly dephosphorylates RelA. Moreover, the activity of PP2A in melanoma cells is lower than that in melanocytes, which partially contributes to the higher phosphorylation state of RelA and the increased NF-κB activity in the melanoma cells.RESULTSTo determine which protein phosphatase is involved in the dephosphorylation of RelA, phosphatase inhibitors were tested for the inhibition of RelA dephosphorylation. We took advantage of inhibitors with different phosphatase specificities: OA, an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A (33Giannini E. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4055-4064PubMed Google Scholar, 34Durfee T.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14549-14557Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of the NHEMs to interleukin-1 resulted in a more robust phosphorylation of RelA (Fig.1, lane 2) compared with the untreated cells (lane 1). This phosphorylation was reversed after withdrawal of the agonist and recovery of the cells at 37 °C for another 1 h (Fig. 1, lane 3). Pretreatment with OA (50 nm) greatly inhibited the dephosphorylation of RelA (Fig. 1, lane 4), whereas pretreatment with cyclosporin A (400 nm) or tautomycin (500 nm) did not block the protein dephosphorylation (lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, treatment of the cells with OA increased the basal phosphorylation of RelA (Fig. 1, lane 7).To examine whether PP2A associates with RelA, a GST pull-down assay was performed. GST-RelA fusion proteins were incubated with NHEM cell lysate, and the coprecipitated PP2Ac and PR65 subunits were detected by Western blotting using antibodies against PP2Ac and PR65, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, PR65 and PP2Ac were coprecipitated with GST-RelA (lane 2), but not with GST alone (lane 1). The N-terminal truncated mutant forms of RelA (amino acids 155–551 and 354–551) bound an almost equal amount of the PP2A core enzyme (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5). However, a C-terminal truncated mutant of RelA (amino acids 1–305) failed to bind the PP2A core enzyme (Fig. 2, lane 4), whereas a further C-terminal truncated mutant of RelA (amino acids 1–155) retained the ability to bind to PP2A (lane 6), suggesting that PP2A may bind to both the C- and N-terminal regions of RelA and that the folding of RelA-(1–305) does not allow the N-terminal region of RelA to bind to PP2A. To assess which subunit of the heterodimeric PP2A core enzyme binds directly to RelA, GST fusion proteins of PR65 and PP2Ac were incubated with the cell lysate from Sk Mel 5 melanoma cells, and coprecipitated RelA was detected by Western blotting. The results demonstrated that RelA bound only to GST-PR65, but not to GST-PP2Ac (Fig. 3), suggesting direct interaction between RelA and PR65.Figure 2In vitro interaction of RelA with PP2A. GST alone or GST-RelA fusion proteins of wild-type and truncated mutant RelA were incubated with NHEM cell lysate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After washing, the beads were resuspended in loading buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Coprecipitated PR65 and PP2Ac were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PR65 and anti-PP2Ac antibodies, respectively. The membrane was initially stained with 0.1% Ponceau S solution (P 7170, Sigma) to confirm protein expression and equal loading.

If this interaction were one of enzyme/substrate, we postulated it would then be transient and therefore chose to use cross-linker to stabilize the proposed complex. To determine whether a functional complex consisting of RelA and the PP2A core enzyme could be detected in mammalian cells, NHEMs were treated with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), a cleavable cross-linker, or with disuccinimidyl suberate, a non-cleavable cross-linker; RelA was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate; and co-immunoprecipitated PP2A was detected by Western blotting under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig.4 A, in the cells treated with disuccinimidyl suberate, immunoprecipitation of RelA resulted in a high molecular mass band that was reactive to anti-PP2Ac antibody (lane 1), whereas in the cells treated with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), PP2A was also co-immunoprecipitated with RelA, but was separated from RelA under reducing conditions (lane 3). However, no detectable PP2A was co-immunoprecipitated with RelA in the cells without cross-linker treatment (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), suggesting a transient interaction of RelA with PP2A.Figure 4RelA associates with the PP2A core enzyme in melanocytes. A, NHEMs were treated with 2.5 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) or disuccinimidyl suberate for 30 min, and RelA was immunoprecipitated (IP) from the cell lysate with an anti-RelA antibody. Proteins were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Coprecipitated PP2Ac was blotted with an anti-PP2Ac antibody. The membrane was stripped and reblotted with an anti-RelA antibody. B, PP2Ac was immunoprecipitated from NHEM lysate with an anti-PP2Ac antibody (second lane). Preimmune mouse IgG1 (MAB002, R&D Systems) was used in parallel as a control (first lane). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.

The GST-RelA fusion protein was phosphorylated by IKKα·IKKβ immunoprecipitants from SK Mel 5 cells. The phosphorylated GST-RelA protein was then incubated with a purified PP2A core enzyme. As shown in Fig. 5, RelA was dephosphorylated by the purified PP2A core enzyme in a concentration-dependent manner.Figure 5In vitro dephosphorylation of RelA by the purified PP2A core enzyme. IKKα·IKKβ complexes immunoprecipitated from SK Mel 5 cells were incubated with 1 μg of GST-RelA protein in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min.

The reactions were terminated by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. The same membrane was blotted with an anti-RelA antibody to confirm equal loading.

Richmond A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4901-4909PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the genetic alteration of PR65 that has been found in melanoma cells and other cancer cells (39Calin G.A. di Iasio M.G. Caprini E. Vorechovsky I. Natali P.G. Sozzi G. Groce C.M. Barbanti-Brodano G. Negrini M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we postulated that PP2A in melanoma cells is functionally deficient in regulating the phosphorylation of RelA, resulting in hyperphosphorylation and constitutive activation of the transcription factor. To test this hypothesis, PP2A was immunoprecipitated from either melanocytes or melanoma cell lines, and the immunoprecipitants were tested for dephosphorylation of RelA phosphorylated by purified IKK. Interestingly, the dephosphorylation activity of PP2A in the melanoma cell lines Sk Mel 5 and WM 115 was decreased compared with that in NHEMs (Fig. 6).Figure 6Dephosphorylation of the RelA subunit by PP2A immunoprecipitated from melanocytes or melanoma cell lines. The purified GST-RelA protein was phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP in an in vitro specific kinase reaction with IKK immunoprecipitated from Sk Mel 5 melanoma cells. The 32P-labeled GST-RelA protein was incubated without (lane 1) or with PP2Ac immunoprecipitated (IP) from NHEMs (lane 2), Sk Mel 5 cells (lane 3), or WM 115 cells (lane 4) at 30 °C for 1 h. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. The membrane was blotted with an anti-PP2Ac antibody to confirm equal loading. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the hypothesis that the constitutive RelA activity in melanoma cells is attributed not only to the constitutive IKK activity (38Yang J. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4901-4909PubMed Google Scholar), but also to some other events such as the PP2A deficiency, the phosphorylation state of RelA and the relative NF-κB activity were measured in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines treated with the IKK inhibitor sulindac (40Yamamoto Y. Yin M.J. Lin K.M. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27307-27314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Sulindac (1 mm) treatment of Sk Mel 5 cells reduced the IKK activity to an equal or lower level than the kinase activity in NHEMs without sulindac treatment (Fig.7 A). However, the phosphorylation state of RelA in sulindac-treated Sk Mel 5 cells was still higher than that in NHEMs without sulindac treatment (Fig.7 B). Although sulindac treatment reduced the NF-κB activity, it remained significantly higher than that in NHEMs without sulindac treat (Fig. 7 C). These data suggest that the higher phosphorylation state and the relative activity of RelA in melanoma cells are due in part to the deficient PP2A activity.Figure 7IKK activity, RelA phosphorylation, and NF-κB activity in melanoma cells. A, Sk Mel 5 cells (but not NHEMs) were treated without or with sulindac (1 mm), and the IKKα·IKKβ complex was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of polyclonal anti-IKKα and anti-IKKβ antibodies and assayed for phosphorylation of a GST-IκBα-(1–54) substrate. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. B, Sk Mel 5 cells and NHEMs were treated without or with sulindac (1 mm) before being incubated with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 1 h. RelA was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-RelA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. The membrane was blotted with a monoclonal anti-RelA antibody to confirm equal loading. C, Sk Mel 5 cells and NHEMs were cotransfected with an NF-κB reporter construct as well as a β-galactosidase construct. 18 h after transfection, Sk Mel 5 cells (but not NHEMs) were treated without or with sulindac (1 mm) for 16 h, and then the total cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using the Dual-Light kit. The luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and is reported as -fold activation over the luciferase activity in NHEMs. Values shown are the means ± S.D. The data were analyzed using Student’s paired t test. *, p < 0.05 compared with the NF-κB activity in NHEMs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have provided evidence that PP2A plays an important role in the regulation of RelA phosphorylation by forming a complex with the transcription factor. The formation of this complex in the cells is probably transient since cross-linking was required to observe it. PP2A may interact with RelA through its regulatory subunit A, directly binding to RelA, because only the GST fusion protein of PR65 (but not that of PP2Ac) interacted with RelA in our experiments. We did not have a chance to examine the potential interaction of RelA with the B subunits of PP2A, which comprise several polypeptides that regulate PP2A activity and specificity. RelA is phosphorylated predominantly at the C-terminal serine residues, e.g. Ser-529 (19Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and Ser-536 (18Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether PP2A directly binds to those phosphorylation sites. However, studies on the interaction of PP2A with proteins such as protein kinase Cζ (25Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1997; 280: 1258-1261Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), casein kinase-2α (28Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and CXCR2 (31Thevenin C. Kim S.J. Rieckmann P. Fujiki H. Norcross M.A. Sporn M.B. Fauci A.S. Kehrl J.H. New Biol. 1990; 2: 793-800PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that PP2A binds to sites other than the phosphorylation sites in these proteins. The interaction of RelA with PP2A appears to be specific and functional because the dephosphorylation of RelA in vitro by the purified PP2A core enzyme was concentration-dependent, and the dephosphorylation of RelA was blocked by the lower concentration of OA (which predominantly inhibits PP2A), but not tautomycin (PP1 inhibitor) or cyclosporin A (PP2B inhibitor).In addition to RelA, another important subunit of NF-κB, p50, is also regulated by phosphorylation (21Li C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of p50 is required for phorbol ester- and hemagglutinin-induced nuclear translocation in Jurkat cells, and phosphorylated p50 accounts for most of the observed nuclear p50 population (41Li C. Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30089-30092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p50 protein has also been shown to increase affinity of formation and stability of p50·DNA complexes in vitro (41Li C. Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. J. Biol.

HAb18G/CD147 cDNA was transfected into human 7721 hepatoma cells to obtain a cell line stably expressing HAb18G/CD147, T7721, as demonstrated by Northern blot and immunocytochemical studies. 8-Bromo-cGMP (cGMP) inhibited the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry in a concentration-dependent manner in 7721 cells. The cGMP-induced inhibition was abolished by an inhibitor of protein kinase G, KT5823 (1 μm). However, expression of HAb18G/CD147 in T7721 cells decreased the inhibitory response to cGMP. A similar concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the Ca2+ entry was observed in 7721 cells in response to a NO donor, (±)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). The inhibitory effect of SNAP on the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry was significantly reduced in HAb18G/CD147-expressing T7721 cells, indicating a role for HAb18G/CD147 in NO/cGMP-regulated Ca2+ entry. Experiments investigating metastatic potentials demonstrated that HAb18G/CD147-expressing T7721 cells attached to the Matrigel-coated culture plates and invaded through Matrigel-coated permeable filters at the rate significantly greater than that observed in 7721 cells. Both the attachment and invasion rates could be suppressed by SNAP, and the inhibitory effect of SNAP could be reversed by NO inhibitor,N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. The sensitivity of the attachment and invasion rates to cGMP was significantly reduced in T7721 cells as compared with 7721 cells when cells were pretreated with thapsigargin. The difference in the sensitivity between the two cells could be abolished by a Ca2+ channel blocker, Ni2+ (3 mm). These results suggest that HAb18G/CD147 enhances metastatic potentials in human hepatoma cells by disrupting the regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry by NO/cGMP.

Yang Z. Mi L. Jiang J.L. Guo X.N. J. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 15: 34Google Scholar). HAb18G is abundantly expressed in human hepatoma tissues and on the cell surface of several highly metastatic hepatoma cell lines as detected by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibody against HAb18G (2Chen Z.N. Chin. J. Oncol. 1992; 14: 9-12Google Scholar, 3Ji Y. Chin. Med. J. 1991; 71: 369-372Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Chin. Med. J. 1991; 71: 362-365Google Scholar). HAb18G is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein of 60 kDa with an ectodomain consisting of two regions exhibiting the characteristics of the immunoglobulin superfamily (1Chen Z.N. Yang Z. Mi L. Jiang J.L. Guo X.N. J. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 15: 34Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of HAb18G is identical to that of CD147, which has recently generated a great deal of interest (5Stockinger H. Ebel T. Hansmann C. Koch C. Majdic O. Prager E. Patel D.D. Fox A. Horejsi V. Sagawa K. Shen D. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Leukocyte Typing VI. Garland Publishing, New York1997: 760-763Google Scholar). Other names for CD147 include human basigin, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN),1 and human leukocyte activation-associated M6 antigen (6Kanekura T. Miyauchi T. Tashiro M.

Homologues in other species include rat OX-47 antigen, mouse basigin or gp42, chicken HT7 molecules, and rabbit homologue (10Fossum S. Mallett S. Barclay A.N. Eur. J.

A role for CD147 as an adhesion molecule has been proposed, and it has been reported to bind to a variety of cell types including endothelial cells and fibroblasts (5Stockinger H. Ebel T. Hansmann C. Koch C. Majdic O. Prager E. Patel D.D. Fox A. Horejsi V. Sagawa K. Shen D. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Leukocyte Typing VI. Garland Publishing, New York1997: 760-763Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that HAb18G stimulates fibroblast cells to produce elevated levels of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (1Chen Z.N. Yang Z. Mi L. Jiang J.L. Guo X.N. J. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 15: 34Google Scholar), including MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, which are well known for prompting invasion of hepatoma cells (12Arii S. Mise M. Harada T. Furutani M. Ishigami S.

Hepatology. 2001; 34: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Limet al. found that EMMPRIN up-regulated MMP-1 mRNA expression, which was dependent on tyrosine kinase activity (15Lim M. Martinez T. Jablons D. Cameron R. Guo H. Toole B. Li J.D. Basbaum C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, substrates or ligands for CD147 or enzymes that modify CD147 are still not known. It is not clear whether CD147 (or HAb18G, basigin, EMMPRIN, M6, etc.) is directly involved in cell adhesion or as an adhesion signal transmitting molecule or a regulator of adhesion. The process of proliferation, invasion, and metastasis is a complex one that involves both the autonomy of the malignant cells and their interaction with the cellular and extracellular environments. The way in which tumor cells respond to cellular and extracellular stimuli is regulated through transduction of those signals and translation into cellular activities. A frequent common denominator of the different signal transduction pathways is cellular Ca2+ mobilization. Ca2+ has been shown to play a role in the regulation of proliferation, invasion, and metastatic potential (16Wasilenko W.J. Palad A.J. Somers K.D. Blackmore P.F. Kohn E.C. Rhim J.S. Wright Jr., G.L.

The motility and adhesion properties of several normal cell types have been shown to work through G protein-sensitive pathways, suggesting that this type of cell signaling may be involved in tumor invasion and metastasis (19Hauang A.J.

Extracellular matrix components, such as laminin, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and thrombospondin, also have been shown to stimulate tumor cell migration (22Aznavoorian S. stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5940-5948PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ appears to play a pivotal role in extracellular matrix-induced tumor cell migration as demonstrated in the A2058 human melanoma cells stimulated with type IV collagen and fibronectin (24Savarese D.M.F.

Ca2+ release from internal stores by either inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (e.g. with cholinergic agonists like carbachol) or by inhibition of the Ca2+ pump in the internal store (e.g. with thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid) stimulates a Ca2+ influx in nonexcitable cells, often referred to as “store-operated” or “capacitative” Ca2+ entry (30Putney Jr., J. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Several factors have been reported to modulate this Ca2+ entry, including small molecular weight G protein(s), serine/threonine phosphatase, tyrosine kinase or phosphatase, cAMP, NO, and guanosine 3′,5′-cGMP (31Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bischof G. Brenman J. Bredt D.S. Machen T.E. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Kwan H.Y. Huang Y. Yao X. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among these, NO and cGMP have received much attention recently. It has been proposed that NO and cGMP may play a key role in regulating Ca2+ entry into pancreas acinar cells (35Gukovskaya A. Pandol S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G350-G356PubMed Google Scholar, 36Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that the Ca2+ content of the internal stores apparently regulated NOS activity and subsequently NO and cGMP, which had a biphasic effect on restoring Ca2+ entry after it had been blocked by NOS/guanylate cyclase inhibitors. These experiments indicated that store-operated Ca2+ entry was regulated tightly by [cGMP]i. Negative regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry by cGMP via a protein kinase G-dependent mechanism has also been observed recently in other cell types including endothelial cells (34Yao X. Kwan H.Y. Chan F.C. Chan N.W. Huang Y. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, cGMP appears to play an absolutely crucial role in regulating store-operated Ca2+ entry. However, very little is known about the physiological importance of store-operated Ca2+ entry in tumor cells, and virtually nothing is known about the intracellular regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry involved in the process of cancer metastasis, although NO has been implicated in cancer metastasis through Ca2+-dependent mechanisms involving different MMPs (37Wu Y. Palad A.J. Wasilenko W.J. Blackmore P.F. Pincus W.A. Schechter G.L. Spoonster J.R. Kohn E.C. Somers K.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1915-1921PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated the presence of a NO-cGMP-regulated store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway in human hepatoma 7721 cells (38Jiang J.L., Yu, M.K. Chen Z.N. Chan H.C. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast to other highly metastatic hepatoma cells, 7721 cells have been shown to have lower metastatic activities and do not express HAb18G (2Chen Z.N. Chin. J. Oncol. 1992; 14: 9-12Google Scholar, 3Ji Y. Chin. Med. J. 1991; 71: 369-372Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Chin. Med. J. 1991; 71: 362-365Google Scholar). It appears that the expression of HAb18G is associated with high metastatic potencials of human hepatoma cells. The present study further explored the involvement of HAb18G/CD147 in regulating the Ca2+ entry signaling pathway and metastatic potentials by stably transfecting HAb18G into 7721 cells. We found that the expression of HAb18G/CD147 reduced the sensitivity of the store-operated Ca2+ entry to NO/cGMP and enhanced the metastatic potentials of human hepatoma cells. 8-Br-cGMP, (±)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP),N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and thapsigargin were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum, Geneticin (G418 sulfate), and Lipofectin transfection reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fura2/AM was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). TRIZOL for total RNA isolation was from Life Technologies, Inc., and ExpressHybTM hybridization solution for Northern blot was from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). All restriction endonucleases were purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI), and [32P]dCTP was fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG and Matrigel were obtained from Becton Dickinson Labware (Bedford, MA). Other reagents were from Sigma. The human 7721 hepatoma cells (obtained from the Institute of Cell Biology, Academic Sinica) were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2% l-glutamin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The expression vector pcDNA3-HAb18G was made in our laboratory. The human 7721 hepatoma cells were seeded onto 35-mm plates at a density of 1 × 105/plate. After cells were grown to 60–80% confluency, transfection was performed using Lipofectin transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 2 μg of expression plasmid DNA and 15 μl of Lipofectin transfection reagent in RPMI 1640 serum and antibiotic-free medium were incubated together for 45 min at room temperature to allow liposome-DNA complexes to form. The cells were washed and incubated with serum and antibiotic-free medium after the addition of liposome-DNA complexes for 8 h. The transfection solution was removed, and fresh medium with serum was added and incubated for another 48 h. Medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml) was added to the cells. The G418 selection medium was changed every 2–3 days, until Lipofectin-treated control cells died. After a 3-week culture in selection medium, the cells were cloned by clonal dilution. Total RNA was isolated from cells using trizol Reagent, and 20 μg was resolved on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Hybridization was done using HAb18G cDNA fragment as the probe in ExpressHybTM hybridization solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film for up to 2 days. Human hepatoma monoclonal antibody HAb18 was produced and characterized in our laboratory (39Chen Z.N. Liu Y.F. Yang J.Z. Reports on Monoclonal Antibody. 1989; 27: 33-36Google Scholar). 7721 and HAb18G-transfected T7721 cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in 15-cm cell culture dishes. Following attachment, coverslips were washed in PBS and then held in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 30 min. Methanol was removed, and the cells were immunostained. All further processing was carried out at room temperature. For immunostaining, the cells were rehydrated in PBS for 5 min and then were held in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h. The coverslips were rinsed briefly in PBS, incubated in a solution of the primary antibody HAb18 (1 μg/ml in blocking solution) for 1 h, and subjected to four 5-min PBS washes. The cells were then incubated with rat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate at 3 μg/ml in blocking solution for 1 h. Following five 5-min washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted in glycerol:water solution (v/v, 1:1) on glass slides. Fluorescence microscopy was taken on. [Ca2+]i was measured using Fura2/AM. The cells were loaded with the dye by incubation with 5 μm Fura2/AM for 45 min in dark at 37 °C in normal PBS (NPBS) containing 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. The cells were then washed and resuspended in NPBS. To start the experiment, the cells were pretreated with 4 μm thapsigargin for 20 min. Then the cells were washed with and maintained briefly in PBS containing no Ca2+ and 2 mm EGTA. Unless stated otherwise, the cells were pretreated with or without chemicals (i.e. 8-Br-cGMP or NiCl2) for 5 min. The fluorescent signal was monitored and recorded by an LS-50B luminescent spectrometer (Perkin Elmer). The excitation light at 340 and 380 nm was provided by a 150 W Xenon arc lamp (Perkin Elmer) and a filter wheel (Perkin Elmer) containing 340- and 380-nm interference filters (Perkin Elmer). The emitted fluorescence at 510 nm was collected by a photomultiplier tube and recorded. The wells of the 96-well culture plate were coated with Matrigel at a concentration of 5 μg/ml and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The coated wells were blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then washed with PBS. Cells suspension in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to the wells (2 × 104/well) and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30–60 min with or without test agents (i.e. 8-Br-cGMP, SNAP, or l-NAME). After removing medium and nonattached cells, 0.2% crystal violet was added for 10 min. The plate was gently washed with tap water and dried in air for 24 h. 0.1 ml of 5% SDS with 50% ethanol was added for 20 min, and then the plate was read at 540 nm. The chemotactic cell migration assay was performed using 24-well transwell units (COSTAR Corning Inc.) with an 8-μm pore size polycarbonate filter according to the method described by Mensing et al. (40Mensing H. Albini A. Krieg T. Pontz B.F. Muller P.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 33: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Each lower compartment of the transwell contained 600 μl of 0.5% fetal bovine serum as chemoattractant or 0.5% bovine serum albumin as negative control in RPMI 1640. Cells (1 × 105) in 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added into the upper compartment of the transwell unit and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After removing the cells from the upper surface of the membrane with a swap, cell numbers on the underside were determined using colorimetric crystal violet assay. The procedure for the chemotactic cell invasion test was the same as in the chemotactic cell migration assay, except that the upper side of polycarbonate filter was coated with Matrigel (5 μg/ml in cold medium) to form a continuous thin layer. Prior to the addition of cell suspension, the dried layer of Matrigel matrix was rehydrated with medium without fetal bovine serum for 2 h at room temperature, and the incubating time varied with a maximum of 72 h. Agents such as 8-Br-cGMP or SNAP were added in the upper compartment after the addition of cell suspension. When thapsigargin treatment assay was carried out, the cells were incubated with 4 μm thapsigargin for 20 min prior to addition of cell suspension. The cells remaining in the upper compartment were completely removed with gently swabbing. The number of cells invaded through the filter into the lower compartment was determined using colorimetric crystal violet assay. We have demonstrated in previous studies that store-operated Ca2+ entry in human 7721 hepatoma cells was negatively regulated by NO/cGMP (38Jiang J.L., Yu, M.K. Chen Z.N. Chan H.C. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of HAb18G, we transfected HAb18G cDNA into human 7721 hepatoma cells and cloned after G418 selection in the present study. A hepatoma cell line stably expressing HAb18G was obtained and named T7721. The expression of HAb18G in T7721 but not 7721 cells was demonstrated by Northern blot (Fig. 1 A) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1 B). Thapsigargin, a potent inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, was used to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores and induce Ca2+ entry from extracellular space. After treatment with 4 μmthapsigargin in Ca2+-free and 2 mmEGTA-containing medium for 20 min, the addition of 2 mmCaCl2 induced a rise in [Ca2+]ibecause of Ca2+ entry (Fig. 2). The thapsigargin-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was completely blocked by Ni2+ (3 mm), a potent blocker of Ca2+ entry that competes for Ca2+-binding sites (41Winegar B.D. Kelly R. Lansman J.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 97: 351-367Google Scholar), in both 7721 cells and T7721 cells (Fig. 2), confirming the presence of the store-operated Ca2+ entry in both cell types. cGMP, an activator of PKG, has been shown to regulate the store-operated Ca2+ entry (34Yao X. Kwan H.Y. Chan F.C. Chan N.W. Huang Y. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

The present study examined the effect of 8-Br-cGMP on the store-operated Ca2+ entry in both human 7721 and T7721 hepatoma cells. Fig. 3 shows that application of 8-Br-cGMP reduced the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i rise in 7721 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. 2 mm 8-Br-cGMP almost completely inhibited the Ca2+ entry with 96.9 ± 1.9% inhibition (Fig. 3, A and C). The cGMP-induced inhibition was reversed by a specific PKG inhibitor, KT5823 (1 μm) (Fig. 4). However, the inhibitory effect of 8-Br-cGMP on the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i rise was significantly attenuated in HAb18G-expressing T7721 cells with only 25.3 ± 13.1% inhibition observed at 2 mm 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 3, B andC).Figure 4Effects of PKG inhibitor on thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx. . The Ca2+ entry fluorescence ratios shown were obtained in cells without chemical treatment (control) or treated with 2 mm 8-Br-cGMP (cGMP) or both cGMP and 1 μm KT5823 (cGMP/KT5823). The cells were incubated in NPBS with 4 μm thapsigargin for 20 min. 2 mm 8-Br-cGMP or plus 1 μm KT5823 was introduced 5 min prior to the measurement. 1 mmCaCl2 was introduced to the medium to obtain the fluorescent signal of Ca2+ entry.

Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to investigate the involvement of NO in regulation of the store-operated Ca2+ entry using a NO donor, SNAP, to trigger production of endogenous cGMP. Similar to the effect of 8-Br-cGMP, SNAP inhibited the thapsigargin-indued Ca2+influx in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5), and the inhibitory response in 7721 was significantly greater than that observed in HAb18G-expressing T7721 cells, 48.3 ± 12.5% as compared with 19.8 ± 4.1% inhibition observed at 100 μm SNAP, respectively (p < 0.01; Fig. 5). HAb18G/CD147 is a potential adhesion molecule that has been shown to stimulate expression and release of MMPs through some kinase signaling pathways (1Chen Z.N. Yang Z. Mi L. Jiang J.L. Guo X.N. J. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 15: 34Google Scholar, 15Lim M. Martinez T. Jablons D. Cameron R. Guo H. Toole B. Li J.D. Basbaum C.

It is now widely acknowledged that some MMPs (such as MMP-2 and MMP-9) are regulated by NO-cGMP-Ca2+ signaling pathways (37Wu Y. Palad A.J. Wasilenko W.J. Blackmore P.F. Pincus W.A. Schechter G.L.

The present study tested the involvement of HAb18G and NO in regulating metastatic potentials of the human hepatoma cells by examining cell adhesion, migration, and invasion processes in vitro. We used Matrigel-coated plates and chambers as models for investigation of possible signaling pathways involved in extracellular matrix-induced metastatic processes. Matrigel is a solubilized basement membrane preparation containing almost all of the extracellular matrix components (46Kleiman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Hassell J.R. Star V.L. Cannon F.B. Laurie G.W. Martin G.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). The following studies were carried out with Matrigel as adhesion substratum. Fig. 6 A shows that after 30 min of incubation, a significant increase in the amount of cells attached to the Matrigel-coated plates, expressed as fractions of total seeded cells, was observed in HAb18G/CD147-expressing T7721 cells (53.4 ± 1.8%) as compared with 7721 cells (34.6 ± 0.6%,p < 0.001). We used Transwell chambers to investigate cell migration. The ability of HAb18G/CD147-expressing T7721 cells to migrate from one compartment to the other in the Transwell chambers (without Matrigel) was significantly greater than that of 7721cells, 36.4 ± 0.6% as compared with 19.8 ± 1.1% after 36 h, respectively (p < 0.001; Fig. 6 B) The Transwell chambers were also coated with Matrigel to assay for the ability of cells to invade through the reconstructed basement membrane. As depicted in Fig. 7, at various time intervals, the invasive potential, measured as fractions of total seeded cells invaded through the membrane, of HAb18G/CD147-expressing T7721 cells was significantly greater than that observed in 7721 cells (p < 0.05). We investigated the possible involvement of NO/cGMP in cell adhesion and invasion processes. Pretreatment of SNAP (200 μm) for 30 min significantly reduces the fraction of attached cells in both 7721 and T7721 cells by 34.6 ± 1.2 and 34.4 ± 5.0%, respectively (p > 0.05), and l-NAME (100 μm), a NOS blocker, reversed the effect of SNAP (Fig. 8). Invasion assay also showed that the fraction of cells invaded through Matrigel-coated filter was decreased by treatment with 8-Br-cGMP (2 mm) in both 7721 (31.1 ± 8.2%) and T7721 (17.6 ± 2.1%) (p < 0.05). These results indicated that NO/cGMP may be involved in the metastatic processes of hepatoma cells. As shown above, the store-operated Ca2+ entry was negatively regulated by NO/cGMP, and the sensitivity of the store-operated Ca2+ entry in T7721 cells to NO/cGMP was significantly reduced as compared with that in 7721 cells. However, although both cell attachment and invasive ability was significantly inhibited by either NO or cGMP, there seemed to be no significant difference between the two cell types in the sensitivity of their metastatic potentials to NO/cGMP treatment. (The inhibition rates on invasion were 13.0 ± 1.7 and 11.0 ± 1.4% in 7721 and T7721, respectiv"

Pretreatment of cells with these polyphenols inhibited UVB-induced PI3K activation. Furthermore, UVB-induced activation of Akt and ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6-K), PI3K downstream effectors, were also attenuated by the polyphenols. In addition to LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, pretreatment with a specific mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (Erks) kinase 1 inhibitor, U0126, or a specific p38 kinase inhibitor, SB202190, blocked UVB-induced activation of both Akt and p70 S6-K. Pretreatment with LY294002 restrained UVB-induced phosphorylation of Erks, suggesting that in UVB signaling, the Erk pathway is mediated by PI3K. Moreover, pretreatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6-K, inhibited UVB-induced activation of p70 S6-K, but UVB-induced activation of Akt did not change. Interestingly, UVB-induced p70 S6-K activation was directly blocked by the addition of (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate or theaflavins, whereas these polyphenols showed only a weak inhibition on UVB-induced Akt activation. Because PI3K is an important factor in carcinogenesis, the inhibitory effect of these polyphenols on activation of PI3K and its downstream effects may further explain the anti-tumor promotion action of these tea constituents.

Initially PI3K was a subject of interest because of its known ability to form complexes with some viral oncoproteins (29Sugimoto Y. Whitman M. Cantley L.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Later, expression of a retroviral oncogene, v-p3k, which codes for the catalytic subunit (p110α) of PI3K, was shown to induce oncogenic transformation in chicken cells (31Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D.

The oncogenic transformed phenotype was observed in mammalian fibroblasts transfected with the constitutively active p110α (32Klippel A. Escobedo M.A. Wachowicz M.S. Apell G. Brown T.W.

In fact, alterations or amplifications of PI3K have been detected in a number of human malignances (33Shayesteh L. Lu Y. Kuo W.L. Baldocchi R. Godfrey T. Collins C. Pinkel D. Powell B. Mills G.B.

The serine/threonine proto-oncogene Akt (also known as protein kinase B or PKB) was first identified as the cellular homolog of the transforming oncogene product v-Akt (37Bellacosa A. Testa J.R.

It plays an important role in the regulation of a wide spectrum of cellular signaling events including apoptosis, glycogen metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell cycle regulation (38Coffer P.J.

Alteration and down-regulation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN/MMAC1, which directly antagonizes PI3K, are frequently observed in a number of cancers (27Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R.

The mutations are thought to be associated with Akt activation as well as an increased level of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (45Dahia P.L. Aguiar R.C. Alberta J. Kum J.B. Caron S. Sill H.

An accumulation of evidence suggests that ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6-K) is also a crucial effector of PI3K in response to growth factors (47Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Activation of p70 S6-K regulates a variety of cellular functions involved in the mitogenic response including protein synthesis, translation of specific mRNA species, cell cycle regulation, and cell motility (48Chou M.M.

The p70 S6-K is constitutively activated in small cell lung cancer cells, and anchorage-independent proliferation in these cells is mediated through an Akt and p70 S6-K-dependent pathway (51Moore S.M. Rintoul R.C. Walker T.R. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Sethi T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5239-5247PubMed Google Scholar). Kl-Ras-mediated transformation is inhibited by blocking both the MAP kinase and p70 S6-K pathways (52Fukazawa H. Uehara Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2104-2107PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of p70 S6-K has been shown to be essential for the UVB-induced increase in MMP-1 and MMP-3 proteins in human dermal fibroblasts (53Brenneisen P. Wenk J. Wlaschek M. Krieg T.

The polyphenols from green tea and black tea, (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and theaflavins, respectively, are generally considered to be the most effective components for inhibition of carcinogenesis (56Huang M.T.

The most widely recognized biological properties of tea polyphenols are their antioxidant activity in scavenging reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (62Wiseman S.A. Balentine D.A. Frei B. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1997; 37: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of their anti-tumor promotion effects might be related to their ability to block signal transduction pathways leading to carcinogenesis (57Dong Z. Ma W. Huang C. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4414-4419PubMed Google Scholar, 58Ahmad N. Gupta S. Mukhtar H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 63Mukhtar H. Ahmad N. Proc.

Ma W.Y. Huang C. Yang C.S. Bowden G.T. Miyamoto K. Dong Z. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of the tea polyphenols in UVB-induced carcinogenesis may result from the blocking of these signal transduction pathways. In the present study, we investigated the effects of tea polyphenols on UVB-induced activation of the PI3K and its downstream effectors, which are critical factors in carcinogenesis. Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and gentamicin were from Whittaker Biosciences (Walkersville, MD); l-glutamine was from Life Technologies, Inc.; the PI3K inhibitor LY29402 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); the p70 S6-K inhibitor rapamycin, the p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190, and the MAP kinase/Erk kinase specific inhibitor U0126 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); the Akt immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit and S6 kinase assay kit were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); c-Jun fusion protein, Akt antibody, and phospho-specific Akt (Thr308 or Ser473) antibody, p70 S6-K antibody, and phospho-specific p70 S6-K (Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424) antibody, c-Jun (Ser63) antibody, and PhosphoPlus p44/42 MAP kinase, p38 kinase, and JNK kinase antibody kits were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA); phospho-JNKs antibody (G-7) and agarose conjugated with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); and phosphatidylinositol was from Sigma. Dominant negative mutants of JNK1 were generous gifts from Dr. Roger J. Davis (65Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). EGCG (purity > 98%) was a gift from Dr. Yukihiro Hara of Mitsui Norin Co. (Fujieda, Japan). Theaflavins (a mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3′-gallate, theaflavin-3,3′-digallate, and unknowns, accounting for 21, 30, 15, 28, and 6%, respectively) were gifts from the Thomas J. Lipton Co. (Englewood Cliffs, NJ). UVB irradiation was performed on serum-starved monolayer cultures utilizing a transluminator emitting UVB (66Huang C. Ma W. Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27753-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The source of UVB is a bank of four Westinghouse F520 Lamps (National Biological, Twinsburg, OH) at 6 J/S/m light in the UVB range. Approximately 10% of the remaining radiation from the F520 Lamp was in the UVA region (320 nm). Although almost no UVC leakage occurs, the UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB exposure chamber fitted with a Kodak Kodacel K6808 filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm. This lamp is one of the most frequently used UVB sources for the study of carcinogenesis. The International Agency for Research on Cancer refers to this lamp as a source emitting mainly UVB irradiation for the studies of cancer induction in animals. UVB irradiation was measured using the UVX radiometer from UVP (UVX-31). The JB6 mouse epidermal cell line Cl 41 and its stable transfectants, Cl 41 CMV-neo and the dominant negative mutant of JNK1 were grown at 37 °C in MEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. The dominant negative mutant of JNK1 subcloned into a mammalian expression vector plasmid, CMV-neo, was transfected into JB6 Cl41 cells by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The stable transfectants were obtained by selection for G418 resistance (300 μg/ml) and further confirmed by activity assays. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (64Nomura M. Ma W.Y. Huang C. Yang C.S. Bowden G.T. Miyamoto K. Dong Z. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, JB6 Cl 41 cells and its stable transfectants were cultured to 80% confluence. The cells were starved in 0.1% FBS MEM for 48 h at 37 °C. Then the media were changed to fresh 0.1% FBS MEM, and the cells were incubated for another 2–4 h at 37 °C. Before the cells were irradiated with UVB, they were incubated with or without LY294002, PD98059, SB202190, rapamycin, EGCG, or theaflavins for 1 h. Then the cells were exposed to UVB (4 kJ/m2) and subsequently incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of inhibitors or tea polyphenols. The cells were then lysed, and immunoblot analysis was performed by using antibodies against total Akt, p70 S6-K, Erks, JNKs, or p38 kinase proteins or the phospho-specific antibodies against their phosphorylated proteins. Antibody-bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECF Western blotting kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed using the Storm 840 Scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). PI3K activity was assayed as described previously (35Huang C. Schmid P.C. Ma W.Y. Schmid H.H. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4187-4194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were treated with UVB (4 kJ/m2) as described above. The cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmaprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin). The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was incubated with 20 μl of agarose conjugated with a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed twice with each of the following buffers: 1) PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate; 2) 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5m LiCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate; and 3) 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The beads were incubated for 5 min on ice in 20 μl of buffer 3, and then 20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (previously sonicated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaH2PO4) was added. After 5 min at room temperature, 10 μl of the reaction buffer were added (50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), and the beads were incubated for an additional 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 4 n HCl and 130 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). After vortexing for 30 s, 30 μl of the chloroform phase was spotted onto 1% potassium oxalate-coated silica gel H plates (previously baked at 110 °C for 1 h). The plates were developed in choloroform/methanol/NH4OH/H2O (60:47:2:11.3) and dried at room temperature. Radiolabeled spots were quantified using the Storm 840 scanner (Molecular Dynamics). The cells were treated with UVB (4 kJ/m2) as described above. The cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm microcystin). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant fractions were incubated with a phospho-specific JNKs antibody with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. Then, protein A/G plus agarose was added, and the incubation continued for another 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of 200 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min using 2 μg of c-Jun as substrate for JNKs. The phosphorylated protein was detected by immunoblotting using a phospho-specific antibody. The cells were treated with the inhibitors or tea polyphenols before irradiation with UVB (4 kJ/m2), lysates were prepared from the cells, and the immunoprecipitation was carried out using 4 μg of Akt1/PKBα PH domain antibody or 3 μg of anti-p70 S6-K antibody as described above. The enzyme-immune complex was washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and once with 100 μl of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT). For the Akt kinase assay, the enzyme immune complex was added to 10 μl of assay dilution buffer, 10 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 0.1 mmAkt substrate peptide, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and for the p70 S6-K assay, it was added to 20 μl of assay dilution buffer, 10 μl of inhibitor mixture, 50 μm S6 kinase substrate peptide, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and centrifuged, and then 30 μl of the supernatant fraction was transferred onto p81 phosphocellulose paper and allowed to bind for 30 s. The p81 papers were washed three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid and then washed once in acetone, and γ-32P incorporation was measured by scintillation counting. The cells were treated with UVB (4 kJ/m2) and lysed, and the immunoprecipitation was carried out using 4 μg of anti-Akt1/PKBα PH domain or 3 μg of anti-p70 S6-K antibody, and the enzyme-immune complex was washed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and with 100 μl of assay dilution buffer as described above. For the Akt kinase assay, the enzyme immune complex was added to 10 μl of different concentrations of tea polyphenols in assay dilution buffer, 10 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 0.1 mm Akt substrate peptide, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and for the p70 S6-K assay, it was added to 20 μl of different concentration of tea polyphenols in assay dilution buffer, 10 μl of inhibitor mixture, 50 μm S6 kinase substrate peptide, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction and measurement were performed as described under “Akt and p70 S6-K Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay.” Significant differences in the kinase activities were determined by using both Student's t test and Welch's t test. Exciting developments have recently implicated PI3K as an important factor in carcinogenesis (27Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6094"
https://openalex.org/W2078654057,"Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and COX-1 play an important role in prostacyclin production in vessels and participate in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, which is crucial in cholesterol biosynthesis. Recently, cholesterol-independent effects of statins have been described. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, mevastatin and lovastatin, on the production of prostacyclin and the expression of COX in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Treatment of cells with 25 μm mevastatin or lovastatin resulted in the induction of COX-2 and increase in prostacyclin production. Mevalonate, the direct metabolite of HMG CoA reductase, and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate reversed this effect. GGTI-286, a selective inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferases, increased COX-2 expression and prostacyclin formation, thus indicating the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins in the down-regulation of COX-2. Furthermore, Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of the Rho GTP-binding protein family, the Rho selective inhibitor C3 transferase, and Y-27632, a selective inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinases, targets of Rho A, increased COX-2 expression whereas the activator of the Rho GTPase, the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, blocked interlukin-1α-dependent COX-2 induction. These results demonstrate that statins up-regulate COX-2 expression and subsequent prostacyclin formation in human aortic smooth muscle cells in part through inhibition of Rho.

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). In this way statins are clinically useful for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis (2Bellosta S.

However, some of their beneficial effects in therapy seem unrelated to the decrease in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol.By modulating the initial part of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, statins decrease the level of numerous important intermediate compounds including isoprenoids that contain geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Isoprenoids are lipid attachments involved in posttranslational modification of some proteins such as the γ subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins, the small G proteins Ras, and Ras-like proteins such as Rho, Rap, Rab, or Ral (4Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Statins can thus modulate various biological or physiological mechanisms.Cyclooxygenases are involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane (TX) A2 (6Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). In vascular biology, the two major products of COX are TXA2, which is mainly formed by the constitutive form of COX, COX-1 in activated platelets, and prostacyclin or PGI2, which is mainly produced in vascular cells by COX-1 and the inducible form of COX, COX-2 (7Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. DeWitt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 8McAdam B.F. Catella-Lawson F. Mardini I.A. Kapoor S. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). TXA2 participates in platelet aggregation and vascular contraction, whereas PGI2 acts as an anti-aggregant for platelets and a vasodilator. PGI2plays an important role in vascular physiology as illustrated by the therapeutic effect of stable analogs of PGI2 such as iloprost (9FitzGerald G.A. Charman W.N. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1206-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets from patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia are characterized by hypersensitivity to various aggregating agents. Notarbartolo et al. (10Notarbartolo A. Davi G. Averna M. Barbagallo C.M. Ganci A. Giammarresi C. La Placa F.P. Patrono C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) have shown that simvastatin decreased platelet aggregation in hypercholesterolemic subjects and supported a decrease in the thromboxane platelet production, although the underlying mechanism of the statin effect on platelet function remains unclear.In this study, we demonstrated in human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMC) that two different statins, mevastatin and lovastatin, increased COX-2 expression and PGI2 formation. We further demonstrated using selective inhibitors of geranylgeranyltransferases and modulators of Rho GTPases that geranylgeranylated proteins such as Rho seem to be responsible for COX-2 down-regulation, which is prevented by statins.DISCUSSIONWe have shown for the first time that inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, lovastatin and mevastatin, increase the expression of COX-2 in human aortic smooth muscle cells. We confirmed the implication of the mevalonate pathway and isoprenoids in the negative modulation of the expression of COX-2 by demonstrating that the direct metabolite of HMG CoA reductase, mevalonate and the isoprenoid, GGPP, reversed the induction of COX-2 by statins and that GGTI-286, the inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferases, induced COX-2 as for statins. Our results suggest that geranylgeranylated proteins are involved in the down-regulation of COX-2. Although COX-2 expression has been reported to implicate activation of farnesylated proteins such as Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras, farnesylation does not seem important in the present study (29Subbaramaiah K.

On the other hand, squalene, the precursor of cholesterol, did not modify COX expression, suggesting that regulation of cellular cholesterol level is not involved in this effect. Our results are different from those reported by Inoue et al. (33Inoue I. Goto S. Mizotani K. Awata T. Mastunaga T. Kawai S. Nakajima T. Hokari S. Komoda T. Katayama S. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) who showed that some statins reduce the level of inflammatory elements in human umbilical vein endothelial cells such as IL-1, IL-6, and COX-2. Falke et al. had also demonstrated a moderate inhibition of the release of prostacyclin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and bovine aortic smooth muscle cells in culture (34Falke P. Mattiasson I. Stavenow L. Hood B. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 64: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The divergence in the regulation of COX-2 expression might be cell type- and species-dependent or also related to the class of statins (33Inoue I. Goto S. Mizotani K. Awata T. Mastunaga T. Kawai S. Nakajima T. Hokari S. Komoda T. Katayama S. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The participation of vascular COX-2 in inflammation is still ambiguous. In our study, the increase in the expression of COX-2 might reflect either an adverse pro-inflammatory role of statins on vasculature or a positive effect if COX-2 expression in vessels were considered as beneficial in participating for instance in physiological functions or anti-inflammatory processes. Although COX-2 expression is detected in atherosclerotic plaque where it is distributed in the intima and media (35Baker C.S. Hall R.J. Evans T.J. Pomerance A. Maclouf J. Creminon C. Yacoub M.H.

Med. 1984; 310: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), the consequence of endothelial and smooth muscle cell increase in COX-2 expression is still a matter of debate. An increase in urinary prostacyclin derivatives has been shown recently in two murine models of atherosclerosis, ApoE-deficient mice and low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice on a high fat diet (37Pratico D. Cyrus T. Li H. FitzGerald G.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 3823-3826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Pratico D. Tillmann C. Zhang Z.B. Li H. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3358-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Selective inhibition of COX-2 failed to decrease the extent of atherosclerosis in these models suggesting that COX-2, although expressed in the atherosclerotic lesions, does not participate in its progression (38Pratico D. Tillmann C. Zhang Z.B. Li H. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3358-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Little is known about the roles of PGI2 and PGE2 on vessels. PGI2 and PGE2inhibit vascular proliferation and cell-cell interaction (39Moncada S. Gryglewski R. Bunting S. Vane J.R. Nature. 1976; 263: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar, 40Bornfeldt K.E. Campbell J.S. Koyama H. Argast G.M. Leslie C.C. Raines E.W. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In normal volunteers, COX-2 contributes to the formation of PGI2 in vivo since selective inhibitors of COX-2 decreased its systemic formation (8McAdam B.F. Catella-Lawson F. Mardini I.A. Kapoor S. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Laminar shear forces have also been demonstrated to increase COX-2 expression in cultured endothelial cells (41Topper J.N. Cai J. Falb D. Gimbrone M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). As suggested recently by FitzGerald and Patrono, PGI2 may be part of a homeostatic defense mechanism limiting the consequences of platelet activation in vivo (42FitzGerald G.A. Patrono C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Vascular PGE2 has also been reported to inhibit the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 (43Bishop-Bailey D. Burke-Gaffney A. Hellewell P.G. Pepper J.R. Mitchell J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although this prostaglandin is considered to have pro-inflammatory effects. This suggest that COX-2-dependent release of PGE2 could have a regulatory role in limiting inflammatory responses and consequently have a protective role in cardiovascular disease (44Bishop-Bailey D. Hla T. Mitchell J.A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 3: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, statin therapy might increase the vasodilator, anti-thrombotic, or anti-inflammatory properties of the vascular wall by increasing PGI2 and PGE2 in a COX-2-dependent manner. Whether this regulation occursin vivo following statin administration and is similarly important in all vascular beds remains to be seen.Our results are comparable with those described recently on the modulation of expression of nitric oxide synthases by statins and geranylgeranylated proteins. Laufs and Liao (45Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), using GGPP, reported that treatment of human endothelial cells with mevastatin increased NOS-III expression as a result of inhibition of geranylgeranylation. Finder et al. (46Finder J.D. Litz J.L. Blaskovich M.A. McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Davies P. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13484-13488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) also showed that mevastatin and GGTI-298, another GGTI similar to GGTI-286, increased NOS-II expression in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Rho GTPases are geranylgeranylated proteins important in cell migration, contraction, cell shape, adhesion, and gene expression (23Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 24Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). It has been shown that one of these proteins, Rho, is linked to the activation, contraction, or proliferation of vascular cells (47Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Kaplan D.D. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rho (A or C) controls the expression of different proteins in vessels including NOS-II (48Muniyappa R. Xu R. Ram J.L. Sowers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1762-H1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NOS-III (45Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), TGFβ (49Park H.J. Galper J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11525-11530Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and pre-pro-endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression (50Hernandez-Perera O. Perez-Sala D. Navarro-Antolin J. Sanchez-Pascuala R. Hernandez G. Diaz C. Lamas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2711-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 51Hernandez-Perera O. Perez-Sala D. Soria E. Lamas S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In our system,C. difficile toxin B and CNF1, selective inhibitor and activator of all Rho GTPases, respectively, affected COX-2 expression either at the basal level or after activation by IL-1α. This suggests that Rho GTPases participate in COX-2 regulation. The further demonstration that both C. botulinum C3 transferase and Y-27632, the selective inhibitors of Rho and ROCK, respectively, induced COX-2 expression stressed the role of these proteins in the negative regulation of COX-2 expression and PGI2 formation and that these geranylgeranylated small G proteins are one of the targets of statins.Since it has been described that induction of COX-2 in some cells could participate in the apoptosis process, we tested whether statins induced apoptosis in HASMC. Although it has been described that some statins could induce apoptosis or sensitize hASMC to death receptor-induced apoptosis (52Stark W.W. Blaskovich M.A. Johnson B.A. Qian Y. Vasudevan A. Pitt B. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L55-L63PubMed Google Scholar, 53Knapp A. Huang J. Starling G. Kiener P. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 152: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), careful examination of Hoechst 33342-stained cells showed no evidence of cell death under our conditions. Observation under phase contrast, however, evidenced some morphological changes with a slight increase in rounded cells that appear to become less adherent.The effect of statins on COX-2 expression was also noted in the presence of IL-1α, a cytokine important in the atherosclerotic vascular wall and largely described to activate COX-2 (17Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jones D.A. Carlton D.P. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A.

A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). We treated cells with IL-1α first to verify the normal induction of COX-2 in hASMC as reported previously (55Bernard C. Merval R. Lebret M. Delerive P. Dusanter-Fourt I. Lehoux S. Creminon C. Staels B. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 56Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) and to further check whether statins could modify COX-2 induction. We showed that these two statins increased COX-2 expression in the presence of IL-1α.The mechanism by which inhibition of Rho increases COX-2 expression is not clear. Rac1 has been shown to down-regulate Rho activation (57Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Signaling through IL-1 receptors implicates activation of Rac, which in turn is involved in the activation p38 MAP kinases and NF-κB, both of which are important in the regulation of COX-2 expression (23Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 58O. Neill L. Int. J. Clin. Lab.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The balance between these two GTPases might be important in determining gene expression, i.e. COX-2. Up-regulation of COX-2 is also induced by protein kinase A activation in response to prostaglandins for example in different cell types including macrophages, vascular cells, and hepatic stellate cells (60Barry O.P. Pratico D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 61Mallat A. Gallois C. Tao J. Habib A. Maclouf J. Mavier P. Preaux A.M.

In view of the results presented here, it may be of interest that protein kinase A is known to phosphorylate and inactivate Rho A (63Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and induce COX-2 (61Mallat A. Gallois C. Tao J. Habib A. Maclouf J. Mavier P. Preaux A.M. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol.

Further investigation is required to understand whether or not these mechanisms are involved in the regulation of COX-2 expression by statins and if they are similar in untreated and IL-1α-stimulated cellsIn the present study, statin did not modify the half-life of the mRNA of COX-2 in IL-1α-activated cells indicating that transcriptional regulation is essentially implicated in the induction of COX-2 by statins. Our results are similar to those reported for NOS-II where regulation at the transcriptional level has been demonstrated in response to Toxin B, C3 transferases (48Muniyappa R. Xu R. Ram J.L. Sowers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1762-H1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Y-27632 (64Chen H. Ikeda U. Shimpo M. Ikeda M. Minota S. Shimada K. Hypertension. 2000; 36: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) but different from those indicating that statins and Rho GTPase inhibitors could increase the stability of the NOS-III mRNA (45Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar,46Finder J.D. Litz J.L. Blaskovich M.A. McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Davies P. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13484-13488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, Slice et al. have demonstrated in NIH 3T3 cells that Gα13 is able to increase COX-2 promoter activity through activation of Rho A (65Slice L.W. Walsh J.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27562-27566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 66Slice L.W. Bui L. Mak C. Walsh J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data contrast with ours, which show an inhibition of COX-2 induction by Rho and Rho-associated kinases. This difference in the regulation of COX-2 might be cell-type and species dependent.We obtained increase in prostacyclin synthesis and COX-2 expression at high concentrations of lovastatin or mevastatin corresponding to 20–100 times the therapeutic doses. It seems that these concentrations are essential for the inhibition of geranylgeranylation of proteins,i.e. Rho GTPases. Previous studies have reported modification of protein expression using high concentrations of lovastatin or mevastatin in different cultured cells (45Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 46Finder J.D. Litz J.L. Blaskovich M.A. McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Davies P. Sebti S.M. J.

Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy to mention that some of these reported effects,i.e. the modulation of NOS-II and NOS-III expression, were further demonstrated in vivo in mice or rats treated with statins or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (68Laufs U. Gertz K. Huang P. Nickenig G. Bohm M. Dirnagl U. Endres M. Stroke. 2000; 31: 2442-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 69Shibata R. Kai H. Seki Y. Kato S. Morimatsu M. Kaibuchi K. Imaizumi T. Circulation. 2001; 103: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although we are not sure that the up-regulation of COX-2 by statins we describedin vitro will occur in vivo at lower concentration of statins, it remains interesting to test whether statins or direct inhibitors of Rho or the Rho kinases such as Y-27632 can modulate in vivo the expression of COX-2.Clinical trials of statin therapy showed an improvement in cardiovascular end points, which is incompletely explained by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol modifications. Cholesterol-independent mechanisms have been suggested to explain the beneficial effect of statins beyond their effects on low density lipoprotein cholesterol (70Rosenson R.S. Tangney C.C. JAMA (J. AM. MED. ASSOC.). 1998; 279: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Statins have also been reported to reduce stroke incidence (71Vaughan C.J. Delanty N. Stroke. 1999; 30: 1969-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, statins could be responsible for a large favorable effect on endothelial function, plaque architecture and stability, cellular adhesion, migration and proliferation, thrombosis, and inflammation. The many in vitro and in vivodata support a role of Rho in vascular function and gene expression. Rho might be one of the potential targets of statins. Additional studies are required to understand how Rho is activated and how it regulates cellular functions under physiological conditions (72Laufs U. Liao J.K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,73Laufs U. Liao J.K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).In summary, by preventing geranylgeranylation of some proteins including Rho, statins increase the expression of COX-2 in human vascular smooth muscle cells. Inhibition of Rho activity in vessels may be important to restore vascular function and could account for the cholesterol-unrelated effects of statins. The competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA)1 reductase, also called statins, inhibit the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of cholesterol by blocking the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonate (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). In this way statins are clinically useful for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis (2Bellosta S. Bernini F. Ferri N. Quarato P. Canavesi M. Arnaboldi L. Fumagalli R. Paoletti R. Corsini A. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: S101-S109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 3Koh K.K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). However, some of their beneficial effects in therapy seem unrelated to the decrease in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. By modulating the initial part of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, statins decrease the level of numerous important intermediate compounds including isoprenoids that contain geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Isoprenoids are lipid attachments involved in posttranslational modification of some proteins such as the γ subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins, the small G proteins Ras, and Ras-like proteins such as Rho, Rap, Rab, or Ral (4Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Statins can thus modulate various biological or physiological mechanisms. Cyclooxygenases are involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane (TX) A2 (6Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). In vascular biology, the two major products of COX are TXA2, which is mainly formed by the constitutive form of COX, COX-1 in activated platelets, and prostacyclin or PGI2, which is mainly produced in vascular cells by COX-1 and the inducible form of COX, COX-2 (7Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. DeWitt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 8McAdam B.F. Catella-Lawson F. Mardini I.A. Kapoor S. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). TXA2 participates in platelet aggregation and vascular contraction, whereas PGI2 acts as an anti-aggregant for platelets and a vasodilator. PGI2plays an important role in vascular physiology as illustrated by the therapeutic effect of stable analogs of PGI2 such as iloprost (9FitzGerald G.A. Charman W.N. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1206-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets from patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia are characterized by hypersensitivity to various aggregating agents. Notarbartolo et al. (10Notarbartolo A. Davi G. Averna M.

The activity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN). Dephosphorylation of NFAT by CaN is required for NFAT nuclear localization. Current immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506 block CaN activity thus inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFAT and consequent cytokine gene transcription. The inhibition of CaN in cells outside of the immune system may contribute to the toxicities associated with cyclosporin A therapy. In a search for safer immunosuppressive drugs, we identified a series of 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole (BTP) derivatives that block Th1 and Th2 cytokine gene transcription. The BTP compounds block the activation-dependent nuclear localization of NFAT as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Confocal microscopy of cells expressing fluorescent-tagged NFAT confirmed that the BTP compounds block calcium-induced movement of NFAT from the cytosol to the nucleus. Inhibition of NFAT was selective because the BTP compounds did not affect the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors. Treatment of intact T cells with the BTP compounds prior to calcium ionophore-induced activation of CaN caused NFAT to remain in a highly phosphorylated state. However, the BTP compounds did not directly inhibit the dephosphorylation of NFAT by CaNin vitro, nor did the drugs block the dephosphorylation of other CaN substrates including the type II regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and the transcription factor Elk-1. The data suggest that the BTP compounds cause NFAT to be maintained in the cytosol in a phosphorylated state and block the nuclear import of NFAT and, hence, NFAT-dependent cytokine gene transcription by a mechanism other than direct inhibition of CaN phosphatase activity. The novel inhibitors described herein will be useful in better defining the cellular regulation of NFAT activation and may lead to identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmune disease and transplant rejection.

During this process, T cells express the autocrine growth factor interleukin 2 (IL-2), which promotes T cell proliferation by interacting with the IL-2 receptor, which is also up-regulated on activated T cells. The transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 gene has been extensively analyzed at the IL-2 promoter, a 275-bp region located upstream of the transcriptional start site of the gene (2Rothenberg E.V. Ward S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 3Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin.

Several transcription factors have been identified to bind elements within this regulatory region, including AP-1, NF-κB, and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (2Rothenberg E.V. Ward S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The transcription factor NFAT plays an essential role in IL-2 expression. Binding sites for NFATs have also been found within the promoter regions of several other cytokine genes, including IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor α, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and γ-IFN (4Rao A.

NFAT is a complex composed of a cytoplasmic subunit and an inducible nuclear component comprised of AP-1 (Fos/Jun) family members. At least four structurally related NFAT cytoplasmic subunit members, NFATp/NFAT1, NFATc/NFAT2, NFAT3, and NFATX/NFATc3/NFAT4, have been identified (5Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Immediately N-terminal to the DNA-binding domain is a second conserved module of ∼300 residues known as the NFAT homology (NFAT-h) region. The N terminus of NFAT, including the NFAT-h region, regulates nuclear/cytoplasm trafficking in response to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. In resting T cells, the protein is retained in the cytoplasm and its NFAT-h domain is heavily phosphorylated. Engagement of the TcR or treatment of cells with the Ca2+ ionophore activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr phosphatase, calcineurin. CaN dephosphorylates the NFAT-h domain, resulting in translocation of NFAT to the nucleus (9Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). The clinically important immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporin A and FK506, act by binding to their respective immunophilins, cyclophilin and FKBP12 (9Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). The immunophilin-drug complex binds to CaN and inhibits CaN phosphatase activity, thus preventing the dephosphorylation and translocation of NFAT to the nucleus (10Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E.

As a substrate of CaN, NFAT is a secondary target of the action of these immunosuppressive drugs. NFAT inhibition is believed to account, at least in part, for the transcriptional inhibitory activity of these immunosuppressants. Both CsA and FK-506 have been shown to be effective in preventing organ graft rejection in the clinic (13Morris R.E. Busuttil R.W. Klintmalm G.B. Transplantation of the Liver; New Immunosuppressive Drugs. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1995: 760-786Google Scholar). In addition, CsA has been shown to be beneficial in reducing joint erosion and disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis patients (14Ferraccioli G.F. Bambara L.M. Ferraris M. Perpignano G. Cattaneo R. Porzio F. Accardo S. Mattara L. Zoppini A. Benucci M. Ostuni P.A. Pasero G. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1997; 15 Suppl. 17: S83-S89PubMed Google Scholar, 15Thomson A.W. Carroll P.B. McCauley J.

However, side effects observed with the clinical use of both of these compounds, notably nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, diabetogenicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity, have markedly reduced their impact (16Fung J.J. Alessiani M. Abu-Elmagd K. Todo S. Shapiro R. Tzakis A. Van Thiel D. Armitage J. McCauley J. Selby R. Starzl T.E. Transplant. Proc. 1991; 23: 3105-3108PubMed Google Scholar). These side effects are likely to be caused by the pleiotropic metabolic effects these agents exert through binding to immunophilins and inhibiting CaN (or immunophilin peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity) in cells outside the immune system (17Ho S.F.

The identification of NFAT as a molecular target in T cell activation suggests a more direct, molecular based approach to the development of immunosuppressive agents with the potential for improved efficacy and reduced side effects. One of the approaches toward the identification of novel immunotherapeutics is to identify low molecular weight entities that selectively target the NFAT transcription factor without inhibiting the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, CaN. In this communication we describe the identification and molecular characterization of a novel series of NFAT regulators that exert their biological effects via a mechanism that does not involve inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, CaN. The human IL-2 promoter containing the DNA sequence from −325 to +24 (20Flanagan W.M. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 399-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by polymerase chain reaction from human genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) and subcloned into pT7-Blue (Novagen, Madison, WI). DNA was isolated from individual colonies. Clones expressing the correct DNA sequence were identified, and the IL-2 promoter fragment was isolated as a Bgl II/Hin dIII fragment and ligated to Bgl II/Hin dIII-digested pRC/RSV (Invitrogen). This ligation replaced the RSV promoter of pRC/RSV with the IL-2 promoter to generate pRC/IL-2. The firefly luciferase gene plus an SV40 intron were isolated from pGL2-Basic (Promega) by digestion withHin dIII and Hpa I. pRC/IL-2 was digested withXba I. The cohesive ends were made blunt by fill-in with polymerase I Klenow fragment and then digested with Hin dIII. The purified Hin dIII/Hpa I luciferase fragment was ligated to the blunt-Xba I/Hin dIII pRC/IL-2 to generate pIL-2-Luc. For permanent cell lines, Jurkat E6.1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were transfected with linearized pIL-2-Luc plus linearized pMEP4, using electroporation as previously described (21Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Mattila P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Clones were selected for resistance to 400 μg/ml hygromycin, and a stably transfected cell line, Jurkat 7:E10,E2 (abbreviated Jurkat E2), was created. Jurkat E2 cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin and 500 μg/ml geneticin. Prior to assay, Jurkat E2 cells were resuspended at 4 × 105cells/ml in RPMI 1640 plus 5% fetal bovine serum (lacking antibiotics) and stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 2 μm ionomycin and placed in 96-well microtiter plates in a final volume of 200 μl/well. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C (5% CO2) in a humidified incubator and pelleted by centrifugation. The media was aspirated, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 20 μl of cell lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane N,N,N ′,N ′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 100 μl of luciferase reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.8), 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP was added to the cell lysate, and chemiluminescence was measured with a luminometer. Normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by standard procedure. Briefly, 50 ml of peripheral blood was obtained from normal donors on the morning of each assay. The heparinized blood was mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density centrifugation at 400 ×g over Histopaque-1077 (Sigma). PBMCs (1 × 106 cells/ml) were added to 96-well microtiter plates previously coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (400 ng/ml, BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Soluble anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (200 ng, BD Biosciences) was added to each well, and the cell cultures were incubated for 24 h. Supernatants were harvested, and IL-2 levels were determined by ELISA as described below. 100 μl of 5 μg/ml monoclonal murine anti-human IL-2 antibody (BIOSOURCE International) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline was added to 96-well Maxisorb plates (Nunc) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed four times with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (wash buffer) and blocked with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mmNaN3 (diluent-blocking buffer) for 1–3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed and recombinant human IL-2 was diluted (at 10,000, 5,000, 2,500, 1,250, 625, 312.5, 156.25, 78, 39, and 20 pg/ml) in diluent-blocking buffer. Tissue culture supernatant at various dilutions was added at 100 μl/well in triplicate. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed four times with wash buffer. 100 μl of rabbit anti-human IL-2 (10 μg/ml, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by four washes and the subsequent addition of 100 μl of 1:2000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2(BIOSOURCE International). After 1 h the plates were washed four times and 100 μl of para nitrophenol phosphate (Southern Biotech or Sigma) at 1 mg/ml in buffer was added. Color development was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min before the addition of 50 μl of 2 n NaOH. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). IL-2 concentrations were calculated using SoftMax (Molecular Devices) based on the IL-2 standard solutions. 50 ml of peripheral blood was obtained from four normal, unrelated donors on the morning of each assay. The heparinized blood was mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation at 400 × g over Histopaque-1077 (Sigma). Responder cells from two individuals were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium at 400 × g for 10 min. The remaining PBMCs (stimulator cells) were treated with 25 μg/ml mitomycin C (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C (5% CO2, 100% humidity) and washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were cultured in medium consisting of RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine (Sigma), 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 25 units/ml penicillin and 25 μg/ml streptomycin. Mixed leukocyte reactions were performed in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) in a volume of 220 μl to include 20 μl of reference immunosuppressant or culture medium, 100 μl of responder cells (1 × 106 cells/ml), and 100 μl of stimulator cells (0.5−1 × 106 cells/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C (5% CO2, 100% humidity) for 4 days. On day 4, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well during the last 6 h of culture. Cultures were harvested onto glass-fiber filter mats using a 96-well harvester (Tomtec, Hamden, CT). [3H]Thymidine uptake was measured by direct β-counting using a Matrix 9600 β-counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Test compounds were added to appropriate wells on 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning Glass Works) in 20 μl of supplemented RPMI 1640. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were added to each well in 100-μl volumes (final cell concentration equal to 5 × 104cells/well). After 15 min, 100 μl of 5 μg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma) in supplemented RPMI 1640 was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2. On day 3, plates were pulsed with 0.5 μCi/well tritiated thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 6 h, plates were harvested on a Tomtec 96-well harvester. Glass filter mats were counted on a Matrix 9600 direct β counter (Packard Instrument Co.). 5 × 107 Jurkat cells were used for nuclear extract preparation per experimental point. The cells were washed and treated for 30 min at 37 °C with compound or vehicle control. The treated cells were then stimulated for 3 h at 37 °C with 20 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin. The cells were washed once in 50 ml of cold PBS. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed once in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.8, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml antipain, 0.3 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.3 mg/ml pepstatin A) and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (buffer A plus 0.05% Nonidet P-40). The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 315 μl of buffer C (50 mm HEPES pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol). 35 μl of 3 m ammonium sulfate was added and mixed for 30 min in the cold room. The viscous solution was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min. 280 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and an equal volume of 3 m ammonium sulfate was added, mixed, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The precipitated nuclear extract was pelleted at 100,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 50 μl of buffer C. The nuclear proteins were desalted by passage over a Bio-Rad P6DG column. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. The binding reactions were carried out with 10 μg of nuclear extract in a solution consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mg of poly(dI-dC). The protein solutions were incubated at room temperature for 45 min with 0.2-0.5 ng of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides used in these assays include IL-2 promoter sites for NFAT (−285 to −256), GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT; AP-1 (−157 to −141), TTCCAAAGAGTCATCAG; and NF-κB, AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC. The samples were electrophoresed on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N-terminal regulatory domain (residues 1–415) of NFAT1 (GFP·NFAT1-(1–415)) was cloned and expressed in CHO cells. Cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of GFP·NFAT1-(1–415) fusion peptide in CHO cells was monitored by time-lapse microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 UV laser scanning confocal microscope and a × 10 objective lens. The cells, grown in coverslip chambers, were placed onto a temperature-controlled stage and maintained at 37 °C throughout the experiment. GFP fluorescence was excited using the 488 nm line of a krypton/argon laser and visualized using a 522 nm bandpass filter. The microscope software was set to automatically acquire images at intervals of 30 s to 3 min. We examined the ability of drug compounds to inhibit ionomycin-stimulated translocation of GFP·NFAT1-(1–415) into the nucleus. The cells were incubated with drug for 20-45 min prior to adding ionomycin. Time-lapse imaging was begun immediately after adding ionomycin, and images were acquired every 30 s for 20 min. We also investigated whether the drugs could reverse ionomycin-induced nuclear translocation of GFP·NFAT1-(1–415). Ionomycin was added first, and cells were imaged every 2 min for 20 min to follow nuclear import of GFP·NFAT1-(1–415). BTPs, CsA, or vehicle was then added, and images were taken every 3 min for 90 min to follow the rate of nuclear export of GFP·NFAT1-(1–415). NFAT1-(1–415) was cloned into the pHM6 vector, and the construct was used to stably transfect CHO cells. 5 × 105 cells/test were washed and treated with either drug or vehicle control for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml ionomycin. After stimulation the cells were washed one time with cold PBS and resuspended in 2 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 2 mm AEBSF, 100 mg/ml aprotinin, 25 mm leupeptin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate). The cell suspension was freeze-thawed once and the lysate diluted four times in sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and NFAT1-(1–415) was detected by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-NFATc1 antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO). Starved COS cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping in buffer A (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for in vitro dephosphorylation assays. In vitro phosphatase assays were performed using phosphorylated GST-Elk-1c as a substrate.32P-Labeled GST-Elk-1c was prepared by incubating with active MEK1 and ERK1 in kinase buffer (18 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 50 μm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated GST-Elk-1c was purified with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and eluted in buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing 5 mm glutathione. Phosphorylated GST-pElk-1c (1 μg) was incubated with the indicated amount of cell lysate in a total volume of 30 μl of buffer A containing various phosphatase inhibitors as indicated. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C and then stopped by adding SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated Elk-1c was detected by autoradiography. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent CaN activity was determined by measuring the dephosphorylation of a radiolabeled peptide corresponding to a sequence in the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE; Asp-X 17-Glu). In some experiments the immunophilin, FK506 binding protein (FKBP)-12, was included in the assay. Phosphorylation of Asp-X 17-Glu peptide with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) was performed essentially as described (22Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Wheal H. Chad J. Molecular Neurobiology. Oxford University, Oxford, UK1991: 135-137Google Scholar) with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, purified from bovine heart. Compounds (doses between 1 nm and 100 μm) were preincubated with 10 nm purified bovine brain CaN in the presence of 100 nm purified bovine brain calmodulin and 1 μm recombinant human FKBP12 in assay buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mmCaCl2 for 15 min at 30 °C in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 25 μm32P-labeled Asp-X 17-Glu. After an additional 45 min of incubation at 30 °C the reaction was stopped using 0.5 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5% trichloroacetic acid. Free inorganic phosphate was isolated by Dowex cation-exchange chromatography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting as described (23Manalan A.S. Klee C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4291-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In a search to identify novel agents capable of inhibiting IL-2 synthesis, we developed a high throughput reporter gene assay, which featured PMA plus ionomycin stimulation of the Jurkat T cell line transfected with the luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of a full-length IL-2 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). The screen of a chemical library identified BTP compounds 1 and 3 (Fig.1), which inhibit IL-2 transcription with low nanomolar ED50 values (Fig.2). BTP2 was identified in a subsequent substructure search of the same chemical library (Fig. 1).Figure 2BTPs inhibit IL-2 promoter/luciferase reporter gene activity. Jurkat T cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the proximal IL-2 promoter (−325 to +24). Reporter gene activity was induced with PMA plus ionomycin and assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Some cultures were stimulated in the presence of increasing concentrations of BTP1 (squares) and BTP3 (circles).

Ledbetter J.A. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 153-161PubMed Google Scholar). The BTP compounds blocked CD3/CD28-induced IL-2 secretion in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values in the range of 100–300 nm (Fig.3). The immunosuppressant, FK506, was assayed as a positive reference standard in the same assay and was active in blocking IL-2 secretion with an ED50 equal to 40–50 nm. IL-2 is a necessary cytokine for T cell proliferation in response to mitogen or alloantigen stimulation (25Tsuchida T. Sakane T. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3446-3449PubMed Google Scholar). The BTP compounds blocked IL-2 secretion (Fig. 3), concanavalin A-induced proliferation (Fig.4 A), and mixed lymphocyte reactions (Fig. 4 B) with equivalent potency (ED50 equal to 100–300 nm). The immunosuppressant, CsA, was also active in blocking T cell proliferation in the same cultures with an ED50 equal to 30–50 nm.Figure 4BTPs inhibit mitogen- and alloantigen-stimulated T cell proliferation. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and stimulated with concanavalin A (A) or by mixed lymphocyte reaction (B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Some cultures were stimulated in the presence of increasing concentrations of CsA, BTP1, BTP2, or BTP3.

Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 248: 159-185Google Scholar), are molecules that show enormous diversity in structure. The greatest diversity is associated with their almost limitless repertoire of antigen-binding sites, which are encoded by the V,1 (D), and J genes. However, the constant (C) regions of the Ig molecules also show diversity within an individual. The antibody heavy chains specify the functions associated with the different classes of antibody, such as complement activation, recognition by phagocytic cells, and secretion across mucous membranes. Within the vertebrates, the V, (D), J, and C genes are arranged in many different patterns. In cartilaginous fishes, the genes encoding both heavy and light chains are arranged in multiple small clusters, each of which contains a single V, one or two D elements (in the case of the heavy chain), a single J, and a single C gene. In contrast, in bony fishes, amphibia, and mammals the IgH loci typically show the so-called translocon arrangement, in which groups of V, D, J, and C genes occur sequentially, from 5′ to 3′ within the locus (reviewed in Ref. 2Bengtén E.

The major mechanism creating the large and effective repertoire of the chicken antibody molecule is gene conversion, from the upstream pseudogene segments into the functional V gene. Gene conversion occurs both before B cells encounter antigen and during antigen-induced diversification of the binding site, a process in which point mutation events are also involved (5Arakawa H.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Magor K.E. Warr G.W. Middleton D. Wilson M.R. Higgins D.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2627-2633PubMed Google Scholar, 12Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5549-5555PubMed Google Scholar). Avian IgY (sometimes termed IgG) shows homologies with both IgG and IgE of mammals. Extant avian IgY is likely descended from the evolutionary precursor of both IgG and IgE (10Parvari R. Avivi A. Lentner F. Ziv E. Tel-Or S. Burstein Y. Schechter I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Warr G.W. Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).Ducks and their relatives have unusual antibody structure and expression, with consequences for their function. Their immune responses are often ineffectual (14Higgins D.A. Warr G.W. Avian Pathol. 1993; 22: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a feature that is explained, in part, by the properties of their antibodies. Although ducks produce a typical avian IgY, they can also generate large amounts of a truncated IgY, termed IgY(ΔFc) because it is missing the two C-terminal domains of its H (υ) chains (11Magor K.E. Warr G.W. Middleton D. Wilson M.R. Higgins D.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2627-2633PubMed Google Scholar, 12Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5549-5555PubMed Google Scholar). This structural abnormality of the duck IgY(ΔFc) would result in the loss of biological effector functions (such as complement activation) associated with the Fc region. The IgA-dependent mucosal immune response of ducks is also problematic, being delayed in its development following hatching (9Magor K.E. Warr G.W. Bando Y. Middleton D.L. Higgins D.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,15Ng P.L.K. Higgins D.A. Immunology. 1986; 58: 323-327PubMed Google Scholar), as compared with the chicken, in which IgA secretion develops more rapidly (16Leslie G.A. Stankus R.P. Martin L.N. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1976; 51: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The search for a genetic basis to the inept antibody response of the duck has been informative. The IgY(ΔFc) molecule results from the utilization (by alternative pathways of RNA processing) of a novel, small terminal exon within the υ gene (11Magor K.E. Warr G.W. Middleton D. Wilson M.R. Higgins D.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2627-2633PubMed Google Scholar, 12Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5549-5555PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the υ and α genes have been shown to be in head-to-head configuration within the IgH locus (17Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This arrangement would require that class switching to produce either IgA or IgY in the duck involves the inversion of a segment of the IgH locus, rather than the usual deletional mechanism of class switching (18Stavnezer J. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 79-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) seen in mammals. Detailed knowledge of the structure of the duck IgH locus will be required if a full understanding of the unusual features of its organization, recombination, and expression is to be achieved. Presented here are the results of a study to establish the structure of the IgH locus in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos), including the organization of the D, JH, and C region genes, the mechanism of expression of the membrane receptor forms of IgM and IgA, and the genetic basis for class switching.DISCUSSIONThe IgH locus can be subject to four processes that modify its coding sequence in the course of B cell development and the immune response as follows: site-specific recombination (of V/D/J), point mutations, gene conversions (in some species), and region-specific recombination (of C region genes). Knowledge of the structure and expression of the IgH locus in ducks sheds light on the genetic basis of their poorly functional antibody response and on the evolution of this complex locus in the vertebrates. The observations on the duck IgH locus made in this study include the following: 1) the unusual organization (μ-α-υ) of the C region genes, 2) the inversion that has accompanied the apparent transposition of the α gene in the locus, 3) the absence of a duck δ gene, and 4) the remarkable prevalence of VNTR sequences in the locus. These observations, in total, point to a unique structure for this locus and have significance for the expression of a functional antibody response in the duck. The genes mapped and sequenced in this study are in the order D-JH-μ-α-υ, suggesting strongly that the duck, like the chicken, possesses a single JH segment (4Reynaud C.-A. Bertocci B. Dahan A. Weill J.-C. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 353-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inverted transcriptional orientation of the duck α gene, while definitively shown here, was the only logical interpretation of previous mapping analyses (17Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and, interestingly, may be widespread in the birds, as PCR-based approaches have indicated a similar arrangement in the chicken (29Zhao Y. Rabbani H. Shimizu A. Hammarström L. Immunology. 2000; 101: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The current position and orientation of the duck α gene is most readily explained by an ancient translocation event that also inverted the α gene as it was inserted into its present position. This follows from the observation that mammalian α genes are found as the 3′-most C region genes and in the same transcriptional orientation as the other C region genes (30Flannagan J.G. Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1982; 300: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The translocation and inversion of α must have occurred in a common ancestor of chickens and ducks, but whether this feature is restricted to the galloanserine lineage (31van Tuinen M. Sibley C.G. Hedges S.B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or shared by all birds is unknown. The position immediately downstream of the μ gene is the site in which all known δ genes are found (32Wilson M. Bengten E. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Du Pasquier L. Warr G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4593-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 33White M.B. Shen A.L. Word C. Tucker P.W. Blattner F.R. Science. 1985; 228: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The insertion of the α gene in this position downstream of μ may have disrupted the δ gene and accounted for the apparent absence of δ from the present day IgH locus of the duck. No evidence has been found to support the presence of a δ gene, or the discernible remnant of one, in the duck IgH locus. The absence of an IgD from ducks provides further evidence for the functional redundancy of this class of antibody (34Roes J. Rajewsky K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).All Igs can be expressed, by alternative RNA processing, in either secreted forms or as membrane-bound receptors for antigen on B cells. Typically, the hydrophobic transmembrane tail of the receptor form of Igs is encoded by 2 exons (TM1 and TM2) that splice into a cryptic site in the terminal secreted C region exon (35Ross D.A. Wilson M.R. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Warr G.W. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 166: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The membrane receptor form of IgA has been studied previously only in mammals, where the transmembrane region has been shown, uniquely, to be encoded by only a single exon (36Yu L. Peng C. Starnes S.M. Liou R.S. Chang T.W. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3932-3936PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here show, similarly, a single TM exon in the duck α gene. Thus, the single TM exon in the vertebrate α gene must have developed prior to the divergence of the lineages that would give rise to birds and mammals. In the case of the mammalian α gene, the low frequency of the αm message has been suggested to reflect, at least in part, the long (∼2.5 kb) intron separating the TM exon from Cα3 (37Seipelt R.L. Peterson M.L. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The homologous Cα4/TM intron in the duck is close to 5 kb long and may, by the same reasoning, be responsible for the low frequency of αm message and in part explain the difficulty in detecting it, even in RT-PCR. However, undefined cis-acting elements present in the mammalian Cα3/TM intron also appear to influence the regulation of α mRNA processing (38Coyle J.H. Lebman D.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, the principal difference between the IgA of mammals and that of birds (only ducks and chickens have been examined in detail) is that in mammals the α chain is shorter by one C region domain, reflecting the loss of the original Cα2 exon (39Tucker P.W. Slightom J.L. Blattner F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7684-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which has been replaced by a flexible hinge region.The information presented here allows further examination of the likelihood that the structure of the IgH locus is the cause of the “inept” antibody response in the duck. In one instance it is clear that the structure of the IgH locus leads to expression of a deficient antibody. The IgY(ΔFc) antibody, which lacks the functionally important Fc region, results from an alternative pathway of processing of the primary transcript from the υ gene, in which the small terminal exon between the exons encoding υ2 and υ3 (Fig. 1) is used (12Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5549-5555PubMed Google Scholar). In a second instance, the inverted position of the α gene in the duck raises the possibility that its orientation is related to the delayed production of IgA observed in ducks (9Magor K.E. Warr G.W. Bando Y. Middleton D.L. Higgins D.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Ng P.L.K. Higgins D.A. Immunology. 1986; 58: 323-327PubMed Google Scholar). This is because the expression of α requires, of necessity, an inversional mechanism of class switching, as opposed to the typical deletional rearrangement. The frequency of inversions during Ig class switching in the IgH locus has been shown, in a mouse cell line, to be lower than that of deletion events (40Jäck H.-M. McDowell M. Steinberg C.M. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1581-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Inversions occurred in ∼23% of the rearrangements, indicating that deletions are apparently, in mammals, the favored outcome of class switch events at the IgH locus. However, the simple correlation of an inverted α gene with a delayed switch to IgA production is not supported by the evidence from the chicken. The α gene in chickens also appears, from indirect evidence based on PCR approaches (29Zhao Y. Rabbani H. Shimizu A. Hammarström L. Immunology. 2000; 101: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), to be inverted. However, IgA production in chickens develops rapidly after hatching (16Leslie G.A. Stankus R.P. Martin L.N. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1976; 51: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating that an inverted α gene is not, per se, linked to inefficiencies of expression. Thus, delayed IgA expression in the duckling must result from other causes, such as the cytokine control of the mechanisms driving class switching to IgA.Birds are considered to have a condensed genome, about one-third the size of that of mammals (41Wachtel S.S. Tiersch T.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1993; 104: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although the IgH locus in ducks is shorter overall than in mammals, each duck C region gene is considerably larger than its mammalian homologue. For example, the mouse μ gene covers ∼4 kb (42Brüggemann M. Calabi F. Neuberger M.S. Molecular Genetics of Immunoglobulin. Elsevier Science Publications B. V., Amsterdam1987: 51-80Google Scholar), whereas the duck μ gene measures close to 10 kb in length, a difference that is attributable to differences in intron length. In the case of the α gene, lengths are ∼6 kb in the mouse versus 11 kb in the duck, a difference attributable both to longer introns and to the presence of an additional exon in the duck gene. Whereas the overall condensation of the avian genome is generally considered to have been accompanied by a loss of repetitive DNA (43Longmire J.L. Hahn D.C. Roach J.L. J. Hered. 1999; 90: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 44Primmer C.R. Raudsepp T. Chowdhary B.P. Möller A.P. Ellegren H. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the data presented here show that the duck IgH locus is, unexpectedly, very rich in VNTRs, which account for ∼60% of its sequence (Fig. 5 A), a much higher value than seen in mammalian IgH loci. Whereas other sequenced regions of the duck genome (Fig. 5 B) contain much lower numbers of VNTRs than the IgH locus, the interpretation of these comparisons is complicated by the fact that VNTRs are asymmetrically distributed on chromosomes. For example, a telomeric bias in VNTR distribution has been reported on human chromosome 22 and chromosome 1 of Caenorhabditis elegans, but a centromeric bias is present in chromosome 4 ofArabidopsis thaliana (45Vergnaud G. Denoeud F. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As only a small proportion of the duck genome has been sequenced, it is not possible to conclude definitively that a high content of VNTRs is unique to the IgH locus. However, VNTRs are often associated with sites of recombination (46Brusco A. Saviozzi S. Cinque F. Bottaro A. DeMarchi M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4392-4398PubMed Google Scholar), and the VNTRs in the duck IgH locus may, in addition to a role in the Ig class switch mechanism, have facilitated the inversion and translocation of the α gene that is a prominent feature of this locus. Antibodies, found only in the vertebrates (1Du Pasquier L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 248: 159-185Google Scholar), are molecules that show enormous diversity in structure. The greatest diversity is associated with their almost limitless repertoire of antigen-binding sites, which are encoded by the V,1 (D), and J genes. However, the constant (C) regions of the Ig molecules also show diversity within an individual. The antibody heavy chains specify the functions associated with the different classes of antibody, such as complement activation, recognition by phagocytic cells, and secretion across mucous membranes. Within the vertebrates, the V, (D), J, and C genes are arranged in many different patterns. In cartilaginous fishes, the genes encoding both heavy and light chains are arranged in multiple small clusters, each of which contains a single V, one or two D elements (in the case of the heavy chain), a single J, and a single C gene. In contrast, in bony fishes, amphibia, and mammals the IgH loci typically show the so-called translocon arrangement, in which groups of V, D, J, and C genes occur sequentially, from 5′ to 3′ within the locus (reviewed in Ref. 2Bengtén E. Wilson M. Miller N. Clem L.W. Pilström L. Warr G.W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 248: 189-219PubMed Google Scholar). The birds are, apart from the mammals, the most highly evolved vertebrate lineage, and their Ig genes show some of the most unusual arrangements and forms of expression. The IgL and IgH loci of chicken each possess only a single functional V and J segment but have up to 100 V region pseudogenes located upstream of the functional V gene (3McCormack W.T. Tjoelker L.W. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 219-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,4Reynaud C.-A. Bertocci B. Dahan A. Weill J.-C. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 353-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major mechanism creating the large and effective repertoire of the chicken antibody molecule is gene conversion, from the upstream pseudogene segments into the functional V gene. Gene conversion occurs both before B cells encounter antigen and during antigen-induced diversification of the binding site, a process in which point mutation events are also involved (5Arakawa H. Furusawa S. Ekino S. Yamagishi H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2540-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Arakawa H. Kuma K. Yasuda M. Furasawa S. Ekino S. Yamagishi H. J.

In the case of the mammalian α gene, the low frequency of the αm message has been suggested to reflect, at least in part, the long (∼2.5 kb) intron separating the TM exon from Cα3 (37Seipelt R.L. Peterson M.L. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The homologous Cα4/TM intron in the duck is close to 5 kb long and may, by the same reasoning, be responsible for the low frequency of αm message and in part explain the difficulty in detecting it, even in RT-PCR. However, undefined cis-acting elements present in the mammalian Cα3/TM intron also appear to influence the regulation of α mRNA processing (38Coyle J.H. Lebman D.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, the principal difference between the IgA of mammals and that of birds (only ducks and chickens have been examined in detail) is that in mammals the α chain is shorter by one C region domain, reflecting the loss of the original Cα2 exon (39Tucker P.W. Slightom J.L. Blattner F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7684-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which has been replaced by a flexible hinge region.The information presented here allows further examination of the likelihood that the structure of the IgH locus is the cause of the “inept” antibody response in the duck. In one instance it is clear that the structure of the IgH locus leads to expression of a deficient antibody. The IgY(ΔFc) antibody, which lacks the functionally important Fc region, results from an alternative pathway of processing of the primary transcript from the υ gene, in which the small terminal exon between the exons encoding υ2 and υ3 (Fig. 1) is used (12Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5549-5555PubMed Google Scholar). In a second instance, the inverted position of the α gene in the duck raises the possibility that its orientation is related to the delayed production of IgA observed in ducks (9Magor K.E. Warr G.W. Bando Y. Middleton D.L. Higgins D.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Ng P.L.K. Higgins D.A. Immunology. 1986; 58: 323-327PubMed Google Scholar). This is because the expression of α requires, of necessity, an inversional mechanism of class switching, as opposed to the typical deletional rearrangement. The frequency of inversions during Ig class switching in the IgH locus has been shown, in a mouse cell line, to be lower than that of deletion events (40Jäck H.-M. McDowell M. Steinberg C.M. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1581-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Inversions occurred in ∼23% of the rearrangements, indicating that deletions are apparently, in mammals, the favored outcome of class switch events at the IgH locus. However, the simple correlation of an inverted α gene with a delayed switch to IgA production is not supported by the evidence from the chicken. The α gene in chickens also appears, from indirect evidence based on PCR approaches (29Zhao Y. Rabbani H. Shimizu A. Hammarström L. Immunology. 2000; 101: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), to be inverted. However, IgA production in chickens develops rapidly after hatching (16Leslie G.A. Stankus R.P. Martin L.N. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1976; 51: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating that an inverted α gene is not, per se, linked to inefficiencies of expression. Thus, delayed IgA expression in the duckling must result from other causes, such as the cytokine control of the mechanisms driving class switching to IgA.Birds are considered to have a condensed genome, about one-third the size of that of mammals (41Wachtel S.S. Tiersch T.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1993; 104: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although the IgH locus in ducks is shorter overall than in mammals, each duck C region gene is considerably larger than its mammalian homologue. For example, the mouse μ gene covers ∼4 kb (42Brüggemann M. Calabi F. Neuberger M.S. Molecular Genetics of Immunoglobulin. Elsevier Science Publications B. V., Amsterdam1987: 51-80Google Scholar), whereas the duck μ gene measures close to 10 kb in length, a difference that is attributable to differences in intron length. In the case of the α gene, lengths are ∼6 kb in the mouse versus 11 kb in the duck, a difference attributable both to longer introns and to the presence of an additional exon in the duck gene. Whereas the overall condensation of the avian genome is generally considered to have been accompanied by a loss of repetitive DNA (43Longmire J.L. Hahn D.C. Roach J.L. J. Hered. 1999; 90: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 44Primmer C.R. Raudsepp T. Chowdhary B.P. Möller A.P. Ellegren H. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the data presented here show that the duck IgH locus is, unexpectedly, very rich in VNTRs, which account for ∼60% of its sequence (Fig. 5 A), a much higher value than seen in mammalian IgH loci. Whereas other sequenced regions of the duck genome (Fig. 5 B) contain much lower numbers of VNTRs than the IgH locus, the interpretation of these comparisons is complicated by the fact that VNTRs are asymmetrically distributed on chromosomes. For example, a telomeric bias in VNTR distribution has been reported on human chromosome 22 and chromosome 1 of Caenorhabditis elegans, but a centromeric bias is present in chromosome 4 ofArabidopsis thaliana (45Vergnaud G. Denoeud F. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As only a small proportion of the duck genome has been sequenced, it is not possible to conclude definitively that a high content of VNTRs is unique to the IgH locus. However, VNTRs are often associated with sites of recombination (46Brusco A. Saviozzi S. Cinque F. Bottaro A. DeMarchi M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4392-4398PubMed Google Scholar), and the VNTRs in the duck IgH locus may, in addition to a role in the Ig class switch mechanism, have facilitated the inversion and translocation of the α gene that is a prominent feature of this locus. The IgH locus can be subject to four processes that modify its coding sequence in the course of B cell development and the immune response as follows: site-specific recombination (of V/D/J), point mutations, gene conversions (in some species), and region-specific recombination (of C region genes). Knowledge of the structure and expression of the IgH locus in ducks sheds light on the genetic basis of their poorly functional antibody response and on the evolution of this complex locus in the vertebrates. The observations on the duck IgH locus made in this study include the following: 1) the unusual organization (μ-α-υ) of the C region genes, 2) the inversion that has accompanied the apparent transposition of the α gene in the locus, 3) the absence of a duck δ gene, and 4) the remarkable prevalence of VNTR sequences in the locus. These observations, in total, point to a unique structure for this locus and have significance for the expression of a functional antibody response in the duck. The genes mapped and sequenced in this study are in the order D-JH-μ-α-υ, suggesting strongly that the duck, like the chicken, possesses a single JH segment (4Reynaud C.-A. Bertocci B. Dahan A. Weill J.-C. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 353-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inverted transcriptional orientation of the duck α gene, while definitively shown here, was the only logical interpretation of previous mapping analyses (17Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and, interestingly, may be widespread in the birds, as PCR-based approaches have indicated a similar arrangement in the chicken (29Zhao Y. Rabbani H. Shimizu A. Hammarström L. Immunology. 2000; 101: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The current position and orientation of the duck α gene is most readily explained by an ancient translocation event that also inverted the α gene as it was inserted into its present position. This follows from the observation that mammalian α genes are found as the 3′-most C region genes and in the same transcriptional orientation as the other C region genes (30Flannagan J.G. Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1982; 300: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The translocation and inversion of α must have occurred in a common ancestor of chickens and ducks, but whether this feature is restricted to the galloanserine lineage (31van Tuinen M. Sibley C.G. Hedges S.B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or shared by all birds is unknown. The position immediately downstream of the μ gene is the site in which all known δ genes are found (32Wilson M. Bengten E. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Du Pasquier L. Warr G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4593-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 33White M.B. Shen A.L. Word C. Tucker P.W. Blattner F.R. Science. 1985; 228: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The insertion of the α gene in this position downstream of μ may have disrupted the δ gene and accounted for the apparent absence of δ from the present day IgH locus of the duck. No evidence has been found to support the presence of a δ gene, or the discernible remnant of one, in the duck IgH locus. The absence of an IgD from ducks provides further evidence for the functional redundancy of this class of antibody (34Roes J. Rajewsky K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). All Igs can be expressed, by alternative RNA processing, in either secreted forms or as membrane-bound receptors for antigen on B cells. Typically, the hydrophobic transmembrane tail of the receptor form of Igs is encoded by 2 exons (TM1 and TM2) that splice into a cryptic site in the terminal secreted C region exon (35Ross D.A. Wilson M.R. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Warr G.W. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 166: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The membrane receptor form of IgA has been studied previously only in mammals, where the transmembrane region has been shown, uniquely, to be encoded by only a single exon (36Yu L. Peng C. Starnes S.M. Liou R.S. Chang T.W. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3932-3936PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here show, similarly, a single TM exon in the duck α gene.

The degree of secondary structural perturbation was greater in the aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl. Both aggregate types were dissolved and refolded using high hydrostatic pressures in combination with either elevated temperature or non-denaturing levels of guanidine HCl or urea. The effects of a range of temperature, pressure, and chaotrope concentrations were tested and led to optimal conditions that approached 100% yield of native protein. The aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl required higher concentrations of urea or GdnHCl, or higher temperature or pressure for a yield equivalent to that for aggregates formed in buffer alone. Investigation of the effects of pressure, temperature, and chaotrope on unfolding of rhGH documented that under conditions used for optimal high pressure disaggregation and refolding, the native state is greatly favored thermodynamically (e.g. 25 kJ/mol at 2000 bar and 0.75 m GdnHCl). Dissolution of aggregates under pressure is a kinetically limited process. Comparison of refolding yields in GdnHCl and urea solutions suggest that pressure effects on electrostatic interactions do not dominate pressure effects on disaggregation. We suggest that non-native hydrogen bonds between protein molecules within aggregates of recombinant human growth hormone are responsible for the rate-limiting kinetic barrier in pressure-induced disaggregation.

A. 1999; 96: 3342-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar)), production of therapeutic protein products, and routine expression, purification, and manipulation of proteins in research laboratories. Proteins partially unfold and assemble into aggregates, ranging from small, soluble dimers to large agglomerates of essentially infinite molecular weight (2Fields G.B. Alonso D.O.V. Stigter D.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation is the major pathway leading to loss of valuable protein product in the biopharmaceutical industry (7Carpenter J.F. Kendrick B.S. Chang B.S. Manning M.C. Randolph T.W. Methods in Enzymology. 1999; 309: 236-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Cleland J.L. Powell M.F. Shire S.J. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 1993; 10: 307-377PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the starting material for many industrial protein purification processes is often inclusion bodies, which are non-native, insoluble aggregates typically formed during overproduction of foreign proteins in Escherichia coli. In addition, many common industrial steps for refolding, purification, and separation of proteins readily lead to aggregation. Because small amounts of aggregates in parenterally delivered protein therapeutics can cause immune response, anaphylactic shock, and even death, both soluble and insoluble aggregates must be carefully removed from pharmaceutical formulations (9Moore W.V. Leppert P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 10Ratner R.E. Phillips T.M. Steiner M.

Under mild conditions, which should greatly thermodynamically favor the non-aggregated native state (e.g. buffered aqueous solutions at physiological pH and temperature), disaggregation and refolding typically are so slow that aggregation is considered irreversible. Classic methods of refolding protein aggregates and inclusion bodies require the use of powerful chemical denaturants (12Cleland J.L. Wang D.I.C. ACS Symp. Ser. 1993; 516: 151-166Crossref Google Scholar, 13De Bernardez Clark E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 14Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In a chemical refolding process, protein aggregates are first dissolved in concentrated chaotropes such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl1), resulting in unfolded protein monomers. Chaotrope concentrations are usually reduced via dilution and/or dialysis (15Rudolph R. Cleland J.L. Craik C.S. Protein Engineering: Principles and Practices. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995: 283-298Google Scholar), allowing the protein to refold in a process that is typically of first order in protein concentration. Because aggregation is typically at least second order in protein concentration (16Zettlmeissl G. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 17Kiefhaber T. Rudolph R. Kohler H.H. Buchner J. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), to prevent reaggregation, the protein typically must be diluted to between 10 and 100 μg/ml before the chaotrope is removed. Unfortunately, achieving acceptable refolding yields, if possible, usually requires screening of a large number of refolding conditions (18Rudolph R. Lilie H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 19De Bernardez Clark E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Frequently, after extensive research, refolding yields remain too low to justify commercial product recovery with chemical refolding methods. In addition, low protein concentrations needed for acceptable refolding yields lead to large processing volumes and require large quantities of toxic, corrosive chaotropes, with high associated purchase and disposal costs. Alternatively, high pressure has long been known to denature native proteins and dissociate oligomeric proteins (20Li T.M. Hook J.W. Drickamer H.G. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5571-5580Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Paladini A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Balny C. Masson P.

J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Gorovits and Horowitz (25Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6132-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported that high pressure could arrest protein aggregation under solution conditions that, at atmospheric pressure, favor formation of aggregates. Recently we have developed high pressure methods for disaggregating and refolding proteins from aggregates and inclusion bodies, allowing processing of high concentrations of protein (e.g. 9 mg/ml) and resulting in high yields of native protein (∼100%) (26St. John R.J. Carpenter L.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this investigation, our goals were 3-fold. First, we wished to elucidate some of the critical variables affecting high pressure disaggregation and refolding of proteins from insoluble aggregates. Second, we wanted to use high pressure spectroscopic techniques to determine at what points during the pressurization/depressurization cycle the individual steps of protein disaggregation and refolding occur. Finally, we sought to exploit high pressure as a fundamental thermodynamic variable to gain quantitative information about the energetics of aggregate dissolution in the absence of chaotropes. Such insights are important for optimizing high pressure disaggregation and refolding techniques, and they deepen our understanding of the thermodynamic relationships between a protein's native state and non-native aggregates. The latter information has been elusive by conventional techniques, because the irreversibility of aggregation under conditions of interest and difficulties of performing spectroscopic analyses on aggregates have precluded obtaining such results. In this work we used recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) as a model protein. In our previous work (26St. John R.J. Carpenter L.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), rhGH in insoluble aggregates was shown to have recovered native structure after incubation at elevated hydrostatic pressures, followed by depressurization and subsequent analysis. However, it was unclear whether refolding actually occurred at high pressure, or whether the protein simply disaggregated and unfolded under pressure, and then refolded as pressure was released. In the current study, we created two distinct insoluble rhGH aggregates with different degrees of perturbation of native secondary structure. We investigated the effects of aggregate structure, chaotropes, pressure, and temperature on pressure-induced disaggregation and refolding, and the energetics of unfolding from the native state. Finally, we compared the relative rates of dissolution and refolding under pressure and used transition state analysis to gain insight into the required conformational changes for, and energetics of, aggregate dissolution. Genentech Inc. generously supplied the recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) for this study. rhGH was aggregated by rotating 10 ml of rhGH solution (1.75 mg/ml) in a 50-ml Falcon tube on a cell suspender for 24 h at 8 revolutions/min. Aggregation buffer consisted of 10 mmsodium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 6.0, at 24 °C (“buffer”). A second set of rhGH aggregates was prepared identically, with the addition of 0.75 m GdnHCl in the aggregation buffer. Prior to pressurization, aggregates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was removed. The desired refolding buffer was then added, and the aggregates (0.87 mg/ml unless otherwise noted) were resuspended using a sonicating cell disrupter (Ultrasonics, 50% duty, 1-s cycles for 10 s). Pressure was generated using high pressure nitrogen (400 bar) connected to equipment from High Pressure Equipment Co. (Erie, PA) as previously described (26St. John R.J. Carpenter L.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or with high pressure crank generators from High Pressure Equipment Co. Samples were prepared either in heat-sealed bulbs of SAMCO transfer pipettes or in sterile, disposable syringes (one end heat-sealed and the other sealed with the rubber plunger). Sealed samples were placed into a 2-liter pressure vessel equipped with a heating jacket, rated to 2000 bar. Samples were slowly pressurized (15 min) to final desired pressure to minimize pressurization-induced heating (less than 2 °C as measured by a thermocouple mounted in the interior of the vessel lid). The depressurization rate was ∼100 bar/min. Infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structure of rhGH aggregates in solution. All spectra were collected on a Nicolet Magna model 550 spectrometer equipped with a deuterized triglycine sulfate detector. Spectral acquisition and numerical manipulations were performed as reported earlier (26St. John R.J. Carpenter L.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements on monomeric, soluble rhGH were conducted on equipment in the laboratory of Dr. Balny in Montpellier, France. Measurements were carried out on an Aminco-Bowman-2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM Co.) modified to accommodate a high pressure cell rated to 7000 bar. The high pressure bomb was described earlier (27Lange R. Frank J. Saldana J.L. Balny C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 277-283Google Scholar). rhGH at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was dissolved in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide), and varying amounts of GdnHCl to mimic refolding conditions. A concentration of 1 mg/ml was required for an adequate signal-to-noise ratio due to the attenuation of light in the high pressure fluorescence equipment. Even at this protein concentration, where inner filter effects are expected, we were able to resolve clearly changes in λmax due to protein unfolding. The excitation wavelength was set to 280 nm, and emission scanned from 320 to 360 nm. Data were corrected for increased density at high pressure. High pressure UV studies on rhGH aggregates were conducted in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 35 UV spectrophotometer equipped with a custom high pressure cell rated to 6500 bar. To inhibit sedimentation, aggregates were suspended in a 20% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solution in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0, 0.75 mGdnHCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide). HES (average molecular weight, 294,000 g/mol) was purchased from Fresenius (Linz, Austria). Samples were pressurized to 2000 bar, and scans were taken from 500 to 250 nm at 30-min intervals. Derivatives of the spectra were calculated using UV Winlab software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Concentrations of soluble rhGH were determined by UV spectroscopy as previously described (26St. John R.J. Carpenter L.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), with an extinction coefficient of 18,890 (cm mol/l)−1 at 278 nm. Insoluble aggregates were removed by centrifugation (13,000 ×g, room temperature) for 15 min. Contributions due to soluble aggregates were subtracted from the signal as reported by Leach and Scheraga (28Leach S.J. Scheraga H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 4790-4792Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Total protein assays (BCA, Pierce) were used to confirm protein concentrations measured by spectroscopy. After depressurization, secondary structure of recovered, soluble protein in selected samples was examined using circular dichroism spectroscopy as previously described (26St. John R.J. Carpenter L.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of aggregated rhGH in precipitates, which were formed by agitating the protein in either buffer or buffer containing 0.75 m GdnHCl, was compared with that of the native soluble protein with infrared spectroscopy (Fig. 1). The second derivative spectrum of the native protein had a dominant band at 1654 cm−1 for α-helix, consistent with the 4-α-helix bundle structure of rhGH (29Ultsch M.H. Somers W. Kossiakoff A.A. De Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 286-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The spectrum for the protein aggregated and precipitated in buffer had a decrease in intensity of the α-helix band, which was compensated for by bands at 1627 and 1695 cm−1. Thus, aggregation of rhGH resulted in a partial loss of native helix and formation of non-native intermolecular β-sheet (30Dong A.C. Prestrelski S.J. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl indicated an apparently more severe perturbation of native structure. The α-helical band was greatly broadened and reduced in intensity, reflecting a heterogeneous population of microenvironments for the remaining helix. This spectrum also exhibited less pronounced peaks associated with intermolecular β-sheet structure. Thus, there was much less residual native structure or newly formed intermolecular β-sheet in the aggregates prepared in 0.75 m GdnHCl compared with those formed in buffer alone. Samples of each rhGH aggregate type were incubated at 2000 bar and room temperature for 24 h in solutions containing various concentrations of GdnHCl, then depressurized and tested for refolded, soluble protein. The fraction recoveries of soluble protein are shown in Fig. 2. We reported earlier (26St. John R.J. Carpenter L.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that, for aggregates prepared in buffer alone, levels of GdnHCl well below those required to unfold rhGH at atmospheric pressure greatly enhance rhGH refolding yields at 2000 bar and that 24 h of pressurization is sufficient to obtain maximal recoveries of native protein. As can be seen in Fig. 2, refolding recoveries for aggregates formed in buffer alone increased nearly linearly from 20% at 0 m GdnHCl to 100% at 0.7 m GdnHCl. Aggregates formed in 0.75m GdnHCl required a higher GdnHCl concentration to achieve a given level of recovery of soluble protein. For both aggregate types, the recovery of soluble protein at atmospheric pressure was significantly lower. For samples exhibiting 100% recovery of soluble protein, far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy documented fully native α-helical structure (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows recovery of native protein from both types of aggregates after pressurization to 2000 bar for 48 h in the presence of varying concentrations of urea. Higher concentrations of urea (Fig. 3) than GdnHCl (Fig. 2) were required to achieve the same recovery yield. 100% refolding recovery was achieved at 1.8 m urea for aggregates formed in buffer and 2.5m for aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl. For both aggregate types, controls incubated at atmospheric pressure showed significantly lower levels of soluble protein. Next, we determined the effect of varying pressure on the recovery of soluble protein (Fig. 4). Pressures were varied from 1 to 2200 bar using a single refolding solution condition (10 mmsodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide, 0.75 m GdnHCl), and samples were incubated 24 h at room temperature. Recovery of native rhGH from aggregates formed in buffer neared 100% at 1750 bar, whereas recovery from aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl reached 80% at 2200 bar. Experiments were terminated at 2200 bar due to the limitations of our equipment. To determine the effect of temperature on yields of folded protein from the two types of aggregates, samples were pressurized at 2000 bar in buffer without chaotropes. As the incubation temperature was increased, refolding yields of native protein from both rhGH aggregate species increased, with yields approaching a maximum of ∼90% at 55 °C (Fig. 5). Aggregates formed in 0.75m GdnHCl showed slightly lower yields at each temperature. Recovery of ∼90% soluble protein from these aggregates was achieved at 65 °C. Control samples incubated at atmospheric pressure displayed an increase in soluble protein between 40 °C and 60 °C. However, at 65 °C, soluble protein in atmospheric pressure control samples was less than 5%. To determine whether refolding was occurring at elevated pressure, or during or subsequent to depressurization, we examined rhGH tertiary structure as a function of pressure, temperature, and chaotrope concentration. At atmospheric pressure, addition of GdnHCl to solutions of rhGH causes the protein to unfold (31Bam N.B. Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. Biotechnol. Prog. 1996; 12: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), as evidenced by a cooperative shift in λmax, the wavelength of maximum intensity in the fluorescence emission spectrum (Fig. 6 A). Unfolding begins at ∼4m GdnHCl, with a midpoint near 4.5 m, consistent with reported unfolding curves from Bam et al.(31Bam N.B. Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. Biotechnol. Prog. 1996; 12: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At 25 °C in the absence of GdnHCl, fluorescence spectroscopy showed no evidence of unfolding transitions at pressures up to 6000 bar (Fig. 6 B). Likewise, in the absence of GdnHCl, no unfolding transition could be detected by fourth-derivative UV at pressures up to 4500 bar, and a plot of fourth derivative UV spectral intensity at 284 nm versus pressure had a slope indistinguishable from zero over the pressure range from 1 to 4500 bar (data not shown). At temperatures between 25 and 60 °C in solutions without GdnHCl, no pressure-induced structural transition could be detected by fluorescence spectroscopy at pressures up to 6000 bar. Fig. 6 B shows representative data for fluorescence emission λmax at 25 and 60 °C; data for other temperatures (37, 45, 55 °C) are not shown. Because we used GdnHCl at a concentration of 0.75 m during some of our refolding studies, we also searched for a pressure-induced unfolding transition in the range of 0–3 m GdnHCl. No unfolding transition could be seen for these solutions at pressures up to 6000 bar. Representative data for rhGH solutions containing 1m GdnHCl are shown in Fig. 6 B. Data for GdnHCl concentrations of 0.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 m are not shown. Samples of rhGH containing 4 m GdnHCl (at the onset of the unfolding transition at atmospheric pressure) were pressurized, and an unfolding transition was detected (Fig. 6 B), with a pressure midpoint of ∼1200 bar, at 25 °C. At pressures above 1800 bar, the λmax plateaus at about 355 nm, are equivalent to the fluorescence shift seen after unfolding in GdnHCl at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 6 A). The partial molar volume change for pressure-induced equilibrium unfolding ΔV can be calculated from Equation 1. −RT∂(lnK)∂P=ΔVEquation 1 Using the data for the pressure-induced unfolding curve in Fig. 6 B, the estimated ΔV of unfolding of rhGH in 4m GdnHCl was ∼−120 ml/mol. The free energy of unfolding (ΔG unfold) at atmospheric pressure of native rhGH in 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.0, 25 °C) can be calculated from the circular dichroism spectroscopic data of Bam et al. (31Bam N.B. Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. Biotechnol. Prog. 1996; 12: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The resulting ΔG unfold is 62 kJ/mol, with an “m” ( m = ∂ ΔGunf/∂ [GdnHCl]) value of −13 kJ mol−1 (mGdnHCl)−1. Using these data, we estimated that ΔG unfold for rhGH in 4 m GdnHCl at atmospheric pressure is about 10 kJ mol−1, and ΔG unfold in 0.75 m GdnHCl at atmospheric pressure is about 50 kJ mol−1. From the unfolding curve in Fig. 6 B, we calculated that ΔG unfold in 4 m GdnHCl, atmospheric pressure is 14 kJ mol−1, in reasonable agreement with the value calculated from the data of Bam et al. (31Bam N.B. Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. Biotechnol. Prog. 1996; 12: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using the ΔV obtained in this study (−120 ml mol−1), we estimated ΔG unfoldfor rhGH in 0.75 m GdnHCl, 2000 bar to be about 25 kJ mol−1. Hence, ΔG unfold indicates that the native state of rhGH is thermodynamically favored at 2000 bar in 0.75 m GdnHCl. To analyze kinetics of structural transitions and disaggregation, we performed a real-time evaluation of these processes using rhGH aggregates suspended in buffer containing 0.75 m GdnHCl and 20% HES. Because of the high viscosity of the resulting solution, aggregates remained suspended with less than a 10% reduction in light-scattering signal at 500 nm after 24 h (data not shown). Suspended aggregates were pressurized in the UV cell to 2000 bar and the UV spectrum (between 250 and 500 nm) obtained at 30-min intervals. Structural changes were determined from the second derivatives of the spectra calculated between 320 and 270 nm. Optical density at 500 nm, which is due to light scattering, was used to monitor disaggregation. The second derivative UV spectra of both types of rhGH aggregates indicate structural perturbations from native structure in the aggregate form (Fig. 7 A). A strong positive peak at ∼289 nm and a large negative peak at 283.7 nm dominate the second derivative UV spectrum of native rhGH in buffer containing 20% HES and 0.75 m GdnHCl. Based on studies measuring the absorbance of individual Trp and Tyr amino acids in solution, the native rhGH spectrum is dominated by Trp absorbance (27Lange R. Frank J. Saldana J.L. Balny C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 277-283Google Scholar). There are 3 Trp residues in rhGH, one in the interior and one at each of the two solvent-exposed receptor binding sites (32De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). The spectra of the aggregates formed in buffer alone and aggregates formed in 0.75m GdnHCl exhibited pronounced negative peaks at 284.5 and 285.5 nm, respectively. The red shifts in the spectra for the aggregates relative to the native rhGH spectrum indicate that Trp residues are less solvent exposed (e.g. experiencing additional hydrophobic contacts) in the aggregate species compared with the native state (33Yanari S. Bovey F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2818-2826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this effect is more pronounced for the aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl. Upon pressurization to 2000 bar, the second derivative UV spectra of both aggregates exhibited a blue shift and an increase in intensity over time (Figs. 7 B, 7 C, and 8 A). After incubation at 2000 bar for 24 h, the negative spectral peak near 284 nm in spectra of both aggregate types shifted to 283.7 nm, matching the peak position in the spectrum for native rhGH. To obtain the kinetics of this return to native-like Trp solvent exposure, we plotted the position of the negative peak as a function of time (Fig. 8 A). Shifting of λmax in the UV spectra of samples from both aggregate types followed first order decay kinetics (Fig. 8 A). The time constants for Trp solvation for aggregates formed in the absence and presence of 0.75 GdnHCl were indistinguishable (3.3 ± 0.6 and 3.2 ± 0.7 h, respectively). Dissolution of both aggregates was monitored by following light scattering at 500 nm (Fig. 8 B). The decrease in light scattering for aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl displayed bimodal behavior, exhibiting a slower rate for the first 5 h, followed by an exponential phase after 5 h. For aggregates formed in buffer alone the decrease in light scattering is exponential throughout. The dissolution time constant for aggregates formed in buffer alone was 4.8 ± 0.1 h, whereas that for aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl was 10.1 ± 0.1 h. To estimate the volume associated with formation of the transition state leading to dissolution of rhGH molecules from aggregates, we determined dissolution rates as a function of pressure (Figs. 9, A and B). The activation volume ΔV* (the difference in partial molar volume between rhGH molecules in the aggregates and in the dissolution transition state) is calculated from Equation 2, −RT∂(lnk)∂P=ΔV∗Equation 2 were ΔV*, estimated from rates determined at three pressures for aggregates formed in buffer alone, was −19 ± 3 ml/mol (Fig. 9 A, inset), which was essentially the same as that (−23 ± 5 ml/mol) for aggregates formed in 0.75m GdnHCl (Fig. 9 B, inset). Conventional, chaotrope-based protein refolding techniques rely on powerful denaturants to solubilize proteins from aggregates. At chaotrope concentrations sufficient to solubilize the aggregates (e.g. 6 m GdnHCl), the protein is fully unfolded. Refolding occurs only when sufficient chaotrope is removed to once again favor the native state. If, by analogy, high hydrostatic pressure operates in a similar fashion, we would expect that the unfolded state would be favored at the high pressures required for aggregate dissolution, and refolding would commence only as pressures were lowered. Clearly this is not the case for aggregated rhGH. Under each of the conditions used to effect complete refolding of rhGH fro"

The finding that p160 co-activators interact with and co-activate the AR in an LXXLL motif-independent manner suggests that the mechanism of co-activator interaction with the AR is distinct from those of other NRs (27Bevan C.L.

Tip60 contains a single NR box at its extreme C terminus, which was proposed to mediate interaction with the AR (31Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol.

We show that Tip60 interacts with the AR in an LXXLL motif-dependent manner, which is also a requisite for Tip60-mediated AR up-regulation, indicating that Tip60 binds the AR in a manner distinct from that of the p160 family of co-activators. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Tip60 specifically interacts with class I NRs, including estrogen receptor-α (ERα), estrogen receptor-β (ERβ), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and fails to up-regulate class II NRs, suggesting a specific role for Tip60 in class I NR-mediated gene expression. The plasmid pACT2-Tip60-(70–513) (31Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol.

In the first round of a two-step polymerase chain reaction method, using Bio-X-Act proofreading DNA polymerase enzyme (Bioline), the following primer combinations were used to generate 600-base pair 3′-fragments of Tip60 containing the individual NR box leucine to alanine mutations: L493A, ATGCGAAAGCGGCTCCTCCGG-pACT2 and reverse (pACT2R) GGGTTTTTCAGTATCTAC; L496A, ATGCTCAAGCGGCGACTCCGG-pACT2R; and L497A, ATGCTCAAGCGGCTCCGACGG-pACT2R. These fragments were then used in combination with the pACT2 forward primer (pACT2F, GATGATGAAGATACCCCACCA) in a second round of PCR with pACT2-wt-Tip60 as template, to generate the Tip60-(70–513) mutant DNAs: Tip60L493A, Tip60L496A, and Tip60L497A, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into Zero-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the yeast vector pACT2 via the BamHI site, generating pACT2-Tip60L493A, -Tip60L496A, and -Tip60L497A. To generate Tip60-(70–363), PCR was performed with the reverse primer, CTCGAGATGCAGGCCACATTGTAG (which anneals to a site upstream from the NR box of Tip60), and pACT2F, using pACT2-wt-Tip60 as template. The product was cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently subcloned into the yeast vector pACT2 viaBamHI/XhoI sites. pAS2–1hAR-DS vector containing the DNA- and hormone-binding domains of the human AR has been described previously (31Brady M.E.

For the mammalian two-hybrid system, VP16AD-wt-Tip60, VP16AD-Tip60L493A, VP16AD-Tip60L496A, and VP16AD-Tip60L497A fusion proteins were generated by inserting the BamHI fragment from the respective pACT2 clones, utilizing a BamHI site located in the 3′-untranslated region of Tip60, downstream from the VP16 activation domain of pVP16 (CLONTECH). For VP16AD-Tip60-(70–363) subcloning, the BamHI/XbaI sites were used. The NR box-containing fragment of Tip60 (Tip60-(481–513)) was generated by PCR using NR-F, GGATCCATGAGGCCACAGATCACCATC, and pACT2R primers, using the pACT2-wt-Tip60 construct as template. The amplified product was cloned into the TA vector and then subcloned into pVP16 vector viaBamHI sites to generate the VP16AD-Tip60-(481–513) construct. The pM-hAR-DS was generated by inserting theBamHI fragment from pAS2–1hAR-DS downstream from the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of the pM mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH). PCR was performed with GR-F, GGATCCCTCTTAAACTCTGCCTC (anneals upstream from LBD of GR), and GR-R, GGATCCTCACTTTTGATGAAACAG (incorporates the stop codon of GR), using pRSVL-GR (gift from R. Evans, Salk Institute) as template, to generate GR-LBD. The product was cloned into TA vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently subcloned into the pM mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH) viaBamHI site to generate pM-GR-LBD. pVP16AD-TR was created by inserting the EcoRI fragment of pSG5-TR-LBD-424 (gift from K. Chatterjee, University of Cambridge) into the EcoRI site of pVP16AD. PCR was performed with VDR-F, GAATCCGAGTTCATTCTGACAGATGAG (anneals to a position flanking the VDR LBD), and VDR-R, GGATCCGGTGAAGGACTCATTGGAGCG (incorporates stop codon of VDR), using pSG5-VDR (gift from P. McDonald, Case Western Reserve University) as template to generate VDR-LBD. The product was cloned into TA vector and subsequently subcloned into pVP16AD via EcoRI site to generate pVP16AD-VDR-LBD. The pVP16AD-hAR-DS was created by inserting theBamHI fragment from pAS2–1hAR-DS downstream from the VP16AD of pVP16 via a BamHI site. All constructs were fully sequenced to verify DNA alterations. The pRSET-C-wt-Tip60, pT7-hAR-(1–918), pCDNA3-AR-(1–918), pPSAluc, pCMV-β-gal, Gal4DBD-wt-Tip60, pAS2–1hAR-DS, and UASTKLuc have all been described (31Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I.

COS-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1 × 104 COS-7 cells were routinely plated per well in 24 microtiter plates (Corning Glass). After 24 h, the cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In defining the AR-Tip60 interaction, transfection mixtures consisted of pCMV-β-Gal control plasmid (200 ng), UASTKLuc reporter (200 ng), which contains five repeats of the Gal4DBD element, pM-hAR-DS (50 ng), or pM-AR-DSG743V (gift from J. Palvimo, University of Helsinki, Finland) and the various VP16AD-Tip60 constructs (50 ng), including VP16AD-wt-Tip60, VP16AD-Tip60-(70–363), and VP16-Tip60-(481–513) (Fig. 2). pVP16 empty vector was used as an appropriate control for interaction with pM-hAR-DS. After 2 h, the cells were washed and incubated in 500 μl of RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FCS that had been stripped of steroids by treatment with dextran-coated charcoal with the addition of 10 nm mibolerone, a synthetic androgen, as indicated. After 48 h, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Promega). Luciferase activity was corrected for the corresponding β-galactosidase activity to give relative activity. β-Galactosidase assays were typically performed in a 96-well plate (Corning Glass) as follows: 10 μl of cell lysate and 10 μl of β-galactosidase assay reagent (2 mm MgCl2, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m Na2CO3.A 410 values were obtained using an MR500 plate reader (Dynatech), and relative luciferase activities were calculated as follows: luciferase activity/β-galactosidase activity. To investigate the nuclear hormone receptor specificity of Tip60, various Gal4DBD-nuclear hormone receptor bait constructs, including pCMX-Gal4-ERα-LBD, pCMX-Gal4-ERβ-LBD (gifts from Katarina Pettersson, Karolinska Institute, Sweden), pSG-RXR-424 (gifts from K. Chatterjee, University of Cambridge, UK), pSG5-Gal4-VDR (gift from P. McDonald, Case Western Reserve University), pM-hAR-DS, and pm-GR-LBD, together with VP16AD-wt-Tip60 fusion (50 ng), were transfected into COS-7 cells as above. After the 2-h transfection period, cells were washed and incubated as above in the presence of various ligands. Ligands including the synthetic androgen mibolerone for AR, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for VDR, and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) for RXR were used at 10 nm, whereas estradiol for ER-α/β, deoxycorticosterone for GR, and triiodothyronine for TR were used at 1 nm (Fig. 7 A). For experiments incorporating ERα and ERβ, cells were incubated in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS stripped with dextran-coated charcoal. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysates assayed as above. In the reciprocal mammalian two-hybrid analysis, experiments were performed exactly as above except Gal4DBD-wt-Tip60, pVP16AD-AR-DS, -TR-LBD, and -VDR-LBD were used. For the homodimerization assay, Gal4DBD-wt-Tip60, VP16AD-wt-Tip60, and empty pVP16 (as control) were introduced by transient transfection into COS-7. Two hours after transfection, cells were incubated in RPMI containing 10% FCS. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described above. To determine the effect of mutating the individual leucine residues of the NR box of Tip60, the pAS2-1hAR-DS vector was co-transformed into the yeast strain PJ69-4A together with pACT2-wt-Tip60 and individual leucine mutant constructs pACT2-Tip60L493A, -Tip60L496A, and -Tip60L497A. For control, empty pACT2 vector was transformed together with pAS2–1hAR-DS. Subsequent yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed as described previously (31Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I.

To assess the role of the LXXLL motif in the enhancement of AR-mediated transactivation, BglII fragments of the pACT2-wt-Tip60 and pACT2-Tip60L497A were subcloned into the pCMV5 mammalian expression vector, downstream from the CMV promoter, producing the pCMV-wt-Tip60 and pCMV-Tip60L497A constructs. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected, using Superfect, with the following DNA: pCMV-β-Gal control plasmid (200 ng), pPSAluc (200 ng), pCDNA3-AR-(1–918) (50 ng), and either pCMV-wt-Tip60 or pCMV-Tip60L497A (50 ng). To determine the specificity of Tip60-mediated co-activation, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected as above with pCMV-Tip60, pCMV-SRC-1 (31Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S.

Ozono, Osaka Medical Center, Japan) and pSG5-TRβ0 (gift from Bjorn Vennstrom, Karolinska Institute, Sweden) and the respective reporters, pVDRE (which contains three VDR response elements; gift from K. Ozono) and pB2-TRE (which contains two TR response elements; gift from Martin Privalsky, University of California). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was determined as above. pRSET-C-Tip60L497A was constructed via excision of a BamHI fragment from pACT2-Tip60L497A and subcloned into pRSET-C viaBamHI site. Briefly, 5 μg of each vector was purified using GeneClean (Anachem Chemicals) and resuspended in nuclease-free water. By using the in vitro coupled transcription and translation kit (T7-TNT; Promega) incorporating [35S]methionine, pRSET-C-wt-Tip60, pRSET-C-Tip60L497A, pASG4-Sap-1a, and pT7-hAR-(1–918) proteins were produced according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The recombinant proteins were combined equally on ice, as indicated, and immunoprecipitation reaction was performed as reported previously (31Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S.

It was demonstrated previously (31Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) that Tip60 is capable of a direct, hormone-dependent interaction with a C-terminal portion of the androgen receptor (AR) containing both the DNA- and hormone-binding domains (DS domain) and can enhance AR-mediated transactivation, implying that Tip60 is a bona fide co-activator molecule for the AR. In an attempt to define further the function of Tip60 as a co-activator for the AR, we sought to examine the mechanism of Tip60-AR interaction. Tip60 contains a single LXXLL motif between residues 493 and 497. LXXLL motifs have been shown to bind directly a region within the AF-2 of NRs (22McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 23Darimont B.D.

Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar), and thus we hypothesized that the lone LXXLL motif of Tip60 mediates the AR LBD interaction. To this end, we generated a C-terminal deletion of Tip60, Tip60-(70–363) (Fig. 1), which lacks the extreme 150 C-terminal residues including the LXXLL motif, and together with wt-Tip60, tested for the ability to bind the AR DS domain, using the mammalian two-hybrid system in COS-7 cells. In the presence of 10 nm synthetic androgen, mibolerone, wt-Tip60 interacted specifically with the DS domain of the AR, whereas Tip60-(70–363) failed to interact (Fig. 2). The values obtained in the presence and absence of mibolerone for Tip60-(70–363) were comparable, demonstrating a complete lack of binding upon removal of the C-terminal 150 amino acids, suggesting that the LXXLL motif is a potential requisite for AR LBD interaction. To delineate further the region involved in receptor binding, a shorter LXXLL-containing fragment was generated, encompassing 12 amino acids N-terminal and 16 residues C-terminal to the NR box, Tip60-(481–513) (Fig. 1), and we tested for AR LBD binding using the mammalian two-hybrid system. We demonstrated that in the presence of mibolerone, the Tip60-(481–513) fragment interacts with the DS domain of the AR to levels observed with wild-type Tip60 (Fig. 2), supporting the notion that the single NR box of Tip60 is sufficient for AR LBD interaction. Secondary structure analysis of several co-activator molecules has revealed that the individual leucine residues of the LXXLL motif align upon one face of an α-helix, generating a hydrophobic interface for LBD interaction (21Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar,24Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Disruption of the hydrophobic peptide sequence, through replacement of the leucine residues with alanines, has proved to abolish NR binding of several co-activator molecules, including SRC-1, RIP-140 (21Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar), and GRIP-1 (12Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). By having established that a 33-amino acid C-terminal peptide of Tip60 is sufficient to bind to the DS domain of the AR, we hypothesized that binding was mediated predominantly through the NR box of Tip60. We introduced individual leucine residue mutations into the single NR box of Tip60 to assess directly the role of the LXXLL motif in ligand-dependent AR interaction. Each of the leucine residues was replaced with alanines forming three separate Tip60 NR box mutants as follows: Tip60L493A, Tip60L496A, and Tip60L497A which lack the first, second, and third leucine residues of the NR box, respectively, but retain the rest of the wild-type sequence (Fig. 1). By using the yeast two-hybrid system, the NR box mutants were tested for hormone-dependent AR LBD binding. As shown in Fig. 3, in the presence of dihydrotestosterone, the relative binding activity of the three mutants remained at basal level, whereas an expected increase in AR-binding was observed with wt-Tip60, indicating that the NR box mutants were incapable of a direct interaction with the AR LBD. To confirm the above results, the NR box mutants were tested for AR interaction in the mammalian two-hybrid system. In the presence of mibolerone, Tip60L493A, Tip60L496A, and Tip60L497A failed to interact with the AR LBD, whereas wt-Tip60 specifically interacted with the AR LBD (results not shown). Furthermore, in an attempt to define a region of the AR targeted for Tip60 binding, we found wt-Tip60 incapable of interaction with the AR LBD mutant, AR-LBDG743V (results not shown), which contains a glycine to valine substitution at position 743 and has been shown to disrupt the integrity of the LBD, suggesting that Tip60 may target a region encompassing Gly-743 of the LBD for binding. Together, results from the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems confirm that each of the leucine residues of the LXXLL motif are required for successful AR LBD interaction, and a region at the extreme C terminus, including residues of the AF-2, may be involved in Tip60 interaction. Previous studies (27Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 32Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A.

Wild-type Klebsiella aerogenes UreE binds approximately six nickel ions per homodimer, whereas H144*UreE (a functional C-terminal truncated variant) was previously reported to bind two. We determined the structure of H144*UreE by multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction and refined it to 1.5 Å resolution. The present structure reveals an Hsp40-like peptide-binding domain, an Atx1-like metal-binding domain, and a flexible C terminus. Three metal-binding sites per dimer, defined by structural analysis of Cu-H144*UreE, are on the opposite face of the Atx1-like domain than observed in the copper metallochaperone. One metal bridges the two subunits via the pair of His-96 residues, whereas the other two sites involve metal coordination by His-110 and His-112 within each subunit. In contrast to the copper metallochaperone mechanism involving thiol ligand exchanges between structurally similar chaperones and target proteins, we propose that the Hsp40-like module interacts with urease apoprotein and/or other urease accessory proteins, while the Atx1-like domain delivers histidyl-bound nickel to the urease active site.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3233-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Park I.S. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Moncrief M.B.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4081-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and are suggested to act as a molecular chaperone for activation (7Hausinger R.P. Colpas G.J. Soriano A. ASM News. 2001; 67: 78-84Google Scholar). In vitro activation and mutagenesis studies of the largest of these complexes, UreD-UreF-UreG-urease apoprotein (UreDFG-apourease), reveal that UreG functions as a GTPase during activation (12Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Urease within the UreDFG-apourease complex can be fully activated in the presence of nickel, bicarbonate (for lysine carbamylation), GTP, and UreE (13Soriano A. Colpas G.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12435-12440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The latter protein is proposed to function as a “metallochaperone” by delivering nickel ions to UreDFG-apourease (14Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The metal-binding properties of wild-type UreE and H144*UreE, which has 15 residues truncated C-terminally, have been extensively characterized (15Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. McCracken J. Pressler M.A. Babcock G.T. Ming L.J. Colangelo C.M. Scott R.A. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10731-10737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The wild-type protein binds approximately six nickel ions per homodimer in distorted octahedral geometry with an average of three-five histidine donors per metal ion (14Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G.

Most of these ligands are presumed to derive from the C-terminal fragment that contains 10 histidines within the last 15 residues. H144*UreE lacking the His-rich region is competent for activating urease in vivo (15Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but was reported to bind only two nickel ions per dimer; thus, internal ligands, not the histidine residues at the C terminus, are necessary for UreE to assist in K. aerogenes urease activation (15Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on extensive mutagenesis and spectroscopic studies of H144*UreE, a model for the critical nickel-binding sites was proposed (17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Structural information of UreE is desired to test the validity of this model and to identify potential residues involved in interaction with urease. Major advances have been made in understanding the structure and function of copper metallochaperones in recent years (19Rosenzweig A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 20O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar); however, structural information on chaperones for other metals is lacking. Here we provide the first view of a suspected metallochaperone for nickel incorporation. The H144*UreE structure reveals a unique two-domain architecture with one domain structurally related to a heat shock protein and the second to the Atx1 copper metallochaperone. Significantly, the metal-binding sites in UreE and Atx1 are distinct in location and types of residues despite the relationship between these proteins. In contrast to the thiol ligand exchange mechanism used by the copper metallochaperones (21Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 22Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), we propose a distinct mechanism for UreE activation of urease. Recombinant H144*UreE and two of its variants (H91A and H110A) were purified as described previously (17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), except that the host cells used were Escherichia coli B834(DE3). Protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and then concentrated to 15 mg/ml. Crystallization was performed by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 22 °C. The reservoir solution for crystallization of the H91A mutant (native and Se-Met1 substituted) consisted of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, containing 18–19% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and 200 mmcalcium acetate. For cryo-cooling, a crystal was transferred to reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol before flash-freezing in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. The H91A mutant crystallized in the P21 space group with unit cell parameters of a = 43.88, b = 129.36, c = 56.79 Å, and β = 93.72°. The asymmetric unit contains four molecules of the polypeptide. The H110A mutant crystallized in a different form using slightly different crystallization conditions (100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 19–20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and 200 mmmagnesium acetate). The crystal belongs to the P212121 space group with unit cell parameters of a = 40.11, b = 80.42, and c = 99.85 Å. The asymmetric unit contains a dimer. Due to a lack of reproducibility of the native crystals, the structure was determined by using multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction data collected from a crystal of the Se-Met-substituted H91A variant (TableI). Data were collected on a charge-coupled device detector at the BW6 beamline of the Deutsche Elektronen Synchrotron Center, Hamburg, Germany. Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL software package (23Minor W. Tomchick D. Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Fifteen of 16 possible selenium sites (including four N-terminal methionine) in the H91A asymmetric unit were located with SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The phases were improved and extended to 1.5 Å with DM (25Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallog. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). The initial model was built using the warpNtrace option of the program ARP/warp (26Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) with the DM phase set as input. The model was rebuilt with the program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) using an electron density map based on the combination of the multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction and model phases. The protein model was refined with CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar), including the bulk solvent correction. The 4-fold noncrystallographic symmetry was maintained with tight restraint during the early stages of refinement but was relaxed in the final rounds. The model of the H144*UreE (H91A) mutant (Se-Met substituted) accounts for 138 residues in three molecules and 140 residues in one molecule. No electron density was observed for the C-terminal segments (139). Solvent molecules were added using model-phased difference Fourier maps by using CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). Statistics for the refined model are described in Table I. Subsequently, the structure of H144*UreE (H91A) complexed with Cu2+ ions was also refined (Table I). The positions of the metals were clearly determined by using model-phased difference Fourier map at 8 ς and confirmed by the anomalous difference Fourier map. The initial phases of the H144*UreE (H110A) crystal were determined by the molecular replacement method using AmoRe (29Navaza J. Acta Cryst. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Refinement of the model was performed as above. The geometry of the models was assessed by the program PROCHECK (30Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Hutchinson E. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the secondary structure elements were assigned by the program PROMOTIF (31Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Coordinates of the Se-Met-substituted H144*UreE (H91A), this protein complexed with Cu2+, and H144*UreE (H110A) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under ID codes 1gmu, 1gmw, and 1gmv, respectively. The H144*UreE homodimer has an elongated shape with approximate dimensions of 90 × 43 × 32 Å (Fig. 1a). Each monomer folds into two discrete domains with approximate dimensions of 58 × 32 × 30 Å (Fig. 1b). The first domain (termed the peptide-binding domain; residues 1–70) consists of two β-sheets (A1, Leu-2-Leu-4; A2, Arg-29-Thr-33; A3, Asp-39-Leu-43; and B1, Gln-6-Arg-7; B2, Ala-16-Leu-20; B3, Val-55-Ser-57; B4, Phe-64-Ala-69) and a short α-helix (H1, Ile-22-Arg-25), while the second domain (termed the metal-binding domain; residues 71–133) consists of an anti-parallel β-sheet (C1, Asp-71-Arg-78; C2, Gln-100-Met-102; C3, Glu-105-His-109; C4, Val-125-Pro-131) and two α-helices (H2, Pro-82-Asn-94; and H3, His-112-Arg-119). The C-terminal tail is flexible and would be followed by a characteristic histidine-rich segment (10 of the last 15 residues) in the wild-type UreE protein (15Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A superposition of the four refined models (two crystal forms with dimers in the asymmetric unit) shows that the peptide-binding domain and the C terminus are flexible (Fig. 1c), consistent with the dramatic B-factor distribution of a monomer in the H110A structure (Fig. 1d). The average B-factors of the N- and C-domains in a monomer of this protein are 91.5 and 37.9 Å2. A long α-helix (H2), a short β-strand (C2), their connecting loop, and a portion of C-terminal tail are involved in dimerization (Fig. 1a). For both crystal forms the dimer interface is composed of the following residues: Pro-82, Phe-83, Leu-85, Ala-86, Lys-87, Cys-89, Tyr-90, His-91, Gly-93, Asn-94, His-96, Val-97, Pro-98, Leu-99, Ile-101, Met-102, Pro-103, Glu-135, and Gly-137. The interface accessible surface area is ∼810 Å2 per monomer (biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server). This value is within the frequently observed range of the minimal buried surface area required for stable dimer association (32Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). This dimer interface is the most rigid part in the structure as shown in Fig. 1, c and d. Comparison to proteins in the DALI data base (33Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) indicated structural similarity (Z = 2.8) between the first domain of H144*UreE (residues 1–70) and the peptide-binding domain (domain I; residues 180–255) of yeast Hsp40 or Sis1 (34Sha B. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Structure. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, c and d). A superposition of structurally equivalent residues in several secondary structural elements of UreE and the corresponding residues in Sis1 (PDB ID 1C3G) yields an r.m.s. deviation of 2.7 Å for 51 matching Cα atoms (UreE residues 15–32, 39–43, and 48–74). Many molecular chaperone/unfoldase proteins, including Hsp40, are known to utilize hydrophobic patches to form transient complexes with hydrophobic residues exposed in non-native peptides (35Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 36Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). For example, domain I of Sis1 has a hydrophobic depression formed by residues Val-184, Leu-186, Ile-203, and Phe-251, and this was proposed as a binding site for interaction with non-native peptides (34Sha B. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Structure. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, UreE possesses a long hydrophobic canyon beginning in the putative peptide-binding domain (albeit at a different location that the hydrophobic region of Sis1) and extending into the metal-binding domain and C-terminal tail (Fig.3a). In addition, many hydrophobic residues are located on the opposite surface of the suggested UreE peptide-binding domain (Fig. 3c). We presume that several of these residues are crucial for transient interaction of UreE with urease and/or the other accessory proteins, UreD, UreF, and UreG. The UreE variants examined thus far (Fig. 3, b andd) have focused on potential metal ligands (16Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. McCracken J. Pressler M.A. Babcock G.T. Ming L.J. Colangelo C.M. Scott R.A. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 150-160Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and provide no insight into possible functions associated with these hydrophobic regions. As described above, the peptide-binding domain is not well ordered possibly as a consequence of lack of crystal packing. It may also be an intrinsic structural property (Fig. 1d) as expected for a module involved in transient protein-protein interactions. The illustrated conformation of UreE may differ from that when UreE interacts with its partners. Further biochemical and mutagenesis studies on this domain are needed to see whether this module has a peptide-binding role during urease activation.Figure 3Surface representations of H144*UreE.a and c, residues forming the hydrophobic surfaces of UreE are colored green and labeled. Bound-copper ions are shown as red balls. b andd, residues that have previously been subjected to mutagenesis are colored magenta and labeled in one subunit, and those in the other are colored blue and labeled with a prime (′).

Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar), a notable structural similarity (Z score > 2.0) was found in 89 proteins. Representatives showing the highest structural similarity are the pro-(activation) domain of procarboxypeptidase A2 (Z = 5.5), copper metallochaperone Atx1 (Z = 5.4), elongation factor G (Z = 5.2), the fourth metal-binding domain of Menkes copper-transporting ATPase (Z = 5.1), and domain 1 of the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (Z = 4.5). The Atx1-like folding unit of these proteins shares an identical topology with the metal-binding domain of UreE (Fig. 2, a and b). The putative nickel metallochaperone metal-binding domain is very similar in overall structure to Atx1 despite a lack of overall sequence similarity (37Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure. 1999; 7: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Superpositioning of structurally equivalent residues in several secondary structural elements of UreE and Atx1 (PDB ID 1CC8) yields an r.m.s. deviation of 1.9 Å for 50 matching Cα atoms (UreE residues 75–96, 98–109, 111–122, and 126–129, excluding parts that show large deviations). Despite sharing a common folding pattern, a significant structural difference exists between the metal-binding domain of UreE and Atx1. Specifically, Atx1 is known to be a monomer in solution (21Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), whereas UreE is a dimer in the presence or absence of nickel ions (14Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The human homologue of Atx1 is a homodimer, but the intersubunit contacts for Hah1 (22Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) differ from that observed in UreE. Further studies involving mutagenesis and biophysical analysis are necessary to better understand the possible role of subunit interactions in the catalytic function of the UreE urease accessory protein. Efforts to crystallize H144*UreE in the presence of nickel ions were not successful and addition of nickel ions to preformed crystals led to their dissolution. These results parallel the reported inability to crystallize full-length wild-type UreE with nickel and the fracturing of wild-type apoprotein crystals upon nickel addition (14Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As an alternative to obtaining the nickel-bound structure, we solved the copper-bound form of H144*UreE for which the metal binding properties are well characterized (17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Colpas G.J. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10731-10737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After soaking 50 mm CuSO4 solution into pre-grown UreE crystals for 2 h, the copper-binding sites were readily located in the (Fo−Fc) difference Fourier and anomalous difference maps (Fig. 4). The UreE dimer binds three copper ions (Fig. 1a), consistent with the reported three sequential Cu2+ binding steps observed by kinetics (18Colpas G.J. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10731-10737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The pair of His-96 residues binds one copper atom between the subunits, whereas the other two copper sites involve His-110 and His-112 from within each subunit (Fig. 4). These are the same three pairs of residues implicated by mutagenesis studies in nickel ion binding (17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); however, equilibrium dialysis measurements have consistently shown only two nickel ions bound per H144*UreE (15Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We suggest that aberrant reactivity of UreE with protein assay reagents may have resulted in an underestimation of nickel binding by this protein. Significantly, only His-96 is conserved in all reported UreE sequences (17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, there is little conformational change in the main-chain between free and copper-complexed states (an r.m.s. deviation of less than 1.0 Å including the C-terminal tail) except for a dramatic side chain movement of His-112. Several water molecules (one or two for each binding site) also coordinate Cu2+, but their relative positions differ as shown in Fig.4. Spectroscopic studies had earlier revealed a thiolate-to-Cu2+ charge-transfer transition in Cu2+-bound H144*UreE that was absent in the C79A variant (17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on these results, some of us had concluded that one Cu2+ site must bind Cys-79. In contrast, we detect no additional electron density near residue Cys-79 in the structure, and this position is quite distant from the experimentally determined Cu2+-sites (Fig. 3d). We suggest that the apparent discrepancy arises from comparison of solution studiesversus investigation of Cu2+ addition to crystals. Specifically, we propose that in solution Cys-79 of one dimer interacts with a copper site in another dimer, whereas crystal packing prevents this interaction in the solid state. Perhaps related to such a proposed aggregation event, we observe transient turbidity upon adding copper ions to H144*UreE solutions. Selective binding of Hg2+ to Cys-79 (along with Met-84) supports the proposal that this residue is accessible for metal binding (data not shown). Intriguingly, Cys-79 of UreE is structurally equivalent to the metal-binding Cys-15 of Atx1; thus, further highlighting the relationship between these proteins (Fig. 2, a andb). While the Atx1 thiol is one of two cysteines essential to its copper metallochaperone role, Cys-79 is not important to function of UreE (17Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Colpas G.J. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10731-10737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cys-89, located in helix H2, has no counterpart in Atx1 and is not available to bind metals because it is involved in subunit dimerization. While the structures of ureases from different sources (3Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 5Benini S.

Wieghardt K. Huber R. Poulos T.L. Messerschmidt A. Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., West Sussex, UK2001: 867-879Google Scholar), our understanding of how nickel is incorporated into the enzyme is very limited. Assembly of the dinuclear nickel center requires that the pre-organized apoprotein structure (38Jabri E. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10616-10626Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) be partially opened up to expose the deeply buried metal-binding sites. This process, along with carbamylation of a specific lysine residue, appears to be carried out by a GTP-dependent molecular chaperone comprised of UreD, UreF, and UreG that forms the UreDFG-apourease complex (7Hausinger R.P. Colpas G.J. Soriano A. ASM News. 2001; 67: 78-84Google Scholar). The role of nucleotide hydrolysis in urease activation remains unclear, but we speculate that it provides energy for conformational transitions like in the classical chaperone action (35Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 36Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). The putative metallochaperone UreE participates in urease activation by delivering nickel ions but may also function in the molecular chaperone process. In particular, the putative peptide-binding domain of UreE that shares very similar architecture to Sis1 domain I may bind to urease apoprotein or an accessory protein to control specific conformational changes needed for activation. Conformational changes within UreE or the UreDFG-apourease may be coupled to nickel transfer from the proposed metallochaperone to the urease apoprotein, perhaps via His-96. We speculate that nickel ions are delivered one at a time to form the dinuclear site in urease, perhaps with the His-110/His-112 sites acting as a nickel reservoir to facilitate that process. Notably, this mechanism is unrelated to the thiol ligand exchange reactions that occur during copper delivery by copper metallochaperones (21Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J.

Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It is also unrelated to the mechanism of iron sulfur cluster assembly mediated by NifS (39Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). UreE has counterparts involved in the activation of two other nickel-containing enzymes (40Watt R.K. Ludden P.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 604-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (41Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O. Science. 2001; 293: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and hydrogenase (42Volbeda A. Charon M.-H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). CooJ of Rhodospirillum rubrumcontains a C-terminal His-rich region and binds ∼4 Ni2+per monomer for incorporation into CO dehydrogenase (43Watt R.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10019-10025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HypB fromBradyrhizobium japonicum possesses a His-rich sequence at the N terminus, binds 18 Ni2+ per dimer, and is proposed to have a dual role of both storing and delivering the metal to apohydrogenase (44Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to suspect that CooJ and HypB perform similar roles with their target enzymes as UreE does in urease activation. Therefore, this structural study of UreE may provide more general insight into mechanisms of nickel enzyme activation. We thank G. Bourenkov and H. Bartunik for help with data collection at BW6 beamline of Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany.

https://openalex.org/W2077376582,"Although G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling is one of the best studied biological events, little is known about the kinetics of these processes in intact cells. Experiments with neurons from α2A-adrenergic receptor knockout mice suggested that the α2A-receptor subtype inhibits neurotransmitter release with higher speed and at higher action potential frequencies than the α2C-adrenergic receptor. Here we investigated whether these functional differences between presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptor subtypes are the result of distinct signal transduction kinetics of these two receptors and their coupling to G proteins. α2A- and α2C-receptors were stably expressed in HEK293 cells at moderate (∼2 pmol/mg) or high (17–24 pmol/mg) levels. Activation of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels was similar in extent and kinetics for α2A- and α2C-receptors at both expression levels. However, the two receptors differed significantly in their deactivation kinetics after removal of the agonist norepinephrine. α2C-Receptor-activated GIRK currents returned much more slowly to base line than did α2A-stimulated currents. This observation correlated with a higher affinity of norepinephrine at the murine α2C- than at the α2A-receptor subtype and may explain why α2C-adrenergic receptors are especially suited to control sympathetic neurotransmission at low action potential frequencies in contrast to the α2A-receptor subtype.

G protein-coupled receptor α2-adrenergic receptor G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel human embryonic kidney G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 transfer a large diversity of extracellular signals into the cell interior, including light, neurotransmitters, and hormones. Although GPCRs represent some of the best studied signaling molecules, relatively little information exists about the kinetics of signal transduction by these receptors (except for rhodopsin) in intact cells. However, more detailed knowledge about the kinetic properties of GPCR signal transduction would be of particular interest to determine the physiological significance of closely related receptor subtypes, which can be activated by the same endogenous agonist but differ in their biological function. Functional data on α2-adrenergic receptor subtypes suggest that they differ in their signaling kinetics. Interestingly, several physiological differences were identified between presynaptic α2A- and α2C-receptor subtypes (1Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In mouse atria, the α2A-subtype inhibited norepinephrine release at high stimulation frequencies whereas the α2C-receptor operated at lower levels of sympathetic nerve activity (1Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of norepinephrine release mediated by the α2A-subtype occurred much faster than inhibition by the α2C-receptor. These findings indicate that two presynaptic receptors in the inhibitory feedback loop of transmitter release may differentially regulate synaptic transmission. Several explanations may account for these functional differences. α2-Adrenergic receptor subtypes have been shown to differ in their signal transduction, agonist-dependent internalization and receptor trafficking, subcellular localization, and binding to intracellular scaffolding proteins (2Daunt D.A.

Kilbinger H. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 864-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Three subtypes of α2-adrenergic receptors have been identified in different species (12Bylund D.B. Eikenberg D.C. Hieble J.P. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Molinoff P.B. Ruffolo R.R. Trendelenburg U. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 121-136PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, transgenic mouse models lacking individual α2-receptor subtypes have been generated to define the physiological significance and therapeutic potential of these receptor subtypes (for reviews, see Refs. 16Docherty J.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 361: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 17MacDonald E. Kobilka B.K. Scheinin M. Trends Pharmacol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 142: 162-185Google Scholar). α2-Receptors are essential constituents of a negative feedback loop regulating presynaptic neurotransmitter release (15Starke K. Göthert M. Kilbinger H. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 864-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Experiments with gene-targeted mice lacking individual α2-adrenergic receptors have demonstrated that two α2-receptor subtypes, α2A and α2C, serve as presynaptic regulators in the sympathetic nervous system and in the central nervous system (1Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 19Trendelenburg A.U. Klebroff W. Hein L. Starke K. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 364: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mice lacking both of these receptors had enhanced circulating norepinephrine levels and developed cardiac hypertrophy and failure (1Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We therefore sought a simple experimental model to investigate potential differences in the speed of α2A- and α2C-receptor-mediated signaling and the role of receptor levels for signaling kinetics. We have determined the properties of these receptor subtypes to inhibit N-type Ca2+ channels or activate G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels in a heterologous expression system in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We found that, at similar levels of expression, α2A- and α2C-receptors did not differ in their activation kinetics, but the deactivation after receptor stimulation by norepinephrine was significantly slower for α2C- than for α2A-receptors. This finding is consistent with a higher affinity of norepinephrine for α2C- than for α2A-receptors. Different deactivation kinetics may account for part of the functional differences between presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptor subtypes to enhance the power of synaptic regulation and plasticity. HEK293 cells were stably transfected with the murine α2A- and α2C-adrenergic receptors using a pcDNA3 vector (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). After selection with 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), stable cell clones were screened by radioligand binding and homogeneity of receptor expression was controlled by immunofluorescence (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). α2A-AR-or α2C-AR-expressing cell lines were transiently transfected with a bicistronic expression vector encoding for GIRK1 and GIRK4 (kindly provided by Dr. L.Y. Jan, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA) as well as with πH3 plasmids encoding the CD8 receptors (0.15 μg/5-cm dish; kindly provided by Dr. G Yellen, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For GIRK deactivation studies, either rat RGS4 (in pcDNA3.1) or empty pcDNA3 vector (0.5 μg/5-cm dish) was added to the transfection reaction. 18–24 h after transfection, cells were replated onto poly-l-lysine-coated cell culture dishes and were used for experiments 40–50 h after transfection. Successfully transfected cells were detected by binding Dynabeads coated with anti-CD8 antibodies (Dynal ASA, Oslo, Norway) to the cells (20Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of N-type Ca2+ channels, G1A1 cells (Ref. 21Shekter L.R. Taussig R. Gillard S.E. Miller R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; cells provided by Dr. R. J. Miller with permission from SIBIA Neuroscience, La Jolla, CA) were transiently transfected with pCDNA3-α2A or pcDNA3-α2C (1 μg/5-cm dish) and πH3-CD8 (0.15 μg/5-cm dish) using Effectene. Immunofluorescence detection of α2-adrenergic receptor was performed as described previously (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) using α2A- and α2C-adrenergic receptor subtype-specific antibodies (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,22Hurt C.M. Feng F.Y. Kobilka B. J. Biol.

Expression levels of α2-adrenergic receptors were determined after lysis of cells with hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris, 2 mmEDTA, pH 7.4) as described (23Ceresa B.P. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29557-29564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]RX 821002 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) was used as radioligand, and nonspecific binding was determined by addition of 1 μmatipamezole (Orion Corp., Turku, Finland). For competition assays, 4 nm [3H]RX 821002 was used with equal amounts of α2A- and α2C-receptors (150 fmol) (24Pihlavisto M. Sjoholm B. Scheinin M. Wurster S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Inward currents through GIRK channels were measured by whole cell patch recording similar to that described previously (25Bünemann M. Meyer T. Pott L. Hosey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12537-12545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell membrane currents were measured at −90 mV holding potential and agonist-induced currents were activated by fast superfusion of the cells using a solenoid valve operated superfusion system (26Bünemann M. Liliom K. Brandts B.K. Pott L. Tseng J.L. Desiderio D.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Solution exchange occurred within less than 150 ms. Voltage ramps (from 120 mV to +60 mV in 500 ms, every 10 s) were used to determine current-voltage relationships. Barium currents through N-type Ca2+ channels were measured as described (27Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31186-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Depolarization-evoked Ba2+ currents were measured every 10 s using 25-ms test pulses of +10 mV (holding potential was −90 mV). All measurements were performed at room temperature. Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (GF-150-10, Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, United Kingdom) using a horizontal puller (P-95, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The DC resistance of the filled pipettes ranged from 2 to 5 megohms. Membrane currents were recorded using either an EPC 9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) or an Axopatch 200 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Signals were analog-filtered using a low pass Bessel filter (1–3-kHz corner frequency). Data were digitally stored using computers equipped with the appropriate hardware/software package (ISO2 by MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany; or PULSE by HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) for voltage control, data acquisition, and data evaluation. For the measurement of GIRK currents, an extracellular solution of the following composition was used: 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3). The internal (pipette) solution contained: 100 mmpotassium aspartate, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mm GTP (pH 7.3). For measurement of barium currents through N-type Ca2+channels, the extracellular solution contained: 105 mmNaCl, 25 mm CsCl, 10 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3). The intracellular solution contained 130 mm CsCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES-CsOH, 5 mmMgATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mm GTP (pH 7.3). NaCl, KCl and MgCl2 were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); potassium aspartate, CaCl2, BaCl2, CsCl, ATP, GTP, EGTA, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany); and HEPES was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Results shown display means ± S.E. forn = 5–10 experiments if not stated otherwise, and statistically significant differences were determined by applying the Student's t test for two independent data sets (*,p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01). The ability of α2-adrenergic receptor subtypes α2A and α2C to activate GIRK currents or to inhibit N-type Ca2+ currents was initially tested in HEK293 cells transiently expressing either one of the receptor subtypes and GIRK channels or in HEK cells stably expressing N-type Ca2+channels composed of α1B-, β1B-, and α2δ-channel subunits (G1A1 cells; Ref. 21Shekter L.R. Taussig R. Gillard S.E. Miller R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Activation of both adrenergic receptors, α2A and α2C, led to inhibition of N-type Ca2+ currents (Fig. 1) and to activation of GIRK channels (Fig. 1). The time course of the phenylephrine-induced inhibition of Ba2+ currents through N-type Ca2+ channels was similar for the two α2-receptor subtypes (data not shown). In addition, the time course of the activation of GIRK currents was indistinguishable from the time course of the phenylephrine-induced inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels (Fig. 1). However, independent from the effector system, the time courses of α2-adrenergic responses were quite variable in this transient expression system, possibly because of cell to cell variability of the expression levels of the receptors. Therefore, we chose to investigate the signaling of both receptor subtypes in stable HEK293 cell lines expressing defined amounts of receptor. From a total of 48 cell lines with ∼0.1–50 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein, four cell lines were chosen for further experiments (Fig. 2). An intermediate level (2 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein) and a high level (17–24 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein) of receptor expression were used for all experiments. Lower expression levels of α2-receptors resulted in less reproducible Ca2+ channel inhibition or GIRK channel activation, respectively (data not shown). As previous studies had indicated that α2A- and α2C-receptors may differ in their plasma membrane targeting (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11von Zastrow M. Link R. Daunt D. Barsh G. Kobilka B. J. Biol.

As the GIRK channel activation kinetics by α2-receptors had been found to be similar to the kinetics of α2-receptor-mediated inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels, and as measurement of GIRK current activation allowed for a higher temporal resolution of the α2-response, we focused on these channels for detailed kinetic analysis of α2-receptor signaling.Figure 2Expression of α2A- and α2C-adrenergic receptors in HEK293 cells.

Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of α2-receptors by norepinephrine led to a concentration-dependent increase in steady-state GIRK currents (Fig. 3). In cells expressing similar levels of receptors, the concentration-response curves were indistinguishable for the α2A- and the α2C-receptor. For both receptor subtypes, the potency for norepinephrine was closely correlated with the density of receptor expression. A 10-fold increase in receptor expression led to a similar increase in the potency of norepinephrine to activate steady-state GIRK currents. To test whether the kinetics of α2-receptor activation differed between the two α2-receptor subtypes, the time course of GIRK current activation by norepinephrine was determined (Fig. 4). With increasing concentrations of norepinephrine (10 nm to 10 μm), the time for half-maximal GIRK activation decreased progressively. At 2 pmol/mg of α2-receptor expression, the half-times for GIRK activation were similar for α2A- and α2C-receptors at all three norepinephrine concentrations tested. Only at high receptor levels and at 10 μmnorepinephrine, concentrations 104 times the EC50, the activation of GIRK currents was significantly faster when activated via α2A-receptors (218 ± 13 ms) as compared with α2C-receptors (503 ± 29 ms,p < 0.05) (Fig. 4).Figure 4Activation kinetics of GIRK currents induced by norepinephrine. The activation of inward GIRK currents in response to fast superfusion with norepinephrine (using different concentrations) was recorded. Representative current recordings (left side, normalized to maximal responses) and summarized data for the time of half-maximal activation (right) are shown for cell lines expressing indicated levels of α2A- or α2C-receptors. Data shown represent means ± S.E. of 5–10 different cells derived from two to three different transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activation kinetics of norepinephrine-induced GIRK currents were not only dependent on the agonist concentration, but also correlated with the receptor expression level independent of the receptor subtype,e.g. the half-time for GIRK current activation by 10 nm norepinephrine decreased from 5.3 ± 1.1 s to 2.1 ± 0.3 s when α2A-receptor expression was increased from 2 pmol/mg to 17 pmol/mg (similar results were obtained for the α2C-receptor, Fig. 4). Thus, with the possible exception of maximal stimulation of high levels of α2-receptors, no subtype-specific differences could be identified for activation kinetics or steady-state GIRK currents. However, both parameters were greatly dependent on the level of receptor expression for the two α2-receptor subtypes. To search for subtype-specific differences in off-rates of α2-receptor-activated GIRK transients, the time course of deactivation of GIRK currents was monitored after rapid removal of norepinephrine (Fig. 5). For both α2-receptors, GIRK currents completely returned to base-line values within 60 s. However, a significant difference remained between the deactivation time courses of the two receptor subtypes; α2A-stimulated GIRK currents deactivated 2–3.5 times faster than α2C-stimulated GIRK currents (Fig. 5,b and c). This difference was the same at high receptor levels (Fig. 5, a and b) and at moderate levels (Fig. 5 c). For both receptor subtypes, the half-time for deactivation was similar at moderate and at high levels of receptor expression. To test whether different receptor affinities for norepinephrine are responsible for the observed deactivation kinetics, competition binding experiments were performed with HEK cells expressing α2A- and α2C-receptors. The K i values for norepinephrine were higher at the α2A-receptor (5.03 μm) than at the α2C-subtype (0.77 μm), indicating that, indeed, norepinephrine has a higher affinity for the α2C-receptor than for the α2A-receptor (Fig. 5 d). The higher affinity of norepinephrine for the α2C-receptor compared with the α2A-receptor suggested a slower time constant for the unbinding of the agonist from the α2C-receptor. We hypothesized this phenomenon to be responsible for the slower deactivation kinetics of the α2C-receptor-mediated responses. To rule out that the slower deactivation of the α2C-adrenergic receptor was caused by a post-receptor mechanism, the regulator of G protein-signaling protein, RGS4, was transiently overexpressed in these cells (Fig. 6). RGS4 has been shown to accelerate deactivation of G proteins 100–1000-fold (28Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and to substantially accelerate GIRK current deactivation after agonist removal (29Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 30Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). If indeed the slower deactivation of α2C-receptors were the result of decreased G protein inactivation, RGS4 overexpression should lead to enhanced turn-off rates of the G protein. However, addition of RGS4 did not affect the deactivation of α2-receptor-activated GIRK currents (Fig. 6). Interestingly, phenylephrine, an α-adrenergic receptor agonist with very low affinity, showed significantly faster deactivation of GIRK currents than norepinephrine, when used at equally potent concentrations (Fig. 6). These findings indicate that the agonist affinity rather than intrinsic receptor-G protein interaction determined the turning off rates of the α2-receptor evoked responses. Our study represents the first in which activation and deactivation of Gi protein signaling in intact cells were determined in dependence of defined amounts of receptor expression. No subtype-dependent differences were found in steady-state GIRK currents and their activation kinetics between α2A- and α2C-receptors expressed at moderate or at high levels in HEK293 cells. However, for both receptor subtypes, a 10-fold increase in receptor expression was correlated with a 2.5–3-fold acceleration of the GIRK current activation for both receptor subtypes. Most interestingly, α2A- and α2C-adrenergic receptors differed significantly in their deactivation kinetics. This finding may explain part of the functional differences between the two α2-receptor subtypes, which have been identified in mouse sympathetic neurons in vitro (1Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). At high stimulation frequencies of isolated mouse atria, norepinephrine release was primarily controlled by the α2A-receptor subtype, whereas at lower frequencies the α2C-receptor was the principle regulator of transmitter release (1Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Deactivation of norepinephrine-activated GIRK currents was significantly faster for the α2A- than for the α2C-receptor. This finding is consistent with the higher affinity (and thus slower dissociation kinetics) of norepinephrine for the α2C-subtype than for the α2A-receptor subtype (31Chruscinski A.J. Link R.E. Daunt D.A. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 186: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Deactivation of the α2C-receptor-induced GIRK currents occurred with faster kinetics, when the low affinity agonist phenylephrine was used instead of the endogenous agonist, norepinephrine. In addition, enhancing the rate of G protein inactivation by overexpressing RGS4 in these cells did not alter GIRK deactivation. Taken together, these results indicate that agonist dissociation rather than receptor-G protein interaction or a post-receptor effect was responsible for the slower turn-off rate of the norepinephrine-activated α2C-receptor. The finding of similar activation kinetics is in contrast to in vitro observations in intact sympathetic neurons where endogenous α2A-receptors can inhibit presynaptic transmitter release significantly faster than α2C-receptors (1Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Several possibilities remain to explain this discrepancy between the HEK293 cell data of this study and the situation in intact neurons. Expression levels may differ between α2-receptor subtypes. Indeed, in the central nervous system, ∼90% of α2-adrenergic receptors belong to the α2A-subtype, whereas only 10% are α2C-receptors (32MacMillan L.B. Hein L. Smith M.S. Piascik M.T. Limbird L.E. Science. 1996; 273: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The α2B-receptor is restricted to very few brain nuclei and thus does not contribute significantly to total brain α2-receptor binding. However, these data are based on radioligand binding experiments in membrane homogenates, and no data are available on receptor densities in presynaptic membranes. Selective targeting of α2-receptor subtypes to specific membrane domains has been shown in a number of different cell types (2Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,9Olli-Lahdesmaki T. Kallio J. Scheinin M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9281-9288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11von Zastrow M. Link R. Daunt D. Barsh G. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 763-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas α2A-receptors were always targeted to the plasma membrane, α2C-receptors were found in addition in an intracellular membrane compartment (22Hurt C.M. Feng F.Y. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35424-35431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Specific targeting of α2A- and α2C-receptors to distinct plasma membrane domains in intact neurons may account for differences in signaling kinetics because of their distance from the neurotransmitter release site or because of specific interaction with distinct intracellular messenger systems. Different modulatory pathways have been implicated in presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmission by G protein-coupled receptors (33Hille B. Trends Neurol. Sci. 1994; 17: 531-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), which also differ in their signaling kinetics. In sympathetic neurons norepinephrine, via Go, slowed the kinetics of Ca2+ current activation and a second, sustained reduction in Ca2+ current, via the inhibitory G protein, Gi, was also observed (5Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus further studies are required to test whether indeed α2A- and α2C-receptors in intact neurons in vivodiffer in their subcellular localization and/or intracellular signaling pathways. These studies demonstrate that subtype-specific differences in receptor signaling kinetics may be important avenues for future study to further understand the functional significance of GPCR subtype diversity.

They showed that the fusion protein was functional and exhibited the identical properties to those obtained by the coexpression of b0,+AT and rBAT. In addition, the mutant fusion protein whose light chain portion was mutated was not functional, confirming that the detected transport activity was due to the fusion protein itself and not to the associated oocyte endogenous light chain (24Pfeiffer R.

Twenty five nanograms of cRNAs were injected to each oocyte. For coexpression of Asc-2 and mouse 4F2hc or mouse rBAT, 12 ng of Asc-2 cRNA and 13 ng of mouse 4F2hc cRNA (21Fukasawa Y. Segawa H.

Groups of 6–8 oocytes were incubated in 500 μl of standard uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) or Na+-free uptake solution in which NaCl in the standard uptake solution was replaced by choline-Cl, containing 0.5–3.0 μCi of the radiolabeled compounds (17Segawa H.

Preliminary experiments to determine the time course of l-[14C]serine (100 μm) uptake into oocytes expressing the Asc-2-rBAT and Asc-2–4F2hc fusion proteins indicated that the uptake was linearly dependent on incubation time up to 30 min (data not shown). Therefore, in all the subsequent experiments, the uptake levels were measured over 30 min, and the values were expressed as pmol/oocyte/min. Km and Vmax values of amino acid substrates were determined using the Eadie-Hofstee equation based on the amino acid uptakes mediated by the Asc-2-rBAT fusion protein measured at 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μm forl-serine, l-alanine, l-threonine,l-cysteine, and l-glycine and at 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm for l-valine andl-leucine. The amino acid uptakes mediated by the Asc-2-rBAT fusion protein or Asc-2–4F2hc fusion protein were calculated as differences between the means of the uptakes by the oocytes injected with cRNA for the fusion proteins and those of the control oocytes injected with water. For the efflux measurement, 100 nl (10 nCi) ofl-[14C]serine (600 μm) was injected into the oocytes with a fine-tipped glass micropipette as described elsewhere (9Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A.

The individual oocytes were incubated for 5 min in ice-cold Na+-free uptake solution and then transferred to Na+-free uptake solution, with or without 100 μm nonradiolabeled l-serine, kept at room temperature (18–22 °C). The radioactivity in the medium and the radioactivity remaining in the oocytes were measured. The values were expressed as percent radioactivity (radioactivity in medium or that in oocytes)/(radioactivity in medium + radioactivity in oocytes) × 100% (9Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A.

For the uptake and efflux measurements in the present study, 6–9 oocytes were used for each data point. Each data point in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of uptake (n = 6–9). To confirm the reproducibility of the results, three separate experiments using different batches of oocytes and in vitrotranscribed cRNA were performed for each measurement.

Briefly, 3 days after injection of cRNAs, Xenopus oocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer at 4 °C overnight. Samples were dehydrated in graded alcohol series, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 3-μm thick sections, which were then deparaffinized and equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20.

In mammals, nuclear localization of the circadian regulators PER1–3 is controlled by multiple mechanisms, including multimerization with PER and CRY proteins. In addition, nuclear entry of mammalian PER1 (mPER1) can be regulated by a phosphorylation-dependent masking of its nuclear localization signal. Here we present evidence suggesting that nuclear localization of PER proteins is a dynamic process determined by both nuclear import and previously unrecognized nuclear export pathways. Examination of the subcellular localization of a series of truncated mPER1 proteins demonstrated that cytoplasmic localization is mediated by an 11-amino acid region with homology to leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs). Similar sequences were identified in mPER2 and mPER3 as well as in several insect PER proteins. The putative NESs from mPER1 and mPER2 were able to direct cytoplasmic accumulation when fused to a heterologous protein. Mutations in conserved NES residues and the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B each blocked the function of the NES. Full-length mPER1 was also exported from microinjectedXenopus laevis oocyte nuclei in an NES-dependent manner. The presence of a functional NES in mPER1 and mPER2 as well as related sequences in a variety of other PER proteins suggests that nuclear export may be a conserved and important feature of circadian regulators.

The timing of circadian clocks is established in a cell autonomous manner by interacting negative and positive transcription/translation-based negative feedback loops. The negative feedback loop begins by activating transcription of clock genes such as Period(Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) family members. The products of these clock genes then negatively regulate their own expression, thus setting up the rhythmic oscillations of gene expression that drive the circadian clock. To produce stable oscillations of gene expression with a period of 24 h, there must also be a delay between the production and the action of the inhibitory clock gene products. Several mechanisms may contribute to delayed repression of the circadian promoter, including proteolysis of the repressors, alterations in repressor activity by post-translational modification (e.g. phosphorylation), and regulation of nuclear accumulation by alterations in rates of nuclear entry and/or nuclear egress. Initial insights into the role of nuclear entry in the regulation of circadian rhythm came from studies on Drosophila. There, nuclear entry of the PERIOD (dPER)1 protein leads to repression of its own expression (4Curtin K.D. Huang Z.J. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 365-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A region of the dPER protein termed the cytoplasmic localization domain (CLD) (and recently recognized as a PAC domain often found carboxyl-terminal to PAS domains (5Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R674-R677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) maintains monomeric dPER in the cytoplasm, where it is phosphorylated and degraded. When the Drosophila TIMELESS (TIM) protein accumulates to sufficient levels, it heterodimerizes with dPER, masking the CLD and allowing nuclear entry of the complex (6Saez L. Young M.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 7Sehgal A. Rothenfluh-Hilfiker A. Hunter-Ensor M. Chen Y. Myers M.P. Young M.W. Science. 1995; 270: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Nuclear dPER/Drosophila TIM represses its own expression. Delayed nuclear entry of dPER therefore generates a temporal separation between protein production and the onset of negative feedback that allows the feedback loop to oscillate on a 24-h time scale. In mammals, PER function in circadian rhythm is less well understood. PER proteins are capable of partial repression of circadian promoters driven by the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimeric transcription factor, but the two CRYPTOCHROME proteins CRY1 and CRY2 appear to be much more potent repressors. Nonetheless, the PER proteins appear to be critical to proper clock function (8Bae K. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R.

The Per genes are rhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and Per1 andPer2 mRNAs are induced by light pulses during night (10Albrecht U. Sun Z.S. Eichele G. Lee C.C.

Furthermore, mice lacking intact Per2 have a short period that rapidly becomes arrhythmic in total darkness. The critical biochemical function of the PER proteins remain unclear. One clue to their function is their intracellular localization. Several immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that PER1 and PER2 accumulate in the nuclei of suprachiasmatic nucleus cells, suggesting a nuclear function (13Field M.D. Maywood E.S.

However, conflicting results have been obtained in studies of PER proteins transiently expressed in tissue culture (reviewed in Ref. 15Eide E.J. Virshup D.M. Chronobiol. Int. 2001; 18: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The picture that has emerged is of multiple distinct pathways for PER proteins to enter the nucleus. We found that murine PER1 (mPER1) expressed alone in HEK 293 cells is a nuclear protein and that nuclear accumulation requires a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) adjacent to the casein kinase Iε-binding site (16Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 17Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of mPER1 by casein kinase Iε leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of the protein. In other cell types, e.g. COS-7 cells, mPER1 and mPER2 expressed alone are cytoplasmic (18Takano A. Shimizu K. Kani S. Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Yagita K. Yamaguchi S. Tamanini F. van der Horst G.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Yasui A. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Okamura H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1353-1363PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms to relocate PER1 and PER2 to the nucleus have been described. CRYPTOCHROME proteins (CRY1 and CRY2) bind to the carboxyl terminus of mammalian PER proteins and facilitate their translocation into the nucleus (20Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P.

Virshup, manuscript in preparation. Additionally, mPER3 binding to mPER1 or mPER2 has been shown to contribute to nuclear localization of the heterodimer (19Yagita K. Yamaguchi S.

However, neither of these mechanisms appears to fully explain the nuclear entry of PER proteins since mice lacking either mPER3 or both CRY proteins still have nuclear mPER1. To better understand how the localization of PER proteins is determined, we examined the signals in the mPER1 protein that regulate its intracellular localization in HEK 293 cells. Domain analysis of mPER1 produced several unexpected results. First, in addition to the NLS of mPER1 at amino acids 824–851 (16Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the amino terminus of mPER1 is also required for nuclear localization of the protein, as its removal led to cytoplasmic localization of mPER1. Removal of the region of mPER1 homologous to the CLD of dPER had no effect on localization of the protein. Rather, cytoplasmic localization of mPER1 was mediated by an 11-amino acid sequence immediately carboxyl-terminal to the CLD. This domain contains a leucine-rich sequence with homology to a nuclear export signal (NES) (21Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The NESs of mPER1 and mPER2 are functional, as fusion of these regions to a nuclear localized yellow fluorescent protein (YFP-NLS) led to its cytoplasmic accumulation. Mutation of the NES and the inhibition of nuclear export by leptomycin B both prevented cytoplasmic localization. Nuclear export of PER proteins may be a general phenomenon since homologous sequences are present in mPER3 as well as in certain insect PER proteins. Finally, microinjection experiments using Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that full-length mPER1, but not mPER1 with a mutant NES, was exported from nuclei following nuclear injection of the protein. The ability of PER proteins to regulate circadian rhythm may therefore be determined by combined rates of nuclear export, nuclear import, and degradation. The expression constructs encoding Myc epitope-tagged full-length mPER1, Myc-tagged mPER1 protein fragment 496–1291 (Δ1–495), the tandem YFP, and the tandem YFP protein with the NLS (amino acids 709–921 from mPER1) fused to the carboxyl terminus of the second YFP (YFP-NLS) have been previously described (16Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding Myc tagged-mPER1 protein fragments 206–1291 (Δ1–205) and 485–1291 (Δ1–484) were constructed using QuikChange (Stratagene) to create an EcoRI site in the DNA sequence that encodes either amino acids 204 and 205 or amino acid 483, respectively, in the full-length mPER1 construct. These mutagenized constructs were cut with EcoRI to excise the DNA fragment encoding either amino acids 1–205 or 1–484, respectively, and religated. The CLD/NES regions of mPER1 and mPER2 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the YFP-NLS construct between BspEI and HindIII. These new CLD/NES constructs were then mutagenized with QuikChange to create the various NES mutants. The YFP-NLS construct containing only the NES of mPER1 was made by introducing an EcoRV site into the +P1-(411–498) (where P1 indicates the mPER1 protein) construct with QuikChange, followed byEcoRV digestion and religation of the vector. All of the constructs described above were sequenced to ensure that the introduced mutations or sequences were correct. In addition, all of the mPER1 constructs were expressed in in vitrotranscription/translation reactions (TnT, Promega) to confirm expression of a protein of the expected size. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2. The cells were transfected when they reached 70–90% confluence in six-well dishes with 0.5–1 μg of total plasmid DNA using Opti-MEM and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were allowed to proceed for 3 h. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were replated on poly-l-lysine-treated glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were replated on glass coverslips, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After three more washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and washed again with PBS with 1% goat serum. The cells that were transfected with the various YFP constructs were incubated with Hoechst 33258, washed three times with PBS with 1% goat serum, and mounted onto slides with Antifade (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells that were transfected with the various mPER constructs were incubated with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 dye (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and Hoechst 33258 for 1 h in PBS with 1% goat serum. Cells were visualized using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope (magnification × 60), and images were captured using mFISH software (Vysis, Inc.). Images were assembled using Photoshop Version 4.0 (Adobe) and Canvas Version 6.01 (Deneba Software). Excel 98 (Microsoft) was used for graphical analysis of the data. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with either 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB) or vehicle for 4 h prior to immunofluorescence microscopy. LMB was a generous gift from Minoru Yoshida (University of Tokyo). The proteins indicated in Fig. 5 were synthesized in programmed rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TnT, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. The various mPER1 proteins were mixed with the luciferase protein, and 5–7 nl of the protein mixture was injected into the nuclei of X. laevisoocytes kept at 4 °C. Following the injections, the oocytes were incubated at 18 °C for the indicated times. At the end of the incubation period, the nuclei were removed from individual oocytes by manual microdissection as previously described (22Ullman K.S. Shah S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 649-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), except that harvest buffer volumes were reduced, and the acetone precipitation was omitted. Individual nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were then mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amount of each 35S-labeled protein was quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant Version 1.11 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Each experiment was performed in duplicate on at least three separate occasions. Previous analysis of the subcellular localization of mPER1 transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells indicated that the protein is localized predominantly in the nucleus. Further analysis revealed that casein kinase Iε can alter the subcellular localization of mPER1 through a phosphorylation-dependent masking of the NLS and suggested that the NLS is the predominant regulator of mPER1 subcellular localization (16Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A similarly located NLS has been identified in mPER3 (19Yagita K. Yamaguchi S. Tamanini F. van der Horst G.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Yasui A. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Okamura H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1353-1363PubMed Google Scholar). However, all three PER proteins also contain a conserved CLD related in sequence to the functionally identified dPER CLD. To determine the role of additional domains within mPER1 in its subcellular localization, several amino-terminal truncations of mPER1 were analyzed (Fig. 1 A). Although full-length mPER1 was predominantly nuclear when expressed in HEK 293 cells, deletion of the first 205 amino acids (Δ1–205) resulted in a protein that was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B). This suggests that there is a functional NLS in this region. Computer-aided inspection of the amino acid sequence in this region identified a potential SV40 large T antigen-like NLS between amino acids 150 and 158. However, mutation of key basic residues in this putative NLS sequence had no effect on the nuclear localization of the mPER1 protein (data not shown). Furthermore, fusion of this putative NLS sequence to a green fluorescent protein-β-galactosidase carrier protein did not drive nuclear localization of the fusion protein (data not shown). Taken together, these data imply that amino acids 150–158 do not encode a functional NLS, but that region 1–205 is important for the nuclear localization of mPER1 through an as yet unidentified mechanism. Further amino-terminal truncations of mPER1 that deleted the PAS A domain (Δ1–328) or the PAS A and B domains (Δ1–416) had no further effect on the subcellular localization of mPER1 (data not shown). Likewise, deletion of the PAS A and B domains and the CLD (Δ1–484) (Fig. 1 A) also produced a protein that was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B). This result was unexpected considering that the CLD is required for the cytoplasmic localization of dPER in S2 cells (6Saez L. Young M.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and mPER3 in COS-7 cells (19Yagita K. Yamaguchi S. Tamanini F. van der Horst G.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Yasui A. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Okamura H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1353-1363PubMed Google Scholar). However, further truncation of the protein by 11 amino acids (Δ1–495) (Fig. 1 A) resulted in a protein that accumulated predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that unlike the dPER protein, the CLD is not required for the subcellular localization of mPER1. Instead, the region between amino acids 485 and 495 of mPER1 appears to be required for the cytoplasmic localization of this protein, although in the context of the full-length protein, the effect of this region is overridden by sequences in the amino terminus. An analysis of the sequence around region 485–495 that is required for mPER1 cytoplasmic localization revealed a leucine-rich stretch of amino acids homologous to an NES motif between amino acids 486 and 498 (Fig. 2) (21Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). NESs bind to the CRM1/exportin-1 nuclear export receptor and mediate CRM1-dependent nuclear export of NES-containing proteins (23Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The presence of this putative NES within mPER1 could explain why this region is required for the cytoplasmic localization of mPER1. Similar hydrophobic regions are also present in other PER proteins, including mammalian PER1–3 and possibly Drosophila and silkmoth (Antheraea pernyi) PER proteins as well (Fig. 2). The ability of the putative NES of mPER1 to direct nuclear export of a heterologous protein was tested using fragments of mPER1 fused to a nuclear targeted tandem YFP (YFP-NLS) (16Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Fusion of the CLD and NES of mPER1 (+P1-(411–498)) re-localized YFP-NLS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in >90% of the cells (Fig.3, A, B, andD). To determine whether the putative NES alone is sufficient for directing the cytoplasmic localization of the YFP protein, amino acids 485–498 alone were fused to YFP-NLS (Fig. 3,A, B, and D). Again, this region alone was sufficient to re-localize YFP-NLS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As a further test of the role of the NES in PER1 nuclear export, three conserved hydrophobic residues were mutated to either alanine or lysine (Fig. 3 A). Mutation of the NES (+P1-(411–498)mut NES) prevented the cytoplasmic accumulation of the YFP fusion protein, whereas the protein with the wild-type NES (+P1-(411–498)) was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3,B and D). These data support the hypothesis that the putative NES (and not the CLD) mediates cytoplasmic localization of mPER1 and are consistent with the results of the deletion studies in mPER1 (Fig. 1). Cytoplasmic accumulation of NES-containing proteins is due to nuclear export, frequently mediated by the nuclear export receptor CRM1. To determine whether the cytoplasmic localization of the YFP-CLD/NES fusion protein is mediated by CRM1-dependent nuclear export, cells expressing either the nuclear localized YFP protein (YFP-NLS) or the YFP-CLD/NES fusion protein (+P1-(411–498)) were treated with the CRM1-specific nuclear export inhibitor LMB (24Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). As expected, LMB treatment had no effect on the nuclear localization of the YFP-NLS protein (Fig. 3 C, upper right panels). However, LMB prevented the cytoplasmic accumulation of the YFP-CLD/NES fusion protein (Fig. 3, C, lower right panels; and D). These data suggest that the CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway is either directly or indirectly involved in mediating the cytoplasmic localization of this YFP-CLD/NES fusion protein. Similar to mPER1, putative NES sequences were identified in a region carboxyl-terminal to the CLDs in mPER2 and mPER3 (Fig. 2). However, the putative NES sequence in mPER2 differs from that of mPER1 and the consensus sequence due to the presence of a methionine instead of a leucine in the last position of the sequence. To test whether the related mPER2 sequences could direct the cytoplasmic localization of a heterologous protein, the CLD/NES region (amino acids 382–469) of mPER2 was fused to the YFP-NLS protein (Fig.4 A). Similar to the results seen with the NES of mPER1, the CLD/NES of mPER2 (+P2-(382–469), where P2 indicates the mPER2 protein) also directed YFP-NLS to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, both the triple-point mutant within the NES sequence (+P2-(382–469)mut NES) and LMB treatment similarly prevented cytoplasmic localization of the YFP-NLS protein (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, a single-point mutation in the mPER2 NES sequence that changed the terminal methionine to lysine (+P2-(382–469)M224K) also had a significant effect on the subcellular localization of YFP-NLS (Fig. 4 B). The corresponding single-amino acid substitution in the mPER1 NES (L224K) had very little effect on the subcellular localization of the YFP-NLS protein (data not shown). These data indicate that a methionine in the terminal position of the NES sequence functions as well as a leucine and that this terminal residue in the sequence is more important for the function of the mPER2 NES than it may be in the mPER1 NES, at least in the context we utilized. Furthermore, the ability of this NES sequence to function as an NES appears to be conserved in other mammalian PER proteins. For example, the CLD/NES region of mPER3 (amino acids 321–407) was similarly able to drive cytoplasmic accumulation when fused to YFP (data not shown). The results described above established that there is a domain in mPER1 and mPER2 capable of promoting nuclear export in protein fragments and when fused to a heterologous reporter. To determine whether the full-length mPER1 protein undergoes nuclear export in vivo, [35S]methionine-labeled mPER1 was microinjected into the nuclei of X. laevis oocytes. [35S]Methionine/luciferase was co-injected as an internal control for localization of the initial injection. At specific time points following microinjection, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from individual oocytes were isolated and analyzed for the presence of mPER1 and luciferase (Fig. 5). Nuclear injection of luciferase (∼60 kDa) resulted in predominantly nuclear luciferase at both 2 and 4 h post-injection, indicating appropriate targeting of the protein and minimal diffusion from the nucleus (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, wild-type mPER1 (∼180 kDa) was exported from the nucleus, with half the protein cytoplasmic within 2 h. Notably, at 4 h post-injection, there was no further increase in the amount of mPER1 in the cytoplasm. Mutation of two conserved hydrophobic residues within the NES (I493A and L496A) prevented the nuclear export of mPER1 (Fig. 5, A andB). These data indicate that mPER1 is actively exported from the nucleus utilizing an NES. The fact that only half of the wild-type mPER1 protein was found in the cytoplasm suggests either that it may be rapidly re-imported into the nucleus or that a fraction of the mPER1 protein molecules in the nucleus are actively retained there through interaction with another protein (see below). To test whether PER1 cytoplasmic localization is influenced by nuclear re-import, mPER1 lacking the amino-terminal nuclear localization domain (Δ1–205) (Fig. 1) was similarly tested for nuclear export. As shown in Fig. 5 C, removal of the first 205 amino acids of mPER1 allowed ∼85% of the mPER1 protein to be exported to the cytoplasm compared with ∼50% of the full-length protein. Since this amino-terminal truncation removes a potent NLS, these results are consistent with full-length mPER1 undergoing cycles of export and re-import. Our previous study demonstrated that phosphorylation of mPER1 by casein kinase Iε promotes its cytoplasmic accumulation by masking an NLS (16Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To test whether phosphorylation of mPER1 can accelerate nuclear export in addition to inhibiting nuclear import,35S-labeled mPER1 was incubated with recombinant casein kinase Iε in the reticulocyte extracts prior to oocyte nuclear injection. We were unable to detect any effect of casein kinase Iε on the rate of mPER1 nuclear export (data not shown). Previous models of circadian machinery have envisioned a unidirectional flow of circadian regulators from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, followed by degradation in an unknown compartment. In this study, we have identified a novel function of the mammalian PER proteins, that of nuclear export, and show that in both mPER1 fragments and intact protein, nuclear export is directed by a leucine-rich NES similar in sequence to those found in diverse cellular regulatory proteins. One caveat of this study is that HEK 293 cells may not accurately reflect the intracellular environment seen in suprachiasmatic nucleus cells. In fact, PER proteins accumulate in different compartments in different cell lines. For this reason, we also tested the function of the NES in an unrelated cell system. We found that the NES directed nuclear export of mPER1 in two distinct systems, HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes. The data therefore suggest that the NES is generally important in regulating the subcellular localization of mPER1 in diverse cells. Previous studies identified a sequence in dPER (termed the CLD) as a key regulatory of PER cytoplasmic retention (6Saez L. Young M.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This domain has been recently recognized as a conserved sequence (termed the PAC domain) found carboxyl-terminal to multiple PAS domains and proposed to contribute to proper structure of the PAS domain (5Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R674-R677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yagita et al. (19Yagita K. Yamaguchi S. Tamanini F. van der Horst G.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Yasui A. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Okamura H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1353-1363PubMed Google Scholar) found that deletion of the mPER3 CLD (a deletion that apparently did not impinge on the immediately adjacent NES) led to nuclear localization in COS-7 cells. However, we found that truncation of the CLD from mPER1 had no effect on its cytoplasmic localization. What then is the function of the CLD in the cytoplasmic retention of the PER proteins? One possibility is that the CLD is a structural element of the protein; and in specific constructs, its deletion can alter the structure and hence the function of the adjacent NES. If PER localization is in fact determined by competing rates of nuclear import and export, minor changes in NES function and consequently nuclear export rates could have a substantial impact on the global localization of the protein. The discrepant results of PER localization seen after expression in diverse cell lines may therefore simply reflect differences in the relative rates of PER nuclear import and export. The finding that PER localization is dynamic rather than unidirectional may explain a finding in the silkmoth. In this system, PER is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein in clock neurons, while still undergoing circadian variations in mRNA and protein abundance (25Sauman I. Reppert S.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 889-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Silkmoth and Drosophila PER proteins share most (but not all) of the NES hydrophobic residues identified in mPER1 and mPER2 (Fig. 2). It may be that silkmoth PER is in fact actively shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in these cells, with the more readily visualized protein in the cytoplasm, but with functional PER also present in the nucleus. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling provides the opportunity for regulation of protein function by moving it from one compartment to another. For example, phosphorylation-regulated binding of the Mdm2 protein to p53 facilitates translocation of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded (26Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The lymphoid transcription factor NF-AT is sequestered in the cytoplasm by phosphorylation and relocated to the nucleus by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation (27Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In the case of PER shuttling, immunohistochemistry suggests that the majority of PER protein is located in the nucleus. It is possible that there is a pool of cytoplasmic PER proteins not well visualized by immunohistochemistry that is in equilibrium with the more concentrated and hence readily visualized nuclear protein. Certainly, immunolocalization of PER proteins may miss a significant fraction of the protein localized to the cytoplasm. There are several (nonexclusive) potential functions of PER nuclear export. Nuclear export of the PER protein may be required for its degradation in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, PER nuclear export may serve to expedite transport of other PER-binding proteins such as CRY1, CRY2, and casein kinase Iε to the cytoplasm before PER is re-imported into the nucleus. Last, PER is a modest inhibitor of circadian transcription. Nuclear export of PER may serve to up-regulate CLOCK/BMAL1 transcription, perhaps in response to photic input. Clues to the role of PER export may come when external stimuli that alter its localization are identified in intact animals. The ultimate test of the importance of nuclear export in the regulation of circadian rhythm will be to assess the effect of targeted mutations of the various PER nuclear export sequences on circadian rhythm in mice.

CysLT1R and CysLT2R bind their cognate ligands with high affinity. The human receptor subtypes are only 31% identical at the protein sequence level. They are located on different chromosomes; hCysLT1R is on Xq13-Xq21 and hCysLT2R on 13q14. The rank order affinities of CysLTs for CysLT1R and CysLT2R determined in transfected HEK 293 cells and COS cells are LTD4 > LTC4 > LTE4, and LTD4 = LTC4 ≫ LTE4, respectively, correlating well with what was determined previously pharmacologically (4Coleman R.A. Eglen R.M. Jones R.L. Narumiya S. Shimizu T. Smith W.L. Dahlen S.E. Drazen J.M. Gardiner P.J. Jackson W.T. Jones T.R. Krell R.D. Nicosia S. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1995; 23: 283-285PubMed Google Scholar). Although CysLT1R can be inhibited specifically by the specific antagonists zafirlukast, montelukast, pranlukast, and MK-571, these compounds are unable to compete for binding at CysLT2R, and no specific antagonist for this subtype has been identified to date (14Dahlen S.E. Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 1999; 17: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). BAYu9773 is an antagonist at both receptors and also a partial agonist for CysLT2R. The tissue expression patterns of these two receptors are different, indicating distinct roles in mediating leukotriene effects. In this study we report the molecular cloning of mCysLT2R, alternative transcripts, genomic structure and chromosomal mapping, tissue localization, and CysLT2R functional characterization. LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). BAYu9773 and MK-571 were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [3H]LTD4 (130 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The mCysLT2R coding region corresponding to transmembrane domain III–VII was PCR amplified using degenerate primers based on the sequence similarity between human and rat CysLT2R (sense primer: 5′-GTCTTATTCYTTRTATGTCAACATG; antisense primer: 5′-CTCYCCAGCAAARTAATAG; R = A or G, Y = T or C). Full-length cDNA was cloned from mouse heart total RNA using a CLONTECH SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene-specific primers (GSP) were 5′-CCGTTCACCAGAAGCAGGGCTGAGGAAGC (GSP1) and 5′-ACGTGCTGCTCATAGGAAGGCGCTGACC (GSP2). 5′- and 3′-nested PCRs were performed with nested GSP1, 5′-CTGGAAACGCACCACACTCAG, and nested GSP2, 5′-ACTGCGGACCCTCCACTTGGTCACATGG. The full-length cDNA sequence was obtained by assembly of the 5′- and 3′-RACE products and the initial PCR-cloned fragment. The whole gene structure for mCysLT2R was determined by PCR. The following primer sets were used to clone each intron starting from the 5′-end of the gene. In set 1 for intron 1, the sense primer was 5′-AGGGCGACCGAAGGCAGAGGCAC, and the antisense primer was 5′-CCATTCATTTGGGAACATCCATTGGC. In set 2 for introns 2 and 3, the sense primer was 5′-GGAAGAGAGAAGAGTCCATCTGAGAAGGCATACTTC, and the antisense primer was 5′-TTCCAAGTCTTCTCTTTAGCCAATGATACACATCC. In set 3 for intron 4, the sense primer was 5′-TGTCCTGGGGAAGGATGTGTATCATTGGC, and the antisense primer was 5′-GCCATTATATGTCCTTTGGAGTTCAAACCATTGC. In set 4 for intron 5, the sense primer was 5′-CTGTTAGAGACCACTTGTAGCAATGG, and the antisense primer was 5′-GCTCTAGACTATAGATGAACTTTGCTGAATATAGCCC. Total RNAs from various mouse tissues were reverse transcribed using the Superscript First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Life Technologies, Inc.) and PCR performed to characterize the alternative splicing pattern of mCysLT2R mRNA. Primer sets 5′- AGGGCGACCGAAGGCAGAGGCAC and 5′-GCCATTATATGTCCTTTGGAGTTCAAACCATTGC were used to amplify a fragment representing the short mRNA transcript lacking exon 3. A fragment representing the long mRNA transcript containing exon 3 was amplified by two rounds of PCR. The first round PCR used primer sets 5′-CTTTTACATGTACCTGAGAGTAATATG and 5′-AAGGCTCCCCAGAAAAATATTATCAGG. The nested PCR was performed with 5′-TGTACCTGAGAGTAATATGAATGAAGAAATAAG and 5′-ATCTTATCTCTTGGACAACTATTCTTCACTC. Both fragments were verified by sequencing. β-Actin cDNA amplification was used as an internal control with primer sets 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATG and 5′-AACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCC. The mCysLT2R tissue expression pattern was analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay using an RPA IIITM kit (Ambion). Total RNA was prepared from various mouse tissues using TriZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The coding region of mCysLT2R subcloned into pcDNA3 vector at EcoRI/XbaI sites was linearized at the unique PmlI site. [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences)-labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized by in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase (Ambion) in the presence of ribonuclease inhibitor at 37 °C for 1 h. DNase I was added after transcription, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to remove template. The 280-bp labeled probe was gel purified. Total RNA (10 μg) from different tissues was mixed with 7 × 104 cpm probe and coprecipitated with NH4OAc and EtOH. The precipitated pellets were resuspended in hybridization buffer and incubated at 42 °C overnight. A mixture of RNase A/RNase T1 diluted in digestion buffer was added to hybridization tubes and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to yield a 263-bp protected fragment. RNase was inactivated, and samples were precipitated and resuspended in gel loading buffer II, denatured, and electrophoresed in a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide urea gel. Radiolabeled probes were detected by exposure to x-ray film. Yeast tRNA served as a negative control. Antisense oligonucleotide probes 5′-GCAAGGTGCTGATGAATAGAAAATCGGAAG and 5′- TCTTTATCCCATGTGACCAAGTGGAGGGTC were end labeled with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Biochemicals) using the digoxigenin oligonucleotide tailing kit (Roche) and substituting biotin-dUTP for digoxigenin-dUTP. In situ hybridization on 8-μm thick cryostat sections of Swiss Webster mouse heart was carried out as described (6Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q. Im D.S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M. Coulombe N.

Interspecific backcross progeny were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus) F1 females and C57BL/6J males as described (15Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). 205 N2 mice were used to map the Cyslt2rlocus. DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot transfer, and hybridization were performed essentially as described (16Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All blots were prepared with Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe, a 1.1-kb fragment of mouse cDNA from the 5′-untranslated region (UTR), was labeled with [α32P]dCTP using a random primed labeling kit (Stratagene); washing was done to a final stringency of 1.0 × SSCP, 0.1% SDS, 65 °C. Fragments of 9.0 and 3.7 kb were detected in BamHI-digested C57BL/6J DNA, and fragments of 8.0 and 3.7 kb were detected in BamHI-digestedM. spretus DNA. The presence or absence of the 8.0-kbBamHI M. spretus-specific fragment was followed in backcross mice. A description of the probes and RFLPs for the loci linked toCyslt2r including hr and Dct has been reported previously (17Jackson I.J. Chambers D.M. Tsukamoto K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hearing V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Recombination distances were calculated using Map Manager, version 2.6.5. The gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to explain the allele distribution patterns. HEK 293 cells or HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The coding region of mCysLT2R was subcloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-mCysLT2R using Fugene 6 (Roche), and HEK 293T were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the instructions of the manufacturer. HEK 293T cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-treated black wall microplates (Biocoat) at 5 × 104 cells/well 24 h after transfection. 24 h later the cells were loaded with Fluo-4 calcium indicator dye (Molecular Probes) in the presence of 2.5 mm probenecid. After washing three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 2.5 mm probenecid, the cells were treated with varying concentrations of agonists, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and LTB4; maximum fluorescence indicating the changes in intracellular calcium concentrations following agonist activation was measured in a Molecular Devices Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using PRISM software (GraphPad, San Diego). HEK 293 cell membranes were prepared as described previously (18Frey E.A. Nicholson D.W. Metters K.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The cells were dispersed in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 0.37 mg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), pH 7.4) by Dounce B homogenization followed by nitrogen cavitation at 1,100 p.s.i. for 15 min. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was subjected to a final Dounce A homogenization. For competition studies, membrane preparations (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.5 nm[3H]LTD4 together with different concentrations of reagents in buffer containing 10 mmHEPES, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, in the presence of 20 mml-penicillamine at room temperature for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0), and the bound ligand was captured on Whatman GF/B filters. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding, measured as the radioligand binding in the presence of 1 μmLTD4, from total binding. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using PRISM software. We sought to identify and characterize the mouse CysLT2R. Previous data suggested that rat may not possess a functional CysLT2R because no evidence of signaling could be obtained from the cloned sequence, and its deduced structure was truncated relative to the human receptor (11Heise C.E. O'Dowd B.F. Figueroa D.J. Sawyer N. Nguyen T. Im D.S. Stocco R. Bellefeuille J.N. Abramovitz M. Cheng R. Williams Jr., D.L. Zeng Z. Liu Q. Ma L. Clements M.K. Coulombe N. Liu Y. Austin C.P.

We designed a pair of degenerate primers based on the sequence similarity between human and rat CysLT2R, and PCR was carried out using mouse genomic DNA as template. A single band of 590 bp corresponding to transmembrane domains III–VII was obtained. GSP derived from the fragment's sequence were used to perform both 5′- and 3′-RACE from mouse heart cDNA. Sequence analysis and assembly of the three products identified a contiguous 1762-bp cDNA. This mouse CysLT2R cDNA has an open reading frame of 930 bp, a 620-bp 5′-UTR, and a 212-bp 3′-UTR. The deduced protein sequence has 309 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 35.3 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The sequence identities between human and mouse, and rat and mouse are 65 and 84%, respectively. The deduced protein sequence alignment among the three species is shown in Fig. 1 B. Interestingly, the mouse and rat sequences are both truncated by 16 and 21 residues at the respective N and C termini. Hydrophobicity analysis reveals that each of the proteins has seven transmembrane-spanning domains and six hydrophilic loops, characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors (not shown). The mCysLT2R gene organization was determined by a series of PCRs using primer sets designed from the cDNA sequence. The gene is composed of six exons and five introns and spans around 20 kb. The coding region is intronless with all introns located in the 5′-UTR and each exon-intron junction following the GT-AG rule (Fig. 1 C). A mouse cDNA sequenced from adult male tongue by the RIKEN Mouse Gene Encyclopedia Project (19; GenBank accession AK008997) is identical to our cDNA sequence except that a 57-bp fragment in the middle of the 5′-UTR is missing. This missing fragment corresponds to the entire exon 3. Hence two potential transcripts were identified: a long form containing all 6 exons and a short form lacking exon 3 (see below). Initial Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA from various mouse tissues failed to find a detectable hybridization band indicating low level expression of mCysLT2R. A more sensitive ribonuclease protection assay was tested subsequently. By this technique, the highest expression was found in spleen, thymus, and adrenal gland with weaker expression in kidney, brain, and buffy coat (primarily peripheral blood leukocytes). mCysLT2R expression was not apparent in lung, liver, heart, aorta, skeletal muscle, uterus, and ovary by this technique (Fig. 2 A). A CysLT2R mRNA signal was detected in mouse heart using amplified in situ hybridization. CysLT2R mRNA was detected selectively on larger cells concentrated at the apical portions of the ventricle. This pattern is suggestive of expression on conducting Purkinje cells (Fig. 3 C) and is consistent with the CysLT2R expression seen in human heart (11Heise C.E. O'Dowd B.F. Figueroa D.J. Sawyer N. Nguyen T. Im D.S. Stocco R. Bellefeuille J.N. Abramovitz M. Cheng R. Williams Jr., D.L. Zeng Z. Liu Q. Ma L. Clements M.K. Coulombe N. Liu Y. Austin C.P. George S.R. O'Neill G.P. Metters K.M. Lynch K.R. Evans J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30531-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). A CysLT2R signal was also noted on endothelial cells surrounding cardiac vessels (Fig. 3, A and B). No signal was detected using sense control oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 D). RT-PCR was used to delineate the alternative splicing pattern of mCysLT2R. A 270-bp fragment representing the short splice variant was amplified in some tissues with a primer set spanning exon 3 from first strand cDNA. However, an expected 327-bp fragment containing exon 3 representing the long transcript failed to appear by this approach. A primer derived from exon 3 in combination with a downstream primer was used to amplify a fragment containing part of exon 3, which was followed by a second PCR using a nested primer within exon 3 and additional nested downstream primer. Only by two rounds of PCR could a 266-bp band containing part of exon 3 be detected (Fig. 2 B). Neither the first primer set nor nested primer set alone was able to amplify a specific PCR product (data not shown). The short splice variant is predominant in every tissue expressing mCysLT2R, whereas the long transcript expression is trivial compared with the short transcript. The mouse chromosomal location of Cyslt2r was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived from matings of ((C57BL/6J × M. spretus) F1 × C57BL/6J) mice. This interspecific backcross mapping panel has been typed for more than 3,200 loci that are well distributed among all of the autosomes as well as the X chromosome (15Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J and M. spretus DNAs were digested with several enzymes and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization for informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) using a mouse cDNA Cyslt2r probe. The 8.0-kb BamHI M. spretus RFLP (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to follow the segregation of the Cyslt2r locus in backcross mice. The mapping results indicated that Cyslt2r is located in the distal region of mouse chromosome 14 linked to hr and Dct.Although 162 mice were analyzed for every marker and are shown in the segregation analysis (Fig. 4), up to 166 mice were typed for some pairs of markers. Each locus was analyzed in pairwise combinations for recombination frequencies using the additional data. The ratios of the total number of mice exhibiting recombinant chromosomes to the total number of mice analyzed for each pair of loci and the most likely gene order are: centromere:hr → 7/166 → Cyslt2r → 37/162 →Dct. The recombination frequencies (expressed as genetic distances in centiMorgans ± the S.E.) are hr → 4.2 +/− 1.6 → Cyslt2r → 22.8 ± 3.3 →Dct. The distal region of mouse chromosome 14 shares regions of homology with human chromosomes 8p and 13q (summarized in Fig. 4), consistent with the assignment of CysLT2R to 13q14 in humans. To detect the function of mCysLT2R, intracellular calcium mobilization was measured by FLIPR assay upon agonist activation in HEK 293T cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-mCysLT2R vector. The cells responded to LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 with marked, dose-dependent elevations of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5). LTC4 and LTD4 were equipotent agonists for this receptor with EC50 values of 13.4 and 14.4 nm, respectively. LTE4 behaved as a partial agonist. LTB4 failed to elicit a significant Ca2+response at concentrations up to 3 μm. A Ca2+mobilization response to CysLTs using hCysLT2R in parallel gave comparable elevations. However, CysLTs seemed to have higher efficacy at the mCysLT2R, but the difference was not significant (p > 0.1). The EC50 values of these reagents for both mouse and human CysLT2R are shown in Table I. pcDNA3 vector-alone transfected cells did not respond to leukotrienes. BAYu9773 could elicit a partial Ca2+ mobilization response by itself. Pretreatment with BAYu9773 decreased the response to LTC4 and LTD4 (data not shown).Table IEC50 values for LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and LTB4 for human and mouse CysLT2R in eliciting intracellular calcium mobilization in transiently transfected HEK 293T cellsAgonistEC50hCysLT2RmCysLT2RnmnmLTC421.213.4LTD426.614.4LTE4>1,000728.3LTB4>1,000>1,000 Open table in a new tab Cell membranes from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-mCysLT2R were used for radioligand binding assays. [3H]LTD4 bound specifically to these membranes. Specific binding represented ∼60% of the total binding, whereas membranes from vector-alone transfected cells showed no specific binding (data not shown). Competition assays with CysLTs, LTB4, CysLT1R-specific antagonist MK-571, and partial agonist/antagonist BAYu9773 were performed in three separate experiments with three different membrane preparations (Fig. 6). The rank order potency of leukotriene agonists to compete with [3H]LTD4 (0.5 nm) binding was LTC4 = LTD4 > BAYu9773 > LTE4 with IC50 values of 8.5, 17.6, 325, and 1,985 nm, respectively. LTB4 and MK-571 did not compete with [3H]LTD4 even at 10 μm. In this report we have described the cloning and functional characterization of the mouse CysLT2 receptor. Contrary to previous data that implicate a nonfunctional rat CysLT2R (11Heise C.E. O'Dowd B.F. Figueroa D.J. Sawyer N. Nguyen T. Im D.S. Stocco R. Bellefeuille J.N. Abramovitz M. Cheng R. Williams Jr., D.L. Zeng Z. Liu Q. Ma L. Clements M.K. Coulombe N. Liu Y. Austin C.P. George S.R. O'Neill G.P. Metters K.M. Lynch K.R. Evans J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30531-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), our functional experiments with mCysLT2R in parallel with the human and rat homologs revealed that all three CysLT2Rs had similar responses to CysLTs in raising intracellular calcium levels (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Both mouse and rat CysLT2R are truncated by 16 and 21 residues at the respective N and C termini relative to the human sequence. However, this truncation is not significant in terms of ligand binding and intracellular signaling because the binding affinity of CysLTs to mCysLT2R is similar to hCysLT2R, and the ligand-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization is similar in both intensity and EC50 values in each of the human, rat, and mouse CysLT2R-transfected cell preparations. The significance of the extra sequences in hCysLT2R merits further investigation. We report the first determination of a CysLT2R gene structure. It is composed of 6 exons and 5 introns with all introns located in the 5′-UTR and the coding region intronless like many other G protein-coupled receptor genes. We identified two splice variants for mCysLT2R mRNA. The 57-bp exon 3 is spliced out from the short transcript. Even though the long transcript was isolated during the initial cloning step from heart cDNA, later RT-PCR results revealed that the short transcript was the predominant form in every tissue where the mCysLT2R gene was expressed. Thus, PCR using a primer set spanning exon 3 could only amplify the short transcript because of the relative rareness of the long transcript. The mCysLT1R gene also has long and short splice variants (8Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Lam B.K. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2256-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,9Martin V. Sawyer N. Stocco R. Unett D. Lerner M.R. Abramovitz M. Funk C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) resulting in two mCysLT1 receptors that differ at the N terminus. However, because the alternative splicing of mCysLT2R occurs in the 5′-UTR region there should be no difference in protein structure. The significance of the alternative splicing remains to be clarified. The long transcript expression pattern is different from the short form, indicating that exon 3 might play some role in transcriptional or translational regulation. Previously, CysLT2R was described pharmacologically in guinea pig trachea and ileum, ferret trachea and spleen, sheep bronchus, and pulmonary arteries and veins and vasculature of various species (4Coleman R.A.

Pharmacol. 2000; 401: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). hCysLT2R mRNA was identified mainly in heart, spleen, adrenal gland, and various regions of the brain. Despite the identification of CysLT2R expression sites, its function is not well defined. We cloned the mCysLT2R cDNA from mouse heart, but this tissue exhibits very low overall expression as detected by Northern blotting, ribonuclease protection assay, and RT-PCR. These results are consistent with mCysLT2R expression limited to Purkinje and endothelial cells by tyramide-enhanced in situhybridization. CysLTs were shown to reduce coronary blood flow and myocardial contractility in guinea pig and rat (24Letts L.G. Piper P.J. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1983; 11: 391-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Human CysLT1R was cloned from vascular endothelial cells, and LTD4-induced vascular leakage was shown in mice (10Gronert K. Martinsson-Niskanen T. Ravasi S. Chiang N. Serhan C.N. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The identification of CysLT receptors in both human and mouse Purkinje and endothelial cells indicates multifunctional roles for these receptors in modulating cardiovascular function. Consistent with hCysLT2R distribution, we found the relative highest mCysLT2R expression in spleen and adrenal gland. Thymus also has high expression, and kidney, brain, and buffy coat leukocytes show weaker evidence of expression. CysLT2R may also mediate pulmonary vessel relaxation possibly through nitric oxide release (22Walch L. Norel X. Gascard J.P. Brink C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 2000; 161: S107-S111Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CysLT2R might also take part in the neuroendocrine regulation of hormones (25Saadi M. Gerozissis K. Rougeot C. Minary P. Dray F. Life Sci. 1990; 46: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and identification of its expression in many brain regions and adrenal gland (Fig. 2; 11) might broaden our current perspective of CysLTs as inflammatory mediators toward other important physiological roles. CysLTs were able to elicit intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in CysLT2R-transfected HEK 293T cells in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that CysLT2R couples to the Gq/11 family as does CysLT1R. Coupling of CysLT2R to other members in this family was also tested, but only Gq signaled effectively (data not shown). Pertussis toxin did not affect the CysLT-induced Ca2+ response in CysLT1R-transfected cells (7Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Chambers J. Ellis C. Elshourbagy N. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Muccitelli R.M.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19845-19855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which might only express CysLT1R because the binding of CysLTs could be totally inhibited by CysLT1R-specific antagonists (18Frey E.A. Nicholson D.W. Metters K.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), indicating the potential for differential CysLT-mediated G protein coupling. Whether CysLT2R might also couple to the Gi/o class in certain tissues in unknown. mCysLT2R binds CysLTs in a rank order of affinity LTC4 = LTD4 ≫ LTE4, as does hCysLT2R. BAYu9773 works at this receptor as both antagonist and partial agonist. Pretreatment with BAYu9773 partially abolished cellular reaction to LTC4 and LTD4, indicating desensitization of the receptor. With cloned CysLT2 receptors available, it should be feasible to develop new pharmaceutical agents specific to CysLT2R. In summary, we identified mCysLT2R as a functional CysLT receptor that is derived from 5′-UTR alternative transcripts, and which functions similar to hCysLT2R. The establishment of a CysLT2R-deficient mouse model would potentially yield new insights into biological and pathophysiological roles of this receptor. We thank Anna Myklebust for excellent technical assistance and Drs. Mark Abramovitz, Jilly Evans, and Xin-Sheng Chen for helpful discussions on CysLT receptors."

The measurements showed comparable amounts of RNA polymerase II, TFIIE, and TFIIF, lower levels of TBP and TFIIB, and still lower levels of Mediator and TFIIH. These findings are consistent with the presumed roles of the transcription proteins, but do not support the idea of their recruitment in a single large complex to RNA polymerase II promoters. The approach employed here can be readily extended to quantitative analysis of the entire yeast proteome.

Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). All seven proteins are thought to assemble in a giant complex at a promoter prior to the initiation of transcription. Many of the proteins interact in solution, for example, TFIIB with TFIID, TFIIE with TFIIH, and TFIIF and Mediator with RNA polymerase II. Indeed it has been proposed that all the proteins except TFIID and TFIIE are recruited to a promoter as a preassembled complex (5Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). While a test of this proposal is difficult, especially in vivo, one expectation would be that the components of a preassembled complex occur in nearly equivalent amounts. Here we investigate this possibility by a simple, generally applicable method. Protein expression levels cannot be reliably determined by measurement of mRNA levels with cDNA microarrays and DNA chip technology (6Shalon D. Smith S.J. Brown P.O. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 7Lashkari D.A. DeRisi J.L. McCusker J.H. Namath A.F. Gentile C. Hwang S.Y. Brown P.O. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13057-13062Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Deviations between protein and mRNA levels can be as great as 20- to 30-fold (8Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar), due to posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms including nuclear export and localization of mRNAs, stability of mRNA transcripts and proteins, and translational control (9Pradet-Balade B. Boulme F. Beug H. Mullner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 225-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Protein levels in crude cell extracts can be measured directly by high-resolution, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (10Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V.

A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), but this approach is limited in sensitivity (8Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). A variant of this approach has been used for comparative studies of protein expression (11Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 994-999Crossref Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). The method we describe involves introduction of a “TAP” tag (12Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 1030-1032Crossref Scopus (2280) Google Scholar) and detection by IgG binding to the tag in a dot blot assay. We find no background IgG binding, even in a crude extract, eliminating the need for fractionation. The sensitivity is sufficient for the detection of proteins as scarce as those involved in transcription, and the use of a dot blot avoids the problem of differential transfer of proteins in commonly used SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/immunoblot procedures. Primers GST-TAP forward and GST-TAP reverse (GST-TAP forward: CGTGCAGGATCCATGGAAAAGAGAAGGST; and TAPreverse: GGTGCTCTCGAGCTATCATCAGGTTGACTTCCCCGCGGA) were used to amplify the TAP tag region of pBS1479 obtained from the Seraphin laboratory (12Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 1030-1032Crossref Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR fragment was digested withBamHI/XhoI and cloned into pGEX6P1 (Pharmacia Corp.). Resulting clones were tested by restriction digestion and immunoblotting in BL21 cells. The GST-TAP construct in BL21cells was grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.8 and induced with 1 mm isoprooyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C. Cells were washed in PBS and frozen. Thawed cells were sonicated and centrifuged. Clarified extract was applied to a glutathione affinity column (Sigma), washed with PBS, and eluted with PBS+15 mm glutathione (Sigma). The GST-TAP fusion protein was further purified by electroelution using an Elutrap-Electrophoresis Chamber (Schleicher and Schueller). The resulting GST-TAP was pure as judged from 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. TAP-tagged strains were prepared as described in Refs. 12Rigaut G.

In brief, PCR was performed with forward and reverse primer pairs using pBS1479 as the template; pBS1479 contains the TAP tag cassette followed by a trp+ selection marker. The resulting PCR product was used to transform yeast strain CB010 (Mata, pep4::HIS3/prb1::LEU2,prc1::HISG, can1,ade2, trp1, ura3, his3,leu2–3,112) as described in (23Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar) or onfhcrc.org/labs/gottschling/hc.sht, to mid-log phase, (A 600 = 0.5, or 2 × 107cells). Cells were harvested, washed once with water, and counted using an Improved Neubauer Brightline Hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific). Cells (107) were washed once with water and resuspended in 30 μl of 2% SDS, and 100 μl of glass beads were added. Cells were subjected three times to 2 min of boiling and 2 min of vortexing. Then 300 μl of 1 m NaCl/2m urea/PBS were added, followed by vortexing and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The clarified supernatant (10 μg and subsequent dilutions) was used for the dot blot assay. Protein concentrations were determined in triplicate with the Bradford reagent (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), and the amounts of cell extracts applied to dot blots were adjusted accordingly. Protein quality was verified by immunoblotting. For this purpose, the extracts were run on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and probed with anti-RPB3 (1Y26) and antiRpb1 (8W16) antibodies. Detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibodies (Bio-Rad) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation of transcription proteins in yeast cell extracts has been performed in the past by immunoblot analysis. It has been limited to the few polypeptides for which high quality polyclonal antibodies are available. Most antibodies produce unacceptably high cross-reactivity and background signals on blots from crude lysates. We circumvented this problem by taking advantage of the two protein A modules within the TAP tag (12Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 1030-1032Crossref Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). The affinity and specificity of protein A-IgG interaction proves to be sufficient for detection of even very scarce proteins in crude extracts with no background at all. TAP tags were introduced at the C termini of transcription proteins by integration at genomic loci. TAP-tagged strains were checked by PCR and immunoblotting to ensure correct integration (Fig. 1). To measure the absolute amounts of tagged proteins, an external standard was prepared. A TAP tag was introduced at the C terminus ofEscherichia coli GST. The resulting GST-TAP was purified to homogeneity and was quantitated by Bradford assay (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Extraction of proteins from TAP-tagged strains was accomplished by bead beating and boiling in the presence of SDS. Optimal extraction of transcription proteins was obtained with the inclusion of 1 m NaCl and 2 m urea in the solubilization buffer. The number of cells extracted could be varied by an order of magnitude or more without effect on the results. Dilution series were prepared in 96-well plates, along with dilution series of GST-TAP and of a negative control (extract of the untagged, parental wild-type strain). Following transfer from a 96-well plate to a polyvinylidene difluoride-membrane with a 96-well vacuum dot-blotter, the membrane was washed, blocked (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and subjected to a one-step immunoaffinity procedure with an anti-peroxidase-IgG conjugate (15Sternberger L.A. Hardy Jr., P.H. Cuculis J.J. Meyer H.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1970; 18: 315-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (4507) Google Scholar). Bound IgG was detected by chemiluminescence (Fig. 2 A), followed by scanning (Umax Astra4000U) and quantitation (ImageQuant). As little as 1 fmol of protein could be detected, corresponding to 500 molecules per cell in a sample prepared from 106 cells. This detection limit allows the quantitation of proteins present at very low levels and the processing of many samples rapidly and in parallel. Yeast strains bearing TAP tags on various transcription proteins were grown to mid-log phase in minimal medium and harvested at the same cell density. Quantitation was performed by dot blot analysis as described, with all measurements in triplicate, resulting in standard deviations of 10–20%. Three observations indicated that the presence of the TAP tag did not alter the expression level of the protein under study. First, growth curves of all strains were determined in rich and in minimal media, and no significant variation from the wild-type strain was observed (data not shown). As the tagged strains were haploid and many of the tagged components are essential for viability, a decrease in expression level should have been manifested by growth retardation. Second, independent measurements of the levels of three Mediator subunits gave essentially the same results, as did measurements on four TFIIH subunits (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, the levels of tagged subunits of Mediator and TFIIF complexes judged from intensities of Coomassie staining in SDS-gels were essentially the same as those of untagged subunits (not shown). Finally, immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies against RNA polymerase II subunits Rpb1 and Rpb3 showed no difference in expression level between Rpb3 TAP-tagged and wild-type strains. The results (Table II) showed the greatest abundance of RNA polymerase II, in keeping with its involvement in both the initiation and elongation of transcription. The level of TFIIF was nearly the same, as expected from its tight association with RNA polymerase II and from its likely role in both transcription initiation and elongation as well (16Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The levels of Mediator and TFIIH were much lower, consistent with their involvement only in transcription initiation and only transiently in complexes with RNA polymerase II. It was surprising to find an amount of TFIIE comparable with that of TFIIF rather than TFIIH, since TFIIE interacts with TFIIH and is believed to be responsible for its recruitment to transcription initiation complexes. Finally, TBP and TFIIB were present in equal amounts, intermediate between those of RNA polymerase II and Mediator/TFIIH. This finding is inconsistent with a previous report of TBP and TFIIB levels 2- to 3-fold greater than that of RNA polymerase II (17Lee T.I. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1398-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), perhaps due to differences in the methods of extract preparation or quantitation. Our result is, however, entirely consistent with other information about the roles of TBP and TFIIB. The two proteins form a complex at the TATA box of RNA polymerase II promoters and so should be present in equal amounts. They are only involved in initiation and so should occur at a lower level than the polymerase. They may persist at a promoter through multiple rounds of transcription, accounting for their occurrence at a higher level than TFIIH or Mediator.Table IINumber of selected protein molecules per yeast cellProteinCopies per cellRNA polymerase II (Rpb3)30,000TFIIF (Tfg2)24,000TFIIE (Tfa2)24,000TFIIB (Sua7)20,000TFIID (TBP)20,000Mediator (Med8)6000TFIIH (Tfb3)6000 Open table in a new tab The method of protein quantitation presented here, based on TAP-tagging and dot blot assay, is rapid and sensitive. In the example described, it was applied to the measurement of protein levels in crude cell extracts. It can also be of great utility for monitoring protein purification at early stages where protein levels are below the detection limit of polyclonal antibodies or where such antibodies are not available. The method can readily be applied on a genome-wide scale to quantitate the entire yeast proteome. It is preferable to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis for this purpose for cases of very small or very large proteins or those that occur at very low levels. Once TAP tags have been introduced they offer the further advantage of facile isolation for biochemical analysis. Our measurements of the levels of RNA polymerase II transcription proteins do not support the hypothesis of recruitment to a promoter in the form of a single large complex. Rather they are consistent with distinct modes of entry, such as persistent association of TBP and TFIIB with the promoter and transient interaction of Mediator and TFIIH. As Mediator and TFIIH are the least abundant components of the transcription machinery, they may be the most susceptible to regulation. Indeed, Mediator is the target of many activators and repressors (4Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) while TFIIH, containing kinase and helicase activities, plays a pivotal role in promoter opening and clearance. The protein kinase activity of TFIIH is regulated by Mediator in vitro(18Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) and TFIIE (19Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and its action on the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is tightly regulated in vivo (20Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although TFIIH function in transcription initiation and promoter clearance is dependent on TFIIE, the level of TFIIE is severalfold greater, comparable with the levels of TFIIF and RNA polymerase II. This raises the possibility that TFIIE is involved in the elongation as well as the initiation of transcription. Alternatively, TFIIE might be subject to rapid turnover or to inactivation by posttranslational modification. Indeed, acetylation of TFIIE has been reported in the human system (21Imhof A. Yang X.J.

In this study, the underlying mechanisms of VVC-induced cytotoxicity was investigated on ECV304 cell, a human vascular endothelial cell line. When cells were exposed to 0.4 hemolytic units (HU) of VVC, consecutive apoptotic events were observed; the elevation of superoxide anion (O⨪2), the release of cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-3, the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and the DNA fragmentation. The pretreatment with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), O⨪2 scavenger, completely abolished O⨪2 levels and downstream apoptotic events. Moreover, pretreatment with cyclosporin A (CsA), a mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitor, was capable of attenuating O⨪2-mediated cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, and consequent apoptosis. Apoptosis, as demonstrated by oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and fluorescence microscopy, was induced 24 h after VVC treatment, which was also prevented by caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO. Caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO, did not protect ECV 304 cells from apoptosis. These results suggest a scenario where VVC-induced apoptosis is triggered by the generation of O⨪2, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, activation of caspase-3, degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and DNA fragmentation.

Mitochondria are major sources of superoxide anion (O⨪2), which is generated during mitochondrial respiration (20Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). O⨪2that is generated in excess acts as mediators of the apoptotic signal pathway. It seems that various proapoptotic stimuli provoke alterations of the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane that permits release of apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor (21Susin S.A.

The released cytochromec activates caspase, a family of cysteine proteases and inhibition of apoptosis by Bcl-2 or cyclosporin A (CsA) may be mediated by blocking the release of cytochrome c (23Yang J.

Caspase is synthesized as catalytically inactive proenzymes comprising a large and small subunit with a variable length amino-terminal prodomain. On activation, the prodomain is lost by catalytic cleavage of carboxyl-terminal at an aspartate residue, with heterodimerization of the large and small subunits to form the active enzyme (26Nicholson D.W.

It has been reported that VVC has lethal activity by increasing vascular permeability and neutrophil sequestration in the lungs of mice (35Park J.W. Ma S.N. Song E.S. Song C.H. Chae M.R. Park B.H. Rho R.W. Park S.D. Kim H.R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2873-2876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kim (36Kim J.S. Exp. Mol. Med. 1997; 29: 117-121Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) already reported that VVC had a cytotoxic effect in pulmonary endothelial cells, which was associated with the formation of small transmembrane pores. The purpose of this study was to examine whether VVC at lower concentrations induces apoptosis in endothelial cells. Our data suggests that elevated O⨪2 levels in ECV304 cells following VVC exposure act as a signal to trigger the release of cytochromec from mitochondria. We also provide evidence that cytochrome c acts at the upstream of caspases in inducing apoptosis. The human endothelial cell line ECV304 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were placed into 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and grown at 37 °C under a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmglutamine, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. A virulent strain of V. vulnificus MO6–24/O was kindly donated by J. G. Morris, Jr. (Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Division of Infectious Disease, University of Maryland, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). V. vulnificus was cultured in heart infusion diffusate broth (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at 37 °C for 4 h as described by Kreger et al. (37Kreger A.S. Kothary M.H. Gray L.D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 176-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cytolysin was purified to homogeneity from the culture supernatant by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography as described by Kim et al. (34Kim J.S. Chae M.R. Chang K. Park K.H. Rho H.W. Park B.H. Park J.W. Kim H.R. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 42: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purified cytolysin had a specific activity of 81,000 HU/mg of protein with 30% recovery. The hemolytic activity of cytolysin against mouse erythrocytes was determined by the method of Bernheimer and Schwartz (38Bernheimer A.W. Schwartz L.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1963; 30: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). General viability of cultured cells was determined by reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to formazan (39Oez S. Platzer E. Welte K. Blut. 1990; 60: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After 24 h incubation with VVC, cells (105 cells/well) in 96-well plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. MTT (100 μg/0.1 ml phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a model Spectra MAX PLUS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Generation of O⨪2 was measured by chemiluminescence probe, bis-N-methyl-acridinium nitrite (lucigenin, Sigma) (40Allen R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 133: 449-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 41Li Y. Zhu H. Kuppusamy P. Roubaud V. Zweier J.L. Trush M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2015-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). ECV304 cells (1 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.4 HU of VVC for the indicated times at 37 °C. After the addition of lucigenin (final concentration; 0.25 mm), the chemiluminescence was monitored as relative light units in a luminometer (Lumat, LB9501, Berthold). The release of mitochondrial cytochrome c was determined by Western blot (42Shen H.M. Yang C.F. Ding W.X. Liu J. Ong C.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, at the end of various designated treatments, cells (1.5 × 107 cells) were collected with trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in ice-cold homogenizing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes). The homogenate was subjected to a series of centrifugations (1,000 × g for 10 min, then 10,000 × g for 20 min, and finally 100,000 ×g for another 60 min, 4 °C) for the collection of the cytosolic fraction. Fifty μg of protein was loaded on 15% SDS gel. After electrophoretic separation, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany), and the blot was incubated with mouse anticytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), followed by reaction with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. After treatment with VVC, cells (5 × 106) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Triton X-100 buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were mixed with caspase assay buffer (10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing caspase substrate 20 μm Ac-DEVD-AFC (Pharmingen Inc., San Diego, CA), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Enzyme catalyzed release of AFC was monitored using a spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Cytosolic extracts were separated by gel electrophoresis on a 10% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Prior to incubation with PARP antibodies (Transduction Lab, Lexington, KY), the membrane was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. After washing, the proteins were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody. Cell pellets (1.5 × 107 cells) were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at room temperature for 15 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. DNA was then extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1), precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). DNA was analyzed after separation by gel electrophoresis (1.8% agarose). Apoptotic cells are characterized by unique morphological changes within their nuclei, consisting of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. These changes can also be identified using the fluorescent DNA-binding dye H-33342 (bisbenzamide, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), which stains the nuclei of normal cells as well as those that have died by apoptosis (43Lieberthal W. Triaca V. Koh J.S. Pagano P.J. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F691-F702PubMed Google Scholar, 44Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells were stained with H-33342 (1 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were observed and photographed using fluorescence microsopy. Protein concentration in the ECV304 cell cytosol was determined by the method of Bradford (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. All of the samples were assayed in triplicate. Statistical analysis of the data was performed with Student's t test and ANOVA. Differences withp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. MTT conversion assay was used to determine the viability of ECV304 cells exposed to VVC. As shown in Fig. 1, the viable cells were less than 20% after exposure to 0.6 HU of VVC for 24 h. The IC50 for cell viability of VVC was less than 0.4 HU. To determine the involvement of reactive oxygen intermediates in VVC-induced endothelial cell death, we next monitored the time course of O⨪2 generation after VVC exposure. A lucigenin-based chemiluminescence assay was used to detect intracellular O⨪2 following the incubation of ECV304 cells to 0.4 HU of VVC for the indicated times. A kinetic analysis of O⨪2 generation upon exposure to VVC revealed a significant increase in the intracellular concentration of O⨪2 with the maximum attained at 5 min following VVC treatment, which dropped to base-line level by 30 min (Fig. 2 A). TEMPO, a scavenger of O⨪2, blocked VVC-induced O⨪2 production, which correlated with the inability of VVC to release cytochromec, activate caspase-3, and cause apoptosis (lane 3 in Fig. 3, Fig. 5, lane 3 in Fig. 6, and Fig. 7 C).Figure 3Cytosolic translocation of cytochromec induced by VVC.

Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4266) Google Scholar,25Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of ECV304 cells with 0.4 HU of VVC for 3 h resulted in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (lane 2). Pretreatment of cells with TEMPO (1 mm, lane 3) or CsA (2.5 μm, lane 4) for 1 h prior to VVC exposure totally inhibited VVC-induced cytochrome c release. Ac-DEVD-CHO, an inhibitor of caspase-3, did not affect the release of cytochrome c in VVC-treated cells (data now shown). This finding indicates that activation of caspase-3 is a downstream event to cytochromec release. Results with TEMPO imply that O⨪2 is responsible for VVC-mediated cytochrome c release. Several studies have shown that the release of mitochondrial cytochromec triggers activation of caspase-3 (23Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar, 24Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4266) Google Scholar, 25Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined caspase activity using fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate, Ac-DEVD-AFC. As shown in Fig. 4 A, VVC caused slow activation of caspase-3 during the first 3 h but increased 3–4-fold during the next 3 h and remained at that level by 12 h. This protease activity increased dose dependently and reached maximal at 0.4 HU (Fig. 4 B). However, caspase-1 activity was not increased by VVC (data now shown). Consistent with O⨪2 production and cytochrome c release, TEMPO, CsA, and Ac-DEVD-CHO almost completely abolished the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 5 A). These results were confirmed by Western blotting of PARP cleavage (Fig. 5 B). PARP is a well known endogenous substrate of caspase-3 and its inactivation by caspase-3 mediated cleavage prevents futile DNA repair cycle (27Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). Evident cleavage of PARP was found in those cells treated with 0.4 HU for 6 h. The pattern of PARP cleavage was found to be very consistent with that of caspase-3 activity. Again, no cleavage of PARP was observed when cells were treated with TEMPO, CsA, and Ac-DEVD-CHO. VVC-induced PARP cleavage was not affected by Ac-YVAD-CHO, caspase-1 inhibitor, implicating a specific role of caspase-3 in VVC-induced apoptosis. To investigate whether ECV304 cells undergo apotosis after treatment with VVC, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA extract from ECV304 cells treated with 0.4 HU of VVC for 24 h generated a characteristic ladder pattern of discontinuous DNA fragments on agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6). VVC-induced apoptosis was further confirmed using fluorescence microscopy, which is based on the fact that the nucleus of apoptotic cells stained with a high-intensity than that of normal cells (46Sun X.M. Snowden R.T. Skilleter D.N. Dinsdale D. Ormerod M.G. Cohen G.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 47Elstein K.H. Zucker R.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 211: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 48Ormerod M.G. Sun X.M. Snowden R.T. Davies R. Fearnhead H. Cohen G.M. Cytometry. 1993; 14: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Normal nuclei stained with H-33342 fluorescence faintly and demonstrated a delicate chromatin structure (Fig. 7 A). The nuclei of VVC-exposed cell fluorescence more intensely and also demonstrated two classic features of apoptosis: chromatin condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 7 B). The increased intensity under these conditions is believed to be both the result of chromatin condensation as well as of an increased rate of influx of H-33342 into apoptotic cells. Preincubation with TEMPO and CsA completely inhibited VVC-induced apoptosis (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 6, andC and D in Fig. 7) as Ac-DEVD-CHO did (lane 5 in Fig. 6, and E in Fig. 7). In contrast, Ac-YVAD-CHO did not prevent VVC-induced apoptosis, suggesting that VVC-induced apoptosis was caspase-3 specific. At higher concentrations (more than 2 HU), VVC induced necrosis rather than apoptosis (data now shown). In the present study, we examined the characteristics of VVC-induced apoptotic signal pathway initiated by O⨪2 in ECV 304 cells. First, a temporal pattern of events was observed, starting from O⨪2 generation, followed by cytochrome crelease, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. Second, the pretreatment with either TEMPO or CsA significantly inhibited the whole apoptotic pathway. Third, the pretreatment of caspase-3 inhibitor, but not caspase-1 inhibitor, markedly suppressed the apoptotic events including caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. Both the release of cytochrome c and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis were completely abolished by TEMPO indicating that generation of O⨪2 precedes the release of cytochrome c and subsequently the activation of caspase-3, and plays a crucial role in the apoptotic process. This was supported by the kinetics of VVC-induced apoptosis that the maximal production of O⨪2, the release of cytochrome c, and the peak activity of caspase-3 were observed after 5 min, 3 h, and 6 h after VVC treatment, respectively. Several biochemical changes were present in VVC-treated ECV304 cells with the appearance of the apoptotic phenotype. Even though DNA and membrane changes strongly suggest an apoptotic death, many researchers consider caspase activation as an even more reliable hallmark of apoptosis (49Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar). During VVC-induced cell death, caspase-3 activation seems to be critical to mediate apoptosis. Using both the DNA fragmentation assay and morphological study, it was observed that ECV304 cell apoptosis could be prevented by inhibition of caspase activity with caspase-3 inhibitor, but not with caspase-1 inhibitor. Fluorogenic substrates also showed increased caspase-3 activity in time and dose dependent manners, but no change in caspase-1 activity. Activation of caspase leads to the cleavage of several cellular substrates, one of which is PARP. Treatment of ECV 304 cells with VVC induced proteolytic cleavage of PARP, which was reversed by pretreatment with caspase-3 inhibitor. Although our findings point to a critical role for caspase-3 in ECV 304 cell apoptosis by VVC, they do not rule out the possibility that another caspase family protease also plays an important role in cell death. Actually, caspase-6, caspase-7, and caspase-8 may be inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO. Certainly, our data does not exclude the possibility that other regulators of the apoptotic signaling cascade may exert a role similar to that of caspase-3 for the execution of the apoptotic program by VVC. It is known that pore-forming proteins, perforins, and ionophores contribute to apoptosis induction through the marked alterations in calcium levels (50Chen Y. Zychlinsky A. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 51Kizaki H. Tadakuma T. Odaka C. Muramatsu J. Ishimura Y. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1790-1794PubMed Google Scholar, 52Hameed A.

Med. 1989; 169: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or by affecting directly or indirectly cellular metabolic processes such as ATP levels and mitochondrial function (53Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1835-1840PubMed Google Scholar,54Galitovsky V.E. Gogvadze V.G. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 1374-1377PubMed Google Scholar). At higher concentrations (more than 2 HU), VVC induced necrosis. 2K. B. Kwon, J. Y. Yang, D. G. Ryu, H. W. Rho, J. S. Kim, J. W. Park, H. R. Kim, and B. H. Park, unpublished data. VVC caused calcium influx from outside and reduced cellular ATP levels in those necrotic conditions. Therefore, VVC-mediated calcium influx may trigger necrotic pathway rather than apoptotic signaling events. Cytotoxicity toward nucleated cells has been demonstrated for other pore-forming cytolysins such as staphylococcal α-toxin (55Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 733-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), streptolysin-O (56Walev I. Palmer M. Valeva A. Weller U. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1188-1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Vibrio cholerae E1 Tor cytolysin (57Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Among them, staphylococcal α-toxin was reported to induce apoptosis in human T lymphocytes with low doses (58Jonas D. Walev I. Berger T. Liebetrau M. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of permeability studies, those authors associated the induction of apoptosis with the formation of very small pores on the plasma membrane, but they did not explain the molecular pathway leading to apoptosis. Until now, little is known about the cytotoxic mechanism of VVC on mammalian cells. In the present study, we showed for the first time that endothelial cell damage mediated by VVC occurred through apoptosis. Our previous study showed that increased pulmonary vascular permeability and neutrophil sequestration in lung tissue are important in the lethal activity of cytolysin injected intravenously (35Park J.W. Ma S.N. Song E.S. Song C.H. Chae M.R. Park B.H. Rho R.W. Park S.D. Kim H.R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2873-2876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, VVC secreted during V. vulnificus infection may participate in increasing vascular permeability and subsequent lung damage. We have no data as to whether or not VVC-induced apoptosis also occurs in vivo. However, considering the fact that tissue necrosis is a clinical feature characterized primarily in severe V. vulnificus infection, the presence of apoptotic process in endothelial cells may give us important clues in understanding the pathophysiology of V. vulnificus infection. Taken together, these data suggest that O⨪2 generation coupled with the release of cytochrome c could be a strong amplification signal for the efficient activation of the caspase cascade during VVC-induced apoptosis. Additional studies are needed to investigate the implication of VVC in the triggering of endothelial cell apoptosis during infection with V. vulnificusin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2024533882,"Constitutively active mutant forms of signaling enzymes provide insight into mechanisms of activation as well as useful molecular tools for probing downstream targets. In this study, point mutations in ERK2 at conserved residues L73P and S151D were identified that individually led to 8-12-fold increased specific activity and in combination reached 50-fold, indicating synergistic interactions between these residues. Examination by mass spectrometry, phosphatase sensitivity, and Western blotting revealed that the mutations enhanced ERK2 activity by facilitating intramolecular autophosphorylation predominantly at Tyr-185 and to a lesser extent at Thr-183 and that phosphorylation at both sites is required for activation. A set of short molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using different random seeds to sample locally accessible configurations. Simulations of the active mutant showed potential hydrogen bonding interactions between the phosphoryl acceptor and catalytic nucleophile, which could account for enhanced intramolecular autophosphorylation. In intact cells, the ERK2 mutants were functionally active in phosphorylating Elk-1 and RSK1 and activating the c-fos promoter. This activity was only partially reduced upon treatment of cells with the MKK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, indicating that in vivo the mechanism of ERK2 activation occurs substantially through autophosphorylation and partially through phosphorylation by MKK1/2."

Recently, TPA was also found to induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity. Here, we investigated whether the EGFR is a necessary component for TPA-induced signal transduction associated with tumor promotion. We demonstrated that potent inhibitors of the EGFR, PD153035 and AG1478, blocked TPA-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), AP-1 activity, and cell transformation. Egfr gene deficiency blocked TPA-induced ERK activity and AP-1 binding activity. The blocking of the ectodomain of the EGFR by a monoclonal antibody depressed TPA-induced ERK activity and AP-1 DNA binding activity. The use of a neutralizing antibody for heparin-binding EGF, one of the ligands of EGFR, blocked TPA-induced phosphorylation of ERKs. BB-94, a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, which are activators of ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands, also blocked TPA-induced ERK activity, AP-1 DNA binding, and cell transformation but had no effect on EGF-induced signal transduction. Anti-EGFR, anti-heparin-binding EGF, and BB-94 each blocked TPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation, but only anti-EGFR could block EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation.

TPA-induced tumor promotion is characterized by a dramatic increase in cell proliferation (1Angel J.M. DiGiovanni J. Prog. Exp. Tumor Res. 1999; 35: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This change is primarily the result of promoter-induced alterations in gene expression and in mediation of signal transduction from extracellular stimuli to the nucleus (1Angel J.M. DiGiovanni J. Prog. Exp. Tumor Res. 1999; 35: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because protein kinase C (PKC) is an intracellular receptor of TPA, TPA-induced tumor promotion is thought to be related to the PKC/MAP kinases/AP-1 pathway (2Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G.

However, several reports showed that PKC activation induced by TPA is a transient process, and sustained treatment with TPA down-regulates PKC activity (6Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S.

These observations suggest that other mechanisms, in addition to the PKC pathway, mediate TPA-induced tumor promotion.Several investigators recently found that the EGFR was phosphorylated in TPA-promoted skin tumors from SENCAR mice (11Xian W. Kiguchi K. Imamoto A. Rupp T. Zilberstein A. DiGiovanni J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1447-1455PubMed Google Scholar) and in TPA-treated cultured cells (12Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). The pathway mediated by the EGFR is very important in modulating cell proliferation, but no evidence thus far has shown clearly that this pathway is related to TPA-induced tumor promotion. In the present work, we demonstrate that the activation of the EGFR by TPA is a necessary step in TPA-induced signal transduction and cell transformation and therefore is involved in TPA-induced tumor promotion.DISCUSSIONThe strong tumor-promoting effect of TPA is believed to contribute to its activation of PKC. However, TPA has also been shown to increase phosphorylation of the EGFR (11Xian W. Kiguchi K. Imamoto A. Rupp T. Zilberstein A. DiGiovanni J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1447-1455PubMed Google Scholar, 12Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TPA-stimulated signal transduction may be related to a signaling network that couples TPA to the EGFR. However, the role of the EGFR in TPA-induced signal transduction is not clear. Here we demonstrated that repression of the EGFR by specific inhibitors reduced TPA-induced phosphorylation of ERKs, AP-1 activity, and cell transformation.Egfr-deficient cells blocked TPA-induced ERK activity and AP-1 DNA binding activity. Blocking of the ectodomain of the EGFR by a monoclonal antibody hindered TPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation, ERK activity, and AP-1 DNA binding activity, suggesting that TPA induced the release of some components functioning as EGFR ligands. In addition, the use of an antibody to neutralize HB-EGF, a kind of EGFR ligand, suppressed TPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activity. Inhibition of MMP, the activator of ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands, blocked TPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation as well as ERK activity and cell transformation. Taken together, these results suggest that the EGFR is involved in mediating TPA-induced signal transduction. Induction of EGFR transactivation by TPA is a mechanism by which the EGFR mediates TPA-induced tumor promotion-related signal transduction.PKC is a major target of TPA and, thus, the role of PKC in mediating tumor promotion has been emphasized. Activated PKC phosphorylates target proteins on serine or threonine residues, presumably altering their functional properties. MAP kinases are important mediators of signal transduction from various extracellular stimuli to many cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Activation of PKC by TPA results in the rapid activation of ERKs (26Hoshi M. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5396-5401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ray L.B.

The activation of signal transduction pathways that lead to stimulation of AP-1 activity seems to be a common mechanism for diverse types of tumor promoters (2Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G.

Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 181-197Google Scholar). Topical application of TPA on SENCAR mice resulted in a significant increase in binding of125I-EGF to its receptor (37DiGiovanni J. Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 181-197Google Scholar). Moreover, TPA has been found to up-regulate protein and mRNA expression of the EGFR and its ligands, TGF-α and HB-EGF, in both cultured keratinocytes and mice with skin tumors (17Kiguchi K. Beltran L. Rupp T. DiGiovanni J. Mol. Carcinogen. 1998; 22: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37DiGiovanni J. Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 181-197Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrated that knockout of the Egfr gene or inhibition of EGFR activation by EGFR inhibitors blocked TPA-induced ERK phosphorylation, AP-1 activity, and cell transformation. Even though blocking EGFR did not completely inhibit TPA-induced signal transduction, the EGFR appears to be required for mediating TPA-induced tumor promotion-associated signal transduction.The mechanism of TPA-induced EGFR activation is not well understood. Some studies have shown that EGFR was involved in the signaling networks activated by stimuli that do not interact directly with this receptor (38Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These stimuli include G protein-coupled receptor agonists thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid (39Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), calcium (40Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2493-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The process by which EGFR-unrelated stimuli may release some EGFR ligands leading to EGFR activation is termed EGFR transactivation (38Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Recent studies on the transactivation of the EGFR by G protein-coupled receptor agonists have shown that the stimulation of a protease activity by these agonists is involved in the transactivation (42Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This stimulation results in the cleavage of EGF-like precursors and the production of diffusible growth factors that then activate the EGFR (12Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 38Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 39Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). This proteolytic event is likely to be mediated by a metalloproteinase, based on sensitivity of the transactivation of EGFR to BB-94, a broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor (42Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). TPA has been suggested to activate cleavage of pro-TGF-α, pro-HB-EGF, and proamphiregulin (22Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol.

The cleavage of pro-HB-EGF was also found to be modulated by metalloproteinase-disintegrins (ADAM family), members of the Metzincin family (23Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T.

In the present work, we used a neutralizing antibody against HB-EGF to deplete the released EGFR ligand and also a neutralizing antibody against the EGFR to block the binding site of the EGFR for its ligands, resulting in inhibition of TPA-induced EGFR and ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, BB-94, a potent inhibitor of MMPs and ADAMs, blocked TPA-induced ERK activity and cell transformation but did not affect EGF-induced signal transduction. These results suggest that TPA-induced ectodomain shedding of certain EGFR ligands by MMP activates the EGFR, and this transactivation of the EGFR is an important mechanism by which the EGFR mediates TPA-induced tumor promotion-associated signal transduction.To address whether the EGFR is involved in TPA-induced signal transduction and cell transformation, we used EGFR-deficient cells and highly specific EGFR inhibitors to provide direct evidence that the EGFR, at least partially, is required for TPA-induced signal transduction associated with cell transformation. Through blocking ligand binding to the EGFR by using a neutralizing antibody against HB-EGF or EGFR and suppressing MMP activity by using a MMP inhibitor, we demonstrated that TPA-induced transactivation of the EGFR occurs through the release of EGFR ligands. Taken together, our data suggest that EGFR mediates TPA-induced tumor promotion-associated signal transduction (Fig. 6). This mechanism may account for TPA-induced long term tumor promotion and thus provide a novel mechanism of TPA-induced tumor promotion. Phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)1is a highly potent tumor promoter and is used widely for the study of the mechanism of tumor promotion.

Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 181-197Google Scholar). Topical application of TPA on SENCAR mice resulted in a significant increase in binding of125I-EGF to its receptor (37DiGiovanni J. Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 181-197Google Scholar). Moreover, TPA has been found to up-regulate protein and mRNA expression of the EGFR and its ligands, TGF-α and HB-EGF, in both cultured keratinocytes and mice with skin tumors (17Kiguchi K. Beltran L. Rupp T. DiGiovanni J. Mol. Carcinogen. 1998; 22: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37DiGiovanni J. Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 181-197Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrated that knockout of the Egfr gene or inhibition of EGFR activation by EGFR inhibitors blocked TPA-induced ERK phosphorylation, AP-1 activity, and cell transformation. Even though blocking EGFR did not completely inhibit TPA-induced signal transduction, the EGFR appears to be required for mediating TPA-induced tumor promotion-associated signal transduction.The mechanism of TPA-induced EGFR activation is not well understood. Some studies have shown that EGFR was involved in the signaling networks activated by stimuli that do not interact directly with this receptor (38Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These stimuli include G protein-coupled receptor agonists thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid (39Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), calcium (40Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2493-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The process by which EGFR-unrelated stimuli may release some EGFR ligands leading to EGFR activation is termed EGFR transactivation (38Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Recent studies on the transactivation of the EGFR by G protein-coupled receptor agonists have shown that the stimulation of a protease activity by these agonists is involved in the transactivation (42Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This stimulation results in the cleavage of EGF-like precursors and the production of diffusible growth factors that then activate the EGFR (12Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 38Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 39Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). This proteolytic event is likely to be mediated by a metalloproteinase, based on sensitivity of the transactivation of EGFR to BB-94, a broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor (42Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). TPA has been suggested to activate cleavage of pro-TGF-α, pro-HB-EGF, and proamphiregulin (22Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol.

The cleavage of pro-HB-EGF was also found to be modulated by metalloproteinase-disintegrins (ADAM family), members of the Metzincin family (23Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T.

Intermolecular Cross-talk in Tumor Metastasis. NATO Science Series, IOS Press, Amsterdam1999: 263-290Google Scholar). In the present work, we used a neutralizing antibody against HB-EGF to deplete the released EGFR ligand and also a neutralizing antibody against the EGFR to block the binding site of the EGFR for its ligands, resulting in inhibition of TPA-induced EGFR and ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, BB-94, a potent inhibitor of MMPs and ADAMs, blocked TPA-induced ERK activity and cell transformation but did not affect EGF-induced signal transduction. These results suggest that TPA-induced ectodomain shedding of certain EGFR ligands by MMP activates the EGFR, and this transactivation of the EGFR is an important mechanism by which the EGFR mediates TPA-induced tumor promotion-associated signal transduction.To address whether the EGFR is involved in TPA-induced signal transduction and cell transformation, we used EGFR-deficient cells and highly specific EGFR inhibitors to provide direct evidence that the EGFR, at least partially, is required for TPA-induced signal transduction associated with cell transformation. Through blocking ligand binding to the EGFR by using a neutralizing antibody against HB-EGF or EGFR and suppressing MMP activity by using a MMP inhibitor, we demonstrated that TPA-induced transactivation of the EGFR occurs through the release of EGFR ligands. Taken together, our data suggest that EGFR mediates TPA-induced tumor promotion-associated signal transduction (Fig. 6). This mechanism may account for TPA-induced long term tumor promotion and thus provide a novel mechanism of TPA-induced tumor promotion. The strong tumor-promoting effect of TPA is believed to contribute to its activation of PKC. However, TPA has also been shown to increase phosphorylation of the EGFR (11Xian W. Kiguchi K. Imamoto A. Rupp T. Zilberstein A. DiGiovanni J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1447-1455PubMed Google Scholar, 12Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TPA-stimulated signal transduction may be related to a signaling network that couples TPA to the EGFR. However, the role of the EGFR in TPA-induced signal transduction is not clear. Here we demonstrated that repression of the EGFR by specific inhibitors reduced TPA-induced phosphorylation of ERKs, AP-1 activity, and cell transformation.Egfr-deficient cells blocked TPA-induced ERK activity and AP-1 DNA binding activity. Blocking of the ectodomain of the EGFR by a monoclonal antibody hindered TPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation, ERK activity, and AP-1 DNA binding activity, suggesting that TPA induced the release of some components functioning as EGFR ligands. In addition, the use of an antibody to neutralize HB-EGF, a kind of EGFR ligand, suppressed TPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activity. Inhibition of MMP, the activator of ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands, blocked TPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation as well as ERK activity and cell transformation. Taken together, these results suggest that the EGFR is involved in mediating TPA-induced signal transduction. Induction of EGFR transactivation by TPA is a mechanism by which the EGFR mediates TPA-induced tumor promotion-related signal transduction. PKC is a major target of TPA and, thus, the role of PKC in mediating tumor promotion has been emphasized. Activated PKC phosphorylates target proteins on serine or threonine residues, presumably altering their functional properties. MAP kinases are important mediators of signal transduction from various extracellular stimuli to many cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Activation of PKC by TPA results in the rapid activation of ERKs (26Hoshi M. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5396-5401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ray L.B.

https://openalex.org/W1966350729,"When co-expressed with a receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) accessory protein, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) can function as a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CRLR-RAMP1) or an adrenomedullin (AM) receptor (CRLR-RAMP2/3). Here we report on the structural domain(s) involved in selective AM binding that were examined using various RAMP chimeras and deletion mutants. Co-expression of chimeric RAMPs and CRLR in HEK293 cells revealed that residues 77–101, situated in the extracellular N-terminal domain of human RAMP2 (hRAMP2), were crucial for selective AM-evoked cAMP production. More detailed analysis showed that deletion of hRAMP2 residues 86–92 significantly attenuated high-affinity125I-AM binding and AM-evoked cAMP production despite full cell surface expression of the receptor heterodimer and that deletion of hRAMP3 residues 59–65 had a similar effect. There is little sequence identity between hRAMP3 residues 59–65 and hRAMP2 residues 86–92; moreover, substituting alanine for Trp86(Ala87), Met88, Ile89, Ser90, Arg91, or Pro92 of hRAMP2 had no effect on AM-evoked cAMP production. It thus seems unlikely that any one amino acid residue is responsible for determining selective AM binding or that AM binds directly to these peptide segments. Instead these findings suggest that the respective seven-amino acid sequences confer selectivity either by directly contributing to the structure of ligand binding pocket or by allosteric modulation of the conformation of CRLR.

Although they share very little sequence identity, both proteins contain ring structures comprised of six or seven amino acids linked by a disulfide bridge and an amidated C terminus required for biological activity (3Wimalawansa S.J.

Both peptides and their specific or common binding sites are widely distributed among peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system and mediate a wide variety of biological effects (4Van Rossum D.

RAMPs consist of ∼160 amino acids and possess a large extracellular N-terminal domain, a single transmembrane-spanning domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. Co-expression of RAMP1 with CRLR leads to both proteins being presented at the plasma membrane as a CGRP receptor, while co-expression of RAMP2 or -3 allows CRLR to function as an AM receptor (7McLatchie L.M.

Interestingly, although RAMP2 and -3 share only 30% sequence identity and differ in their tissue distributions, they generate essentially equivalent AM receptors when co-expressed with CRLR in HEK293T cells (9Fraser N.J.

It was initially believed that mature glycosylation of CRLR in the presence of RAMP1 determined CGRP specificity, while core glycosylation in the presence of RAMP2 or -3 determined AM specificity (7McLatchie L.M.

However, unlike in mammalian cells, co-expression of CRLR with RAMP1 or RAMP2 in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells led to RAMP-independent, uniformly mature glycosylation of CRLR; moreover, the functional properties of the CGRP and AM receptors formed were indistinguishable from those in mammalian cells (11Aldecoa A.

This is consistent with a more recent study directly demonstrating that the distinct pharmacology conferred by each RAMP is independent of the CRLR glycosylation state (12Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In fact, although core-glycosylated CRLR predominates when co-expressed with RAMP2 or -3, cross-linking experiments revealed that 125I-AM binds only to the mature forms. On the other hand, analysis of various RAMP1/2 chimeras showed the extracellular N-terminal domain to be crucial for defining CGRP or AM selectivity (12Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which is consistent with earlier radioligand binding and functional assays (9Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To further examine the structural domains of hAM receptors that confer agonist specificity, we analyzed the effects of co-expressing CRLR and various chimeras and deletion mutants in HEK293 cells. Our results indicate that seven-residue segments situated between three residues conserved in both hRAMP2 and hRAMP3 (amino acids 86–92 and 59–65, respectively) are key determinants of high affinity agonist binding to the hAM receptors. A plasmid hCRLR cDNA (13Fluhmann B. Muff R. Hunziker W. Fisher J.A. Born W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Kenji Kangawa (National Cardiovascular Research Institute, Osaka, Japan).125I-hAM (specific activity, 2 μCi/pmol) was produced in our laboratory (2Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichiki Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Human αCGRP and AM were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Mouse anti-Myc antibody was from Invitrogen. Fluorescein PE-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody was from Exalpha Biologicals, Inc. All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from various commercial suppliers. Human CRLR and RAMPs were modified to provide a consensus Kozak sequence as described previously (14Aiyar N. Rand K. Elshourbagy N.A. Zeng Z. Adamou J.E. Bergsma D.J. Li Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11325-11329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Expression vector pCAGGS-hCRLR was constructed by cloning hCRLR cDNA into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS/Neo (10Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) using the 5′ XhoI and 3′ NotI sites. In addition, a Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) was ligated in-frame to the 5′-end of all hRAMP cDNAs, and the native signal sequences were removed and replaced with MKTILALSTYIFCLVFA (15Guon X.-M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein, not conjugated with hCRLR, was also inserted into the vector to confirm hCRLR expression levels. myc-hRAMPs were then cloned into pCAGGS/Neo without green fluorescent protein cDNA. myc-hRAMP1/2 chimeras were constructed by digestion at three unique restriction sites (BamHI, Bsp1286I, andMflI) located in the extracellular N-terminal domain of hRAMP2. As these sites are absent in hRAMP1, corresponding DNA fragments containing them were prepared by PCR using primers containing the sites. The separate fragments of myc-hRAMP1 and -2 were then ligated and cloned into the same expression vector. Chimeric RAMPs were all sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 310 Genetic Analyzer. Deletion mutations and single amino acid substitutions were carried out using a Quick Change kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer with pIRES-myc-hRAMPs serving as the template, which was constructed by subcloning the coding sequence of each myc-hRAMP into pIRES1/Neo (CLONTECH). For each mutation, two complementary 30-mer oligonucleotides (sense and antisense) were designed to contain the desired mutation in their middle. To allow a rapid screening of mutated clones, the primers carried an additional silent mutation introducing (or removing) a restriction site. The presence of each mutation of interest and the absence of undesired ones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Individual myc-hRAMP mutants were then cloned into pCAGGS/Neo. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. To obtain cells stably expressing hCRLR, HEK293 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 35-mm culture dishes and then transfected with 1 μg of linearized pCAGGS-hCRLR using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two days after transfection, cells were selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), after which a pool of G418-resistant colonies was trypsinized and diluted, and single cells were seeded into 96-well plates. Stable transfectants were then isolated ∼3 weeks later, and a single cell line in which almost 100% of cells expressed green fluorescent protein (assessed by flow cytometry) and functionally responded to CRLR agonists when co-transfected with hRAMPs (assessed by cAMP assay) was selected for further analysis. The transfectant cell line was maintained in the same Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml G418. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells stably expressing hCRLR was also performed using LipofectAMINE. The cells were seeded into 24-well culture plates, and at 70% confluence cells were transfected with empty expression vector (pCAGGS/Neo) or with wild-type, chimeric, or mutant expression constructs. This was accomplished by incubating the cells for 3 h in 250 μl of Optimem 1 medium containing 100 ng/well plasmid DNA and 2 μl/well LipofectAMINE. All experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Flow cytometry was performed to assess levels of cell surface expression of various myc-hRAMP2 and -3 deletion mutants in HEK293 cells stably expressing hCRLR. Following transient transfection, the cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer (20 mm PBS, pH 7.4, 1% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide), and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with monoclonal c-Myc antibody (1:1000 dilution). Following two additional washes with FACS buffer, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark with fluorescein PE-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:400 dilution) in ice-cold FACS buffer. Then after two successive washes with FACS buffer, the cells were adjusted to a density of 2 × 105 cells/tube in FACS buffer containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, subjected to flow cytometry on an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and analyzed using EXPO 2 software (Beckman Coulter). Fluorophores were excited at 488 nm, and emission was monitored at 530 nm for green fluorescent protein and 575 nm for PE. Viability was assessed by exclusion of propidium iodide. To assess whole-cell radioligand binding, transfected HEK293 cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with prewarmed PBS and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS to reduce endogenous AM binding, after which the remaining adherent cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 125I-hAM (20 pm) in the presence (for nonspecific binding) or absence (for total binding) of 1 μm unlabeled hAM in modified Krebs-Ringers-HEPES medium (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mm d-glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin), washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and harvested with 0.5 m NaOH. The associated cellular radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. Specific binding was defined as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding. Analyses of intracellular cAMP accumulation were carried out following transfection of the indicated cDNAs into HEK293 cells stably expressing hCRLR. In Hanks' buffer containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were exposed to hαCGRP or hAM for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), after which the reactions were terminated by addition of lysis buffer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The lysates were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, aliquots of the supernatants were harvested, and the cAMP content was determined using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for a nonacetylation protocol. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Differences between two groups were evaluated with Student's t tests; differences among multiple groups were evaluated with a one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. To roughly assess which structural domains of the hAM receptor mediates cAMP accumulation upon binding AM, we constructed a group of hRAMP chimeras by using three unique restriction sites (BamHI,Bsp1286I, and MflI), which enabled us to generate six hybrid genes by swapping DNA restriction fragments (Fig.1). These RAMP chimeras were then transiently transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing hCRLR and characterized by measuring agonist-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2). We found that AM but not CGRP increased the cAMP content of untransfected cells slightly; maximal cAMP levels reached ∼2.5-fold over baseline, which was consistent with the finding that intact HEK293 cells endogenously express hRAMP2 (data not shown). When co-expressed with myc-hRAMP1 or -2, hCRLR mediated marked, concentration-dependent increases in cAMP in response to CGRP or AM (Fig. 2,a and b). In cells co-expressing myc-hRAMP1 and hCRLR, both CGRP and AM elicited accumulations of cAMP that were nearly 20-fold greater than in cells expressing hCRLR alone (EC50= 0.34 or 1.39 nm, respectively). On the other hand, cells expressing hCRLR and myc-hRAMP2 responded more selectively to AM (EC50 = 0.46 nm). Note that these EC50 values are compatible with those previously obtained in HEK293 cells stably expressing hCRLR and hRAMPs (10Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M.

Cell lysates were then analyzed for cAMP content. Symbols represents means ± S.E. from three separate identical experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the six chimeric constructs, replacement of residues 36–76 of myc-hRAMP2 with the corresponding myc-hRAMP1 sequence had little effect on myc-hRAMP2-mediated cAMP production (Fig. 2c). Likewise, replacement of residues 102–175 or 128–175 of myc-hRAMP2 with the corresponding myc-hRAMP1 sequence had little effect on myc-hRAMP2-mediated responses to AM (EC50 = 0.43 and 0.40 nm, respectively (Fig. 2, g and h)). When myc-hRAMP2 residues 36–124 were replaced by the corresponding sequence from myc-hRAMP1, however, expression of the resultant chimera induced a leftward shift in the CGRP concentration-response curve, yielding a response comparable to those mediated by myc-hRAMP1 (Fig.2e). Two of the chimeras were incapable of mediating cAMP accumulation in response to either AM or CGRP (Fig. 2, d and f). This is explained by the observation that neither was detectable in the cells unless the cells were permeabilized (as judged by PE fluorescence of permeabilized cells). The staining pattern suggested that these proteins were probably in the endoplasmic reticulum, representing a pool of newly synthesized molecules not yet transported to the cell surface (data not shown). The above findings suggest that AM selectivity is determined within a region between amino acids 77 and 101 of hRAMP2. We therefore constructed two chimeras in which residues 77–101 were replaced with the corresponding sequence from hRAMP1 to produce an hRAMP2/1/2 chimera, and conversely, an hRAMP1/2/1 chimera was generated by inserting the residues 77–101 of hRAMP2 into the corresponding sequence of hRAMP1 (Fig. 3A). In cells co-expressing myc-hRAMP1/2/1 with CRLR, AM produced a greater increase in cAMP than did CGRP (EC50 = 0.58 nm) (Fig. 3B), and the responses were very similar to those observed in cells expressing hRAMP2/1 (Fig. 2g). By contrast, myc-hRAMP2/1/2 failed to mediate cAMP production in response to AM or CGRP (Fig. 3B). These results confirm that the amino acid sequence determining the selectivity of AM-evoked cAMP production via the CRLR·RAMP2 complex is situated among residues 77–101 of hRAMP2. To gain a more precise understanding of how residues 77–101 of hRAMP2 confer agonist selectivity, we constructed the 10 hRAMP2 deletion mutants shown in Fig. 4and carried out a detailed pharmacological characterization following their transient transfection into HEK293 cells stably expressing hCRLR. We initially analyzed the cell surface expression of epitope-tagged mutants using FACS (Fig. 5). Cell surface immunoreactivity was detected in only 1.82 ± 0.02% of cells expressing hCRLR alone. This markedly increased to 53.0 ± 1.0% of cells when myc-hRAMP2 was co-expressed with hCRLR. Co-expression of deletion mutant D76–78, D79–82, D86–89, or D90–92 with hCRLR led to their full expression at the cell surface in 47.2 ± 0.03, 21.7 ± 1.9, 16.8 ± 0.5, and 29.9 ± 1.3% of cells, respectively. The other mutants appeared at the surface of only ∼6% of cells, although the proteins were diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown).Figure 5FACS analysis of HEK293 cells co-expressing hCRLR with hRAMP2 or its deletion mutants.A, cell surface expression of myc-tagged hRAMP2 and its deletion mutants. HEK293 cells stably expressing hCRLR were transiently transfected with empty vector (Mock), myc-hRAMP2, or the indicated mutants. The cells were then incubated with monoclonal c-Myc antibody for 45 min at 4 °C followed by fluorescein PE-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C.

The number of cells was estimated by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the ligand selectivity of the various deletion mutants, we examined the binding of 125I-AM to the receptors comprised of hCRLR complexed with the indicated mutants (Fig.6A). As mentioned above, transfection of hCRLR into HEK293 cells, which endogenously express hRAMP2, led to production of an AM receptor, enabling AM-specific binding (199 ± 14 Bq/μg of protein). In cells co-expressing myc-hRAMP2 and hCRLR, the specific AM binding was 4.4-fold higher than in cells expressing hCRLR alone. Two of the deletion mutants, D76–78 and D79–82, were capable of supporting 125I-AM binding that was 94 and 32% of that seen with myc-hRAMP2, which was consistent with their level of presentation at the cell surface. It is therefore noteworthy that expression of two mutants, D86–89 or D90–92, led to a loss of agonist binding despite their full presentation at the cell surface (Fig. 5). Co-expression of the remaining mutants did not increase the specific AM binding over that seen in cells expressing hCRLR alone. We then assessed AM-evoked cAMP production in HEK293 cells co-expressing hCRLR and one of the 10 deletion mutants (Fig.6B). As with myc-hRAMP2, co-expression of D76–78 with hCRLR mediated significant cAMP production in response to 100 nmAM. Similarly, D79–82 evoked a smaller but significant increase in cAMP. Consistent with the binding assays (Fig. 6A), however, the remaining mutants markedly impaired AM-evoked cAMP production, indicating residues 86–92 of hRAMP2 to be essential for agonist binding and functionality of the hAM receptor. When the D86–92 deletion mutant was co-expressed in HEK293 cells with hCRLR, the Myc epitope of the mutant was present at the surface of 24.7 ± 1.3% of cells (Fig. 7), midway between the levels observed with mutants D86–89 and D90–92 (Fig. 5). Further, in cells expressing D86–89, D90–92, or D86–92, the total125I-AM binding was significantly reduced to 18, 24, and 21% of that obtained with empty expression vector, respectively (Fig.8A), and AM-induced cAMP production was not different from that seen in cells expressing hCRLR alone (Fig. 8B). When an alanine was substituted for Trp86 (Ala87), Met88, Ile89, Ser90, Arg91, or Pro92 of myc-hRAMP2 to assess which of these residues might affect the capacity of AM to induce cAMP production, no significant change in EC50 value or response magnitude was seen (TableI), indicating that no single amino acid residue within this segment is responsible for the ligand selectivity of the AM receptor.Figure 8Effects of D86–89, D90–92, and D86–92 on radioligand binding and functional responses in hCRLR-expressing cells.A, total 125I-AM binding.

We next attempted to define the structural domains of the CRLR-RAMP3 receptor, which also selectively binds AM. Note that although the sequence alignment in Fig. 9 shows residues Trp83, Cys84, and Tyr93 of hRAMP2 to be conserved in hRAMP3, the corresponding seven-amino acid segment in between shows little sequence identity. Foord and Marshall (16Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 184-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) hypothesized that RAMPs might directly affect ligand binding by contributing or masking binding sites, or they might enable different binding states of CRLR by allosterically modifying its conformation. With that hypothesis in mind, a myc-hRAMP3 deletion mutant, D59–65, was co-expressed with hCRLR in HEK293 cells, after which FACS analysis showed it to be present at the surface of 53.8 ± 2.4% of cells (Fig. 10). The IC50 for AM binding in cells expressing D59–65, D86–92, or empty expression vector was >1 μm under conditions where the IC50 was 54 nm in cells expressing myc-hRAMP2 (Fig. 11A). In addition, total AM binding in cells expressing D59–65 was reduced by 14–24% as compared with cells expressing empty vector, which is similar to the reduction seen in cells expressing D86–92. The specific binding of125I-AM to cells expressing empty vector, D86–92, and D59–65 was 157, 126, and 111 Bq/μg of protein, respectively.Figure 10FACS analysis of HEK293 cells co-expressing hCRLR with hRAMP3 deletion mutant D59–65.A, cell surface expression of myc-tagged D59–65.

On the other hand, although structural characteristics of residues 56–66 of hRAMP1 are very similar to those of the corresponding sequences of hRAMP2 and -3 (Fig. 9), myc-hRAMP1 D59–65 was not presented at the cell surface (data not shown). We have shown that seven amino acids located between three conserved residues in the extracellular N-terminal domains of hRAMP2 (86) and hRAMP3 (59) are essential for high affinity agonist binding to hAM receptors as well as for the functionality of the receptor. Previous studies have shown that RAMPs serve as accessory proteins influencing CRLR glycosylation and determining ligand specificity (7McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar, 9Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that mature glycosylation of CRLR in the presence of RAMP1 and core glycosylation in the presence of RAMP2 or -3 determines whether CRLR binds CGRP or AM. More recent evidence suggests that the distinct pharmacology conferred by individual RAMPs does not depend on the CRLR glycosylation state, however. For instance, unlike in mammalian cells, co-expression of CRLR with RAMP1 in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells does not affect CRLR glycosylation, although the CRLR·RAMP1 complex acted as a CGRP receptor with pharmacological properties indistinguishable from those in mammalian cells (11Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hilairet et al. (12Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) showed that 125I-AM binds only to the mature glycosylated CRLR, even though the core-glycosylated forms of the receptor predominate when CRLR is co-expressed in mammalian cells with RAMP2 or -3. Those investigators also showed that, when complexed with CRLR, RAMPs are situated close to the agonist binding pocket as125I-CGRP and 125I-AM could be cross-linked in RAMP1 and RAMP2 or -3, respectively (12Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which supports the idea that the distinct pharmacology acquired by CRLR reflects the direct participation of RAMPs in ligand binding. Interestingly, the CRLR·RAMP1 complex is sensitive to peptide N-glycosidase F, while CRLR·RAMP2 and -3 are resistant to the enzyme (12Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This indicates that distinct conformations of the receptor are induced by the different RAMPs, irrespective of whether an agonist is bound. In the present study, 125I-AM binding was significantly diminished by expression of two hRAMP2 mutants, D86–89 and D90–92 (Fig. 8). However, as substituting an alanine for Trp86(Ala87), Met88, Ile89, Ser90, Arg91, or Pro92 caused no significant change on AM-evoked cAMP production and as amino acids 86–92 of hRAMP2 and 59–65 of hRAMP3 show little sequence identity, it seems unlikely that any single amino acid residue is responsible for determining selective AM binding or that AM binds directly to these sequences. More likely, these seven-amino acid sequences confer selectivity by contributing directly to the structure of the ligand binding pocket or perhaps indirectly through allosteric modulation of the conformation of CRLR. Furthermore, as the ring structure (Cys16–Cys21) and amidation of the C-terminal residue of the AM molecule are both essential for agonist binding and receptor activation (18Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Iwasaki H. Sato K. Watanabe T.X. Inui T. Nakajima K. Sakakibara S. Marumo F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the finding that expression of D86–92 significantly inhibited 125I-hAM binding and cAMP production suggests that residues 86–92 of hRAMP2 may be involved in the binding of the ring structure or the amidated C terminus of AM to the receptor. When co-expressed with hCRLR, hRAMP2 mutant D79–82 mediated only low levels of specific 125I-AM binding and AM-induced cAMP production (Figs. 5 and 6). The attenuated response, despite full expression hCRLR and D79–82 at the cell surface, suggests residues 79–82 of hRAMP2 also contribute to the agonist specificity of the hAM receptor. Co-expression of hCRLR with D70–75, D83–85, or D93–96 completely abolished both radioligand binding and cAMP production with almost all the mutant remaining in the cytoplasm together with hCRLR. It is interesting to us that residues Asp74, Trp83, Cys84, and Tyr93 of hRAMP2 are conserved in hRAMP3 and that the two segments (residues 79–82 and 86–92) these residues delimit in hRAMP2 play a key role in conferring agonist specificity. Determination of the specific roles played by the four conserved residues in the interaction between CRLR and RAMP, or perhaps in the transport of the CRLR·RAMP complex to the cell surface, will require further study, however. We tested also the hypothesis that hRAMP2 D86–92 and hRAMP3 D59–65 can act as negative regulators of hAM receptor function. To address that question, we used HEK293 cells stably expressing hCRLR, which forms functional hAM receptors with endogenous hRAMP2. Consistent with our hypothesis, co-expression of hRAMP2 D86–92 or hRAMP3 D59–65 with hCRLR significantly diminished specific 125I-AM binding and AM-evoked cAMP production. Previous studies have shown that the dominant negative activity of truncated V2 vasopressin receptors resulted from reduction of cell surface expression of the full-length receptor protein and formation of heterodimeric complexes involving the truncated and full-length forms (19Zhu X. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15773-15784Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although several studies have investigated the relative affinities of various RAMP forms for CRLR (8Muff R.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether the inhibition of receptor function by dominant negative RAMP mutants is due to competitive inhibition, formation of heterodimeric complexes, or both. A detailed analysis of dominant negative effects of D86–92 and D59–65 is currently ongoing."

(1997) Biochemistry 36, 1479–1486) and seven predicted cytoplasmic cysteines. A mutant of rat SERT (X8C) in which those eight cysteine residues were replaced by other amino acids retained ∼32% of wild type transport activity and ∼56% of wild type binding activity. In contrast to wild-type SERT or the C109A mutant, X8C was resistant to inhibition of high affinity cocaine analog binding by the cysteine reagent 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) in membrane preparations from transfected cells. Each predicted cytoplasmic cysteine residue was reintroduced, one at a time, into the X8C template. Reintroduction of Cys-357, located in the third intracellular loop, restored MTSEA sensitivity similar to that of C109A. Replacement of only Cys-109 and Cys-357 was sufficient to prevent MTSEA sensitivity. Thus, Cys-357 was the sole cytoplasmic determinant of MTSEA sensitivity in SERT. Both serotonin and cocaine protected SERT from inactivation by MTSEA at Cys-357. This protection was apparently mediated through a conformational change following ligand binding. Although both ligands bind in the absence of Na+ and at 4 °C, their ability to protect Cys-357 required Na+ and was prevented at 4 °C. The accessibility of Cys-357 to MTSEA inactivation was increased by monovalent cations. The K+ion, which is believed to serve as a countertransport substrate for SERT, was the most effective ion for increasing Cys-357 reactivity.

These transporters take up extracellular substrate in a process that is coupled to the transmembrane movement of Na+, Cl−, and, in some cases, K+ (5Rudnick G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In SERT, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake into neurons and peripheral cells such as platelets is believed to occur through cotransport with Na+and Cl− and countertransport with K+ (5Rudnick G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A widely studied aspect of these proteins is their role in the removal of neurotransmitter after its release into the synaptic cleft of neurons, by which they regulate synaptic activity. The role of SERT in behavior is demonstrated by the action of SERT inhibitors, which are clinically effective as antidepressants (6Boyer W. Int. Clin. Psychopharmacol. 1992; 6: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SERT also interacts with psychostimulants, some of which, such as cocaine, are inhibitors (7Wall S.C. Innis R.B. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 264-270PubMed Google Scholar), while others, such as amphetamine derivatives, are alternative substrates (8Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SERT is most closely related to transporters for the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine (DAT and NET, respectively) (1Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 22Rudnick G. Reith M. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation.

They are all inhibited by cocaine and share many structural and functional properties. Hydropathy analysis of the cDNA sequence coding for SERT (23Blakely R. Berson H. Fremeau R. Caron M. Peek M.

Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M. Davidson N. Lester H. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 10Pacholczyk T. Blakely R. Amara S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Previous work from this laboratory established that cysteine and lysine residues in each of the predicted external loops reacted with impermeant reagents added to the extracellular medium (26Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, this technique did not establish the topology of any intracellular domains. In mutants with no reactive residues in external loops, cysteine and lysine reagents reacted with SERT only when the cell membrane was permeabilized with detergent, providing a means to identify intracellular residues. A single endogenous cysteine residue at position 109 (Cys-109) in SERT is responsible for inactivation by extracellular application of the cysteine reagents 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) and [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) (27Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This residue is predicted to lie in the first extracellular loop. A mutant of SERT in which Cys-109 was replaced by alanine (C109A) was insensitive to external cysteine reagents. However, in membrane preparations of cells expressing C109A, we observed modest inactivation of binding activity by these reagents, suggesting that one or more internal cysteine residues were modified, leading to inactivation (28Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Work on related transporters has identified internal cysteines as determinants of sensitivity to cysteine reagents. In DAT, two predicted intracellular cysteines, Cys-135 in the first internal loop (IL1) and Cys-342 in IL3 (equivalent to Cys-155 and Cys-357 in SERT, respectively), were shown to confer sensitivity to cysteine reagents (29Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (GAT-1), a predicted internal cysteine at position 399 was shown to be the major site of inactivation by cysteine reagents (30Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There is no cysteine in SERT at the position corresponding to γ-aminobutyric acid transporter Cys-399. In the present work, we undertook identification of the cysteine residues on the internal surface of rat SERT that were responsible for inactivation of binding in membrane preparations. Our results suggest that a reactive cysteine in the third intracellular loop is sensitive to conformational changes that result from ion and ligand binding. Mutant transporters were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the C109A mutant of rat SERT, which contains sequences encoding a c-myc epitope tag at the N terminus and a FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus (27Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated regions were excised by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned back into the original plasmid. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Confluent HeLa cells were infected with recombinant vTF-7 vaccinia virus and then transfected with plasmid bearing SERT mutant cDNA under control of the T7 promoter as described previously (32Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated for 14–20 h at 37 °C and then used for the determination of transport and binding activities. Transfected HeLa cells in 24-well culture plates were washed twice with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/CM). To the washed cells, 250 μl of PBS/CM containing 4.9 nm 5-HT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; catalog no. NET-498) was added, and the incubation was continued for 10 min at room temperature when each well was washed three times by aspiration with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in 500 μl of 1% SDS for 30–60 min, transferred into scintillation vials, and counted in 3 ml of Optifluor scintillant (Packard Instrument Co.). HeLa cells grown in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks were transfected with SERT cDNA as described above. The cells were rinsed once with 10 mm HEPES buffer (adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH) and scraped into 5 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 1:500 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma; catalog no. P8340) and 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The cells were then disrupted by homogenization in 20 ml of homogenization buffer on ice, using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman Inc., New York) at a setting of 7 for 20 s. The homogenization was repeated after 1 min on ice. The membranes were collected by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Each preparation from a single 75-cm2 flask was resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer and stored as 0.1-ml samples at −80 °C. To determine binding activity, the high affinity cocaine analog, 2-β-carbomethoxy-3-β-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT) was used. Membrane suspensions were thawed on ice and diluted with 1 ml of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, with NaOH, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2). 100 μl of the diluted suspension was added per well in 96-well filtration plates (Multiscreen Filtration System; Millipore Corp.). The membranes were washed twice by filtration with 200 μl of binding buffer, and then binding was initiated by the addition of 200 μl of binding buffer containing 10,000 cpm of β-CIT (RTI-55; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog no. NEX272). For determination of MTSEA sensitivity, the membranes were incubated with MTSEA for 15 min following initial washing of the membranes. Then MTSEA was removed by washing the membranes three times with binding buffer. The membranes were incubated with β-CIT for 1.5 h at room temperature with gentle agitation, and then the reaction was terminated by washing the membranes three times with 200 μl of binding buffer. The filters from each individual well were removed and placed in scintillation vials containing 3 ml of Optifluor scintillation fluid (Packard Instrument Co.). The filters were allowed to soak for 2 h and were then counted. To measure the effect of cations on the action of MTSEA, the membranes were washed in binding buffer with all Na+ replaced by the given replacement ion, and MTSEA was diluted into that buffer. After the MTSEA incubation, the membranes were washed in normal, Na+-containing binding buffer in which binding was measured. For the protection assays, ligands (cocaine or serotonin) were added to the washed membranes and incubated for 10 min. MTSEA was subsequently added to the membranes for 15 min, and the membranes were then washed with binding buffer five times to remove unbound MTSEA and ligand. Binding was then measured as described above. Following MTSEA incubation of membrane suspensions, either 12 mm free cysteine, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, or 10 mm dithiothreitol were added to the suspension for 180, 90, or 15 min, respectively. At the end of the incubation, the membranes were washed three times with binding buffer, and binding was measured as described above. Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA), which used the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares curve fitting algorithm. Each figure shows a representative experiment that was performed at least twice. The statistical analysis given was from multiple experiments. Unless indicated otherwise, data with error bars represented the mean ± S.D. for four samples from two separate experiments. Theasterisks indicate significance at the p < 0.05 level in the paired Student's t test. The C109A mutant of SERT was shown to be insensitive to externally applied methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents (26Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 27Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, in membrane preparations from cells expressing C109A, β-CIT binding was inactivated by MTS reagents (28Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In these membrane preparations, MTS reagents have access to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, suggesting that one or more internal cysteines were responsible for the inactivation of binding in C109A. To identify the internal cysteine residues responsible for this inactivation, a mutant of SERT was prepared (X8C) with eight predicted intra- and extracellular cysteines (at positions 15, 21, 109, 147, 155, 357, 522, and 622) replaced by other amino acids. Cys-357, which was highly conserved within the NaCl-coupled transporter gene family, was changed to isoleucine, which was found in the corresponding position in the proline transporter. Cys-522 was changed to serine as found in the corresponding positions in NET and DAT. Cys-147 was changed to alanine as found in NET and DAT. Cys-155 was highly conserved but was changed to alanine, which was one of the few amino acids that was found at that position when it was not cysteine. The other predicted internal cysteine residues were changed to alanine, because there was little sequence conservation at that position within the gene family. X8C, which retained significant transport and binding activity, was further modified by restoring each of the endogenous predicted internal cysteines in the X8C background. These constructs, as well as one with only Cys-109 and Cys-357 replaced (C109A/C357I) were all found to be active for transport and binding (TableI).Table ITransport and binding activities of SERT mutantsMutationPercentage of C109ATransport activityBinding activity%%C109A/C357I63.6 ± 6.198.9 ± 2.7X8C31.9 ± 3.855.8 ± 6.3X8C-21C30.1 ± 2.847.0 ± 5.8X8C-15C,21C27.2 ± 2.350.1 ± 4.9X8C-147C33.0 ± 1.470.1 ± 8.7X8C-155C79.0 ± 2.647.7 ± 2.1X8C-357C63.4 ± 3.564.4 ± 1.1X8C-522C61.8 ± 6.655.0 ± 2.7X8C-622C32.9 ± 1.764.92 ± 11.4Transport activity was assayed in HeLa cells following expression of the mutants as described under “Materials and Methods.” Binding activity was assayed using a membrane preparation from HeLa cells expressing each construct as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are means ± S.D. from six measurements in three separate experiments expressed as the percentage of transport or binding activity relative to SERT C109A.

X8C is SERT with the following substitutions: C15A, C21A, C109A, C147A, C155A, C357I, C522S, and C622A. In constructs such as X8C-357C, one or more of the endogenous cysteine residues was restored in the X8C background. All of these mutants retained significant transport and binding activities (Table I). X8C, the mutant with all predicted intracellular cysteines replaced, had about the lowest transport activity (31.9 ± 3.8% of C109A activity). Reintroduction of Cys-155 and Cys-357 into X8C resulted in the greatest recovery of transport activity (44 and 40%, respectively). The binding activities of the SERT mutants were significantly greater than the transport activities when expressed as a percentage of C109A activity. X8C had 56% of C109A binding activity, and again, reintroduction of Cys-155 resulted in the greatest binding activity of all single cysteine replacement mutants (70% of C109A). However, reintroduction of Cys-357 into X8C did not substantially increase binding activity. As described previously (28Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), 5-HT transport by cells expressing SERT C109A was insensitive to MTSEA. We chose to use this reagent in studying putative cytoplasmic cysteine residues, because it is more reactive than MTSET (33Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). MTSEA is also more permeant across lipid bilayers than MTSET (34Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), but for this study it was seen as an advantage that the reagent would have unrestricted access to the cytoplasmic face of the transporter. Fig.1 A shows that intact cells expressing Cys-109 or the X8C mutant were resistant to a 15-min treatment with 1.5 mm MTSEA. In membrane preparations, where both faces of the transporter are exposed to the reaction medium, binding to C109A was inhibited markedly by the same treatment, but X8C was resistant (Fig. 1 B). It follows that one or more of the predicted internal cysteines replaced in X8C was responsible for the sensitivity of SERT to MTSEA. We examined mutants of X8C, each with one or two of the original cysteines reintroduced, to determine their sensitivity to MTSEA. Only X8C-357C was sensitive to MTSEA (Fig.1 B), suggesting that the presence of Cys-357 is sufficient to confer sensitivity to SERT. In intact cells, transport by X8C-357C was insensitive to the same treatment, suggesting that Cys-357 was located on the cytoplasmic face of SERT (Fig. 1 A). To test whether Cys-357 was the only intracellular residue responsible for MTSEA inactivation, we generated a mutant of C109A in which Cys-357 was replaced with isoleucine (C109A/C357I). This mutant was insensitive to MTSEA both in intact cells (Fig. 1 A) and in membranes (Fig.1 B), demonstrating that Cys-357 was the only residue contributing to the MTSEA sensitivity in membranes from cells expressing C109A. The sensitivity of C109A, X8C, C109A/C357I, and X8C-357C to MTSEA inactivation is shown in Fig. 2. Essentially no inhibition was seen with X8C and C109A/C357I. However, C109A and X8C-357C were both markedly inactivated by concentrations of MTSEA above 0.1 mm. It is clear from these results that all of the sensitivity of C109A is accounted for by the cysteine at position 357. From the concentration of MTSEA required for half-maximal inactivation in 15 min, we estimated the pseudo-first order rate of inactivation to be 185 ± 15 min−1·M−1. To evaluate the possibility that modification of Cys-357 by MTSEA inactivates binding by directly occluding the binding site, we examined the effect of incubating membrane preparations from cells expressing C109A with 5-HT or cocaine during the treatment with MTSEA. The results, shown in Fig. 3, demonstrate that these ligands markedly decreased the extent of inactivation. In the absence of ligand, 1.5 mm MTSEA inactivated over half of the binding activity in a 15-min incubation. When the incubation was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of 5-HT or cocaine, the amount of residual activity progressively increased to over 75% of the control activity. In this experiment, the membranes were washed free of MTSEA, 5-HT, and cocaine prior to measuring binding with β-CIT, and the amount of inhibition is plotted as a percentage of controls treated similarly but without MTSEA. It is noteworthy that protection was not complete. We estimate that even in the presence of saturating concentrations of 5-HT or cocaine, MTSEA would have inactivated 17 ± 2 or 21 ± 2%, respectively. Although not shown, almost identical results were obtained with X8C-357C. Protection by ligand binding might occur by direct steric blockade of Cys-357, or alternatively, binding might induce a conformational change that reduces the reactivity of Cys-357. The results shown in Fig.4 suggest that the latter possibility is more likely. In this experiment, membranes from cells expressing C109A or X8C-357C were incubated with MTSEA in the presence or absence of Na+ and at room temperature or reduced temperature. At 4 °C, the reaction rate for MTSEA inactivation is reduced, and to compensate, a higher MTSEA concentration was used, leading to greater inactivation. However, in each case, and for both C109A and X8C-357C, protection by 5-HT and cocaine was blocked by low temperature or Na+ removal. A clear increase in activity was observed for both constructs when 5-HT or cocaine was present during MTSEA treatment in Na+ at 25 °C. However, at 4 °C or in the absence of Na+, no such increase was observed (Fig. 4). Previous experiments demonstrated that 5-HT and cocaine bind at 4 °C and in the absence of Na+ (35Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, bound 5-HT and cocaine altered the reactivity of Cys-357 only when Na+ was present and the temperature was permissive. Since the reactivity of Cys-357 was sensitive to conformational changes induced by substrate and inhibitor binding, it was of interest to determine the effects of monovalent cations, some of which are involved in the proposed reaction cycle of SERT. Fig.5 shows the remaining activity after a 15-min treatment of C109A and X8C-357C with 25 μm MTSEA in media where all of the Na+ (150 mm) was replaced with the indicated cations. For both constructs, the most activity (least inactivation) was observed in the absence of alkali cations (NMDG). Although each of the alkali cations increased the extent of inactivation, they did so to various extents. Na+ had the least effect, and K+ had the greatest, with intermediate amounts of inactivation in the presence of Li+, Cs+, or Rb+ (Fig. 5). Incubation of membranes in these monovalent cation solutions in the absence of MTSEA had no effect on their binding activity subsequently measured in Na+-containing binding buffer (data not shown). Following inactivation by 1.5 mm MTSEA in membrane preparations, the C109A and X8C-357C mutants could not be reactivated by incubation with 12 mmfree cysteine or 10 mm dithiothreitol for up to 90 min. Reactivation could not be observed even when Na+ was replaced with NMDG, K+, Li+, Cs+, or Rb+, or when 10 μm 5-HT or 10 μm cocaine was present during the incubation (data not shown). Similar treatments have been shown to reactivate some SERT mutants after inactivation with MTSET (36Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Previous results (28Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) uncovered a modest sensitivity of SERT C109A to MTSET inactivation of β-CIT binding activity. The inactivation was observed in membranes from cells expressing C109A, although transport in intact cells expressing the same SERT mutant was insensitive to externally added MTSET (27Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The work presented here demonstrates that the sensitivity of SERT C109A membranes to MTS reagents is due to a single reactive residue, Cys-357, on the cytoplasmic face of SERT. When this cysteine was present, either in C109A or X8C-357C, binding was inactivated by MTSEA treatment of membranes (Figs. 1 and 2). In contrast, when this residue was converted to isoleucine in C109A/C357I or X8C, binding was resistant to inactivation by MTSEA (Figs. 1 and 2). The same treatment of intact cells expressing these mutants did not inhibit transport (Fig. 1). This lack of sensitivity suggests that Cys-357 is accessible only from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, which is more accessible in membrane preparations than in intact cells. Although MTSEA is known to cross biological membranes (34Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), here it apparently behaves like an impermeant reagent because the limited rate of MTSEA influx is less than the rate at which it reacts with competing intracellular thiols, such as glutathione. For the same reasons, we observed no labeling of intracellular SERT cysteine residues in a previous study with N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin) unless cells were permeabilized with digitonin (26Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cys-357 was found to be the only residue conferring sensitivity to SERT. This contrasts to the case of DAT, where the corresponding cysteine residue, Cys-342, was one of two whose modification by MTS reagents led to inactivation of binding (29Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The other sensitive residue in DAT was Cys-135 in IL1. Although that cysteine residue is conserved in SERT as Cys-155, SERT constructs containing Cys-155 but not Cys-357 were resistant to inactivation by MTSEA (mutants C109A-C357I and X8C-155C in Fig. 1). Aside from Cys-357, there are six endogenous cysteine residues predicted to lie on the cytoplasmic face of SERT at positions 15, 21, 147, 155, 522, and 622. Apparently, none of these cysteines are sites of inactivation by MTSEA. They may be inaccessible to the reagent, despite their predicted location, or if they do react, their modification by MTSEA apparently does not affect β-CIT binding to the transporter. Experiments are currently under way using biotinylation to evaluate these possibilities and to define further the internal topology of SERT. At sufficient concentrations (above 2 mm, data not shown) MTSEA modification of Cys-357 leads to complete inactivation of β-CIT binding. The fact that both 5-HT and cocaine protect against the inactivation at concentrations close to their K D values for binding to SERT (Fig. 3) raises the possibility that Cys-357 is located in proximity to the β-CIT binding site, that its modification sterically interferes with binding, and that occupation of the site by 5-HT or cocaine blocks access of MTSEA to Cys-357. However, other evidence suggests that the binding site is formed from transmembrane domains (28Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 37Smicun Y. Campbell S.D. Chen M.A. Gu H. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36058-36064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 38Barker E.L. Perlman M.A. Adkins E.M. Houlihan W.J. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. Blakely R.D. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there are additional compelling reasons to reject this conclusion. Protection by 5-HT and cocaine against MTSEA inactivation does not occur in the absence of Na+ or at low temperature (Fig. 4). We know from previous studies that these conditions do not prevent binding (35Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not binding per se that prevents MTSEA modification of Cys-357, but rather a process, almost certainly a conformational change, that follows binding, requires Na+, and is blocked at low temperature. Somehow, the Na+-dependent changes that follow 5-HT or cocaine binding alter the accessibility of Cys-357 and possibly other neighboring residues in IL3. A likely consequence of this coupling between the binding site and IL3 is that modification of IL3 at Cys-357 distorts the binding site and thereby prevents high affinity β-CIT binding. The rate at which Cys-357 reacts with MTSEA is lower than previously observed for some other residues in SERT. The pseudo-first order rate constant for modification of Cys-357 was 185 ± 15 min−1·M−1 from the data presented in Fig.2. By comparison, modification of SERT I179C by MTSET occurred with a rate of 782 min−1·M−1 (28Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate of Cys-357 modification is affected by ligand and ion binding as discussed above. Finally, the modification rate was accelerated in the presence of alkali cations, particularly K+ (Fig. 5). These results strongly suggest that the accessibility of Cys-357 to MTSEA is limited and varies with the conformation of the transporter. Consistent with the limited accessibility of Cys-357 is the observation that the MTSEA-modified transporter was not reactivated with free cysteine or dithiothreitol. The reaction with MTSEA generates a disulfide that should react with free sulfhydryl compounds to regenerate an unmodified cysteine residue, as we have observed with other SERT mutants (36Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The lack of reactivation suggests that, after modification, the disulfide was inaccessible, either because the added 2-aminoethanethiol moiety blocked an already restricted access pathway to Cys-357 or because the modification induced a conformational change that occluded Cys-357. To evaluate whether the disulfide was inaccessible, we are currently using biotinylating MTS reagents to test the reversibility of labeling. Thus, Cys-357 and, by extension, IL3 are in a flexible part of the transporter that is sensitive to the conformational changes that follow ligand and ion binding. It is linked to the substrate and inhibitor binding site as evidenced by the effect of ligand binding on Cys-357 accessibility and by the inhibition of binding after modification of Cys-357. Conformational changes are expected to be key steps in the transport cycle (5Rudnick G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Rudnick G. Reith M. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar), and the variable accessibility of residues like Cys-357 and Ile-179 (28Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 36Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) suggests that they participate in those changes. It is therefore of special interest that K+increased Cys-357 reactivity. Cytoplasmic K+ is thought to be countertransported by SERT in a step that follows 5-HT release to the cytoplasm (40Rudnick G. Nelson P.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4739-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10084-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of K+ on Cys-357 modification may result from conformational changes that follow K+ binding as SERT undergoes the countertransport step of its transport cycle."

The potential contribution by the LDL moiety of Lp(a) to the cardiovascular risk has received relatively limited attention, although based on the information available on authentic LDL, it is likely to be dependent on LDL particle size and type and extent of modifications due to oxidative, lipolytic, or proteolytic events. On the contrary, free apo(a), either derived from parent Lp(a) or as a recombinant, has been reported to be an active component of Lp(a) in many cellular systems and in binding to members of the vascular extracellular matrix. In an endothelial cell system, native Lp(a), via apo(a), has been shown to stimulate the production of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (11Takami S. Yamashita S. Kihara S.

Native Lp(a) has also been reported to enhance endothelial plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression (15Etingin O.R. Hajjar D.P. Hajjar A.K. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Biol.

Moreover, in a vascular smooth muscle cell system, native Lp(a), and particularly apo(a), was shown to inhibit the proteolytic activation of transforming factor β via a decrease in cell surface generation of plasmin, resulting in increased vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation (18Grainger D.L. Kemp P.R. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Metcalfe J.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the proteolytic fragment of apo(a), namely F2 which corresponds to the C-terminal domain of apo(a), may exhibit pro-inflammatory properties in that it binds in vitro to the members of the vascular extracellular matrix (19Edelstein C.

Macrophages play a pivotal role in atherosclerosis as cellular components of the underlying chronic inflammatory process. These cells, derived from blood monocytes, are virtually absent in the normal artery but are abundant in unstable plaques, where they exhibit an increased expression of pro-inflammatory elements that contribute to the progression of the atherosclerotic lesion (22Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). At this time, it is unclear whether Lp(a) in its native form has pro-inflammatory properties. In the current study we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of Lp(a) and some of its derivatives on the production of inflammatory mediators, using as a model system human THP-1 macrophages obtained by phorbol ester stimulation of THP-1 monocytes. This cell line is highly differentiated and, upon stimulation with phorbol ester, is known to acquire properties similar to those of human monocyte-derived macrophages (23Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar, 24Via D.P. Pons L. Dennison D.K. Fanslow A.E. Bernini F. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1515-1524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that in the chosen cell system, Lp(a), Lp(a)-derived apo(a), and its C-terminal domain, all cause, although to a different degree, an increased production of interleukin (IL)-8, a potent pro-inflammatory chemokine. We also show that this effect is exhibited by neither the LDL isolated from parent Lp(a) nor by authentic LDL isolated from the plasma that served as a source of Lp(a). All the tissue culture reagents, cholera toxin, and pertussis toxin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and were of low endotoxin grade. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB), ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA), diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), EDTA, dithioerythritol (DTE), β-mercaptoethanol, SDS, porcine pancreatic elastase (EC 1.4.21.36), trehalose, formamide, and formaldehyde were purchased from Sigma. Kallikrein inactivator (KI) was purchased from Calbiochem. Nuclease-free water and the RNase-free plasticware were from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Human Glu-plasminogen was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Rabbit affinity-purified antibodies to Lp(a), apo(a), and LDL and anti-KV monoclonal antibody were prepared as described previously (25Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Lp(a) and anti-apo(a) did not react against LDL and plasminogen, and anti-LDL was unreactive to apo(a). The plasma from a healthy donor with a single apo(a) isoform of 289 kDa (26Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was obtained by plasmapheresis performed in the Blood Bank of the University of Chicago. The steps for Lp(a) and LDL isolation were carried out immediately after blood drawing using the procedure outlined below. To prevent lipoprotein degradation, the plasma was adjusted with 0.15% EDTA, 0.01% sodium azide, 10,000 units/liter KI, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lp(a) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation and lysine-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (27Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W.J. Garcia-Hedo M.T. Mora R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The purity of the product was assessed by electrophoresis on precast 1% agarose gels (Ciba-Corning, Palo Alto, CA) and Western blots of 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (NOVEX, San Diego, CA), utilizing anti-Lp(a) and anti-LDL. The LDL preparations used in this study were isolated from the same donor used for the Lp(a) preparation, at d = 1.030–1.050 g/ml by sequential flotation as described previously (28Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and assessed to have no apo(a) by electrophoresis and Western blot criteria. Lp(a−),i.e. apo(a)-free LDL, was isolated from Lp(a) as reported previously (26Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of Lp(a), Lp(a−), and LDL were determined by either a sandwich ELISA as described previously (25Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. J.

The purified lipoproteins showed no evidence of oxidation as determined by measuring the amounts of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and diene formation (29Sattler W. Kostner G.M. Waeg G. Esterbauer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The endotoxin content in lipoprotein preparations was analyzed using theLimulus amoebocyte lysate assay (Sigma) and was estimated to be less than 0.3 pg/μg Lp(a) protein and 0.2 pg/μg LDL protein. Apo(a) was isolated from Lp(a) under mild reductive conditions in the presence of 1.5–2 mm DTE as described by Edelstein et al. (26Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The final preparation of apo(a) was assessed for purity by Western blot with an anti-apo(a) and stored in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 125 mmtrehalose at −80 °C. The concentration of apo(a) was determined either by ELISA or using an extinction coefficient (ε278= 1.31 ml mg−1 cm−1) established previously for apo(a) (30Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The endotoxin content in apo(a) preparations was estimated to be less than 0.25 pg/μg apo(a). The structure of apo(a) fragments obtained by limited proteolysis using either human leukocyte or pancreatic elastase is outlined in Fig. 1. Lp(a) was digested with a purified preparation of human leukocyte elastase (1 μg of enzyme per 3 mg of Lp(a) protein) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of DFP to a final concentration of 5 mm. Apo(a) fragments containing KIV-9, retained its linkage to apoB100 via the disulfide bond, forming a miniLp(a) particle. The digest was centrifuged in 30% sucrose solutions, d 1.127 g/ml containing 100 mm EACA at 15 °C, 412,160 ×g. The floating lipoprotein fraction (top) containing miniLp(a)s, and the sedimenting fraction (bottom) containing F1, F6, and F7 were collected separately and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The bottom fraction was subjected to a lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The fraction eluted in PBS (unbound) contained F1 and F7 and was further fractionated by molecular sieve chromatography with Superdex 200; F1, due to a higher molecular weight, eluted first followed by F7. The fraction eluted from lysine-Sepharose with 100 mm EACA (bound) contained only F6. The miniLp(a)s in the top d 1.12 g/ml fraction consist of four species of miniLp(a) particles each containing apoB100 disulfide linked to individual apo(a) fragments, namely F2, F3, F4, and F5. The fragments were obtained free of apoB100 by mild reduction with DTE (1.5 mm) in the presence of 100 mm EACA and separated from the floating LDL fraction (Lp(a−) by ultracentrifugation. The sedimenting fraction (bottom) containing F2, F3, F4, and F5 was fractionated by lysine-Sepharose chromatography using a gradient of EACA from 0 to 100 mm. The order of elution with increasing EACA molarity was F4, F5, F2, and F3. The purity of the fragments was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on Coomassie-stained gels and by Western blot analysis using polyclonal monospecific rabbit anti-apo(a) and anti-apoB100 antibodies as well as monoclonal anti-KV antibodies. In addition, N-terminal sequence analysis of the first 20 amino acids confirmed the purity and identity of each fragment. When the studies involved only F1 and F2, these fragments were prepared by digestion of apo(a) with pancreatic elastase as described previously by Edelstein et al. (19Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, apo(a) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, KI (200 units/ml) was digested with porcine pancreatic elastase at a molar ratio of 25:1 (protein:enzyme) at 22 °C for 2 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 mm DFP with further incubation for 20 min. The digest was applied to a lysine-Sepharose affinity column that was then washed sequentially with 3 column volumes of PBS, 500 mm NaCl, and 200 mm EACA. Fragment F1 eluted with PBS and F2 with EACA. The PBS and EACA fractions containing these fragments were each pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and concentrated using Centriprep membranes (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA). Human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and 50 μm mercaptoethanol at 37 °C, 5% CO2. To prepare THP-1 macrophages, monocytes were plated in 6-well plates at the density of 1·106 cells/ml (2 ml per well) and incubated in the complete growth medium in the presence of 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. After 72 h, the cells were washed once with RPMI 1640 serum-free medium and incubated with a new aliquot of the serum-free medium for 16 h. At this point, the medium was replaced with a fresh serum-free medium containing the indicated amounts of Lp(a), Lp(a−), LDL, apo(a), or the apo(a) fragments and incubated with THP-1 macrophages for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 30 min with cholera or pertussis toxins (1 μg/ml) prior to the addition of apo(a). At the end of incubation, the cells were immediately processed for the isolation of RNA as described below. The supernatants from each well were collected, centrifuged to eliminate debris, and either used for determination of the concentration of IL-8 or frozen at −20 °C until further analysis. At the concentrations of apo(a) and lipoproteins used in our studies, cell viability was >95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. All the experiments were conducted in duplicate and were repeated at least twice. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Quality of the RNA preparations was verified by 1% denatured formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Sambrook et al. (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Microarray analysis of total RNA samples isolated from both control and treated cells, 5-μg aliquots, was performed using the human inflammatory response cytokines GE array kit from Super Array, Inc. (Bethesda, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This array is composed of 23 genes involved in inflammatory response including a variety of cytokines, growth factors, and interleukins such as IL-1α, -1β, -2, -4, -5, -6, -8, -10, -12A, -12B, -16, -17, and -18. It also includes two housekeeping genes, β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G3PDH). The relative mRNA level of each gene was normalized against the levels of both housekeeping genes and expressed as a ratio of sample to control. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA were fractionated by 1% denatured formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto Zeta Probe Nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillary transfer according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cross-linking with UV irradiation (Stratalinker model 2400, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the membranes were hybridized with a human radiolabeled IL-8 probe (289 base pairs), stripped, and subsequently hybridized with a human radiolabeled G3PDH probe (983 base pairs). For preparation of the hybridization probes, total RNA isolated from THP-1 cells was subjected to the reverse transcriptase-PCR by using the Super Script One-step kit from Life Technologies, Inc., and the corresponding PCR primers were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA): IL-8, forward 5′-ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTC-3′; G3PDH, forward 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′ and reverse 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′. Total RNA, 100-ng aliquot, was converted to cDNA according to the kit's instructions, and the PCR was conducted thereafter in the same reaction tube as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 2 min, total of 30 cycles. The resulting PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified by QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and subsequently labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Prime It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization and washes were performed as recommended by the manufacturer of the membrane (Bio-Rad). After autoradiography, the signals were quantified by densitometric analysis (ImageQuant software version 3.3, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and the relative mRNA level of IL-8 was normalized against that of G3PDH. The amount of IL-8 released in the media was assessed by ELISA (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the measurements were conducted in triplicate. In this preliminary work we used apo(a) because according to our previous studies (19Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Zhu L. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23856-23865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) it is the active component of Lp(a). Human THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 macrophages were incubated in the presence and absence of apo(a), 220 nm, for 24 h at 37 °C, and the gene expression in these cells was analyzed by the human inflammatory response cytokines microarray (Super Array, Inc., Bethesda, MD). Among the 23 genes examined, a 6-fold stimulation was observed for IL-8 mRNA in the apo(a)-treated THP-1 macrophages as compared with the untreated cells. This apo(a) effect on IL-8 was not observed in the THP-1 monocytes. Based on these results, we set out to identify in more detail the elements of Lp(a) responsible for the IL-8 stimulation. These products were obtained from the same donor. We first incubated THP-1 macrophages with various concentrations of Lp(a) and then evaluated the level of IL-8 expression by both Northern blot analysis and ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of the THP-1 macrophages with this lipoprotein resulted in a dose-dependent induction of both IL-8 mRNA level (up to 12-fold) and the secretion of IL-8 protein (up to 6-fold) into the culture medium. Apo(a) also caused a dose-dependent increase in the production of IL-8 mRNA (up to 32-fold) and protein (up to 22-fold), indicating a greater stimulating efficiency compared with its parent Lp(a). Because bacterial endotoxin is a potent inducer of IL-8 expression in macrophages (32Wilson L. Butcher C.J. Kellie S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Schmidt J. Fleissner S. Heimann-Weitschat I. Lindstaet R. Pomberg B. Werner U. Szelenyi I. Immunopharmacology. 1994; 27: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we determined the endotoxin content of Lp(a) and apo(a) by using the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. The amount of endotoxin in Lp(a) and apo(a) was extremely small (less than 0.3 pg/μg for Lp(a) protein and 0.25 pg/μg for apo(a)), a value that is in the same order of magnitude of that reported for the LDL preparations used by other investigators (34Wang N. Tabas I. Winchester R. Ravalli S. Rabbani L.E. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8837-8842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 35Terkeltaub R. Banka C.L. Solan J. Santoro D. Brand K. Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in this cell system. Neither Lp(a−) (Fig. 2) nor LDL (endotoxin 0.2 pg/μg of LDL protein) had an effect on IL-8 production. Taken together, these results indicate that the increased production of IL-8 by THP-1 macrophages induced by Lp(a) was due to apo(a) and was not endotoxin-related. To define the region on apo(a) responsible for the effect on IL-8 in THP-1 macrophages, we used in our assay the two main proteolytic fragments of apo(a), F1 and F2, along with a full-length apo(a). We first established that apo(a), upon incubation with THP-1 macrophages, remained intact as assessed by Western blot analysis of the immunoreactive apo(a) present in the culture medium (data not shown). F2 also remained intact and was 1.5–2-fold more potent than apo(a) both in terms of IL-8 RNA and protein induction (Fig. 3). In contrast, F1 exhibited only a limited activity. To define the region in F2 responsible for the IL-8 induction, we studied non-overlapping apo(a) fragments of F2 obtained by elastase digestion, namely F5, F6, and F7 (see Fig. 1). Of them, F7, located in the C-terminal portion of F2, stimulated IL-8 production more efficiently than F5 and F6 (Fig. 3). However, none of those fragments was individually as potent as the whole F2. Of note, plasminogen exhibited only a minimal effect regarding IL-8 induction (Fig. 3). The evidence that F2 studied as a fragment is the domain responsible for the action of apo(a) on the production of IL-8 in THP-1 macrophages, prompted us to determine whether this also applies to F2 as a part of apo(a). To this end, we exposed apo(a) to different concentrations of a monoclonal antibody specific for KV, prior to the incubation with the cells. As shown in Fig. 4, this antibody caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the IL-8 mRNA production. In turn, no inhibition was observed when an irrelevant mouse IgG was used (data not shown). For this purpose, we performed experiments using DRB, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. THP-1 macrophages were cultured in either the presence or absence of apo(a) for 20 h and then exposed to DRB for various time intervals. As shown in Fig. 5, following the arrest of transcription, the rate of decay of IL-8 mRNA in both apo(a)-treated and untreated cells was similar indicating that apo(a) had no effect on the degradation and stability of IL-8 mRNA, suggesting an induction of expression at the transcriptional level. These experiments were carried out to determine whether the G-proteins were required for the action of apo(a) on IL-8 production. For this purpose, THP-1 macrophages were incubated with apo(a) in either the presence or absence of either cholera toxin (inhibitor of stimulatory G protein, Gs) or pertussis toxin (inhibitor of inhibitory G protein, Gi). Cholera toxin totally inhibited the apo(a)-mediated accumulation of IL-8 mRNA contrary to the lack of effect by the pertussis toxin (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the stimulatory G protein signal transduction pathway might have been responsible for the apo(a)-mediated effect. In the present study we have shown that in THP-1 macrophages, Lp(a) under low endotoxin conditions is an inducer of IL-8, a major pro-inflammatory chemokine (36Boisvert W.A. Curtiss L.K. Terkeltaub R.A. Immunol. Res. 2000; 21: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have also shown that this effect is at both the mRNA and protein levels and that apo(a) is responsible for the action of Lp(a). This stimulation was macrophage-specific because no effect was elicited when apo(a) was incubated with the unstimulated THP-1 monocytes. In inducing IL-8, apo(a) was markedly more efficient than parent Lp(a) possibly due to the masking of the apo(a)-active site(s) by the LDL moiety. In this vein, we have shown previously that in vitro apo(a) is more efficient than parent Lp(a) in binding to lysine-Sepharose (26Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), fibrinogen (19Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), fibronectin (19Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23856-23865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The importance of apo(a) in the Lp(a) action was also supported by the finding that both Lp(a−) and authentic LDL from the same subject had little or no effect on the production of IL-8 by THP-1 macrophages even at very high lipoprotein concentrations. Of note, our finding regarding authentic LDL is in agreement with the previous observations by Wang et al. (34Wang N. Tabas I. Winchester R. Ravalli S. Rabbani L.E. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8837-8842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) in THP-1 macrophages and Terkeltaub et al. (35Terkeltaub R. Banka C.L. Solan J. Santoro D. Brand K. Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in THP-1 monocytes. In both studies, LDL needed to undergo either oxidative (34Wang N. Tabas I. Winchester R.

Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to stimulate production of IL-8. Of note, in the studies by Terkeltaub et al. (35Terkeltaub R. Banka C.L. Solan J. Santoro D. Brand K. Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the stimulatory effect of oxidized LDL was mediated by oxidized lipid end products. In turn, our studies with unmodified Lp(a) demonstrated that the action on IL-8 was protein- and not lipid-dependent pointing at important functional differences between LDL and Lp(a) when studied in their native state. By using proteolytic derivatives of apo(a), we also provided evidence that F2 was the domain responsible for the IL-8 stimulatory effect and that this effect was 1.5–2-fold higher than that exhibited by intact apo(a). There are two possible explanations for these findings. First, F2, as an isolated fragment, may assume a conformation that is different from that in intact apo(a). Second, isolated F1, although in our system exhibited little activity on IL-8, may exhibit some hindering action on F2 when a component of full-length apo(a) was used. Irrespective of mechanisms, however, it is apparent that apo(a) and some of its fragments can differ in their functional expression and that this difference should be taken into account when studying Lp(a) at the tissue level. In this context, we have reported previously (21Fortunato J.E. Bassiouny H.S. Song R.H. Kocharian H. Glagov S. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. J. Vasc. Surg. 2000; 32: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that F2 is abundant in surgical segments of unstable human carotid plaques and co-localized with MMP-2 and MMP-9 in areas enriched in macrophages. Both MMPs cleave apo(a). Moreover, MMP-9 is the major MMP produced by macrophages and thus a potential contributor to apo(a) fragmentation. In our experimental system we observed no fragmentation of apo(a) upon its incubation with cultured macrophages, suggesting that the secreted MMPs were not adequately activated to cause proteolysis. Based on the finding on F2, we may surmise that if apo(a) fragmentation were to occur either in vitro or in vivo, the pro-inflammatory action of apo(a) will be maintained or even enhanced by some of its fragments. As we reported previously (19Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10019-10023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the two major fragments, F1 and F2, are in vitro products of a limited proteolysis by either elastase or MMPs. However, under conditions of a more extensive digestion, smaller apo(a) fragments are generated (30Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The use of them in our current study permitted us to identify the region in apo(a) comprising KV and the protease domain predominantly responsible for the IL-8 effect. Of interest, this region has been suggested to be involved in the binding of apo(a) to fibronectin. 2O. Klezovitch and A. M. Scanu, unpublished observations. This region is structurally very similar but not identical to its counterpart in plasminogen that we found to have a very limited effect on IL-8 production, indicating that even subtle structural divergence might have been responsible for the difference in action between the two proteins. Of the 13 interleukins examined, IL-8 was the one that was stimulated by apo(a) in our cell system. IL-8 is a known pro-inflammatory chemokine that is expressed in macrophage-rich areas of human coronary atheromas as assessed by both immunohistochemical techniques andin situ hybridization studies (34Wang N. Tabas I. Winchester R. Ravalli S. Rabbani L.E. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8837-8842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The pathogenicity of this chemokine is mostly attributed to its chemotactic activity toward neutrophils (39Baggiolini M. Walz A. Kunkel S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar), T-cells (40Larsen C.G. Anderson A.O. Appella E. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K.

Science. 1992; 268: 447-448Google Scholar), as well as to its mitotic (43Yue T.L. Wang X. Sung C.P. Olson B. Mckenna P.J. Gu J.L. Feuerstein G.Z. Circ.

Science. 1992; 268: 447-448Google Scholar). IL-8 is also a long-lived chemokine resistant to proteolytic degradation compared with the other cytokines produced by macrophages (45Colditz I.G. Zwahlen R.D. Biggiolini M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 48: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, we may speculate that the apo(a)-dependent increased production and secretion of IL-8 by activated macrophages and its subsequent accumulation in the vascular extracellular matrix may contribute to the progression of the chronic inflammation process in atheromas. The mechanism by which apo(a)/fragments stimulate IL-8 production remains to be established. Our current data with DRB, an inhibitor of transcription, suggest that apo(a) stimulated the synthesis of IL-8 mRNA rather than affected its degradation. Moreover, the results of our toxin studies favor an involvement of the G protein signal transduction pathway in the Lp(a)/apo(a) action. These promising leads and the potential pleiotropic effects of Lp(a) justify further mechanistic studies utilizing larger scale microarray systems comprising a variety of genes relevant to the general areas of inflammation and atherosclerosis."

This NS2/3 variant will facilitate the development of an assay suitable for identifying inhibitors of HCV replication. hepatitis C virus 3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propane sulfonate lauryldiethylamine oxide dithiothreitol tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyrano-side tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone aminobutyric acid polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Hepatitis C virus (HCV),1 a member of theFlaviviridae family, is the major etiological agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis and an important cause of chronic liver disease leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in humans (1Choo Q.-L.

The enveloped virion contains an RNA genome of positive polarity of ∼9500 nucleotides encoding a polyprotein of about 3010 amino acids and is comprised of 10 viral proteins: C, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. C is thought to be the nucleocapsid protein binding to the viral RNA genome (3Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E1 and E2 are the virion glycoproteins (4Lin C. Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and p7 is of unknown function. The NS2–5B proteins are thought to be of nonstructural nature and are involved in replication and polyprotein processing (5Houghton M. Weiner A. Han J. Kuo G. Choo Q.-L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The individual proteins are processed from the polyprotein by a combination of host and viral proteases. A host signal peptidase is responsible for the cleavage of p7 from NS2 creating an N terminus at amino acid 810 for NS2 (6Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Tanji Y. Komoda Y. Hirowatari Y. Akagi T. Kato N.

The proteolytic release of mature NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B is mediated by a chymotrypsin-like serine protease within the N terminus of NS3. The NS3 protease requires NS4A as co-factor and a structural zinc for efficient processing (8De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the HCV-encoded enzymes have been evaluated as targets for the development of new antiviral therapies, namely the NS3 protease, helicase, and ATPase activities, as well as the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase activity (9Dymock B.W. Jones P.S. Wilson F.X. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 2000; 11: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Hong Z. Standring D.N. Baroudy B. Lau J.Y.

One viral enzyme that has not been extensively characterized is the NS2/3 protease (Fig. 1). The NS2 protein extends from amino acids 810 to 1026, and autocleavage of the NS2/3 junction at amino acids 1026–1027 is mediated by a protease activity that is encoded by the NS2 region and the minimal NS3 protease domain that flank the cleavage site (amino acids 810–1206) (12Grakoui A.

This autocleavage appears to be essential for productive replicationin vivo as validated with an HCV clone devoid of the NS2/3 protease activity that fails to infect chimpanzees (17Kolykhalov A.A. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The minimal NS2/3 protease domain for the autocleavage activity spans from amino acid 898 at the N-terminal NS2 boundary to amino acid 1207 at the C-terminal NS3 boundary (6Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Tanji Y. Komoda Y. Hirowatari Y. Akagi T. Kato N. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10773-10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12Grakoui A. McCourt D.W.

Remarkably, the NS2/3 protease activity is not dependent on an active NS3 protease (12Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 13Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet the NS3 protease domain cannot be substituted by another nonstructural protein (19Santolini E. Pacini L. Fipaldini C. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7461-7471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have shown that the residues His952 and Cys993 of NS2 are essential for the autocleavage activity (12Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 13Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no homology between NS2/3 protease and other proteases has been identified. Gorbalenya and Snijder (20Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. Perspect. Drug Discovery Design. 1996; 6: 64-86Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have suggested that the NS2/3 protease could be a cysteine protease. However, the observation that the activity is stimulated by metal ions and inhibited by EDTA led to the suggestion that the NS2/3 protease is a metalloprotease (12Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 13Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with classical protease inhibitors in an in vitro translation assay (15Pieroni L. Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have not resulted in a definitive classification. Additionally, NS2/3 autoprocessing is inhibited by mutations that are presumed to perturb the local conformation of the polyprotein precursor and may indicate an extreme sensitivity of the NS2/3 cleavage reaction to the correct folding of the protease (12Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 13Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S.

Virol. 1995; 69: 4127-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that NS2/3 activity can be detected upon co-transfection of constructs harboring defects in either the NS2 or NS3 regions, but not both, in conjunction with constructs expressing intact versions of the defective region. Furthermore, trans-cleavage activity in cells was suggested by the co-expression of an active NS2/3 protease containing a mutated cleavage site with an inactive NS2/3 protease precursor (H952A or C993A) supplying the cleavage substrate (16Reed K., E. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4127-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical characterization of the NS2/3 protease, as well as mechanistic and structural studies have been limited because of the lack of a pure recombinant form of the enzyme. In this study, we describe the mapping of an N-terminal truncation of the NS2/3 (904–1206) protease; its subsequent expression in Escherichia coli, extraction from inclusion bodies, and renaturation have facilitated the biochemical characterization of this critical target for HCV intervention. The detergents CHAPS and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma, LDAO was from Calbiochem,n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was from Anatrace Inc., Nonidet P-40 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, andn-octylpentaoxyethylene was from Bachem. The reducing agents DTT and TCEP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Pierce, respectively. Arginine hydrochloride, glycerol, Hepes, imidazole, magnesium chloride, Chelex-100 resin, and bovine serum albumin were all purchased from Sigma. Guanidine hydrochloride and Tris were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., whereas IPTG and urea were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sodium chloride was purchased from Fisher, Me2SO and zinc chloride were from Aldrich, and EDTA was from Ambion. Restriction enzymes and DNase were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. E. coli XL-1 Blue cells were obtained from Stratagene, and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were from Novagen. The following protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma: captopril, iodoacetamide, leupeptin, N-ethylmaleimide, pepstatin, 1,10-phenanthroline, phosphoramidon, TLCK, and TPCK. Aprotinin and E-64 were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Pefabloc was from PentaPharma AG, and 1,7-phenanthroline was from Aldrich. The NS2/3 sequence was amplified by PCR from a HCV genotype 1b sequence obtained from cloning of the NS2-NS5B-3′non coding region by reverse transcription-PCR into the pCR®3 vector (Invitrogen) using RNA extracted from the serum of an HCV-infected individual. 2D. Lamarre and C. Pellerin, unpublished data. AnNcoI site at the 5′ end and an amino acid sequence conferring streptavidin binding affinity followed by a BamHI site at the 3′ end were introduced by PCR. The PCR product was inserted into the vector pCR®3 using the TA Cloning®(Invitrogen). The insert was then transferred to the bacterial expression vector pET-11d (Novagen) by cutting with EcoRI followed by Klenow treatment to create blunt ends and then by a partial digestion with NcoI. This construct was designated pET-11d-NS2/3. The DNA was transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue cells, isolated, and sequenced. The NS2/3 protease construct was translated in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine as a label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Translated 35S-labeled products were separated by SDS-PAGE (15%) and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). To evaluate protein expression, the DNA was transferred into E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS cells followed by a 2-h induction at 37 °C with 1 mm IPTG. The level of expression was verified by SDS-PAGE (15%) and immunoblot analysis using an anti-NS3 polyclonal antibody. The N-terminal deletion constructs 815–1206, 827–1206, 855–1206, 866–1206, 904–1206, and 915–1206 were derived from the pET-11d-NS2/3 template and obtained by PCR using the appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The DNA was then transformed into E. coli XL-Blue cells, isolated, and sequenced. Protein production and expression of the different constructs were verified as described above. Four lysine residues followed by a hexahistidine tag were added to the N terminus, and four lysine residues were added at the C terminus of the NS2/3 protease. Constructs were obtained using PCR and the pET-11d-NS2/3 template for the wild type and the H952A mutant using the appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The primers also introduced a NdeI and a BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. These inserts were cloned into pET-11d and designated pET-11d-NS2/3 (904–1206) WT or H952A. The DNA was then transformed into E. coli XL-Blue cells, isolated, and sequenced. Full-length and N-terminal truncated variants of the NS2/3 protease were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells following induction with 1 mm IPTG for 2–3 h at 37 °C to assess their level of expression. The highly expressed NS2/3 (904–1206) was selected for further characterization. A typical 4-liter fermentation yielded ∼20 g of wet cell paste. The cell paste may be stored at −80 °C. Following thawing at 23 °C, the cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (5 ml/g) consisting of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT followed by a DNase treatment (20 μg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C and a centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting insoluble pellet was then washed twice by homogenization (5 ml/g) in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2% Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA, 2 m urea, 5 mm DTT and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the insoluble material was washed in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and inclusion bodies were recovered in the pellet by centrifugation at 22,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. To solubilize the inclusion bodies, the pellet was suspended in the extraction buffer (4 ml/g) (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.5 m NaCl) and maintained in that buffer for 1 h at 23 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 125,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The clarified filtrate was stored at −80 °C. To purify the NS2/3 (904–1206), the filtrate was diluted 2-fold in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6 mguanidine HCl, 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Pharmacia Hi-Trap Ni2+-chelating column. The NS2/3 protease was typically eluted with a 50–500 mm imidazole linear gradient with a 250 mm imidazole peak elution. Fractions from the major peak, containing the purified enzyme, were pooled. The purified NS2/3 (904–1206) in 6 m guanidine HCl (typically 1–2 mg proteins/ml) was supplemented with 5 mm TCEP and 5 mm ZnCl2. Following a 15-min incubation at 23 °C, the enzyme was loaded on a Amersham Pharmacia BiotechSuperose 12 gel filtration column (HR 10/30 column; bed volume, 24 ml) pre-equilibrated in refolding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m arginine HCl, 1% LDAO, 5 mm TCEP). The column was run with refolding buffer at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions associated with the major peak were pooled. The inactive NS2/3 (904–1206) was stored at −80 °C in the refolding buffer. The NS3 serine protease activity of the refolded NS2/3 (904–1206) was determined by incubating serial dilutions of the refolded enzyme with 5 μm of the internally quenched fluorogenic substrate anthranilyl-DDIVPAbu[C(O)-O]AMY(3-NO2)TW-OH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm TCEP for 30 or 60 min at 23 °C. The proteolytic activity was monitored by the fluorescence change associated with cleavage of the substrate and the appearance of the fluorescent product anthranilyl-DDIVPAbu-COOH on a BMG Galaxy 96-well plate reader (excitation, 355 nm; emission, 485 nm). The autocleavage reaction was initiated by diluting the NS2/3 (904–1206) in the cleavage buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1–1.0% CHAPS, or 0.1–1.0% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 1 mm TCEP) to a final concentration of 0.5–0.8 μm. The enzyme concentration was determined using the Non-Interfering Protein AssayTM (GenoTechnology, Inc.). The assay mixture was then incubated for up to 24 h at 23 °C. For the time course experiment at 15, 23, or 37 °C, the cleavage reaction was performed with 0.8 μm NS2/3 protease in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30% glycerol (w/v), 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm TCEP for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 24 h. The reaction was stopped by heat denaturation of the enzyme in the presence of SDS. Cleavage at the NS2/3 junction was monitored by SDS-PAGE (15%) and immunoblot analysis using either a NS3 protease polyclonal antibody or a commercially available hexahistidine tag polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Various concentrations of classical protease inhibitors were assayed in the presence of 0.8 μm NS2/3 protease in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm TCEP. The final methanol or ethanol content never exceeded 1% (v/v). The assay mixtures were incubated for 4 h at 23 °C. The reactions were stopped, and quantitation was performed as described above. Inhibition was quantified by densitometry (UN-SCAN-IT software; Silk Scientific Inc., Orem, UT). NS2/3 protease cleavage site-derived peptides and NS4A-derived peptides were synthesized in-house using the standard solid phase methodology (21Bodansky M. Peptide Chemistry. 2nd Edition. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar) or were made by Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA). Various concentrations of peptides were preincubated with 0.54 μm NS2/3 protease for 30 min at 23 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 50% (w/v) glycerol. The autocleavage reaction was initiated by the addition ofn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside to a final concentration of 0.5%. The final Me2SO content never exceeded 5% (v/v). The resulting mixture was then incubated for 3 h at 23 °C. The reaction was stopped and quantified. The hydrophobic nature of native NS2 (alone or linked to NS3) has limited its isolation and characterization. An N-terminal truncation study of NS2/3 was therefore undertaken to reduce hydrophobicity and identify a minimal functional domain. All of the NS2/3 protease N-terminal deletion variants were expressed by in vitro translation (Fig.2 A) and were capable of autocleavage with the exception of the NS2/3 (915–1206). Notably, the NS2/3 (904–1206) was expressed at high levels in E. coli(Fig. 2, B and C), although it partitioned in insoluble inclusion bodies. Expression of the NS2/3 (904–1206) with soluble fusion partners, such as maltose-binding protein and thioredoxin, was unsuccessful at increasing the solubility of the protease (data not shown). The NS2/3 (904–1206) was therefore selected for further studies. Following its expression in E. coli, some autocleavage could be observed (Fig. 3,lane 1). However, the majority of the enzyme remained unprocessed in inclusion bodies. Consequently, the inclusion bodies were extracted, solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl (Fig. 3,lane 2), and purified on a Ni2+-chelating column (Fig. 3, lane 3), resulting in a >90% pure NS2/3 (904–1206). The enzyme was refolded by buffer exchange on a gel filtration column with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5m arginine HCl, 1% LDAO, and 5 mm TCEP. A typical chromatogram is shown in Fig. 4 A (solid line). Addition of 0.5 m arginine HCl was required to maintain NS2/3 (904–1206) solubility. Use of the zwitterionic detergent LDAO was also required for refolding. Finally, the presence of a reducing agent, either DTT or TCEP, was necessary during the refolding process to avoid aggregate formation. Greater than 95% purity, as judged by SDS-PAGE, was obtained (Fig.4 B, lane 3), and typically, 7 mg of refolded enzyme were purified per liter of E. coli cell culture. Immunoblot analyses showed that the NS2/3 (904–1206) did not autoprocess upon refolding (Fig. 4 B,lanes 6 and 9). The lack of autocleavage suggested that the cleavage assay conditions were either not optimal or that the enzyme was not refolded properly. To address the latter, the efficacy of refolding was assessed by monitoring the NS3 serine protease activity. As shown on Fig. 4 A (dotted line), the NS3 serine protease activity co-eluted with the major NS2/3 protein peak. Our finding that NS2/3 (904–1206) possessed NS3 protease activity suggested proper refolding but suboptimal reaction conditions permissive for autocleavage activity.Figure 4Purification of the NS2/3 (904–1206). A, chromatogram obtained from the refolding and purification of the NS2/3 (904–1206) on a Superose 12 gel filtration column. Following the addition of 5 mm TCEP and 5 mmZnCl2 to the purified inclusion bodies, the enzyme was refolded and eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5m arginine HCl, 1% LDAO, 5 mm TCEP. Thesolid line represents the absorbance at 280 nm, whereas thedotted line indicates the NS3 protease activity monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, purification was monitored by 15% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue or by immunoblot analysis using an anti-NS3 rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-Histag rabbit antibody.

Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6373-6380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of this observation, several detergents were evaluated for their ability to promote autocleavage (Fig.5 A). The detergents Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and CHAPS promoted autocleavage to a similar extent at concentrations varying from 0.125 to 1%. However, poor processing was observed in the presence of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5% n-octylpentaoxyethylene and LDAO, and no processing was observed in the presence of 1% detergent. In the absence of detergent, autocleavage was not observed even in the presence of up to 50% (w/v) glycerol (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–6). Glycerol was found to enhance the ability of 0.1% CHAPS to promote autocleavage (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7–12). However, the effect of glycerol reached a plateau at concentrations higher than 30%, and under these conditions, ∼50% autocleavage was observed (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10–12). The effect of temperature and incubation time on the NS2/3 (904–1206) activity was also examined. Autocleavage was observed at 15 and 23 °C (Fig.6, lanes 1–14), although more NS3 protease product was detected at earlier time points from the 23 °C reaction (compare lanes 2–4 to 9–11). At both temperatures, the processing reaction appears to reach a plateau following a 3–5-h incubation. Little to no product was detected from reactions performed at 37 °C (lanes 15–21). All of our subsequent experiments were therefore conducted at 23 °C. In an attempt to verify that the protease activity was NS2/3-dependent, the activity of the wild type enzyme was compared with the corresponding H952A mutant (Fig. 7). The absence of cleavage products from the H952A mutant, when assayed under conditions that paralleled the wild type, confirmed that the activity was indeed NS2/3 protease-dependent (Fig. 7, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 6 and 7). As a control for the NS2/3 wild type, no significant cleavage was detected upon removal of 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside from the assay buffer following a 24-h incubation (Fig. 7, comparelanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, no change in the activity was observed in the presence of potent substrate-based NS3 protease inhibitors, confirming that the NS2/3 protease activity was independent of the NS3 serine protease activity (data not shown). Finally, N-terminal sequencing of the NS3 product confirmed that the cleavage occurred between the residues Leu1026 and Ala1027 (data not shown). As a further characterization of our purified NS2/3 (904–1206), we studied its stimulation by zinc and inhibition by EDTA as previously reported for the in vitro translated enzyme (12Grakoui A.

These studies are easily biased by trace amounts of zinc present in solutions, such that addition of 1 μm zinc chloride to the cleavage buffer only resulted in a slight increase in activity (Fig. 8, compare lanes 1 and2), and addition of 100 μm EDTA partially inhibited the enzyme (Fig. 8, compare lanes 1 and3). However, upon stringent preparation and zinc depletion of both the refolding and the cleavage buffers (with Chelex-100 resin), autocleavage was observed only upon the addition of zinc to the reaction mixture, and EDTA addition prevented zinc activation completely (Fig. 8, lanes 4–6), emphasizing the importance of zinc for NS2/3 protease activity. The effect of classical protease inhibitors on NS2/3 (904–1206) autocleavage was evaluated and is listed in TableI. Of the inhibitors tested, the serine/cysteine protease inhibitors TLCK and TPCK, known to react with active site histidine residues, as well as the thiol-reactive agents iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide, were effective inhibitors of autocleavage. The metal chelators EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline were also effective inhibitors. 1,10-phenanthroline acts via its chelating properties because 1,7-phenanthroline did not inhibit autocleavage. This inhibition profile was similar to the profile of the in vitro translated NS2/3 (810–1615) (15Pieroni L. Santolini E. Fipaldini C. Pacini L. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J.

The hydrolysis of GTP on ARF1 depends on the action of members of a family of ARF1-directed GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Previous studies in well defined systems indicated that the activity of a mammalian Golgi membrane-localized ARF GAP (GAP1) might be subjected to regulation by membrane lipids as well as by the coatomer complex. Coatomer was found to strongly stimulate GAP-dependent GTP hydrolysis on a membrane-independent mutant of ARF1, whereas we reported that GTP hydrolysis on wild type, myristoylated ARF1 loaded with GTP in the presence of phospholipid vesicles was coatomer-independent. To investigate the regulation of ARF1 GAPs under more physiological conditions, we studied GTP hydrolysis on Golgi membrane-associated ARF1. The activities at the Golgi of recombinant GAP1 as well as coatomer-depleted fractions from rat brain cytosol resembled those observed in the presence of liposomes; however, unlike in liposomes, GAP activities on Golgi membranes were approximately doubled upon addition of coatomer. By contrast, endogenous GAP activity in Golgi membrane preparations was unaffected by coatomer. Cytosolic GAP activity was partially reduced following immunodepletion of GAP1, indicating that GAP1 plays a significant although not exclusive role in the regulation of GTP hydrolysis at the Golgi. Unlike the activities of the mammalian proteins, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Glo3 ARF GAP displayed activity at the Golgi that was highly dependent on coatomer. We conclude that ARF GAPs in themselves can efficiently stimulate GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 at the Golgi, and that coatomer may play an auxiliary role in this reaction, which would lead to an increased cycling rate of ARF1 in COPI-coated regions of the Golgi membrane.

The cycles of GTP binding and hydrolysis on ARF proteins is controlled by two sets of cytosolic proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange proteins, which facilitate GTP binding, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) which are obligatory for GTP hydrolysis on ARFs (reviewed in Refs. 17Chavrier P.

ARF GAPs are a family of proteins sharing a catalytic domain of 120–140 amino acids that includes a Cys4 zinc coordination motif. The first ARF GAP to be discovered, now termed GAP1, is a 45-kDa protein that distributes between cytosol and the Golgi complex and functions in the regulation of membrane traffic through this organelle (19Makler V.

Whereas some of these proteins are likely to regulate plasma membrane-associated processes, others may function at the Golgi (36Liu X. Zhang C. Xing G. Chen Q. He F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Okawa K. Tsubouchi A. Nakamura K. Yagi R. Yano H. Kondo A. Iwamatsu A. Mizoguchi A. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 645-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), adding further complexity to the regulation of traffic through this organelle. Because an ARF1 GAP activity is a prerequisite for the uncoating of COPI vesicles, a regulation of this activity may be necessary to ensure a proper timing of vesicle uncoating, as well as cargo segregation (2Wieland F. Harter C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,3Springer S. Spang A. Schekman R. Cell. 1999; 97: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Two types of factors have been reported to influence the activity of ARF GAPs in well defined systems, lipids and the coat protein. ARF1 depends on a lipid environment for nucleotide exchange (40Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 41Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M.

Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, GAP1 activity depends on its association with the phospholipid vesicle, which in turn is increased by diacylglycerols (21Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Studies pioneered by Goldberg utilizing a truncated, lipid-independent ARF1 mutant (Δ17-ARF) as substrate showed that the activity of GAP1 is strongly stimulated by coatomer (43Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 44Goldberg J. Cell. 2000; 100: 671-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar findings were subsequently described for yeast Gcs1, whereas the activity of the phosphoinositide-dependent ARF GAP ASAP1 was coatomer-insensitive (45Szafer E. Pick E. Rotman M. Zuck S. Huber I. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We reported, however, that coatomer does not influence the activity of GAP1 and Gcs1 when myristoylated ARF1 is used as substrate in the presence of liposomes (45Szafer E. Pick E. Rotman M. Zuck S. Huber I. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings were interpreted to suggest that, in the biological membrane, proximity between ARF1 and its GAP, which results from their mutual binding to membrane phospholipids, might be sufficient for the stimulation of ARF1 GTPase activity. Even though studies in well defined systems such as liposomes provided important clues to mechanisms that regulate GTP hydrolysis on ARF1, results of such studies may not fully represent regulatory mechanism operating at the Golgi. To investigate this issue, we designed an assay that measures the activity of exogenous GAPs on Golgi membrane-bound ARF1. Our findings demonstrate that multiple ARF GAPs act at the Golgi membrane, and that their activities may be fine-tuned by the coatomer complex. [γ-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Brain phosphatidylserine was from Avanti Polar Lipids; egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and brefeldin A (BFA) were from Sigma. Coatomer was purified from rabbit liver according to Pavel et al. (46Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

Full-length GAP1 with a hexahistidine extension was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector and purified as described (49Huber I. Rotman M. Pick E. Makler V. Rothem L. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This protein was used to raise antibodies in rabbits by repeated injections of 0.1 mg of GAP1 protein in Freund’s adjuvant. The antibodies (marked GAP1–807) were found to be directed against determinants at the carboxyl-terminal part, as these antibodies did not recognize a truncated GAP1 containing the first 257 amino acids. These antibodies were used in immunodepletion experiments, whereas for Western blot analysis we used rabbit anti-GAP1–257 antibodies (20Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D.

Chem. 1979; 254: 11655-11663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to use, the membranes were washed with 0.75m KCl, 0.2 m sucrose, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 to remove peripheral membrane proteins, and were resuspended in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.2 m sucrose. To load ARF1 with [γ-32P]GTP at the Golgi membrane, salt-washed membranes (0.15–0.20 mg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C with 2 μm bovine myristoylated ARF1 in a GTP-loading mixture consisting of 4 μm[γ-32P]GTP (∼200,000 cpm), 0.1 m KCl, 0.2m sucrose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP plus ATP-regenerating system (5 mmphosphocreatine and 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase), and 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, in a final volume of 50 μl. After 15–30 min, nucleotide exchange was stopped by the addition of 0.3 mmbrefeldin A (from a 30 mm methanolic stock solution), followed by the rapid addition of ARF GAPs with or without coatomer (0.2 μm). When cytosolic fractions were employed as the source of GAP, unlabeled GTP (0.3 mm) was added along with BFA. At different times aliquots were removed for the determination of membrane-associated [γ-32P]GTP by the nitrocellulose filtration assay (52Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least four times, and a typical experiment is presented. ARF1 (4 μm) was first loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (1 μm) in the presence of 0.4-μm phospholipid vesicles containing 40% phosphatidylcholine, 30% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 30% phosphatidylserine, and GAP activity was assayed at 30 °C as described in Ref. 45Szafer E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, except that the reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 mmKCl. The hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP on ARF1 was determined by the charcoal absorption assay (49Huber I. Rotman M. Pick E. Makler V. Rothem L. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rat brain cytosol was prepared as described by Malhotra et al. (50Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Shepherd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and was concentrated to 15–20 mg/ml by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Cytosol (0.5 ml) was loaded onto a 24-ml Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and combined into pools, which were concentrated ∼10 times. In previous studies (16Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3135-3138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Finazzi D. Cassel D. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13325-13330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 at the Golgi membrane was investigated by relying on endogenous ARF GAPs that are present in the membrane preparation. However, we found that, under the conditions employed in these studies, liver Golgi membranes contain significant amounts of coatomer, which would complicate an analysis of coatomer effects on GAP activity. Additionally, because ARF GAPs are not integral membrane proteins, endogenous GAPs found in purified Golgi membrane preparations may not represent the full repertoire of GAPs that act at the Golgi. In this study we measured the effect of exogenous GAPs from both crude and recombinant sources on GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 bound to rat liver Golgi membranes. Endogenous coatomer and most endogenous GAPs were removed from the membranes by salt wash, and the membranes were incubated in the presence of myristoylated ARF1 and [γ-32P]GTP. During this incubation, the nucleotide binds to the membrane in an ARF1-dependent and BFA-sensitive manner (Fig.1), indicating that ARF1 has become loaded with [γ-32P]GTP through the action of a Golgi-bound guanine nucleotide exchange protein. Comparison of loading with [γ-32P]GTP and with [α-32P]GTP indicated that during the loading period up to 50% of ARF1-bound GTP is hydrolyzed; however, because the assay measures bound GTP and not release of Pi, the hydrolysis of GTP during the loading of ARF at the Golgi membrane does not increase the background of the assay. When nucleotide exchange was subsequently stopped by the addition of BFA, the amount of membrane-bound nucleotide decreased slowly, apparently reflecting residual endogenous GAP activity (Fig.1); the rate of this reaction varied somewhat among different membrane preparations. Upon addition of purified recombinant GAP1 protein, the decrease in membrane-bound radioactivity was strongly accelerated, thus providing a sensitive assay for the activity of exogenous GAP proteins at the Golgi membrane. To study the role of coatomer, we first investigated its effect on GTP hydrolysis at the Golgi stimulated by recombinant mammalian GAP1. As shown in Fig. 2, addition of GAP1 (28 or 65 nm) effectively stimulated GTP hydrolysis on Golgi membrane-bound ARF1. The addition of a relatively high concentration of purified coatomer (200 nm) caused an additional increase in GTP hydrolysis; even though this effect was of low magnitude (1.5–2.5-fold stimulation), it was consistently observed. This effect of coatomer differed from the complete lack thereof in assays containing liposomes (45Szafer E. Pick E. Rotman M. Zuck S. Huber I. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but was much smaller than the effect observed with the lipid-independent ARF1 mutant (43Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The slow decline in ARF1-bound [γ-32P]GTP in the absence of exogenous GAP, which apparently reflects endogenous GAP activity, was unaffected by the addition of coatomer. GTP hydrolysis in systems that did not receive coatomer was not the result of an effect of endogenous coatomer, as this was effectively removed by the salt wash of membranes (Fig. 2, inset). In addition to GAP1, multicellular organisms contain multiple ARF GAPs that share a highly related catalytic domain but show little similarity in their noncatalytic parts. Some of these GAPs may also contribute to GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 at the Golgi membrane. Because all ARF GAPs are soluble proteins, it was of interest to examine the activity and regulation of GAPs present in the cytosol. For these experiments, we employed rat brain cytosol, which was found to possess high levels of ARF GAP activity. To test the effect of coatomer on cytosolic GAPs, we fractionated cytosol on a Superdex 200 column and prepared pools of coatomer-depleted fractions. As shown in Fig.3 A, the majority of GAP activity separated from coatomer, peaking in fraction III that represents proteins of molecular size centering at ∼200 kDa. The distribution of GAP activity among different fractions paralleled the distribution of GAP1, which showed a smeared migration that was shifted to sizes higher than the expected one (Fig. 3 A); this behavior of GAP1 was observed previously (19Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and is likely to represent aggregation rather than oligomerization (23Huber I. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Aoe T. Hsu V.W. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24786-24791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The addition of purified coatomer to the cytosolic pools (Fig. 3 B) resulted in an approximately 2-fold stimulation of GAP activity in the coatomer-free fractions (fractions II–IV), and, as expected, had no effect on the fraction containing coatomer (fraction I) and on unfractionated cytosol. The similar magnitude of the effect of coatomer on cytosolic GAPs and on GAP1 raised the possibility that GAP1 might be the major active species in the cytosolic fractions. To assess the contribution of GAP1 to GAP activity in cytosol, we immunodepleted GAP1 from cytosol by employing a polyclonal antiserum raised against the full-length GAP1 protein. This antiserum was found to efficiently remove GAP1 from cytosol (Fig. 4 A). Depletion of GAP1 from a coatomer-free pool of cytosolic fractions resulted in a partial decrease in GAP activity on Golgi-bound ARF1 (Fig.4 B). This decrease was of similar extent both in the absence and in the presence of coatomer, and thus the depletion of GAP1 from cytosol had little effect on coatomer stimulation of GTP hydrolysis. Once again, endogenous GAP activity in the membrane preparation, which was somewhat higher in the experiment shown in Fig. 4 B than that reported in Fig. 2, was unaffected by coatomer. When GAP activity was assayed on ARF1 bound to liposomes instead of Golgi membranes, GAP1 depletion from the cytosolic pool caused a somewhat more pronounced decrease in GAP activity (Fig. 4 C). This suggests that the liposomes we employ (40% phosphatidylcholine, 30% phosphatidylserine, 30% phosphatidylethanolamine) provide a favorable environment for GAP1 activity, but may not be optimal for other cytosolic GAPs. As reported previously for GAP1 (45Szafer E. Pick E. Rotman M. Zuck S. Huber I. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), GAP activity of the cytosolic fraction (either GAP1-depleted or mock-depleted) in the liposome assay was completely unaffected by coatomer. Depletion of GAP1 from unfractionated cytosol (which contains coatomer) affected GAP activities in a manner that resembled that shown in Fig. 4,i.e. a 1.5-fold decrease in GAP activity on Golgi membranes and a 2–3-fold decrease in activity in the liposome assay (data not shown). Several mammalian ARF GAPs were reported to depend on phosphoinositides for activity (28Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

It was of interest to examine whether GAPs in cytosol show phosphoinositide-dependent activity on Golgi membrane-bound ARF1. As shown in Fig. 5 A, addition of PIP2 to full cytosol caused a slight stimulation of GAP activity on Golgi membranes, but had little effect on endogenous GAP activity of the membranes. The phosphoinositide had virtually no effect on GAP activity in the liposome assay (Fig.5 B). Under the same conditions, PIP2 strongly stimulated the activity of the phosphoinositide-dependent ARF GAP ASAP1 both in Golgi membranes and in liposomes (data not shown), indicating that the conditions we employed were proper for the detection of the phosphoinositide effect. These findings suggest that, under the conditions employed, GAP activity for ARF1 in brain cytosol"

These observations have raised interest in defining the nature of L-selectin/L-selectin ligand interactions among human HCs.Human HCs express two distinct L-selectin ligands as follows: P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a molecule that functions as a ligand for all three selectins; and a specialized glycoform of CD44 known as hematopoietic cell E- and L-selectin ligand (HCELL) (7Dimitroff C.J.

The L-selectin-binding determinant on PSGL-1 is localized within 17 amino acids of the mature N-terminal region and consists of critical tyrosine sulfation(s) combined with a sialyl Lewis X-bearing O-glycan (12Ramachandran V. Nollert M.U. Qiu H. Liu W.J. Cummings R.D. Zhu C. McEver R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13771-13776Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Snapp K.R. Ding H. Atkins K.

In contrast to PSGL-1, the L-selectin binding determinants of HCELL are resistant to OSGE and mocarhagin digestion, are sulfation-independent, and are presented on sialylated, fucosylated N-glycans (7Dimitroff C.J.

Moreover, contrary to the broad expression of PSGL-1, HCELL expression is a characteristic of only the earliest (CD34+) subsets of human HCs, of blasts in de novo human leukemias, and of the primitive human hematopoietic cell line KG1a (7Dimitroff C.J.

Blood. 2000; 96: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Despite our knowledge of the biochemistry and cellular distribution of PSGL-1 and HCELL, there is no information on the relative L-selectin binding capabilities of these molecules. One of the unique aspects of the biochemistry/biophysics of the L-selectin receptor/ligand adhesive interactions is the requirement for a critical level of shear stress. Thus, typical static adherence assays cannot be employed to measure and study L-selectin/L-selectin ligand interactions. In this study, we utilized shear-based adherence assay systems to analyze the capacity of L-selectin to engage human HCELL and PSGL-1, as expressed on established hematopoietic cell lines and on a population of blasts isolated from a patient with myeloid leukemia, under a wide range of shear stress conditions. Results obtained from experiments examining the L-selectin ligand activities of PSGL-1 and HCELL, either natively expressed on human HC cell membranes or isolated from human HC membrane preparations, indicate that HCELL exhibits a higher capacity to support L-selectin binding compared with PSGL-1. Moreover, these data show that L-selectin ligands impart shear resistance on human HCs and that L-selectin-dependent adhesive interactions mediated by HCELL and by PSGL-1 on human HCs provide intrinsically distinct shear stress binding properties.DISCUSSIONOne of the unique aspects of selectin receptor/ligand adhesive interactions is the dependence on shear stress for adhesion (23Lawrence M.B. Kansas G.S. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This shear dependence is most critical for L-selectin receptor/ligand interactions, which require a threshold shear stress for engagement (24Finger E.B. Puri K.D. Alon R. Lawrence M.B. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Therefore, shear-dependent assays must be employed to analyze the relative avidities of L-selectin ligands. In this report, we utilized two shear-based adherence assay systems to study the relative L-selectin ligand binding capacities and biophysical features of HCELL and of PSGL-1. We analyzed the L-selectin ligand activity of HCELL and PSGL-1 natively expressed on human HCs, and we examined the individual ligand activities of immunoaffinity-isolated HCELL and PSGL-1 from these cells. Our results from all experimental approaches consistently reveal that HCELL possesses greater L-selectin ligand activity than PSGL-1.We first performed analysis of L-selectin binding and the relative shear resistance of HCELL and of PSGL-1 on whole cells to examine the relative functional capacity of these molecules as expressed in their native state on the cell surface. In parallel with previous findings (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Oxley S.M. Sackstein R. Blood. 1994; 84: 3299-3306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sackstein R. Fu L. Allen K.L.

Blood. 2000; 96: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), L-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling on KG1a cells persisted after enzymatic digestions that inactivate L-selectin ligand activity of PSGL-1; KG1a cells treated with either OSGE or mocarhagin maintained a high level of leukocyte rolling similar to that of untreated cells, separating the contribution of PSGL-1 from HCELL (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,19Sackstein R. Dimitroff C.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCELL exhibited a greater capacity to support L-selectin-mediated cell-cell adhesive interactions compared with that of PSGL-1, as evidenced by 5-fold greater leukocyte rolling on KG1a cells than on HL60 cells over a greater shear stress range (2-fold higher on KG1a cells than on HL60 cells). The high shear resistance feature was also characteristic of HCELL expressed on the de novo AML (M1) leukemic blasts.Because the binding capabilities of cellular HCELL may have been attributable to its density as it is presented in its native state on the cell surface, we performed conventional Stamper-Woodruff assays of lymphocyte binding to immunoaffinity purified CD44 and PSGL-1 normalized for molar equivalents. These experiments show that CD44 is a more avid L-selectin ligand than PSGL-1 (>5-fold higher). Both AML (M1) CD44 and KG1a CD44 possessed a greater shear resistance than PSGL-1 as evidenced by the ability to sustain L-selectin-mediated lymphocyte adherence at a high shear stress range (≥100 rpm). Inhibition of lymphocyte binding to N-glycosidase F-treated CD44 and OSGE-treated PSGL-1 verified the critical contribution ofN- and O-glycosylations on HCELL and PSGL-1, respectively. There was no evidence of lymphocyte adherence to neuraminidase-treated CD44 or PSGL-1, indicating that terminal sialic acid on the N- and O-glycan binding determinant(s) is a critical component of L-selectin binding determinants on HCELL and PSGL-1, respectively. These data indicate that the sialylated N-glycosylations on HCELL (six potentialN-glycosylation sites on this standard hematopoietic isoform) comprise a higher binding capacity for L-selectin than the sialylated O-glycosylation site(s) on PSGL-1 (one potentialO-glycosylation site in the L-selectin binding determinant of the reduced isoform (9McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The fact that KG1a CD44 is strikingly more HECA-452-reactive than KG1a PSGL-1 further supports this contention.Previous studies from our laboratory show that HL60 cells express HECA-452-reactive PSGL-1 (monomer isoforms at 140 kDa), but not CD44 (7Dimitroff C.J.

Because KG1a cells express both CD44 and PSGL-1 decorated with HECA-452 epitope(s) and HL60 cells possess only HECA-452-reactive PSGL-1, we examined whether inherent differences in α2,3-sialyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase gene expression, which are involved in the synthesis of HECA-452 epitopes and critical L-selectin binding determinants (7Dimitroff C.J.

Interestingly, KG1a cells express higher levels of α2,3-sialyltransferase, ST3Gal IV, compared with HL60 cells, whereas both cell lines express similar levels of α1,3-fucosyltransferases, FucTIV and FucTVII. In addition, gene expression of ST3Gal IV in RPMI 8402 and K562 cells, which possess neither L-selectin ligand activity nor HECA-452-reactive CD44 and PSGL-1 (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), is minimal, whereas FucTIV and FucTVII are expressed at a lower level than HL60 and KG1a cells. These findings indicate that although α1,3-fucosyltransferases are important for HECA-452 epitope synthesis and L-selectin ligand activity, ST3Gal IV expression may be one of the critical regulator(s) for generating high avidity L-selectin binding determinants on CD44 (HCELL). Given the broad expression of CD44 on hematopoietic cells, the restricted expression of HCELL on the CD34+ subset of normal BM mononuclear cells and on certain acute leukemias, but not on erythrocytes, platelets, or on more mature leukocytes (7Dimitroff C.J.

Indeed, shear stress probably contributes to the creation of appropriate microenvironmental niches for hematopoiesis, and numerous studies have shown that ex vivo expansion of BM mononuclear cells in the presence of cytokines is enhanced under continuous perfusion conditions (32Koller M.R.

These findings, together with the results of our studies, offer new insights into the preferential engagement of HCELL with L-selectin in the biology of hematopoiesis. L-selectin, also known as the “peripheral lymph node homing receptor,” belongs to the selectin family of Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules that includes E-selectin, a cytokine-inducible membrane protein found on activated endothelium, and P-selectin, which is found on activated platelets and endothelial cells. L-selectin is constitutively expressed on most mature leukocytes where it is best known for initiating lymphocyte “rolling” interactions on high endothelial venules in peripheral lymph nodes and, in combination with E-and P-selectin, leukocyte rolling on the post-capillary venules at sites of inflammation (1Tedder T.F.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). L-selectin is also characteristically expressed on human CD34+ hematopoietic cells (HC),1 and its expression on these cells correlates with higher clonogenic activity in in vitro assays and faster hematologic recovery following bone marrow transplantation (3Leon W.M.

These observations have raised interest in defining the nature of L-selectin/L-selectin ligand interactions among human HCs. Human HCs express two distinct L-selectin ligands as follows: P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a molecule that functions as a ligand for all three selectins; and a specialized glycoform of CD44 known as hematopoietic cell E- and L-selectin ligand (HCELL) (7Dimitroff C.J.

Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on several hematopoietic cell lines, as well as on primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C.

The L-selectin-binding determinant on PSGL-1 is localized within 17 amino acids of the mature N-terminal region and consists of critical tyrosine sulfation(s) combined with a sialyl Lewis X-bearing O-glycan (12Ramachandran V. Nollert M.U. Qiu H. Liu W.J. Cummings R.D. Zhu C. McEver R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13771-13776Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Snapp K.R. Ding H. Atkins K.

In contrast to PSGL-1, the L-selectin binding determinants of HCELL are resistant to OSGE and mocarhagin digestion, are sulfation-independent, and are presented on sialylated, fucosylated N-glycans (7Dimitroff C.J.

Moreover, contrary to the broad expression of PSGL-1, HCELL expression is a characteristic of only the earliest (CD34+) subsets of human HCs, of blasts in de novo human leukemias, and of the primitive human hematopoietic cell line KG1a (7Dimitroff C.J.

Despite our knowledge of the biochemistry and cellular distribution of PSGL-1 and HCELL, there is no information on the relative L-selectin binding capabilities of these molecules. One of the unique aspects of the biochemistry/biophysics of the L-selectin receptor/ligand adhesive interactions is the requirement for a critical level of shear stress. Thus, typical static adherence assays cannot be employed to measure and study L-selectin/L-selectin ligand interactions. In this study, we utilized shear-based adherence assay systems to analyze the capacity of L-selectin to engage human HCELL and PSGL-1, as expressed on established hematopoietic cell lines and on a population of blasts isolated from a patient with myeloid leukemia, under a wide range of shear stress conditions. Results obtained from experiments examining the L-selectin ligand activities of PSGL-1 and HCELL, either natively expressed on human HC cell membranes or isolated from human HC membrane preparations, indicate that HCELL exhibits a higher capacity to support L-selectin binding compared with PSGL-1. Moreover, these data show that L-selectin ligands impart shear resistance on human HCs and that L-selectin-dependent adhesive interactions mediated by HCELL and by PSGL-1 on human HCs provide intrinsically distinct shear stress binding properties. DISCUSSIONOne of the unique aspects of selectin receptor/ligand adhesive interactions is the dependence on shear stress for adhesion (23Lawrence M.B. Kansas G.S. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This shear dependence is most critical for L-selectin receptor/ligand interactions, which require a threshold shear stress for engagement (24Finger E.B. Puri K.D. Alon R. Lawrence M.B. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Therefore, shear-dependent assays must be employed to analyze the relative avidities of L-selectin ligands. In this report, we utilized two shear-based adherence assay systems to study the relative L-selectin ligand binding capacities and biophysical features of HCELL and of PSGL-1. We analyzed the L-selectin ligand activity of HCELL and PSGL-1 natively expressed on human HCs, and we examined the individual ligand activities of immunoaffinity-isolated HCELL and PSGL-1 from these cells. Our results from all experimental approaches consistently reveal that HCELL possesses greater L-selectin ligand activity than PSGL-1.We first performed analysis of L-selectin binding and the relative shear resistance of HCELL and of PSGL-1 on whole cells to examine the relative functional capacity of these molecules as expressed in their native state on the cell surface. In parallel with previous findings (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Oxley S.M. Sackstein R. Blood. 1994; 84: 3299-3306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sackstein R. Fu L. Allen K.L.

Blood. 2000; 96: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), L-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling on KG1a cells persisted after enzymatic digestions that inactivate L-selectin ligand activity of PSGL-1; KG1a cells treated with either OSGE or mocarhagin maintained a high level of leukocyte rolling similar to that of untreated cells, separating the contribution of PSGL-1 from HCELL (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,19Sackstein R. Dimitroff C.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCELL exhibited a greater capacity to support L-selectin-mediated cell-cell adhesive interactions compared with that of PSGL-1, as evidenced by 5-fold greater leukocyte rolling on KG1a cells than on HL60 cells over a greater shear stress range (2-fold higher on KG1a cells than on HL60 cells). The high shear resistance feature was also characteristic of HCELL expressed on the de novo AML (M1) leukemic blasts.Because the binding capabilities of cellular HCELL may have been attributable to its density as it is presented in its native state on the cell surface, we performed conventional Stamper-Woodruff assays of lymphocyte binding to immunoaffinity purified CD44 and PSGL-1 normalized for molar equivalents. These experiments show that CD44 is a more avid L-selectin ligand than PSGL-1 (>5-fold higher). Both AML (M1) CD44 and KG1a CD44 possessed a greater shear resistance than PSGL-1 as evidenced by the ability to sustain L-selectin-mediated lymphocyte adherence at a high shear stress range (≥100 rpm). Inhibition of lymphocyte binding to N-glycosidase F-treated CD44 and OSGE-treated PSGL-1 verified the critical contribution ofN- and O-glycosylations on HCELL and PSGL-1, respectively. There was no evidence of lymphocyte adherence to neuraminidase-treated CD44 or PSGL-1, indicating that terminal sialic acid on the N- and O-glycan binding determinant(s) is a critical component of L-selectin binding determinants on HCELL and PSGL-1, respectively. These data indicate that the sialylated N-glycosylations on HCELL (six potentialN-glycosylation sites on this standard hematopoietic isoform) comprise a higher binding capacity for L-selectin than the sialylated O-glycosylation site(s) on PSGL-1 (one potentialO-glycosylation site in the L-selectin binding determinant of the reduced isoform (9McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The fact that KG1a CD44 is strikingly more HECA-452-reactive than KG1a PSGL-1 further supports this contention.Previous studies from our laboratory show that HL60 cells express HECA-452-reactive PSGL-1 (monomer isoforms at 140 kDa), but not CD44 (7Dimitroff C.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because KG1a cells express both CD44 and PSGL-1 decorated with HECA-452 epitope(s) and HL60 cells possess only HECA-452-reactive PSGL-1, we examined whether inherent differences in α2,3-sialyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase gene expression, which are involved in the synthesis of HECA-452 epitopes and critical L-selectin binding determinants (7Dimitroff C.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1033-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), might regulate the differential HECA-452 decoration of CD44 and PSGL-1. Interestingly, KG1a cells express higher levels of α2,3-sialyltransferase, ST3Gal IV, compared with HL60 cells, whereas both cell lines express similar levels of α1,3-fucosyltransferases, FucTIV and FucTVII. In addition, gene expression of ST3Gal IV in RPMI 8402 and K562 cells, which possess neither L-selectin ligand activity nor HECA-452-reactive CD44 and PSGL-1 (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), is minimal, whereas FucTIV and FucTVII are expressed at a lower level than HL60 and KG1a cells. These findings indicate that although α1,3-fucosyltransferases are important for HECA-452 epitope synthesis and L-selectin ligand activity, ST3Gal IV expression may be one of the critical regulator(s) for generating high avidity L-selectin binding determinants on CD44 (HCELL). Given the broad expression of CD44 on hematopoietic cells, the restricted expression of HCELL on the CD34+ subset of normal BM mononuclear cells and on certain acute leukemias, but not on erythrocytes, platelets, or on more mature leukocytes (7Dimitroff C.J.

Because the binding capabilities of cellular HCELL may have been attributable to its density as it is presented in its native state on the cell surface, we performed conventional Stamper-Woodruff assays of lymphocyte binding to immunoaffinity purified CD44 and PSGL-1 normalized for molar equivalents. These experiments show that CD44 is a more avid L-selectin ligand than PSGL-1 (>5-fold higher). Both AML (M1) CD44 and KG1a CD44 possessed a greater shear resistance than PSGL-1 as evidenced by the ability to sustain L-selectin-mediated lymphocyte adherence at a high shear stress range (≥100 rpm). Inhibition of lymphocyte binding to N-glycosidase F-treated CD44 and OSGE-treated PSGL-1 verified the critical contribution ofN- and O-glycosylations on HCELL and PSGL-1, respectively. There was no evidence of lymphocyte adherence to neuraminidase-treated CD44 or PSGL-1, indicating that terminal sialic acid on the N- and O-glycan binding determinant(s) is a critical component of L-selectin binding determinants on HCELL and PSGL-1, respectively. These data indicate that the sialylated N-glycosylations on HCELL (six potentialN-glycosylation sites on this standard hematopoietic isoform) comprise a higher binding capacity for L-selectin than the sialylated O-glycosylation site(s) on PSGL-1 (one potentialO-glycosylation site in the L-selectin binding determinant of the reduced isoform (9McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The fact that KG1a CD44 is strikingly more HECA-452-reactive than KG1a PSGL-1 further supports this contention. Previous studies from our laboratory show that HL60 cells express HECA-452-reactive PSGL-1 (monomer isoforms at 140 kDa), but not CD44 (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc.

Because KG1a cells express both CD44 and PSGL-1 decorated with HECA-452 epitope(s) and HL60 cells possess only HECA-452-reactive PSGL-1, we examined whether inherent differences in α2,3-sialyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase gene expression, which are involved in the synthesis of HECA-452 epitopes and critical L-selectin binding determinants (7Dimitroff C.J.

Interestingly, KG1a cells express higher levels of α2,3-sialyltransferase, ST3Gal IV, compared with HL60 cells, whereas both cell lines express similar levels of α1,3-fucosyltransferases, FucTIV and FucTVII. In addition, gene expression of ST3Gal IV in RPMI 8402 and K562 cells, which possess neither L-selectin ligand activity nor HECA-452-reactive CD44 and PSGL-1 (7Dimitroff C.J. Lee J.Y. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sackstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), is minimal, whereas FucTIV and FucTVII are expressed at a lower level than HL60 and KG1a cells. These findings indicate that although α1,3-fucosyltransferases are important for HECA-452 epitope synthesis and L-selectin ligand activity, ST3Gal IV expression may be one of the critical regulator(s) for generating high avidity L-selectin binding determinants on CD44 (HCELL). Given the broad expression of CD44 on hematopoietic cells, the restricted expression of HCELL on the CD34+ subset of normal BM mononuclear cells and on certain acute leukemias, but not on erythrocytes, platelets, or on more mature leukocytes (7Dimitroff C.J.

Blood. 2000; 96: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that regulated expression of glycosyltransferases (such as ST3Gal IV) directs the expression of this L-selectin ligand at different stages of hematopoietic cell differentiation. Although L-selectin/L-selectin ligand adhesive interactions under shear are typically observed in the vasculature, these interactions would also occur in the bone marrow where fluid flow conditions exist. Indeed, shear stress probably contributes to the creation of appropriate microenvironmental niches for hematopoiesis, and numerous studies have shown that ex vivo expansion of BM mononuclear cells in the presence of cytokines is enhanced under continuous perfusion conditions (32Koller M.R.

In these bioreactors, the constant perfusion or flow of culture medium generates a hydrodynamic shear stress that augments the expansion of self-renewing stem cells and of progenitor cells. The data presented here demonstrate that HCELL expressed on human HCs is capable of supporting L-selectin binding over a broad shear stress range, and compared with HCELL, PSGL-1 appears to play a modest role in human HC adherence to L-selectin (37Greenberg A.W. Kerr W.G. Hammer D.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, L-selectin and CD44 expression on human hematopoietic stem cells, independently, have been correlated with enhanced clonogenic activity (3Leon W.M. Terstappen M. Huang S. Bui N. Picker L.J.

In addition, they are generated by the initial step of base excision repair (BER). When located within a topoisomerase II DNA cleavage site, “intact” abasic sites act as topoisomerase II poisons and dramatically stimulate enzyme-mediated DNA scission. However, most abasic sites in cells are not intact. They exist as processed BER intermediates that contain DNA strand breaks proximal to the damaged residue. When strand breaks are located within a topoisomerase II DNA cleavage site, they create suicide substrates that are not religated readily by the enzyme and can generate permanent double-stranded DNA breaks. Consequently, the effects of processed abasic sites on DNA cleavage by human topoisomerase IIα were examined. Unlike substrates with intact abasic sites, model BER intermediates containing 5′- or 3′-nicked abasic sites or deoxyribosephosphate flaps were suicide substrates. Furthermore, abasic sites flanked by 5′- or 3′-nicks were potent topoisomerase II poisons, enhancing DNA scission ∼10-fold compared with corresponding nicked oligonucleotides that lacked abasic sites. These findings suggest that topoisomerase II is able to convert processed BER intermediates to permanent double-stranded DNA breaks.

To create the DNA gate that allows this essential strand passage reaction to occur, the enzyme generates a transient double-stranded break in the second DNA segment (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

To maintain the integrity of the genome during the strand passage event, topoisomerase II forms covalent bonds with the 5′-termini of the DNA gate (3Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev.

This covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complex is referred to as the cleavage complex (10Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9538-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances, cleavage complexes are fleeting intermediates in the catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II and are tolerated by the cell (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar,8Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, conditions that increase the physiological concentration of cleavage complexes often lead to the formation of permanent double-stranded DNA breaks in the genome. When these breaks accumulate beyond threshold levels, they induce recombination events that lead to chromosomal translocations and in some cases trigger cell death pathways (8Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 11Baguley B.C. Ferguson L.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, although the ability to cleave and religate the genetic material is critical for the physiological functions of topoisomerase II, the generation of double-stranded DNA breaks by the enzyme has potentially deleterious consequences. As a result of its intrinsically lethal nature, topoisomerase II has been utilized as a target for a number of highly successful anticancer agents (8Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Holden J.A. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2001; 1: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Fortune J.M.

Because they convert an essential enzyme to a potent cellular toxin that generates breaks in the genome, these drugs are referred to as topoisomerase II poisons (19Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 424-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This nomenclature is used to distinguish cleavage-enhancing agents from topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitors, which kill cells by robbing them of the critical catalytic functions of the enzyme (14Holden J.A. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2001; 1: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

It has been hypothesized that anticancer drugs are able to exploit the DNA cleavage activity of topoisomerase II because they mimic the actions of endogenous topoisomerase II poisons (14Holden J.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For example, when located within the 4-base stagger that separates the two phosphodiester bonds cleaved by the enzyme, abasic sites often stimulate topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage 10–20-fold (22Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Some DNA adducts, such as 1,N 6-ethenoadenine, enhance scission to a similar extent. In contrast, other adducts such as 8-oxoguanine and N 6-methyladenine are weak topoisomerase II poisons and have comparatively small effects on enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage (26Sabourin M. Osheroff N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is notable that most of these DNA adducts are repaired in the cell by base excision repair (BER)1 (27Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 28McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev.

The first step of all BER pathways is the removal of the damaged base by a DNA glycosylase, which converts the lesion to an abasic site (27Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 28McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 31Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington D. C.1995: 135-169Google Scholar). Thus, if a DNA adduct (even one with relatively little effect on topoisomerase II DNA cleavage) is located within the 4-base cleavage stagger, it has the potential to be converted to a strong topoisomerase II poison by the initiation of BER. After the creation of abasic sites by the action of the glycosylase, a series of BER intermediates are generated that contain DNA nicks or flaps proximal to the site of the original lesion (32Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 33Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 34Memisoglu A. Samson L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Because these intermediates contain strand breaks, they may create substrates that are more lethal for topoisomerase II than the intact abasic site. Indeed, when DNA strand breaks are located between the scissile bonds of a topoisomerase II cleavage site, they often lead to the production of cleaved molecules that dissociate from the active site of the enzyme (35Andersen A.H. Svejstrup J.Q. Westergaard O. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29: 83-101Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because these suicide substrates yield products that cannot be religated readily by topoisomerase II, cleaved molecules accumulate over time. Therefore, BER has the potential to create DNA substrates that can be converted directly to permanent double-stranded DNA breaks by topoisomerase II. If so, processed BER intermediates could be more dangerous to cells than the original damage. To explore the effects of processed abasic sites on topoisomerase II activity, the ability of human topoisomerase IIα to cleave a series of oligonucleotide substrates that model processed short-patch (i.e. simple) BER intermediates was examined. Results indicate that when the original lesion was located within the 4-base stagger of a topoisomerase II DNA cleavage site, BER intermediates that contained nicks or DNA flaps acted as suicide substrates for topoisomerase IIα. Furthermore, 5′- and 3′-nicked intermediates generated by BER were potent topoisomerase II poisons. These findings support a model in which processed DNA lesions may adversely affect cells through their interactions with topoisomerase II. Human topoisomerase IIα was expressed and purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (36Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 39Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar) and its complementary oligonucleotide also were synthesized. The sequences of the top and bottom strands were 5′-GCCTGGGTGACAAAGC↓AAAACACTGTCTCCAAAAAAAATT-3′ and 5′-AATTTTTTTTGGAGACAGTG↓TTTTGCTTTGTCACCCAGGC-3′, respectively. Points of topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage in both sequences are denoted by down arrows. Single-stranded oligonucleotides containing an abasic site analogue or a deoxyuridine residue were prepared in a similar manner utilizing corresponding phosphoramidites. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [32P]phosphate on their 5′-termini with T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified by electrophoresis in a 7 m urea, 14% polyacrylamide gel, visualized by UV shadowing, and isolated using the Qiagen extraction protocol. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by incubating equimolar amounts of each at 70 °C for 10 min and cooling to 25 °C (36Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Substrates that contained 5′-nicks or dRP-flaps were prepared synthetically by annealing three DNA segments, a complete 5′-end-labeled 40-mer oligonucleotide (bottom strand) and two oligonucleotides that together comprised the complementary top strand (with a nick or flap located at the desired position). The 5′-nicked oligonucleotides were annealed as described above using a 1:1.25 ratio of full-length 40-mer to short oligonucleotides. The dRP-flap intermediates were annealed sequentially. The full-length bottom 40-mer and the short top oligonucleotide that did not contain the flap were annealed by incubating at 70 °C for 10 min and cooling below 55 °C. The third oligonucleotide, which contained the DNA flap, was added, and the annealing mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 10 min and cooled to 25 °C. The 3′-nicked substrate was prepared enzymatically. The top strand of the 40-mer oligonucleotide described above was synthesized with a uracil at the +2 position of the incorporated topoisomerase II cleavage site. This oligonucleotide was annealed to its complementary bottom strand as described under “Preparation of Oligonucleotides.” The uracil was removed by treating 100 nm double-stranded oligonucleotide with 0.2 units of uracil-DNA glycosylase in a reaction volume of 15 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. The resulting abasic oligonucleotide was treated with 1.5 ng/μl T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase for 30 min at 37 °C in 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in a 20 μl reaction volume (40McCullough A.K.

DNA cleavage was monitored as described previously (36Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 100 nm oligonucleotide in 19 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol (the final volume of reactions that contained substrates with 3′-nicks was 25 μl). Cleavage was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of human topoisomerase IIα (180–225 nm final concentration). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for up to 20 min, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by 1.5 μl of 250 mm EDTA. Trapped topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes were digested with 2 μl of a 0.8 mg/ml proteinase K stock, and DNA cleavage products were precipitated with ethanol and resolved by electrophoresis in 7 m urea, 14% polyacrylamide gels. Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. Levels of DNA cleavage were calculated relative to that obtained with the wild-type substrate. DNA lesions that cause relatively small perturbations in the structure of the genetic material such as base loss, oxidation, or alkylation generally are repaired by BER (30Norbury C.J. Hickson I.D.

Two primary pathways are used: short-patch (i.e. simple) BER (Fig.1), in which only the damaged residue is excised and replaced, or long-patch BER, in which 2–13 residues are excised (32Wilson S.H.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Because short-patch BER is the primary pathway in mammalian cells (accounting for ∼80% of BER) (31Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington D. C.1995: 135-169Google Scholar, 32Wilson S.H. Mutat.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and the initial intermediates are the same in both pathways, the present study focused on the potential of short-patch BER intermediates to act as topoisomerase II poisons. As depicted in Fig. 1, short-patch BER is a bifurcated pathway. The fork that is chosen is determined by the specific DNA glycosylase that converts the damaged base to an abasic site (step 1) (27Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar,28McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33Krokan H.E.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 2135-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In vivo, the left fork appears to be the predominant pathway (30Norbury C.J. Hickson I.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). If the glycosylase is a “monofunctional glycosylase” with no associated DNA lyase activity, the left fork is utilized. In this case, glycosylase action is followed by cleavage of the damaged DNA strand 5′ to the abasic site by an AP endonuclease (step 2). The resulting 5′-nick is extended one nucleotide by DNA polymerase β, displacing the abasic site and leaving a dRP-flap (step 3). Finally, the flap is removed by the dRP lyase activity of DNA polymerase β (step 4), and the nick is sealed by DNA ligase I or the ligase III/XRCC1 complex (step 5) (33Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 49Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). If the glycosylase is a “bifunctional glycosylase” and has an associated AP lyase activity, the right fork predominates. In this case, base removal is followed by the generation of a nick 3′ to the abasic site by the associated AP lyase activity of the glycosylase (step 2′). The lyase is followed by an AP endonuclease, which cleaves the DNA strand 5′ to the abasic site (step 3′). The resulting gap is filled by DNA polymerase β (step 4′), and the nick is sealed by DNA ligase (step 5) (32Wilson S.H. Mutat.

Because of the differential reaction rates of the participating enzymes, a number of processed BER intermediates (denoted byshaded boxes in Fig. 1) accumulate in the cell. Among these are intermediates containing abasic sites, 5′-nicked abasic sites, dRP-flaps, and 3′-nicked abasic sites (49Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E.

Previous studies demonstrated that topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission is enhanced when an abasic site is included within the 4-base stagger of a cleavage site. Conversely, when an abasic site is located immediately outside the points of cleavage, scission often is depressed (22Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The initial model BER intermediate examined in the present study contained an abasic (apurinic) lesion at the +2 position of a well characterized topoisomerase II cleavage site (which is derived from pBR322 and shown in Fig.2). 2The positions of residues surrounding a topoisomerase II DNA cleavage site are denoted as follows. Residues are numbered 5′ → 3′, with the enzyme cleaving the bond that bridges the −1 and +1 residues. The scissile bonds on the two strands of the double helix are staggered by four bases. Residues numbered +1 to +4 are located between the scissile bonds.This lesion was chosen as a control for two reasons. First, consistent with earlier work that examined this sequence (22Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the +2 apurinic site was a strong topoisomerase II poison. Inclusion of this lesion increased levels of cleavage nearly 9-fold (from 0.2 to 1.7%) compared with wild-type and stimulated enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage to a greater extent than abasic sites located at any other position (Fig. 2,right panel). Second, by situating the original lesion at the +2 position, the nicks and flaps in model BER substrates were located between the scissile bonds. A time course for the cleavage of a +2 apurinic substrate by human topoisomerase IIα is shown in Fig. 2 (left panel). As observed previously (60Wilstermann A.M. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17727-17731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), scission of both the abasic and wild-type substrates reached a stable equilibrium within 5 min. Formation of this equilibrium confirms that the enzyme does not release cleaved substrates. Rather, it remains covalently attached to the oligonucleotide throughout the scission event and is able to religate the cleaved DNA molecule. It has been estimated that some human tissues contain as many as 200,000 abasic sites per cell even in the absence of environmental insults (50Atamna H. Cheung I. Ames B.N. Proc."
https://openalex.org/W1993057385,"Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RabGGTase) catalyzes the prenylation of Rab proteins. Despite possessing a single active site, RabGGTase is able to add geranylgeranyl moieties onto each of the two C-terminal cysteine residues of Rab. We have studied the kinetics of Rab double prenylation employing a combination of a novel high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based in vitroprenylation assay and fluorescence spectroscopy. Transfer of the first geranylgeranyl group proceeds with a k1 = 0.16 s−1, while the conversion from singly to double prenylated Rab is 4-fold slower (k2 = 0.039 s−1). We found that following the first transfer reaction, the conjugated lipid is removed from the active site of RabGGTase but mono-prenylated Rab·REP complex remains bound to RabGGTase with aKd < 1 nm. In contrast to the doubly prenylated Rab7·REP dissociation of the mono-prenylated species from RabGGTase was only weakly stimulated by phosphoisoprenoid. Based on the obtained rate constants we calculated that at least 72% of mono-prenylated Rab molecules proceed to double prenylation without dissociating from RabGGTase. The obtained data provides an explanation of how RabGGTase discriminates between mono-prenylated intermediate and double prenylated reaction product. It also indicates that the phosphoisoprenoid acts both as a substrate and as a sensor governing the kinetics of protein·protein interactions in the double prenylation reaction.

Rab escort protein high pressure liquid chromatography Rab proteins are small GTPases implicated in the regulation of vesicular traffic (1Stenmark H. Olkkonen V.M. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 5Crossref Google Scholar). To be functional, they have to undergo a posttranslational modification in which one or, in most cases, two isoprenoid geranylgeranyl groups are attached to their C termini (2Peter M. Chavrier P. Nigg E.A. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 857-865PubMed Google Scholar). Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RabGGTase or GGTase type II) catalyzes this reaction. RabGGTase belongs to a family of prenyltransferases that includes farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase type I. These enzymes are highly conserved in sequence and structure and possess a single active site (3Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Out of this group, only RabGGTase is capable of transferring multiple isoprenoid units onto one substrate molecule. This is remarkable considering that a large number of enzymes such as peptide and polyketide synthases have evolved multiple active sites to carry out multiple rounds of catalysis on a given substrate molecule (4Cane D.E. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R319-R325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The Rab protein can only interact with RabGGTase when complexed to another protein termed Rab Escort Protein (REP)1 (3Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 5Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). REP plays a dual role in assisting catalysis and in chaperoning prenylated Rab to its target membrane. REP, Rab, RabGGTase, and GGpp form a very tight quaternary complex before prenylation (6Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Owen D. Scheidig A.S. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After transfer of two geranylgeranyl moieties onto C-terminal cysteines of the Rab protein, the ternary complex remains associated until the binding of a new GGpp molecule stimulates the release of the RabGG⋅REP complex (7Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Owen D. Scheidig A.S. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Separation of prenylated Rab and REP is thought to be assisted by a putative membrane Rab receptor (8Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the case of RabGGTase, two principle strategies for double prenylation using a single active site can be envisaged. In one case, the mono-prenylated intermediate dissociates from the enzyme, thus clearing the active site and then reassociates positioning the unprenylated cysteine for the second round of catalysis. In this case, the mono-prenylated reaction intermediate could theoretically interact with the putative membrane receptor in the same fashion as naturally mono-cysteine Rab proteins. However the presence of under-prenylated Rab proteins on the membrane has not been reported so far (9Farnsworth C.C. Kawata M. Yoshida Y. Takai Y. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6196-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). According to the second model, an internal rearrangement clears the active site without dissociation of the ternary complex. In this case the reaction would proceed until all available cysteine residues are prenylated. We set out to investigate which of the two principal mechanistic routes is taken by RabGGTase. We demonstrate that the mono-prenylated intermediate does not need to dissociate from the RabGGTase. In addition, GGpp seems to play a major role in preventing the premature dissociation of the mono-prenylated intermediate. Expression of rat RabGGTase and REP-1 in SF21 cells and subsequent purification was performed as described (6Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur.

Thoma N.H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The GDP bound forms of Rab7 wild type and Rab7C207S mutant were prepared as described (6Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In vitroprenylation and purification of the doubly prenylated Rab7·REP-1 complex was performed as described (12Kalinin A.

All reactions were performed in glass tubes using the following reaction buffer: 40 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithioerythritol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40 detergent. For kinetic measurements 4 μm Rab7-REP-1 complex and 4 μm RabGGTase were preincubated separately for 10 min at 25 °C in the presence of 20 μm GGpp. The reaction was initiated by manual mixing. After defined time periods, 50 μl of the reaction mixture were withdrawn, quenched by addition of 100 μl 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, and 20% glycerol mix and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For analysis, 75 μl of quenched reaction mix were subjected to reverse-phase chromatography. Samples were analyzed using a C4, 150 × 4.6 mm, 15 μm LUNA column (Phenomenx) driven by a Waters 600 s HPLC system. The column was equilibrated with 95% buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and 5% buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After injection and a 2-min wash step, proteins were eluted with a gradient from 5–70% of buffer B in 15 min. Fluorescence intensity was recorded using a Waters 474 Plus fluorescence detector. A Waters 2487 diode-array absorbance detector was used simultaneously to monitor absorbance at 210 nm and 280 nm. The primary HPLC data analysis was performed by integrating peak areas using the Waters Millennium software package. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight measurements were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Voyager TM station with the instrument set in positive ion mode. Samples were desalted by gel filtration on Centriflex cartridges (EdgeBioSystems) equilibrated with distilled water according to the instructions of manufacture. For measurements, the protein sample was diluted in a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in a 70% acetonitrile/0.3% trifluoroacetic acid mixture. First, the elution positions of REP-1, Rab7, dansRab7, and RabGGTase were established by individual injections. Next, the position of doubly prenylated Rab7 was established by injection of purified Rab7GG·REP complex. To correct for differences in the injection volume and possible losses during the prenylation reaction and sample handling, peaks for un-, mono- and doubly prenylated Rab7 were normalized using internal standards. Prenylation reaction mixture was injected onto the column, and the changes in concentration of Rab7 and doubly prenylated Rab7 were determined as the ratio of their respective peak area of that of REP-1. A different strategy was used to extract the time course for the mono-prenylated Rab7, which co-migrated with one of the RabGGTase subunits. The ratio of the peak containing the mono-prenyl species (14.5 min) to the sum of the two RabGGTase containing peaks at 14.5 min and 17.9 min was used as a measure for the production and decay of mono-prenylated Rab7. Due to the nature of the averaging, the transients for Rab7, REP-1, and RabGGTase are on arbitrary scales. Rate constants were extracted simultaneously from time traces of Rab7, mono-prenylated Rab7 (Rab7G), and double-prenylated Rab7 (Rab7GG) using a global-fitting approach based on numerical integration according to a set of differential equations.

The input script for the program Scientist is available as supplementary material. Fluorescence measurements were performed with an Aminco SLM 8100 spectrophotometer (Aminco, Silver Spring, MD). All reactions were followed at 25 °C in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 μm GDP and 2 mmdithioerythritol in 1 ml of volume. Simple titrations were fitted to the solution of a quadratic equation implemented in GraFit4 (Erithacus Software). Competitive titrations were fitted in Scientist (MicroMath Scientific Software) to the explicit binding model. The difference between data and model was minimized using least squares algorithms as described (7Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Owen D. Scheidig A.S. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying double prenylation of Rab proteins has so far remained unclear, largely due to lack of quantitative kinetic data. We set out to develop methodology that would allow quantitative and time-resolved analysis of the reaction. To develop a quantitative assay suitable for kinetic measurements, we took advantage of the different mobilities of un-, mono- and doubly prenylated Rab7 on a C4-reversed phase column. Initially, we used dansyl-labeled Rab7 (dansRab7) that was synthesized viain vitro protein ligation and was shown to have very similar properties to the wild type protein (11Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Merzlyak E. Hillebrand A.M. Thoma N.H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We chosedansRab7 because of its detection ease even in the case of co-elution with other proteins. For monitoring fluorescence, the dansyl moiety was excited via fluorescence energy transfer from tryptophan at 290 nm, measuring emission at 490 nm. The elution profile of dansRab7 (14.3 min), REP-1 (15.1 min), and the two subunits of RabGGTase (14.5 and 17.4 min) is shown in Fig. 1. When this mixture was supplemented with GGpp, two new peaks at 15.1 and 17.9 min were observed (Fig. 1). Using the Rab7·REP-1 mono-prenylated complex as standard, we identified the peak eluting at 15.1 min as the mono-prenylated dansRab7 (data not shown). Thus, in a complex mixture, the mono-prenylated Rab7 co-eluted with a RabGGTase subunit. If the prenylation assay was allowed to proceed to completion, the fluorescent peak at 15.1 min disappeared, presumably through conversion into the emerging species eluting at 17.9 min (Fig. 2). Using enzymatically doubly prenylated dansRab7·REP-1 complex and prenylated wild type Rab7·REP-1 complex, we were able to confirm that the peak at 17.9 min corresponds to doubly prenylated dansRab7 (data not shown) (12Kalinin A. Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Heinemann I. Rostkova E. Constantinescu A.T. Alexandrov K. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore dansRab7, mono-, and doubly prenylateddansRab7 elute in the order of their hydrophobicity and their elution positions are very similar to those of wild type Rab7.Figure 2HPLC analysis of in vitroprenylation reaction quenched at the defined time points. As indicated by the arrows, the peak for unprenylated Rab7 (14.3 min) decreases, while the peak for mono-prenylated Rab7 at 14.5 min transiently increases and then decays. The mono-prenylated Rab7 peaks co-eluted with one subunit of RabGGTase. Data for the accumulation of this species was extracted using the absorbance ratio of both subunits.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, even if dissociation of mono-prenylated Rab7 is a mandatory step in the mechanism, re-association should be fast enough not to be rate-limiting. The HPLC chromatograms obtained as a function of time are shown in Fig. 2. The substrate Rab7 (14.3 min) decays with a transient increase of the mono-prenylated Rab7 intermediate (15.1 min) and the emergence of a the double prenylated species at 17.9 min. The data at each individual time point were subsequently processed by averaging against different internal standards as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” In particular, the emergence and decay of the mono-prenylated Rab7 intermediate was followed on the basis of the peak ratios of RabGGTase subunits. This procedure greatly increased the quality of the data and facilitated extraction of kinetic parameters (Fig. 3, A–C). Kinetic analysis was performed using a global-fitting approach where both rate-constants were simultaneously fitted to the transients shown in Fig. 3, A–C. The procedure resulted in an excellent fit resulting in k1 = 0.16 s−1 for the first prenyl-transfer step, andk2 = 0.039 s−1 for the conversion of mono-prenylated Rab7 into double prenylated Rab7. The data presented so far here do not allow us to determine which of the two C-terminal cysteines are prenylated in the first step. Previous studies conducted using Rab1a as a substrate demonstrated that there was no strict preference for either of the cysteines but the N-terminal cysteine was somewhat preferred (15Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We decided to re-examine this issue particularly since, unlike Rab1a where reactive cysteines are positioned next to each other, the C terminus of Rab7 has the sequence SCSC. Using the above described prenylation protocol we determined the prenylation rates for the single cysteine mutants Rab7C205S and Rab7C207S (Fig. 4, A andB). When only the N-terminal cysteine was available, (i.e. the C-terminal cysteine had been mutated to a serine), the observed prenylation rate was ∼0.02 s−1. On the other hand if the N-terminal cysteine was mutated, the single prenylation rate constant was determined to be ∼0.06 s−1. Based on this data it appears that the C-terminal cysteine is somewhat preferred over the N-terminal for the first prenylation event. The implications of this finding are elaborated on under “Discussion.” Conversion of the mono-prenylated Rab protein into the doubly prenylated form by RabGGTase requires the binding of an additional molecule of GGpp to the enzyme. We wanted to test whether association of phosphoisoprenoid with RabGGTase was affected by the protein reaction intermediate bound to the enzyme. We tested the affinity of the mono-prenylated Rab7⋅REP-1⋅RabGGTase2 complex for phosphoisoprenoids. We used a Rab7C205mutant that had the N-terminal of the two prenylatable cysteines mutated to a serine (Rab7-SC). This mutant was prenylated in vitro and purified either as a complex with REP-1 or, alternatively, as a ternary complex with REP-1 and RabGGTase. 2A. Rak and K. Alexandrov, submitted for publication. We titrated the purified mono-prenylated Rab7⋅REP-1⋅RabGGTase complex with increasing concentrations of the fluorescent phosphoisioprenoid mFpp, which had previously been shown to exhibit properties very similar to GGpp (7Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Owen D. Scheidig A.S. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Owen D.J. Alexandrov K. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Waldmann H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 509-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting titration isotherm was saturable, and analysis of the stoichiometry indicated that one molecule of mFpp bound per molecule of the mono-prenylated ternary complex (Fig. 5). Fitting the data to a quadratic equation resulted in an affinity of 15 nm, which is similar to what has previously been observed for mFpp binding to double prenylated Rab7⋅REP-1⋅RabGGTase (7Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Owen D. Scheidig A.S. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The fluorescent yield observed for mFpp binding to RabGGTase or RabGGTase in complex with double prenylated Rab7-REP-1 was also very similar, suggesting that mFpp binds to the same site in both complexes (data not shown). The tight binding for mFpp is therefore a clear indication that the active site in the mono-prenylated ternary complex is accessible and not blocked by the mono-prenylated protein. Next we wanted to determine how the affinity of the mono-prenylated reaction intermediate for RabGGTase correlates with the affinities of substrate and product. This information could help to choose between the two models of double prenylation. We used two equilibrium competitive titration strategies to obtain these data. In the first set of experiments, the previously characterized complex between dansRab7⋅REP-1 was used as a fluorescent reporter (11Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Merzlyak E. Hillebrand A.M. Thoma N.H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the first experiment, 300 nm RabGGTase and 1000 nmdansRab7 complexed to REP-1 were premixed and subsequently displaced by addition of purified Rab7G⋅REP-1 (Fig. 6A). Fitting the data to an implicit cubic equation system resulted in aKd of 0.8 nm for binding of the mono-prenylated Rab7-REP-1 complex to RabGGTase. To verify this data in an independent experiment we employed a second titration strategy for more accurate Kd determination. In this, experiment both dansRab7-REP-1 and singly prenylated Rab7GG⋅REP-1 were premixed and titrated with increasing concentrations of RabGGTase. Fig. 6B shows the titration isotherm of 0.5 μm mono-prenylated Rab7-REP-1 in the presence of 2 μm dansRab7⋅REP-1 titrated with increasing concentration of RabGGTase. The resulting curve was sigmoidal, which allowed extraction of the dissociation constant with high precision. Data analysis using a competitive binding model resulted in an excellent fit, with a Kd of 1.25 nm. These results clearly indicate that the mono-prenylated Rab7⋅REP-1 complex is bound very tightly to the RabGGTase. The data obtained up to this point does not allow us to distinguish between a mechanism in which the mono-prenylated intermediate dissociates before the second prenylation step and one were it does not. For instance, the mono-prenylated Rab7-REP-1 intermediate could be bound tightly, but dissociate faster than k2 (0.039 s−1), followed by rapid reassociation and prenylation. To clarify this, the dissociation rate constant of the mono-prenylated Rab7-REP-1 complex from RabGGTase⋅ needs to be determined. To this aim, 70 nm of Rab7G·REP-1⋅RabGGTase complex in the presence of 2 μm GGpp were displaced by addition of 400 nm doubly prenylated dansRab7⋅REP-1, and changes in the dansyl fluorescence were monitored (Fig.7A) (13Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The transients were fitted using a single exponential function resulting in an observed rate constant of 0.0155 s−1. Increasing the concentration of the displacing agent had no effect on the observed rate constant (not shown). The observed rate therefore represents the genuine dissociation rate-constant of mono-prenylated Rab7⋅REP-1 complex from RabGGTase. When an identical experiment was performed in the absence of GGpp the dissociation rate constant of the mono-prenylated Rab7⋅REP-1 complex was determined as 0.0098 s−1(Fig. 7B). The dissociation rate constants for the mono-prenylated Rab7⋅REP-1 intermediate are significantly slower than for the second prenylation step. As a consequence, the fraction of mono-prenylated molecules that proceeds directly toward double prenylation can be estimated based on kinetic partitioning as seen in Equation 4.k2k2+koffmonoprenylated Rab=0.72Equation 4 This implies that 72% of the mono-prenylated Rab7 molecules become prenylated before they can dissociate. However, this fraction should be viewed as a lower limit. Based on our experiments, we cannot exclude the existence of a further slow step between the first prenyl transfer and the dissociation of the mono-prenylated intermediate. Such a step would further slow down the effective dissociation rate of the mono-prenylated intermediate, thereby increasing the fraction of molecules that proceeds to double prenylation without dissociation. The molecular mechanisms underlying double prenylation of Rab proteins has long remained a puzzle in the field of prenyltransferases. It was unclear, in particular, whether the mono-prenylated Rab intermediate needs to dissociate from the ternary complex in order to enter a second round of catalysis. Using a novel quantitative in vitro prenylation assay we were able to quantitate unprenylated, mono-, and double prenylated Rab7 species in a time-resolved fashion. This assay has a clear advantage over the traditional in vitro prenylation assays that monitor the protein-incorporated3H-geranylgeranyl and do not allow simultaneous quantitation of unprenylated and prenylated Rab species (15Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Desnoyers L. Seabra M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12266-12270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the basis of radioactive assays, Seabra and co-workers previously determined the steady-state parameters for prenylation of a variety of Rab proteins by RabGGTase in the presence of excess of GGpp askcat ≈ 0.032 s−1 (18Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Westover K.D. Deisenhofer J. Seabra M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12559-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The assay developed here allows time-resolved analysis of individual prenylation steps. We found that the rate for the first prenyl transfer reaction is 0.16 s−1, while the second prenyl transfer is 4-fold slower (0.039 s−1). Based on our prenylation data it appears that the second prenylation event is substantially rate-determining under saturating concentrations of GGpp, REP-1, Rab7, and RabGGTase. We further analyzed the sequence in which C-terminal cysteines are prenylated and came to the conclusion that although the C-terminal cysteine is slightly preferred over the N-terminal one, there appears to be no strict order of first isoprenoid addition. This finding can be reconciled with earlier observations on the difference in the C-terminal sequence between Rab1a and Rab7. It is conceivable that the spacing between the cysteines and the immediate environment influences which cysteine will be prenylated first. The fact that the prenylation rates of single cysteine mutants are slower than the rates for the first and in the case of Rab7C207S mutant even the second prenylation step of wild type protein probably indicates that the interaction of the active site of RabGGTase with the two cysteine motif is more complex then initially assumed. It is unlikely, however, that the use of singly prenylated serine mutants will decrease the observed dissociation rate constants for mono-prenylated Rab proteins. Our initial experiments using a semi-synthetic Rab7 bearing one prenylated and one free cysteine indicate that the dissociation rates of monoprenylated “wild type” protein and monoprenylated Rab7 mutant are very similar. 3T. Durek and K. Alexandrov, unpublished data. We further demonstrated that the mono-prenylated Rab7·REP-1 complex is bound very tightly to RabGGTase with Kd ∼1 nm. This affinity is very close to that observed for double prenylated Rab7⋅REP-1 binding to RabGGTase (Kd = 2 nm) (13Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mono-prenylated ternary complex displayed high affinity for the GGpp analog mFpp (Kd = 15 nm). Tight binding of the phosphoisoprenoid is only possible when the active site of transferase is freed of the Rab-conjugated lipid. Thus it appears that the equilibrium position of the mono-prenylated Rab·REP-1 complex bound to transferase favors an unoccupied active site ready to bind the second molecule of GGpp. This in turn implies that the active site is cleared immediately after the first transfer has occurred. It is conceivable that the 5-fold slower rate observed for the second prenylation compared with the first is at least partly due to the time required to clear the active site. To understand whether mono-prenylated Rab·REP complex has to separate from RabGGTase in the course of the prenylation reaction, we determined the dissociation rate constant of the reaction intermediate. We found that the dissociation rate constant was ∼0.01 s−1 and did not increase significantly in the presence of GGpp. This is in contrast to the double prenylated complex, where addition of the new round of lipid substrate increases the dissociation of the product by ∼10-fold (13Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taking dissociation and prenylation rate constants together, we calculated that the minimal fraction of mono-prenylated Rab7 molecules that proceed to double prenylation with out dissociation is 72%. This number should, however, be viewed as a lower limit. Possible slow isomerization steps positioned after the first transfer, but before dissociation of the intermediate could further increase the fraction of molecules that proceed to double prenylation without dissociation. In comparison to the single cysteine mutant the second reactive cysteine positioned for catalysis in the binding site is very likely to establish additional interactions with RabGGTase and GGpp, thus slowing the dissociation rate. In the case of farnesyl transferase formation of Zn2+-coordinated ionized thiolate leads to a 70-fold affinity increase of FTase affinity for its protein substrate (19Hightower K.E. Huang C.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15555-15562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The same mechanism could be operational in RabGGTase owing to the presence of Zn2+ in the active site and its role in the prenylation reaction (20Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Witter D.J. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10454-10463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Zhang H. Seabra C.M. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 2000; 8: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, formation of metal-coordinated protein·lipid substrate complexes with RabGGTase is very probable and is likely to further slow the dissociation rates of the mono-prenylated reaction intermediate essentially ensuring 100% double prenylation without dissociation. The finding that the majority of Rab molecules do not dissociate during double prenylation poses another question: how does the enzyme prevent dissociation of the mono-prenylated Rabs while retaining the ability to release the fully prenylated product at a reasonable rate? Examination of the kinetic pathways delineated in this work provides an answer (Scheme 1). Once the quaternary complex of RabGGTase, REP-1, and Rab7 has assembled, the first prenylation step proceeds relatively rapidly (0.16 s−1). After the first prenylation step a new molecule of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate must bind to the transferase. On the basis of the rate constants determined for GGpp binding to RabGGTase we conclude that this binding event is fast compared with catalysis and release of intermediates (13Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At this point the complex can either dissociate, releasing the mono-prenylated Rab7-REP-1 complex, or it can undergo prenylation, since a free cysteine is still available. As has been shown previously, following double prenylation the active site is cleared, and a third molecule of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate binds rapidly (13Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At this point the two cysteine residues are already prenylated. The third GGpp molecule serves to increase the dissociation rate of the double prenylated product thereby reducing its affinity for the enzyme and leading to product release. The presence of GGpp only increases the dissociation when the double prenylated product is present, while GGpp has no observable effect on the dissociation rate of the mono-prenylated intermediate (7Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Owen D. Scheidig A.S. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Once both cysteine residues are prenylated, dissociation of the product is accelerated by the binding of phosphoisoprenoid. GGpp thereby acts as a specific activator that determines whether RabGGTase retains or releases the prenylated protein. It should also be pointed out that in vivoRabGGTase also prenylates Rab molecules possessing a single cysteine in their C terminus (23Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Castellano F. Maltese W.A Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on our result product release would be expected to be rate determining in the prenylation of these Rab proteins. RabGGTase has clearly evolved a tightly regulated mechanism for double prenylation that is substantially more complex than just a repetition of a single prenylation step. It is remarkable that RabGGTase and the remaining family of prenyltransferase have almost identical three-dimensional structures but differ significantly in terms of mechanistic details.

The MAPK cascades mediate cell signaling from the GnRH receptor to the nucleus and are critical for transcriptional activation of many GnRH-responsive genes, including the glycoprotein hormone α subunit gene (9Roberson M.S.

These MAPK-dependent transcriptional activation events are mediated by activation of transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun (19Cesnjaj M. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S.

MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in a conserved TXY motif (for review, see Refs. 20Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol.

In addition to the post-translational regulation of MKP catalytic activity by MAPKs, MKP expression is also tightly controlled both temporally and spatially, suggesting that each MKP has a distinct physiological function.

J. 2000; 352: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that MKPs form a negative feedback loop to control intracellular MAPK activity. Because the physiological functions of MKPs are largely determined by their expression patterns, it is important to understand the mechanisms of regulation of MKP expression. Studies of the MKP-1 gene have identified an E-box and two cAMP response elements in the proximal promoter region as important elements for activation of the gene (47Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M.G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 48Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas an E-box and an AP-2-like site are critical for PAC-1 activation in hematopoietic tissues (44Grumont R.J. Rasko J.E. Strasser A. Gerondakis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MKP-2 is a nuclear MKP closely related to MKP-1 and PAC-1 (37Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 38King A.G. Ozanne B.W. Smythe C. Ashworth A.

It is expressed in a broad range of tissues and is induced by various extracellular stimuli. GnRH stimulation of pituitary gonadotropes results in marked induction of MKP-2 expression (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This induction is mediated through MAPK-dependent and independent pathways (18Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Activation of both the ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways, but not the p38 MAPK cascade, is required for MKP-2 expression. Discrete Ca2+signals also contribute to MKP-2 expression through modulation of MAPK-dependent and -independent pathways. To better understand the mechanism underlying MKP-2 induction by GnRH, we conducted functional analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the MKP-2 gene. A DNA element, MGRE (MKP-2 GnRHresponse element), was identified within the proximal promoter region of the MKP-2 gene that mediates GnRH responsiveness. Egr-1, a zinc finger transcription factor essential for pituitary LHβ expression and normal reproductive function (51Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Trembleau A. Gourdji D. Driancourt M.A. Rao C.V. Charnay P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 107-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), was identified in the MGRE-binding complex. GnRH induced binding of Egr-1 to the MGRE in an ERK-dependent manner and enhanced transcriptional activity of Egr-1. Egr-1 protein expression closely correlated with the expression of MKP-2 protein in αT3–1 cells, suggesting a role of Egr-1 in transcriptional regulation of the MKP-2 gene. A luciferase reporter construct MKP-2-Luc containing nucleotides −1664 to +123 of MKP-2 5′-flanking region in pGL3-basic vector (Promega) was prepared as described previously (53Zhang T. Choy M. Jo M. Roberson M.S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Successive deletions of the 5′ end of the MKP-2 sequence were made by PCR. The forward primers used in these reactions were: fw −545, 5′-TCCGGGGAATCGCATT-3′; fw −198, 5′-CCTCTAGGTCTCGGTTTT-3′; fw −169, 5′-TGGCAGACAGCACCGAGC-3′; fw −141, 5′-CTCCTCTCTTTGTGACGT-3′; fw −115, 5′-CGTGACTGGGTGCGAGGG-3′; fw −89, 5′-CTCCATTCAAGAGTCGGG-3′; and fw +35, 5′-GAGGAGGAAACTCTGGCT-3′. The reverse primer was: rev +193, 5′-GACCGAGGAGGGGAGTATGTTT-3′. The PCR products were cloned into pGEMTeasy vector (Promega), and their identities were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The MKP-2 fragments were cleaved out at theSpeI restriction site in the pGEMTeasy polylinker and theNheI site at +123 of the MKP-2 sequence. The fragments were then subcloned into pGL3-basic vector at the NheI restriction site. Oligonucleotides containing the MGRE sequence were: MGREfw, 5′-CGTGACTGGGTGCGAGGGGGCCGGCG-3′, and MGRErev, 5′-CGCCGGCCCCCTCGCACCCAGTCACG-3′. The oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated at the 5′ termini by polynucleotide kinase, and subjected to blunt end ligation to generate multimers of the MGRE element. The multimers were then ligated into a luciferase reporter vector (PRL-pGL3) containing a prolactin minimal promoter as described previously (54Roberson M.S. Ban M. Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3331-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The multimers were inserted at a SmaI restriction site upstream of the prolactin TATAA box. The resulting reporter constructs were sequenced to determine the number and orientation of the MGRE elements present in the PRL-pGL3 vector. Luciferase reporter constructs, containing 507 base pairs of 5′-flanking region of the mouse glycoprotein hormone α subunit promoter (mα-Luc) or the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (TK-Luc) have been described previously (55Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3903-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Gal4-dependent reporter (5xGal4-E1B-Luc), containing five Gal4 DNA-binding sites cloned upstream of the E1B minimal promoter, has been reported previously (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vectors for Gal4-Elk1, Gal4-Egr-1, and NAB1 have been described previously (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Russo M.W. Matheny C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6858-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 58Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Block substitution of the 26-nucleotide MGRE sequence in the MKP-2 promoter was prepared by PCR. The sequences of the primers containing the mutations are indicated below. Mutated nucleotides are underlined. Wild type MGRE sequences are shown for comparison: MUTfwm 5′-ATGTCAGTCTAGATCTTTTTAATTATCTCCATTCAAGAGTCGGGG-3′; MGREfw, CGTGACTGGGTGCGAGGGGGCCGGCG; MUTrev, 5′-ATAATTAAAAAGATCTAGACTGACATGGAACTCGACGTCACAAAG-3′; and MGRErev, CGCCGGCCCCCTCGCACCCAGTCACG. Two PCR reactions were carried out using primer pairs fw −198/MUTrev and MUTfw/rev +193 and the MKP-2 5′-flanking sequence as template. The products from these two reactions were gel-purified and combined together to be used as template for another PCR reaction using primer pair fw −198/rev +193. The product of this PCR reaction was gel-purified, and the nucleotide sequence was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. The mutant sequence was cloned into the pGL3 basic vector as described above. The resulting construct containing MKP-2 sequence from nucleotides −198 to +123, with the block substitution of MGRE, is designated MUT-198-Luc. The mouse gonadotrope cell line, αT3–1 (generously provided by Dr. Pamela Mellon, University of California, San Diego), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. For transient transfection studies, the cells were grown to ∼50% confluence in 60-mm culture dishes. pGL3-basic vector or luciferase reporter constructs containing MKP-2 5′-flanking sequence were transfected into αT3–1 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Plasmid DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate was added to the cell culture medium for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and placed into fresh serum-containing medium. The cells were then stimulated with or without 10 nm GnRHa for 4 h prior to collection for luciferase assay. In overexpression studies using NAB1, a 4-h incubation period was used between the end of transfection and the initiation of agonist treatment to allow for accumulation of overexpressed NAB1 protein in transfected cells. When fetal bovine serum was used as an agonist, the cells were serum-starved for 4 h following transfection and then stimulated with GnRHa or serum for 4 h. For transient transfection studies using 5xGal4-E1B-Luc reporter, αT3–1 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) overnight. The cells were then washed with serum-free medium and cultured with or without GnRHa for 8 h. For both transfection methods, cell lysates were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles and clarified by centrifugation. Luciferase activity was determined in samples containing similar amounts of total cellular protein as described previously (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection studies were conducted in triplicate on at least three separate occasions. The data shown are from a representative experiment and reported as the means ± S.E. (n = 3). αT3–1 cells were cultured in 150-mm culture dishes to ∼50% confluence. Prior to hormone stimulation, the cells were serum starved for 2 h followed by pretreatment with or without PD98059 (50 μm) for 30 min. The cells were then treated with control solution or 10 nm GnRHa for 2 h. At the end of the hormone treatment, nuclear extracts were collected as described previously (9Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after one wash with ice-cold HEPES-buffered saline (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 0.1% dextrose), the cells were scraped in HEPES-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. The cells were placed in hypotonic buffer and lysed in a Dounce homogenizer, and the nuclei were isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Nuclei were resuspended in an EMSA binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm disodium pyrophosphate and 5 mm sodium vanadate. Nuclear proteins were extracted by adding additional NaCl to a final concentration of 450 mm and incubating at 4 °C for 30 min with constant rocking. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 75,000 rpm for 30 min, and protein concentration of the samples was determined by Bradford assay. Nuclear extracts were aliquot and stored at −80 °C until use. EMSA was conducted as described previously (56Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MGREfw and MGRErev oligonucleotides were annealed and radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. αT3–1 cell nuclear extracts were mixed with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in EMSA binding buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Labeled MGRE probe (∼20,000 cpm/reaction) was then added, and the binding reactions were incubated for another 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × TBE (22.5 mm Tris, 22.5 mm boric acid, 0.5 mmEDTA) at 4 °C. The gels were dried, and DNA-protein binding complexes were visualized by autoradiography. In competition EMSA studies, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extract for 30 min before the addition of the labeled MGRE probe. The competitors include MGRE, MUT, Sp1 and cEgr. The sequences of MUT, Sp1 and cEgr are indicated below. The consensus Sp1- and Egr-1-binding sites are in bold: MUT, 5′-ATGTCAGTCTAGATCTTTTTAATTAT-3′ and 3′-TACAGTCAGATCTAGAAAAATTAATA-5′; Sp1, 5′-CGTGGGGGGCGGGGCCTGG-3′ and 3′-GCACCCCCCGCCCCGGACC-5′; and cEgr, 5′-GGGAGTCAGTCTTGCGTGGGCGTTAGTCAGTCGGG-3′ and 3′-CCCTCAGTCAGAA- CGCACCCGCAATCAGTCAGCCC-5′. The MGREfw oligonucleotide was biotinylated at the 5′ terminus during the synthesis reaction (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equal amounts of the biotin-labeled MGREfw and the unlabeled MGRErev were annealed in binding buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmdisodium pyrophosphate and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). MGRE pull-down was performed as described previously (54Roberson M.S. Ban M. Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3331-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, annealed biotin-MGRE oligonucleotides were bound to streptavidin-agarose (SA) beads (Sigma) in binding buffer at 4 °C. Approximately 5 pmol of MGRE oligonucleotides were added for each μl of SA beads. Bound MGRE-SA beads were washed four times in the binding buffer and resuspended to the original volume of the SA beads. MGRE pull-down reactions were carried out in the binding buffer containing 20 μl of MGRE-SA beads and 85 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 0.5 ml. In some reactions nonbiotinylated competitor oligonucleotides were included. These included MGRE, MUT, and cEgr oligonucleotides. The binding reactions were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with constant rocking. At the end of the incubation, the SA beads were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and washed six times in the binding buffer. The binding complexes were denatured by boiling and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and subjected to Western blot analysis. Egr-1 and Sp1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. αT3–1 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes to ∼50% confluence. The cells were serum-starved for 4 h before GnRHa or serum stimulation. At the end of the experiment, whole cell lysates were collected for Western blot analysis as described previously (18Zhang T. Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ERK2, MKP-1, MKP-2, and Egr-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-active ERK antibody (Promega), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) were used according to the manufacturers' instruction. Immunostained signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). We have previously isolated the 5′-flanking region (−1664 to +123) of the rat MKP-2 gene (53Zhang T. Choy M. Jo M. Roberson M.S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This MKP-2 sequence supports both basal and PKC-induced expression of the luciferase reporter gene in the rat somatolactotrope cell line, GH3. In the present study, we first examined the expression of the same MKP-2 reporter construct (MKP-2-Luc) in the αT3–1 gonadotrope cell line. Transient transfection studies indicate that the basal expression level of MKP-2-Luc was higher than the expression level of pGL3 basic vector or TK-Luc (Fig. 1 A). GnRH markedly induced MKP-2-Luc expression, suggesting that the MKP-2 −1664 to +123 sequence can support both basal and GnRH-induced expression of the MKP-2 gene in gonadotropes. The expression level of MKP-2-Luc was comparable with that of the mouse glycoprotein hormone α subunit reporter (mα-Luc). To identify regions of the MKP-2 5′-flanking sequence that mediate GnRH responsiveness of the gene, luciferase reporter constructs bearing 5′ deletions of the MKP-2 sequence were generated by PCR and tested in transient transfection studies in αT3–1 cells. Basal activity of the MKP-2 promoter progressively declined with successive 5′ deletions (Fig. 1 B). However, in these deletion mutants, GnRH inducibility was not abolished until deletion to nucleotide +35 downstream of the putative transcription start site. The shortest MKP-2 fragment identified in this deletion series that retained full GnRH responsiveness was nucleotides −198 to +123. The reporte"

Several signal molecules are localized in a glycolipid-enriched microdomain on the cell surface, and their signals are regulated by the glycolipid composition. However, the function of glycolipids in osteoclastogenesis has not been clearly understood. We found thatd-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (d-PDMP), a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, completely inhibits the osteoclast formation induced by macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of RANK, the receptor of RANKL, induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor, was reduced markedly ind-PDMP-treated cells. d-PDMP also inhibited the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 induced by RANKL. In several experiments with the addition of glycolipids tod-PDMP-treated purified bone marrow cells, lactosylceramide (LacCer) strongly affected the differentiation into tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase mononucleated cells, but not positive multinucleated cells. GM3 and GM1 also recovered, but less effectively compared with LacCer. Moreover, exogenous LacCer recovered the reduced expression of RANK and the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 after stimulation by RANKL at the same level of cells without d-PDMP treatment. Our data suggest that glycosphingolipids, especially LacCer, are necessary for the initiation step of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.

Glycolipid nomenclature is based on that of Svennerholm (61Takeda H. Ozaki K. Yasuda H. Ishida M. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) Osteoclasts are multinuclear cells with bone-resorbing activity which play a crucial role in bone remodeling (1Suda T.

To promote osteoclastogenesis, two molecules, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)1 and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL), are essential and sufficient (3Takahashi N.

Cell. 1998; 93: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4546) Google Scholar). M-CSF, which is imperative for macrophage maturation, binds to its receptor in early osteoclast precursors, thereby providing signals required for their survival, proliferation, and osteoclast development (6Yoshida H. Hayashi S. Kunisada T. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Okamura H. Sudo T. Shultz L.D. Nishikawa S. Nature. 1990; 345: 442-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar, 7Felix R. Cecchini M.G. Fleisch H. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2592-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). On the other hand, RANKL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, binds to its receptor RANK and activates NF-κB, which is associated with osteoclastic differentiation and activation. These, in turn, prompt activation primarily via phosphorylation events such as activation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase, the IκB and NF-κB pathway, and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (3Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). TNF-α, which is produced by many types of cells including monocytes and macrophages, has been proposed to be involved in bone resorption, particularly in inflammatory bone diseases. It was also reported that TNF-α and interleukin-1α play important roles in bone loss associated with osteoporosis (8Pacifici R. Brown C. Puscheck E. Friedrich E. Slatopolsky E. Maggio D. McCracken R. Avioli L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5134-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). TNF-α also stimulates formation of multinucleated cells with the characteristics of osteoclasts in human bone marrow cultures (9Pfeilschifter J. Chenu C. Bird A. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). TNF-α induces a number of biological responses via two cell surface receptors termed TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2 (10Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Chen E.Y.

Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 can transduce intracellular signals that stimulate the proteolytic breakdown of IκB (13Kruppa G. Thoma B. Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3152-3157PubMed Google Scholar, 14Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 15Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The activated NF-κB is then translocated into the nucleus where it induces the transcription of several genes. In the fibrosarcoma cell line L929, exogenous generated bovine brain gangliosides prevent TNF-α-induced apoptosis (17Koike T. Fehsel K. Zielasek J. Kolb H. Burkart V. Immunol. Lett. 1993; 35: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect may be caused by an interference of gangliosides with intracellular signal transduction pathways, resulting in an inhibition of the activation of DNA-cleaving endonucleases. Moreover, treatment of cultured melanocytes with TNF-α results in a change in morphology and greatly enhanced expression of disialoganglioside 3 (GD3) (18Furukawa K. Arita Y. Satomi N. Eisinger M. Lloyd K.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This effect is specific; no other ganglioside is affected with the exception of an increase in monosialoganglioside 3 (GM3). These results suggest that glycosphingolipids (GSLs), especially gangliosides, are important to TNF-α signaling and TNF-α-induced cell fates. Although RANKL activates almost the same signal transduction pathway as TNF-α, the effects of GSLs on osteoclastogenesis by RANKL have never been reported. GSLs have been implicated as mediators of cell adhesion and modulators of signal transduction. These glycolipids compose lipid rafts, glycolipid-enriched microdomains, on the cell surface (19Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). The majority are clustered and associated closely with single or multiple signal transducer molecules; for example, GM3 ganglioside organized with c-Src, Rho, focal adhesion kinase, and Ras in B16 melanoma cells, and GD3 associated with Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn in the rat brain (20Yamamura S. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20916-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). d-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamin-3-morpholino-1-propanol (d-PDMP) inhibits glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthase and thus leads to extensive depletion of the glycosphingolipids derived from GlcCer (23Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has proven to be a useful tool for studying various functional roles of endogenous GSLs and their rafts in the living cell. For example, in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, which have overexpressing receptors for insulin-like growth factor I,d-PDMP has been reported to prevent the proliferative response to either insulin-like growth factor I or serum by blocking cell cycle-dependent kinases (24Mastick C.C. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Saltiel A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it did not affect early signal transduction events in response to these stimuli. In a neuronal culture system, d-PDMP has been reported to affect growth of murine neuroblastoma (26Uemura K. Sugiyama E. Taketomi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). d-PDMP also inhibits the axonal growth of hippocampal neurons (27Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and neurite outgrowth of a rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 (28Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Inokuchi J. Kuriyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26001-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effect of GSLs on osteoclastogenesis induced by M-CSF and RANKL. We show here that d-PDMP completely inhibits osteoclast formation. Furthermore,d-PDMP inhibits the responses in both phosphorylation of IκB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) induced by RANKL, and LacCer rescued the reduction of phosphorylation and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Soluble murine RANKL was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified from culture medium with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described previously (29Sakai H. Kobayashi Y. Sakai E. Shibata M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Nakashima T. Kobayashi Y. Yamasaki S. Kawakami A. Eguchi K. Sakai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Recombinant murine M-CSF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis). All glycosphingolipids and sphingolipids used in this study were purchased from Sigma. Bone marrow cells obtained from tibias and femurs of 4–6-week-old male ddY mice were passed through a Sephadex G-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column as described previously (31Tsurukai T. Takahashi N. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Udagawa N. Nogimori K. Tamura M. Suda T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,32Niida S. Kaku M. Amano H. Yoshida H. Kataoka H. Nishikawa S. Tanne K. Maeda N. Nishikawa S. Kodama H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Purified bone marrow cells were then cultured at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in 48-well plates for 3 or 5 days, under osteoclastogenic conditions, consisting of α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL. The medium was changed on day 2 of culture and supplemented with M-CSF and RANKL. d-PDMP treatment forced the addition ofd-PDMP at 2.5–30 μm with M-CSF and RANKL in growth medium. Osteoclasts were identified as those cells staining positively for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). On the 3rd or 5th day of culture, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline solution for 30 min at room temperature. After treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, the cells were stained for TRAP as described previously (29Sakai H. Kobayashi Y. Sakai E. Shibata M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TRAP-positive mono- or multinuclear cells were counted. Cells containing four or more nuclei were counted as multinuclear cells. Sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids were extracted as described previously (33Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Goto G. Urano T. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9271-9276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Usuki S. Hamanoue M. Kohsaka S. Inokuchi J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids were extracted from about 400 μl of packed bone marrow cells treated with 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL and treated with 10 ng/ml M-CSF, 50 ng/ml RANKL, and 30 μm d-PDMP using chloroform:methanol (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) sequentially. To analyze the sphingolipids and neutral glycosphingolipids, cells were labeled metabolically with [14C]serine. Isolated sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids were applied to high performance TLC plates (Merck) using the solvent system chloroform, methanol, 2.5 nNH4OH (60:35:8) for gangliosides, chloroform, methanol, 0.22% CaCl2 (60:35:8) for neutral glycolipids, and chloroform:methanol (9:1) for the separation of ceramides and then sprayed with resorcinol for detection of bands for gangliosides. The expression levels of neutral glycolipids and sphingolipids were estimated using a Bio-Image analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). For standard gangliosides, bovine brain ganglioside mixture (Wako Chemical Inc., Tokyo) and GM3 (Snow-brand, Tokyo) were used. Each band intensity was measured by NIH Image 1.61. Purified bone marrow cells were then cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL with or without 30 μm d-PDMP or 30 μm d-PDMP and 0.5 μm LacCer in 100-mm tissue culture plates in serum-containing medium for 3 days. Before RANKL or M-CSF treatment, the medium was washed and replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were incubated for 2 h. The cells were then incubated with 50 ng/ml RANKL or 10 ng/ml M-CSF for the appropriate times in the individual experiments at 37 °C. After these treatments, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium vanadate (Na3VO4), then solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, and the protein concentration of each sample was measured with micro-BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). The samples were denatured in SDS sample buffer and loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 20 μg of lysate protein was applied to each lane. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with anti-IκB, anti-phospho-IκB (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-MAP kinase, and anti-phospho-MAP kinase (New England Biolabs) and then visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and first strand cDNA was synthesized using ReveTra Ace (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). For PCR analysis, cDNA was amplified by Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo). A thermal cycle of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min was performed using a program of 29 cycles for RANK. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an internal control for PCR, was repeated for 23 cycles at 55 °C for 1 min of annealing. The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. Primer sequences used for mouse RANK were 5′-CGCCATGGCCCCGCGCGCCCGG-3′ (21–42) and 5′-GGCAGGTAAGCCTGGGCCTCC-3′ (662), and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-ATGTCGTGGAGTCTACTGGC-3′ (321) and 5′-TGACCTTGCCCACAGCCTTG-3′ (682). The predicted size of the each fragment are 642 and 381 base pairs, respectively. Isolated bone marrow cells from ddY mice, a precursor of osteoclasts, were cultured with 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL. To analyze the change in sphingolipids and sphingoglycolipids during the osteoclast differentiation, we isolated and performed thin layer chromatography analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GM3 and GM1 ganglioside expression was increased at 3 days after adding M-CSF and RANKL (Fig. 1 B). The ganglioside including GM3 and GM1 expression was not observed under the stimulation of M-CSF without RANKL (data not shown). Ceramide, sphingosine, and sphinganine expression was not changed by M-CSF and RANKL (Fig. 1 C). GM3 and GM1 expression induced by M-CSF and RANKL was completely inhibited by a 30 μm d-PDMP treatment (Fig. 1 B). GlcCer and LacCer expression was also reduced by d-PDMP. On the other hand, ceramide was increased 2.3 times after a d-PDMP treatment (Fig. 1 C). Sphingosine and sphinganine synthesis was not changed by d-PDMP. The other complex gangliosides, except GM3 and GM1, were not expressed under any condition. TRAP-positive mononuclear cells in purified bone marrow cell culture were observed at 3 days after stimulation with 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL. These TRAP-positive cells attached and fused to each other and then formed TRAP-positive multinuclear giant cells. To assess whether the inhibition of GSL synthesis would affect the osteoclastogenesis induced by M-CSF and RANKL, we addedd-PDMP into the culture medium. The 2.5 μm d-PDMP-treated cells were observed to have a 50% reduction in number of TRAP-positive mononuclear cells and a 65% reduction in number of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells (Fig.2). With 30 μm d-PDMP, TRAP-positive mononuclear and multinuclear cell formation was not observed. d-PDMP inhibited osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner. Cells treated only with M-CSF as a negative control did not form TRAP-positive cells. We used GM2/GD2 synthase (GM2/GD2-T)−/− mice, disrupting complex gangliosides (35Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Aizawa S. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12147-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to determine which glycolipids are important to M-CSF- and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. We found a small decrease in the number of osteoclasts from GM2/GD2-T−/− mice compared with wild type and heterozygous mice (Fig. 3). TRAP-positive mononuclear cell formation in GM2/GD2-T−/− mice was reduced ∼18% on the 3rd day poststimulation with M-CSF and RANKL. In addition, TRAP-positive multinuclear cell formation in GM2/GD2-T−/− mice was reduced ∼16% on day 5. As a result of mononuclear to multinuclear cell formation in osteoclast differentiation, mononuclear cell numbers were gradually reduced in 5 days, but the mononuclear cell number in GM2/GD2-T−/− mice was still high compared with the wild type mice. However, it was much less significant than the effect ofd-PDMP. In the bone marrow cells of GM2/GD2-T−/− mice,d-PDMP treatment dramatically reduced TRAP-positive mononuclear and multinuclear cell formation. These findings support the possibility that the other glycolipids remained in GM2/GD2-T−/− mice. For example, GM3, LacCer, and GlcCer may be important to induce osteoclastogenesis, especially in TRAP-positive mononuclear cell formation. We thought that the glycolipids that remained in GM2/GD2-T−/− mice were important to osteoclast formation. To determine which glycolipids were important in osteoclastogenesis, GM3, GD3, LacCer, GlcCer, and C2-ceramide were added to cultured bone marrow cells treated with 10 ng/ml M-CSF, 50 ng/ml RANKL, and 30 μm d-PDMP (Fig.4). TRAP-positive mononuclear and multinuclear cells were counted at 3 and 5 days after stimulation with these factors. The addition of 0.5 μm LacCer yielded a 65% recovery of TRAP-positive mononuclear cell formation 3 days after stimulation (Fig. 4 B). 5 μm GM3 and GM1 were also recovered, but less effectively compared with the LacCer treatment (Fig. 4 B). The other glycolipids, GD3 and GlcCer, and C2-ceramide, were not effective in the induction of TRAP-positive mononuclear cell. It was observed in this study that no glycolipid or ceramides used produced TRAP-positive multinuclear cells containing four or more nuclei (data not shown). Glycosphingolipids were decreased in presence of d-PDMP. However, ceramide and its other derivatives were increased byd-PDMP treatment. In fact, ceramide was increased after treatment with d-PDMP (Fig. 1 C). To determine the effect of increased ceramide on osteoclastogenesis induced by M-CSF and RANKL, C2-ceramide and sphingosine were added to our culture system without d-PDMP. C2-ceramide and sphingosine did not affect TRAP-positive mononuclear cell formation (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, TRAP-positive multinuclear cell formation was observed in the presence of C2-ceramide at the same level as the control (date not shown). RANKL induced recruitment of TNF-associated factors 2 and 6 to the cytoplasmic tail of RANK with activated IκB kinase and IκB phosphorylation. RANKL also activated the MAP kinase cascade (37Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 38Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28335-28355Google Scholar). These signals are essential for osteoclast differentiation and survival. To determine the effect of glycolipids on RANKL-induced signal transduction, we examined the expression and phosphorylation of IκB and ERK1/2 in RANKL-treated purified bone marrow cells with and without d-PDMP. IκB phosphorylation was observed at 5 min after stimulation of RANKL in control bone marrow cells, and the phosphorylation was sustained for 60 min (Fig. 5 A). Alternatively, RANKL-induced phosphorylation of IκB was reduced significantly ind-PDMP-treated cells. Similar results were observed in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 after treatment with d-PDMP (Fig.5 B). With the addition of LacCer in culture medium 3 days prior to RANKL stimulation, d-PDMP-treated IκB and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were recovered by control cell levels (Fig. 5,A and B). After the addition of M-CSF, ERK1/2 was transiently activated, and the phosphorylation was reduced markedly (Fig. 5 C). The activation pattern of ERK1/2 was different from RANKL-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In cells treated withd-PDMP, ERK1/2 phosphorylation-induced M-CSF was about 50% reduced compared with cells that were not treated withd-PDMP. Reduced phosphorylation by d-PDMP was also recovered with exogenously generated LacCer (Fig.5 C). RANKL binds to its receptor RANK and then activates the downstream molecules, including NF-κB and ERK1/2. The RANK expression level is important to the signal transduction of RANKL. We determined the expression level of RANK after treatment with d-PDMP by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 6). In purified bone marrow cells, RANK was not expressed without M-CSF and RANKL. RANK expression was induced after M-CSF stimulation. RANKL treatment did not affect the expression of RANK. The expression of RANK with M-CSF was inhibited dramatically by d-PDMP treatment. Exogenous LacCer also recovered the reduced expression of RANK withd-PDMP. Changing of glycolipid synthesis and their expression patterns have been observed during cellular differentiation and development as well as with exposure to several cytokines and growth factors. Many of these studies were performed by adding exogenous glycolipids into the culture medium of the cell lines under investigation. There was modulation of functions of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (39Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor receptor (40Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12059-12066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), insulin receptor (42Nojiri H. Stroud M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4531-4537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), insulin-like receptor (43Hynds D.L. Burry R.W. Yates A.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and nerve growth factor (44Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed the change of glycolipid expression during osteoclastogenesis. Among the gangliosides, only GM3 and GM1 were observed in bone marrow cells after adding M-CSF and RANKL; no other ganglioside expression was observed before stimulation of these factors (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, we thought that GM3, GM1 and the precursors of these gangliosides, LacCer and GlcCer, were important for M-CSF- and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. d-PDMP inhibits glucosylceramide synthase and deprives the cell surface sugar chain for glycolipids; therefore, it is useful for analysis of glycolipid function (23Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We employed d-PDMP to assess whether the inhibition of glycolipids including gangliosides would affect osteoclast formation induced by M-CSF and RANKL. In ourin vitro culture system for osteoclasts, d-PDMP completely inhibited the osteoclastogenesis induced by M-CSF and RANKL. These results suggest that GSLs are necessary for M-CSF or RANKL signaling. We also used bone marrow cells of GM2/GD2-T−/− mice to determine which glycolipids are important for M-CSF- and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis as a preliminary experiment. These mice had disrupted complex gangliosides and showed aspermatogenesis and the attenuation of interleukin-2-induced T-cell activation (35Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In GM2/GD2-T−/− mice-derived cells, osteoclast formation was nearly the same level compared with wild type mice, but there was a little inhibition in the number of TRAP-positive mononuclear cells after 3 days of stimulation with M-CSF and RANKL. After 5 days of M-CSF and RANKL supplementation, the number of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells in GM2/GD2-T−/− mice was a little smaller than GM2/GD2-T+/− mice. The number of TRAP-positive mononuclear cells in GM2/GD2-T−/− mice was a little larger than in GM2/GD2-T+/− mice. In cells derived from GM2/GD2-T+/− mice, cell fusion of TRAP-positive mononuclear cells may be inhibited. Several adhesion molecules, for example integrins and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), are important for cell-to-cell adhesion and fusion in osteoclasts. ICAM-1 was also highly expressed in mononuclear cell cultures in forming preosteoclast-like mononuclear cells (46Harada H. Kukita T. Kukita A. Iwamoto Y. Iijima T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the bone marrow culture system for multinuclear cell formation, significant inhibition was observed with the addition of ICAM-1-binding peptide (46Harada H. Kukita T. Kukita A. Iwamoto Y. Iijima T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest the involvement of integrins and ICAM-1 in osteoclastogenesis. ICAM-1 expression-induced TNF-α regulated by LacCer andd-PDMP inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. The αvβ3 integrin is expressed in bone-resorbing osteoclasts (47Chambers T.J. Fuller K. Darby J.A. Pringle J.A. Horton M.A. Bone Miner. 1986; 1: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar, 48Clover J. Dodds R.A.

Res. 1993; 8: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the αvβ3 integrin binds ligands via the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence, osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro can be inhibited by the addition of the RGD peptide or antibody against αvβ3integrins (47Chambers T.J.

Specific gangliosides have been shown to be associated with integrins at focal contacts (53Cheresh D.A. Harper J.R. Schulz G. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, binding to disialogangliosides by tenascin or anti-GD2 antibody causes inhibition of protein kinase C and prevention of integrin-dependent adhesion to fibronectin, resulting in inhibition of neurite outgrowth (57Probstmeier R. Pesheva P. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 58Probstmeier R. Michels M. Franz T. Chan B.M. Pesheva P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, GM1, which is not expressed in GM2/GD2-T−/− mice, increased after RANKL stimulation; this might be important to TRAP-positive mononuclear and multinuclear cell formation, especially for cell-to-cell attachment and fusion. However, the difference in differentiation into osteoclasts for GM2/GD2+/− versus−/− is only marginal. In knockout mice, other unexpected factors may support the formation of the osteoclast. In d-PDMP treatment, ceramide was increased, and sphingosine and sphinganine expression was not affected byd-PDMP in purified bone marrow cells. In tumor cells,d-PDMP causes growth arrest and apoptosis because of an increase of ceramide rather than an decrease of GSLs (59Felding-Habermann B. Igarashi Y. Fenderson B.A. Park L.S. Radin N.S. Inokuchi J. Strassmann G. Hanada K. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 60Shela Rani C.S. Abe A. Chang Y. Rosenzweig N. Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To determine which increased ceramide and decreased GSLs are important for the inhibiting effect of osteoclast differentiation, we added the C2-ceramide sphingosine and GSLs with M-CSF and RANKL to the culture medium. Adding C2-ceramide and sphingosine did not affect the osteoclast differentiation induced by M-CSF and RANKL withoutd-PDMP. The apoptosis of osteoclasts was not induced by C2-ceramide (data not shown). C2-ceramide strongly inhibited F-actin ring formation of and bone resorption by osteoclast (61Takeda H. Ozaki K. Yasuda H. Ishida M. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In our culture system, ceramide did not affect TRAP-positive mononuclear and multinuclear cell formation. The ceramide concentration in cells may be important for actin ring formation and resorptional function in osteoclasts (61Takeda H. Ozaki K. Yasuda H. Ishida M. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but not TRAP-positive cell formation. Exogenously generated LacCer recovered the TRAP-positive mononuclear cell formation in d-PDMP treated cells. GM3 and GM1 were also affected with these recovered effects, but no other glycolipids, GlcCer, GD3, or C2-ceramide (data not shown). GSLs, in particular the unique GSL LacCer, play a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of complex glycosphingolipids. LacCer, a precursor of gangliosides, is expressed ubiquitously all over the body. Exogenous LacCer stimulates the activation of ERK1 and the expression of c-fos transcription factor (62Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10660-10666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, TNF-α induces the expression of LacCer synthesis. This inductive LacCer generates superoxide production and ICAM-1 expression (63Bhunia A.K. Arai T. Bulkley G. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34349-34357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These results indicate that inhibition of osteoclast differentiation by d-PDMP is the cause of the decreased GSLs, especially LacCer, rather than increased ceramide. In d-PDMP-treated bone marrow cells, RANKL-induced IκB phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation were reduced. IκB phosphorylation induced the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This signaling is important for osteoclast differentiation (3Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In fact, osteopetrosis caused by deficient osteoclast formation occurs in NF-κB knockout mice (64Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Yang Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of osteoclastogenesis with d-PDMP on bone marrow cells results in down-regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. M-CSF also induced the expression of its receptor RANK. This induction of RANK was down-regulated by d-PDMP. These results indicate that prevention of osteoclast formation induced by d-PDMP is caused by down-regulation of RANKL signaling, IκB, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, M-CSF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is also inhibited by d-PDMP. d-PDMP also inhibited the expression of RANK induced by M-CSF. In the absence of M-CSF, cells did not respond to RANKL, for example phosphorylation of IκB and MAPK was not observed after RANKL only (data not shown). These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of osteoclast formation by d-PDMP in our system consist of two possibilities. One is that the reduced expression of RANKL was induced by inhibition of M-CSF signaling. Second, the reduced signaling of RANKL was caused by the phosphorylation of IκB and ERK1/2. In either case, total RANKL signaling was reduced, and TRAP-positive cell formation of purified bone marrow cell was completely inhibited byd-PDMP. The addition of LacCer to the culture medium returned the phosphorylation levels back to the d-PDMP-untreated levels. LacCer recovered RANKL-induced ERK1/2 and IκB phosphorylation, but we did not observe TRAP-positive multinuclear cell formation in LacCer-treated cells. Other glycolipids, for example GM3 and GM1, which increased after stimulation of M-CSF and RANKL, may be necessary to form the TRAP-positive multinuclear cells. However, treatment with GM3 or GM1 alone did not induce TRAP-positive multinuclear cell formation. Why LacCer specifically induced the expression and activation of RANK in d-PDMP-treated osteoclast precursor cells is not clearly understood from our study. Previously, our studies with PC12 cells revealed that changing the cell surface glycolipids affected high affinity nerve growth factor receptor TrkA activation and phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2. In PC12 cells, gangliosides regulated the TrkA dimer formation and phosphorylation (65Fukumoto S. Mutoh T. Hasegawa T. Miyazaki H. Okada M. Goto G. Furukawa K. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5832-5838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Exogenous generated LacCer might modify the conformation of the RANK molecule. Two questions, whether LacCer binds to RANK and what the mechanisms are underlying the conformational change of RANK in osteoclasts, are now under investigation in our laboratory. The results obtained in this study strongly suggest the important roles of glycosphingolipids, specifically LacCer, in the regulation of the initiation step of osteoclast differentiation and especially TRAP-positive mononuclear cell formation. These findings may be useful for the development of therapeutic agents to treat bone-resorbing diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2091833651,"Nitric oxide (NO) is not only an important signaling molecule, but it also regulates the expression of a number of genes in the liver. We have previously shown that apoptosis in hepatocytes exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α and actinomycin D is prevented by NO derived from the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), by mechanisms that are both dependent on and independent of modulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) subsequent to activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). We hypothesize that one mechanism by which NO exerts these effects is by regulating the expression of genes involved in apoptosis. We used differential display-polymerase chain reaction to isolate NO-regulated genes in hepatocytes from iNOS knockout mice (to eliminate endogenous inducible NO production). Using this analysis, we identified a NO-suppressed gene fragment homologous with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 binding protein BNIP3. Northern analysis confirmed the NO-dependent suppression of BNIP3 in cultured cells. Similarly, the NO donorS-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (1–1000 μm) down-regulated the expression ofBNIP3 in both iNOS knockout and wild-type hepatocytes. This effect of NO was reversed by the sGC inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalon-1-one (ODQ),suggesting the involvement of the sGC/cGMP pathway in the modulation of BNIP3 by NO. We propose that suppression of BNIP3 expression is one sGC/cGMP-dependent mechanism by which NO might affect the process of hepatocyte apoptosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is not only an important signaling molecule, but it also regulates the expression of a number of genes in the liver.

The liver is a primary response organ during sepsis and one of the last organs to fail in multiple organ failure (1Jarrar D. Chaudry I.H. Wang P. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 575-583PubMed Google Scholar). One emerging theory regarding the pathology of liver failure in sepsis implicates apoptosis secondary to release of inflammatory mediator (2Mahidhara R. Billiar T.R. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N105-N113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,3Papathanassoglou E.D. Moynihan J.A. Ackerman M.H. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is now clear that widespread up-regulation of the inducible nitric-oxide (NO)1 synthase (iNOS; NOS2)1 is part of the sepsis syndrome. Importantly, the expression of iNOS by Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in the liver appears to play a central role in the pathobiology of sepsis (4Johnson M.L. Billiar T.R. World J. Surg. 1998; 22: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); recent studies from our laboratory have shown that iNOS exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on the liver during experimental endotoxemia (2Mahidhara R. Billiar T.R. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N105-N113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Ou J. Carlos T.M. Watkins S.C. Saavedra J.E. Keefer L.K. Kim Y.M. Harbrecht B.G. Billiar T.R.

Several mechanisms contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect of NO on hepatocytes, including the suppression of activity of multiple caspases by nitrosylation (7Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J.

Takeyama N. Tanaka T. Surg. Today. 1999; 29: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and suppression of the induction of pro-apoptotic genes (11Zamora R. Alarcon L. Betten B. Gibson K. Billiar T. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4 (abstract): 183Google Scholar). Some of these actions are cGMP-dependent and cGMP analogues suppress caspase activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release (12Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that some of these anti-apoptotic effects of NO are mediated by the modulation of gene expression in hepatocytes. Nitric oxide is an important regulator of a wide variety of cellular functions (13Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4133) Google Scholar), and affects the expression of genes in multiple cell types (14Remick D.G. Villarete L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,15Vodovotz Y. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Salvemini D. Billiar T.R. Vodovotz Y. Nitric Oxide and Inflammation. Birkhauser, Basel2001: 41-58Crossref Google Scholar). We identified genes regulated by NO in mouse hepatocytes using the technique of differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) (16Liang P. Pardee A.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because iNOS may be induced during manipulation of hepatocytes (17Wang H. Gao X. Fukumoto S. Tademoto S. Sato K. Hirai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Tirmenstein M.A. Nicholls-Grzemski F.A. Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Fariss M.W. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 53: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we decided to use cells that are incapable of expressing iNOS and thus have never been exposed to elevated concentrations of NO. To carry this out, we used hepatocytes derived from iNOS null (iNOS−/−) mice (19Macmicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.w. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Because iNOS is usually induced in hepatocytes by treatment with strong pro-inflammatory co-stimuli (interferon-γ, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) (20Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), stimuli that by themselves can modulate gene expression, we instead infected hepatocytes with an adenoviral vector expressing the human iNOS gene (Ad-iNOS) that has been developed and characterized in our laboratory (21Tzeng E. Shears L.L. Robbins P.D. Pitt B.R. Geller D.A. Watkins S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Among the transcripts identified by this analysis was the pro-apoptotic gene BNIP3 (formerly known as Nip3 (22Vande V.C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar)), which belongs to the Bcl-2 family and has been involved in cell death. Our observation that BNIP3 expression is markedly suppressed following iNOS expression and NO production suggests that this could be another mechanism by which NO prevents apoptosis.DISCUSSIONNitric oxide has an important regulatory role in the liver in infection and inflammation (2Mahidhara R. Billiar T.R. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N105-N113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Johnson M.L. Billiar T.R. World J.

Among the several functions of NO in multiple cell types is the regulation of gene expression (14Remick D.G. Villarete L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,15Vodovotz Y. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Salvemini D. Billiar T.R. Vodovotz Y. Nitric Oxide and Inflammation. Birkhauser, Basel2001: 41-58Crossref Google Scholar). As part of our analysis of iNOS-mediated changes in hepatocyte gene expression using differential display, we carried a detailed evaluation of one of the iNOS-suppressed genes. Thirty-six cDNA fragments that reproducibly displayed a different abundance pattern between hepatocytes infected with Ad-LacZ and cells infected with Ad-iNOS were identified, isolated, cloned, and sequenced. From this analysis, we have reported that infection with Ad-iNOS increases the expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 in iNOS-null hepatocytes in the absence of inflammatory stimuli (33Zamora R. Vodovotz Y. Alarcon L. Betten B. Loughran P.A. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. Gibson K.F. Billiar T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among the other genes regulated by NO and detected by the same differential display analysis wasBNIP3, a gene known to promote apoptosis (29Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar); this was demonstrated for the first time in hepatocytes in the present study. We have shown that NO suppresses BNIP3 independently of any other inflammatory stimuli, an effect largely mediated by the cGMP pathway. Infection with Ad-LacZ had no effect on BNIP3 expression, suggesting that the effect was specific to iNOS expression.BNIP3 localizes to mitochondria and other cytoplasmic membrane structures (34Boyd J.M.

In the liver, BNIP3 is expressed as a major transcript of 2.5 kb and as a minor transcript of 1.7 kb (29Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). BNIP3 appears to have an overall resemblance to several BH3-containing Bcl-2 family proteins such as BIK, BID, HRK, and BAD, in which the BH3 domain plays an important role in eliciting apoptosis (35Yasuda M. Theodorakis P. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Indeed, BNIP3 sensitizes Rat-1 cells to apoptosis by Granzyme B and topoisomerase inhibitors and overcomes Bcl-2 suppression of apoptosis (29Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C.

The BNIP3 BH3 domain was as efficient as the Bax BH3 domain in eliciting apoptosis, probably through heterodimer formation with anti-apoptotic proteins (35Yasuda M. Theodorakis P. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Expression of BNIP3 (both mRNA and protein) is induced and related to hypoxia-induced apoptosis in CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary), CV-1 (monkey kidney), Rat-1 (rat fibroblast), PAM212 (human epithelial), HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), and ECV-304 (human bladder carcinoma) cell lines (37Bruick R.K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9082-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). However, BNIP-3 may also mediate cell death via pathways other than apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by BNIP3 was only partially suppressed in cell lines expressing Bcl-2 (29Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1439-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that BNIP3 heterodimerizes with Bcl-2/Bcl-xl and induces cell death independent of a BH3 domain at both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial sites. Furthermore, another recent study (22Vande V.C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) reported that BNIP3 induces necrosis-like cell death following integration into the mitochondrial outer membrane and rapid mitochondrial PT pore opening. This mechanism was independent of caspases, and the Apaf-1/cytochrome c mitochondrial pathway is accompanied by the suppression of the proton electrochemical gradient and increased ROS production and occurs before the appearance of nuclear damage (22Vande V.C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In the present study, treatment with a pro-apoptotic stimulus (TNF-α in combination with actinomycin D) (7Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar,12Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) resulted in increased expression of BNIP3. Clearly, the mechanisms by which BNIP3 exerts its pro-apoptotic and/or necrotic activity warrant further investigation.Many of the cellular actions of NO are mediated by activation of sGC followed by increase in cGMP production (42Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Regulation of gene expression by NO can be both cGMP-dependent and independent. However, when it is dependent on the GC/cGMP pathway it is not always clear which of several cGMP target proteins mediates the effects on gene expression (43Idriss S.D. Gudi T. Casteel D.E. Kharitonov V.G. Pilz R.B. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9489-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that the anti-apoptotic effect of NO on hepatocytes occurs both via cGMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms (7Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 12Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this study, the comparison of the BNIP3 expression in the presence or absence of the sGC inhibitor ODQ suggested that cGMP production stimulated by NO leads to suppression of BNIP3mRNA. This effect suggests that, in this case, iNOS-derived NO is mediating a direct effect via interaction with sGC, rather than an indirect effect mediated by reactive nitrogen oxide species (44Wink D.A. Feelisch M. Vodovotz Y. Fukuto J. Grisham M.B. Colton C.A. Gilbert D.L. Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Systems: An Interdisciplinary Approach. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing, New York1999: 245-291Google Scholar).The role of nitric oxide (NO) in apoptosis is both diverse and complex, because NO can be considered either a pro-apoptotic or an anti-apoptotic molecule depending on a number of factors (6Li J. Billiar T.R. Semin. Perinatol. 2000; 24: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 45Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The effect of NO on BNIP-3 described herein appears to be part of a broad-spectrum anti-apoptotic effect of NO on hepatocytes (6Li J. Billiar T.R. Semin. Perinatol. 2000; 24: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In a previous study using DNA microarray technology, 2R. Zamora, Y. Vodovotz, K. S. Aulak, P. K. M. Kim, J. M. Kane III, L. Alarcon, D. J. Staehr, and T. R. Billiar, submitted for publication. we found that the anti-apoptotic genes BAG-1 (46Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C.

We also observed a reduction in certain pro-apoptotic genes following infection with Ad-iNOS. These genes include sox-4 (49Ahn S.G. Cho G.H. Jeong S.Y. Rhim H. Choi J.Y. Kim I.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the calpain gene (50Nakata M. Uto N. Maruyama I. Yada T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the R-ras gene (51Wang H.G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the ICE-like cysteine protease (Lice) gene (28Juan T.S. McNiece I.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Fletcher F.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 749-755PubMed Google Scholar), and the RIPgene.2 Further study is required to determine the relative contribution of these gene-modulatory effects of NO to the overall anti-apoptotic effect of this free radical.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that endogenous as well as exogenous NO down-regulate the expression of BNIP3 in both NO naı̈ve and wild-type hepatocytes. The sGC/cGMP pathway largely mediates this inhibitory effect. Because BNIP3 is a pro-apoptotic protein, its suppression by NO may contribute to the anti-apoptotic activity of NO in hepatocytes. We are currently investigating in more detail the expression of BNIP3 in other cell types and its relationship to cell death induced by different apoptosis and cell death inducers. Despite major advances in the information available on the mediators involved in the septic response, relatively little is known about the cellular and molecular events that either prevent or promote organ failure. The liver is a primary response organ during sepsis and one of the last organs to fail in multiple organ failure (1Jarrar D. Chaudry I.H. Wang P. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 575-583PubMed Google Scholar). One emerging theory regarding the pathology of liver failure in sepsis implicates apoptosis secondary to release of inflammatory mediator (2Mahidhara R. Billiar T.R. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N105-N113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,3Papathanassoglou E.D. Moynihan J.A. Ackerman M.H. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is now clear that widespread up-regulation of the inducible nitric-oxide (NO)1 synthase (iNOS; NOS2)1 is part of the sepsis syndrome. Importantly, the expression of iNOS by Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in the liver appears to play a central role in the pathobiology of sepsis (4Johnson M.L. Billiar T.R. World J. Surg. 1998; 22: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); recent studies from our laboratory have shown that iNOS exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on the liver during experimental endotoxemia (2Mahidhara R. Billiar T.R. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N105-N113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Ou J. Carlos T.M. Watkins S.C. Saavedra J.E. Keefer L.K. Kim Y.M. Harbrecht B.G. Billiar T.R.

Several mechanisms contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect of NO on hepatocytes, including the suppression of activity of multiple caspases by nitrosylation (7Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 8Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31437-31441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), decreased mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen intermediates (10Hakoda S. Ishikura H. Takeyama N. Tanaka T. Surg. Today. 1999; 29: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and suppression of the induction of pro-apoptotic genes (11Zamora R. Alarcon L. Betten B. Gibson K. Billiar T. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4 (abstract): 183Google Scholar). Some of these actions are cGMP-dependent and cGMP analogues suppress caspase activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release (12Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that some of these anti-apoptotic effects of NO are mediated by the modulation of gene expression in hepatocytes. Nitric oxide is an important regulator of a wide variety of cellular functions (13Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4133) Google Scholar), and affects the expression of genes in multiple cell types (14Remick D.G. Villarete L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,15Vodovotz Y. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Salvemini D. Billiar T.R. Vodovotz Y. Nitric Oxide and Inflammation. Birkhauser, Basel2001: 41-58Crossref Google Scholar). We identified genes regulated by NO in mouse hepatocytes using the technique of differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) (16Liang P. Pardee A.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because iNOS may be induced during manipulation of hepatocytes (17Wang H. Gao X. Fukumoto S. Tademoto S. Sato K. Hirai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Tirmenstein M.A. Nicholls-Grzemski F.A. Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Fariss M.W. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 53: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we decided to use cells that are incapable of expressing iNOS and thus have never been exposed to elevated concentrations of NO. To carry this out, we used hepatocytes derived from iNOS null (iNOS−/−) mice (19Macmicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.w. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Because iNOS is usually induced in hepatocytes by treatment with strong pro-inflammatory co-stimuli (interferon-γ, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) (20Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), stimuli that by themselves can modulate gene expression, we instead infected hepatocytes with an adenoviral vector expressing the human iNOS gene (Ad-iNOS) that has been developed and characterized in our laboratory (21Tzeng E. Shears L.L. Robbins P.D. Pitt B.R. Geller D.A. Watkins S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the transcripts identified by this analysis was the pro-apoptotic gene BNIP3 (formerly known as Nip3 (22Vande V.C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar)), which belongs to the Bcl-2 family and has been involved in cell death. Our observation that BNIP3 expression is markedly suppressed following iNOS expression and NO production suggests that this could be another mechanism by which NO prevents apoptosis. DISCUSSIONNitric oxide has an important regulatory role in the liver in infection and inflammation (2Mahidhara R. Billiar T.R. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N105-N113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Johnson M.L. Billiar T.R. World J. Surg. 1998; 22: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Taylor B.S.

Among the several functions of NO in multiple cell types is the regulation of gene expression (14Remick D.G. Villarete L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,15Vodovotz Y. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Salvemini D. Billiar T.R. Vodovotz Y. Nitric Oxide and Inflammation. Birkhauser, Basel2001: 41-58Crossref Google Scholar). As part of our analysis of iNOS-mediated changes in hepatocyte gene expression using differential display, we carried a detailed evaluation of one of the iNOS-suppressed genes. Thirty-six cDNA fragments that reproducibly displayed a different abundance pattern between hepatocytes infected with Ad-LacZ and cells infected with Ad-iNOS were identified, isolated, cloned, and sequenced. From this analysis, we have reported that infection with Ad-iNOS increases the expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 in iNOS-null hepatocytes in the absence of inflammatory stimuli (33Zamora R. Vodovotz Y. Alarcon L. Betten B. Loughran P.A. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. Gibson K.F. Billiar T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among the"

In this report we demonstrate that activation of multiple intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation events rapidly ensues following virus adsorption to NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells and affects the ultimate level of myxoma virus replication. UV-inactivated myxoma virus induces the rapid phosphorylation of CCR5 on tyrosine residues, the association of CCR5 with Jaks and p56lck, and their phosphorylation-activation within minutes of virus adsorption. Additionally, we provide evidence for myxoma virus-inducible signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) activation. In contrast to CCR5 activation effected by HIV Env protein, these myxoma virus-inducible phosphorylation events are not sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment. Moreover, in cells that are non-permissive for myxoma virus infection, we provide evidence that myxoma virus fails to invoke this tyrosine phosphorylation cascade. Consistent with the observation that infection of CCR5-expressing cells is blocked by herbimycin A and the Jak 2 inhibitor, tyrophostin AG490, we infer that viral infectivity may be dependent on non-G-protein-coupled signal transduction pathways triggered by the infecting myxoma virus particle.

They have been the subject of intensive study, based largely on their severe pathogenesis in humans and a variety of domestic animals (1Fenner F. FEMS Microbiol.

Myxoma virus, a member of theLeporipoxvirus genus, is the causative agent of myxomatosis, a lethal disease of the European rabbit (2Nash P. Barret J. Cao J.X. Hota-Mitchell S. Lalani A.S. Everett H. Xu X.M. Robichaud J. Hnatiuk S. Ainslie C. Seet B.T. McFadden G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 168: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Myxomatosis is characterized by extensive fulminating lesions and severe immune dysfunction accompanied by supervening Gram-negative bacterial infections of the respiratory tract (3McFadden G.M. Webster R. Granoff A. Encyclpedia of Virology. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 1153-1160Google Scholar). Recently, evidence was provided that myxoma virus may utilize chemokine receptors to initiate infection (4Lalani A.S. Masters J. Zeng W. Barrett J. Pannu R. Everett H. Arendt C.W. McFadden G. Science. 1999; 286: 1968-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Viruses have evolved a number of strategies to gain entry and replicate in host target cells that, for HIV1 and myxoma virus, includes appropriating chemokine receptors (4Lalani A.S. Masters J.

Chemokines and their receptors are critical for the clearance of infectious pathogens. Specifically, chemokines are implicated in directing lymphocyte trafficking to sites of infection and in activating the effector functions of these immune cells to eliminate infectious pathogens (7Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). Thus, viral subversion of chemokine receptors is an effective way to modulate chemokine-receptor-mediated interactions that would invoke an immune response against the invading virus. Indeed, herpesviruses and poxviruses subvert a host immune response by encoding several candidate chemokine receptor homologues and chemokine mimetics, capable of precluding chemokines from activating their cognate cell surface receptors (8Pease J.E.

However, for HIV-1, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that interference with the signaling capacity of CCR5 can compromise its role as an HIV-1 entry coreceptor (10Wang J.M. Oppenheim J.J. J.

Accordingly, we undertook studies to examine whether myxoma virus infection of cells requires activation of the signaling capacity of CCR5. Our data suggest that myxoma virus entry into cells does not require the signaling capacity of CCR5 to be intact, yet initiation of infection is dependent on non-G-protein-coupled tyrosine phosphorylation events initiated by the virus binding to the cell surface. Murine fibroblast NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 and NIH 3T3.CD4.neo cells were obtained from D. Littman (New York University) and were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. vMyxlac is a myxoma virus (strain Lausanne) derivative containing a β-galactosidase marker cassette driven by a late viral promoter in an intergenic location (4Lalani A.S. Masters J. Zeng W. Barrett J. Pannu R. Everett H. Arendt C.W. McFadden G. Science. 1999; 286: 1968-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). 109 plaque-forming units/ml of vMyxlac was UV inactivated using the Stratagene StratLinker for 20–30 min, as indicated. The StratLinker delivers a dose of 1.2 × 105μJ/cm2. 4-Amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine (PP1) was purchased from Biomol and tyrophostin B42 (AG490) from Calbiochem. Cell surface expression of CCR5 and CD4 was quantified by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies 2D7 (PharMingen) and SIM.4 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), respectively. Cells were gated based on forward and side scatter. CCR5 and CD4 expression was determined using an anti-mouse biotin conjugated secondary antibody detected with Cy5 conjugated streptavidin fluorescent tertiary reagent. Staining was according to the manufacturer's protocol, and flow cytometric data were acquired using FACScan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry) as described previously (14Ghislain J. Lingwood C.A. Fish E.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3655-3663PubMed Google Scholar). CELLQuest software was used to analyze data. Approximately 107cells were either exposed to 108 live virus particles, or the equivalent of 108 infectious units of UV-inactivated virus particles, or medium alone, for the indicated times. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as described previously (16Ahmad S. Alsayed Y. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29991-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence were performed as described previously (16Ahmad S. Alsayed Y. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29991-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells in individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were either left untreated, or treated with varying doses of PP1 or AG490, then exposed to vMyxlac at a m.o.i. of 10. After 16 h cells were lysed using a buffer composed of 10% Nonidet P-40 and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Following one freeze-thaw cycle, an aliquot of the lysate was transferred to a well in another 96-well microtiter plate, containing 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. To measure β-galactosidase activity, 4 mg/ml of substrateo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added in 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5. The breakdown ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside by β-galactosidase results in a yellow color reaction. After 1 h the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mNa2CO3. Absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 420 nm using a THERMOmax microplate reader. To determine whether infection by myxoma virus mediates CCR5 activation, thereby rendering a cell permissive for viral replication, we undertook studies to examine CCR5 mediated signal transduction in two distinct cell lines that are differentially sensitive to viral infection. NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells, that stably express human CD4 and human CCR5 (Fig. 1 A), are fully permissive for viral replication (Fig. 1 B). For these studies, viral gene expression was monitored using a recombinant myxoma virus that expresses β-galactosidase under the control of a late viral promoter that drives a lacZ transgene reporter (4Lalani A.S. Masters J. Zeng W. Barrett J. Pannu R. Everett H. Arendt C.W. McFadden G. Science. 1999; 286: 1968-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). By contrast, NIH 3T3.CD4.neo cells that express low levels of human CD4 and no CCR5 (Fig. 1 A) do not support myxoma virus replication, as revealed in Fig. 1 B. When both cell types are infected at an m.o.i. of 0.01 plaque-forming units/cell, then cells are harvested at 1 and 16 h post-infection for virus titration on permissive BGMK cells, we observe that the NIH 3T3.CD4.neo cells are completely non-permissive for infection (data not shown). By contrast, over this same time period we observe a log increase in plaque-forming units/106 BGMK cells (∼500–5000) from the permissive NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells (data not shown). Since myxoma virus infection of NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells can be inhibited by herbimycin A (4Lalani A.S. Masters J. Zeng W. Barrett J. Pannu R. Everett H. Arendt C.W. McFadden G. Science. 1999; 286: 1968-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), at the outset we examined whether adsorption of myxoma virus induces CCR5 phosphorylation. For these studies we employed UV-inactivated myxoma virus, in which the structural integrity of the viral particles is retained, yet UV-induced damage to the viral genome irreversibly prevents viral replication (17Ramsey-Ewing A. Moss B. Virol. 1998; 242: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). UV-inactivated myxoma virus particles can bind and enter into susceptible cells and are uncoated, with similar kinetics to the infective virus, but virus gene expression is severely compromised (data not shown). When lysates from myxoma virus exposed NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against phosphotyrosine or CCR5 and immunoblotted to detect either CCR5 or phosphotyrosine, we observed that even 1–5-min exposure to UV-inactivated myxoma virus induces rapid phosphorylation of CCR5 on tyrosine residues (Fig.2, A and B). Moreover, in NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells exposed to myxoma virus particles, we invariably observed the co-immunoprecipitation of a 56-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with CCR5 (Fig. 2 C). Immunoblot analysis identified this protein as the Src kinase, p56lck (Fig. 2 D). Our data would suggest that p56lck associates with CCR5 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. Notably, we observe inducible phosphorylation of p56lck whether live or UV-inactivated myxoma virus is used (Fig. 2 E). In subsequent experiments we examined the extent of myxoma virus-inducible protein tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cell lysates from the permissive NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 and non-permissive NIH 3T3.CD4.neo cells. Immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins followed by Western blot analysis revealed that a number of proteins consistently become tyrosine-phosphorylated following 1–5-min exposure of NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cultures to UV-inactivated myxoma virus (Fig.3 A), yet the non-susceptible NIH 3T3.CD4.neo cells do not show any evidence of virus-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (Fig. 3 B). Additionally, BGMK cells become resistant to myxoma virus infection following herbimycin A treatment. 2J. Masters, A. A. Hinek, G. McFadden, and E. N. Fish, unpublished observation. Chemokine-mediated activation of chemokine receptors leads to the rapid phosphorylation of receptor-associated Jaks (18Opermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E.I. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Wong M. Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Huynh T. Proudfoot A.E.I. Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11427-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PAGE analysis revealed myxoma virus-inducible phosphorylation of proteins that were candidate Jaks. Stripping and reprobing these antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots with antibodies to Jaks confirmed the identity of tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak1 and Jak2 (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, identical results were obtained whether live or UV-inactivated myxoma virus was used (Fig. 3 E). We did not observe myxoma virus-inducible Jak3 phosphorylation (not shown). Since p56lck associated with CCR5 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and D), we infer that p56lck may be a substrate for the activated Jaks (20Uddin S. Sher D.A. Alsayed Y. Pons S. Colamonici O.R. Fish E.N. White M.F. Platanias L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Uddin S. Grumbach I.M. Yi T. Colamonici O.R.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Alternatively, myxoma virus-CCR5 interactions may lead to cross-talk between cell surface receptors that are constitutively associated with CCR5, such as CD4 (23Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which results in the subsequent phosphorylation of CCR5 by other tyrosine kinases, like p56lck. Certainly, the NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells also stably express ectopic human CD4 (Fig. 1 A), and an earlier report described the dissociation of p56lck from CD4 that accompanies myxoma virus infection of T lymphocytes (24Barry M. Lee S.F. Boshkov L. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5243-5251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with HIV, myxoma virus may interact with both CD4 and CCR5, and the phosphorylation-activation of p56lck that we observe may be a direct consequence of myxoma virus interaction with CD4. It is possible that neither of these scenarios is mutually exclusive, since the kinetics of Jak and p56lck phosphorylation in the NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells would suggest that both tyrosine kinases are rapidly phosphorylated within the first few minutes of virus adsorption. In a recent study, evidence was provided for the reciprocal desensitization of CCR5 and CD4 by their respective ligands (25Mashikian M.V. Ryan T.C. Seman A. Brazer W. Center D.M. Cruikshank W.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3123-3130PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, HIV-1 gp120 association with CD4 results in p56lckphosphorylation and CX chemokine receptor CXCR4 down-regulation (26Su S.B. Gong W. Grimm M. Utsunomiya I. Sargeant R. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7128-7132PubMed Google Scholar). Although the pathophysiological relevance of CXCR4 down-regulation is unclear, this negative regulatory role for CD4 and p56lck may be associated with inhibition of ligand-CXCR4-inducible events that would lead to viral clearance and/or limiting the number of viral particles that may subsequently infect a single cell. Accordingly, we examined the effect of inhibition of p56lck on myxoma virus replication in NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells. The pharmacological inhibitor PP1 was used that exhibits a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) on p56lck activation at 5 nm(27Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brisette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 4 reveal a dose-dependent PP1-mediated increase in myxoma virus replication, suggestive of a negative regulatory role for p56lck in myxoma virus infection. In other cytokine receptor systems, the activation of Jaks results in the engagement of multiple distinct proteins to transduce signals and alter gene expression. Accordingly, we examined whether two of the best characterized downstream targets of Jak activation, the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) proteins (28Schindler C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-proteins (29White M.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar), were phosphorylated in NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells exposed to myxoma virus. In an earlier published report, we provided evidence for RANTES-CCR-mediated phosphorylation-activation of the Stat proteins Stat1 and Stat3 (30Wong M. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 309-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 5, A and B, indicate that exposure of NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells to UV-inactivated myxoma virus leads to the rapid phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 by 1 min, consistent with the rapid kinetics of phosphorylation-activation that we have observed with the cognate ligand, RANTES. The IRS family of proteins includes IRS-1 and IRS-2, which contain multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites in protein binding motifs for the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the adapter protein Grb-2, SHP-2 phosphatase, and other signaling elements (31Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These proteins play a central signaling role for various cytokine receptors by their ability to link these receptors to diverse downstream signaling pathways. We observed that myxoma virus consistently induces dose-dependent increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, albeit relatively weakly (Fig. 5,C–E). Our results clearly show that coincident with initiation of a fully productive myxoma virus infection in NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells, there is activation of a signal transduction cascade. Unlike HIV-1 (10Wang J.M. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), interference with tyrosine kinase signaling, but not G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, appears to compromise the ability of myxoma virus to infect cells. Interference with the G-protein-coupled signaling capacity of CCR5 using pertussis toxin can compromise the ability of HIV to infect cells, at both entry and post-entry stages (32Alfano M. Schmidtmayerova H. Amella C.-A. Pushkarsky T. Bukinsky M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, for myxoma virus, this activation is not G-protein-coupled, but is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation events. These data do not rule out the possibility of signal-dependent entry of myxoma virus into cells, mediated by non-tyrosine kinase pathways. Indeed, the intracellular mature infectious form of vaccinia virus, IMV, enters cells by a process that involves protein kinase C phosphorylation, the small GTPase rac1, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation (33Locker J.K. Kuehn A. Schleich S. Rutter G. Hohenberg H. Wepf R. Griffiths G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2497-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we have evidence that the non-permissive NIH 3T3.CD4.neo cells, as well as a rat basophilic cell line ectopically expressing human CCR5, RBL-5, that is also non-permissive for myxoma virus infection, permit viral particle entry, yet target the virus for lysosomal degradation (data not shown). Notably, myxoma virus fails to induce either CCR5 phosphorylation or other tyrosine phosphorylation events in the RBL-5 cells (data not shown). The implications from our study are that adsorption by myxoma virus, in a ligand-like fashion, activates a rapid tyrosine kinase signal transduction that, at the very least, allows for downstream events required for the completion of the fully productive virus replication cycle. In a final series of experiments, we examined the influence of Jak2 activation in mediating viral replication. Specifically, when NIH 3T3.CD4.CCR5 cells were treated with tyrophostin AG490, a dose-dependent inhibition of myxoma virus replication was noted (Fig. 6 A). AG490 exhibits an IC50 on Jak2 activation at 10 μm. Treatment with 10 μm AG490 reduced myxoma virus-induced Jak2 phosphorylation by 36% (Fig. 6 B). Thus, inhibition of Jak kinase activity blocks myxoma virus replication, indicative of a critical role for this kinase in virus infection. Myxoma virus-dependent recruitment of p56lck to CCR5 and its concommitant phosphorylation is reminiscent of an earlier observation of Src family kinase phosphorylation of a vaccinia viral protein, A36R, required for viral spread (34Frischknecht F. Moreau V. Rottger S. Gonfioni S. Reckmann I. Superti-Furga G. Way M. Nature. 1999; 401: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). An alternative role for myxoma virus-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck may be associated with either CCR5 or CD4 down-regulation. As described above, in other studies there is evidence that HIV-1 gp120 binding to CD4 on T cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck and the subsequent down-regulation of cell surface CXCR4 (26Su S.B. Gong W. Grimm M. Utsunomiya I. Sargeant R. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7128-7132PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that PP1 treatment leads to enhanced viral replication is supportive of a negative regulatory role for p56lck in myxoma virus infection. This contrasts with the requirement for Jak2 activation for myxoma virus replication. Apparently, this kinase activity is obligatory for a productive virus infection. The engagement of Stat and IRS proteins by myxoma virus suggests that the virus may regulate host cell gene expression to create the appropriate cellular environment for the later events in viral replication. In any event, the utilization of cellular tyrosine-kinase signaling pathways initiated by virus adsorption represents a novel strategy by which viruses subvert cell surface receptors to mediate host cell tropism."

We show here that p300 stabilizes both p53 and its negative regulator MDM2, thereby enhancing the p53/MDM2 negative regulatory loop. Binding of p300 is associated with the retention of p53 in the nucleus, which results in the accumulation of p53 in an acetylase-independent manner. Stabilization of MDM2, on the other hand, requires the acetylase activity of p300. Importantly, MDM2, once expressed, is able to reverse the stabilizing effect of p300 on p53. A temperature-permissive p53-expressing cell line enabled us to demonstrate the completely opposite roles of p300 in the regulation of p53 stability, depending on the expression of MDM2. Prior to p53 activation, when MDM2 levels are low, p300 acts as a positive regulator to increase p53 levels. Upon shifting to permissive temperature, however, when MDM2 expression is induced, p300 becomes a negative regulator of p53 by stabilizing MDM2 and thereby augmenting MDM2's ability to target p53 for degradation.

CREB-binding protein cAMP-response element-binding protein reverse transcription hemagglutinin p300 and CBP1 are transcriptional co-activators originally identified as E1A or CREB-binding proteins, respectively. Both p300 and CBP play an integral role in various cellular events, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development by interacting with a variety of cellular proteins. In addition, CBP/p300 possess histone acetyltransferase activity that originates either from intrinsic activity and/or from an associated protein, P/CAF. Paradoxically, CBP/p300 appear to be capable of contributing to opposite cellular processes since both coactivators participate in various tumor-suppressor pathways as well in the activities of several oncogenes. Consistent with this notion, CBP and p300 have been shown to promote apoptosis as well as cell proliferation, effects that appear to be highly context-dependent. The growth suppression functions of CBP/p300 are partially mediated by their interaction with the tumor suppressor p53. Studies have shown that p53 binds to the C-terminal region of CBP/p300 and that this interaction contributes to transcriptional activation of p53-responsive downstream genes including mdm2, p21, andbax (1Avantaggiati M.L.

Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar) that p53 could be acetylated by p300 uncovered a previously unrecognized aspect of CBP/p300 function. Acetylation of specific lysine residues in the C terminus of p53 was found to increase DNA binding dramatically, presumably by altering the conformation of an inhibitory regulatory domain. The ability of p53 to be acetylated in vivo was confirmed subsequently by using acetylation-specific antibodies (4Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W.

CBP/p300 also contributes to the mechanisms that regulate p53 degradation. The p53 protein is stabilized in cells that express adenovirus E1A, which blocks the ability of p53 to induce its target genes, such as MDM2. Because MDM2 is implicated in p53 degradation (7Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar,8Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar), blocking of MDM2 expression by E1A would be expected to suppress a negative feedback loop (9Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Grossman et al. (10Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) have shown that both p53 and MDM2 bind to the first zinc finger domain of p300. MDM2 mutants incapable of interacting with p300, but still capable of binding to p53, are defective in inducing p53 degradation (10Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Similarly, p53 mutants rendered incapable of interacting with p300 escape MDM2-mediated degradation. These findings led to the suggestion that interaction of MDM2 and p53 with p300 is required for p53 turnover. We previously reported that p300 was actually able to stabilize p53 (11Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Shioya H. Utsugisawa Y. Yokoyama K. Weichselbaum R. Shi Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1883-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using cells engineered to express ribozymes directed against either CBP or p300, we showed that p53 induction by DNA damage was compromised in cells deficient in p300. These contrasting findings reveal an unresolved question as to how p300 could exert opposite effects on p53 stability. In the present report, we demonstrate that p300 indeed can differentially control p53 stability, depending on the expression of MDM2. H1299 cells, 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Cells were transfected by a calcium-phosphate method as described (12Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Gu J. Huang Y.Y. Lu H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Hercules, CA). After addition of 5× loading buffer, samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved through SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) and probed with anti-FLAG (M5; Sigma), anti-p300 (RW128; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-acetyl p53 (Lys-373 and -382; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-MDM2 (Ab-1; Oncogene Science) or anti-β-actin (AC-15; Sigma) antibodies. Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was purified from 293T cell lysates using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and RT-PCR was performed using Access RT-PCR System (Promega) with the following gene-specific primers: FLAG-tagged p53 N terminus (5′-GCCACCATGGACTACAAGGAC-3′ and 5′-GCGGAGATTCTCTTCCTCTGT-3′); MDM2 C terminus (5′-GTAGAATTTGAAGTTGAATCT-3′ and 5′-CTAGGGGAAATAAGTTAGCAC-3′) or p300 Bromodomain (5′-AGCCAAAGAAAAAGATTTTCA-3′, and 5′-ACATCACTGGGTCAATTTCTT-3′). Purified p300-HAT domain was incubated with the indicated GST fusion protein in 50 μl of HAT assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm 'TA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 0.1 μCi of [14C]acetyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After drying, the gel was exposed to film for three days. Cells were grown on Chamber Slides (Nunc) and transfected with the indicated vector. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline 36 h after transfection and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Following phosphate-buffered saline washing, the slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) containing 2.5 mg/ml n-propyl gallate (Sigma). Specimens were examined under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Since completely opposite effects of p300 on p53 stability have been reported, we sought to investigate these contrasting findings by asking whether p300 could differentially control p53 stability under different circumstances. In light of our previous observation that p300-deficient MCF-7 cells exhibit an impaired p53 induction in response to DNA damage (11Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Shioya H. Utsugisawa Y. Yokoyama K. Weichselbaum R. Shi Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1883-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we first asked whether p300 could stabilize p53 protein when the two proteins are coexpressed. Plasmid expressing FLAG-p53 was cotransfected with HA-p300 into 293T cells, and p53 protein levels were determined by Western analysis 48 h post-transfection. In agreement with our previous observation, p300 appears to contribute to the accumulation of p53 as demonstrated by an increase in p53 protein levels in cells expressing p300 in comparison with the cells expressing vector control (Fig. 1 A,lane 1 versus 2). A similar result was obtained in H1299 cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and4), indicating that this effect of p300 is not cell type-specific. Consistent with the previously reported finding that p53 is a non-histone substrate of p300, immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific to acetylated p53 demonstrated p300-dependent acetylation of p53 (Fig. 1 A, panel 3). We then asked whether acetylation of p53 contributed to increased p53 levels. p300 mutant deficient in acetylase activity (p300DY) was used to test this possibility. In contrast to wild type p300, the p300DY mutant failed to acetylate p53 (Fig. 1 B, panel 3,lane 2 versus 3). However, the p53 protein levels were increased to a comparable extend in both wild type and the p300DY mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 1 B, panel 2, lane 2 versus 3), revealing an acetylation-independent nature of p53 up-regulation by p300. To further confirm this finding, p53 mutant lacking the acetylation sites (6K/R-p5) was generated. In contrast to the wild type p53 that was acetylated by p300 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 C, panel 3, lanes 1–4), no apparent acetylation was detected in the 6K/R mutant (Fig. 1 C, panel 3, lanes 5–8). However, the 6K/R mutant protein levels were induced by p300 as efficiently as those of wild type p53 (Fig.1 C, panel 2). These results lend further support to the notion that p300 increases p53 levels in an acetylase-independent manner. Up-regulation of p53 protein levels in p300-expressing cells could be attributed to either increased protein synthesis or reduced degradation. Levels of p53 mRNA were therefore determined using RT-PCR to differentiate between these two possibilities. As shown in Fig. 1 D, ectopic expression of p300 did not significantly affect the abundance of p53 mRNA when compared with control vector (Fig. 1 D, lane 2 versus 3), indicating that the accumulation of p53 protein is accomplished via post-transcriptional mechanism. Since interference with p53 nuclear export is associated with the accumulation of p53 protein (13Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), we asked whether p300 could up-regulate p53 levels by affecting subcellular distribution of p53. Vector-expressing GFP-p53 was transfected with or without HA-p300, and subcellular distribution of GFP-p53 protein was examined. When expressed alone in H1299 cells, a typical distribution pattern of p53 was observed: ∼90% of p53 localized to the nucleus, and 10% of the protein was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 E, panel 1). Significantly, when p300 was coexpressed, the nuclear population of p53 became remarkably enriched and displayed as bright nuclear aggregates (Fig. 1 E, panel 2). To quantify these results, p53 distribution in green fluorescence-positive cells was classified as “exclusive/strong nuclear” (EN/SN), “exclusive/strong cytoplasmic” (EC/SC), or “equally distributed in two compartments” (ED). 200 cells from random fields were scored for each condition. The result demonstrates that although there was no significant difference between the overall nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of p53, p300 expression was associated with a significant increase in nuclear aggregates (Fig. 1 F). A similar result was obtained with the p300DY mutant (Fig. 1 E, panel 3). Given the fact that p300 and MDM2 physically interact with each other (13Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), we asked whether complex formation between the two proteins has any impact on the function of MDM2. To this end, MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination was analyzed in the presence or absence of p300 expression. In our experimental settings, efficient MDM2-mediated p53 degradation usually requires 2–3 times more MDM2 plasmid DNA than p53. Cotransfection of p53 with less than a 2-fold amount of MDM2 is associated with ubiquitination without significant degradation of p53. We therefore used a relative ratio of 1:1 of MDM2 to p53 to assess the effect of p300 on the ability of MDM2 to ubiquitinate p53. As expected, coexpression of MDM2 resulted in ubiquitination of p53, as demonstrated by the typical ladder of p53 in the MDM2-expressing cells but not the control vector-expressing cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 1 versus 3). Interestingly, introduction of p300 into this setting was associated with a marked increase in the abundance of p53 ladder (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), suggesting an increase in E3 ligase activity of MDM2 in the presence of p300. Elevated MDM2 E3 ligase activity could be due to an increase in intrinsic enzyme activity or up-regulation of MDM2 protein levels. Anti-MDM2 immunoblot analysis revealed significantly elevated MDM2 protein levels in the p300-expressing cells when compared with cells expressing the control vector (Fig. 2 A, lane 3 versus 4), suggesting that the induced E3 ligase activity was the result of an up-regulation of MDM2 protein by p300. To confirm this observation, plasmid expressing cDNA of MDM2 was transfected along with either HA-p300 or HA-empty vector. Western analysis showed that p300 indeed caused the induction of MDM2 protein levels (Fig. 2 B, lane 1 versus 2). RT-PCR was then performed to determine whether elevated MDM2 levels in p300-expressing cells could be attributed to up-regulated transcription. As shown in Fig. 2 C, levels of MDM2 mRNA isolated from either p300-expressing or non-expressing cells are comparable, indicating that the apparent stabilization effect of p300 on MDM2 is a post-transcriptional event. Since MDM2 is an unstable protein that is degraded by the proteasome-mediated proteolysis, we asked whether p300 could affect the half-life of MDM2. To this end, half-life of MDM2 protein was determined in the presence or absence of coexpression of p300. We utilized cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis and monitored the disappearance of MDM2 by Western blot analysis in cycloheximide-treated cells. The 293T cells expressing the indicated vectors were analyzed at 0, 60, 120, and 180 min following the addition of cycloheximide. Coexpression of p300 indeed resulted in a prolonged half-life of MDM2, as demonstrated in Fig.2 D. Next, to examine whether the stabilization of MDM2 by p300 is acetylase-dependent, MDM2 levels were determined in cells expressing either wild type or DY mutant of p300. Immunoblot analysis with anti-MDM2 revealed that the acetylase activity of p300 was required for its stabilization of MDM2, as MDM2 levels were increased in cells expressing wild type, but not mutant p300 (Fig.3 A, lane 2 versus 3). An almost identical result was seen when H1299 cells were used (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–6). The acetylase-dependent stabilization suggests a possibility that p300 could directly acetylate MDM2. To test this, we arbitrarily divided MDM2 into four fragments to generate GST fusion proteins for testing in an in vitro acetylation assay in which GST-MDM2 was incubated with the purified HAT domain of p300 in the presence of 14C-labeled acetyl-CoA. Autoradiography analysis revealed that amino acids 124–246 and 370–491 of MDM2 (Fig.3 B, lanes 14 and 16), but not other regions of the molecule, were acetylated by p300. GST only (Fig.3 B, lane 2 and 10) and p53 C terminus (Fig. 3 B, lane 3 and 11) were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. p300 stabilizes p53 by retaining it in the nucleus, whereas the up-regulation of MDM2 levels by p300 would result in an increased p53 degradation. To better understand these entirely opposite effects of p300, we asked whether MDM2 presence could affect p300's ability to stabilize p53. Vectors expressing p300 and p53 were cotransfected with pCMV-MDM2 or the parental vector, and protein levels were analyzed by Western analysis 48 h post-transfection. Consistent with previous observations, p300 induced p53 accumulation when the two proteins were coexpressed (Fig.4 A, lane 4). The ability of p300 to stabilize p53, however, was abolished upon coexpression of MDM2 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and3). Since the acetylase activity of p300 is required for its stabilization of MDM2 but not for stabilization of p53, one would predict that the p300DY mutant's ability to stabilize p53 would not be affected by MDM2 expression. Results obtained using the DY mutant indeed proved that prediction to be true (Fig. 4 A,lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these data suggest that MDM2 functions as a determinant of the p300 role in the regulation of p53 stability; upon its expression, MDM2 completely abrogates the ability of p300 to stabilize p53. Additionally, it appears that MDM2 can reciprocally regulate p300 levels, as evidenced by a decrease in p300 protein in the presence of elevated MDM2 (Fig.4 A, lane 3 versus 4). The mechanism of this down-regulation of p300 by MDM2 is currently under investigation. The observation that p300 stabilizes both p53 and MDM2 implies that p300 can contribute to the maintenance of the p53/MDM2 negative regulatory feedback loop. It is therefore plausible that p300 positively regulates MDM2 expression by activating and stabilizing p53 on one hand, and yet enhances the ability of MDM2 to target p53 for degradation by increasing the stability of MDM2 on the other hand. To obtain further evidence in support of this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of p300 on p53 levels in a temperature-permissive p53-expressing cell line in which p53 is in mutant conformation at 37 °C and in wild type conformation at 32 °C. Following p300 introduction into the cells, p53 and MDM2 levels were analyzed at 37 °C or 32 °C, respectively. As expected, switching the cells from 37 °C to 32 °C was associated with the activation of p53 transcriptional activity, as evidenced by the induction of p21 and MDM2 expression (Fig. 4 B). While at non-permissive temperature the inactive p53 was efficiently stabilized in p300-expressing cells (Fig.4 C, lanes 5 and 6), the ability of the wild type p300, but not the DY mutant, to up-regulate p53 was completely abolished at 32 °C (Fig. 4C, lane 3). Correspondingly, MDM2 was not detectable at 37 °C (Fig.4 C, lanes 4–6) and induced MDM2 levels at 32 °C were further increased in the wild type p300-expressing cells but not the DY mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 4 C,lane 2 versus 3). We demonstrate here that p300 can stabilize both p53 and its negative regulator MDM2, which explains the completely opposite effects of p300 on p53 stability. MDM2 appears to play a key role in determining whether p300 exerts a positive or negative effect on p53 protein stability. In unstressed cells, where p53 levels are low and MDM2 is not induced, p300 contributes to the initial activation as well as accumulation of p53. Our previous finding that p53 induction in response to DNA damage is impaired in p300-deficient MCF-7 cells is consistent with this model (11Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Shioya H. Utsugisawa Y. Yokoyama K. Weichselbaum R. Shi Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1883-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The p53 nuclear aggregates observed in p300-expressing cells are very similar to those observed in leptomyocin B-treated cells and represent a consequence of inhibited p53 nuclear export. Since p300 does not affect mRNA levels of p53 (Fig. 1 D), the increased nuclear aggregates in p300-expressing cells likely result from a diminished nuclear export of p53, which leads to increased p53 levels. The exact mechanism of p300-mediated inhibition of p53 nuclear export is presently unknown. A recent study identified a second p53NES at the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (14Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which coincides with the p300-binding motif (3Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that binding of p300 to the p53 N terminus results in the concealment of this second p53NES, thereby abrogating its function. Further studies are needed to test this possibility. Overall, it appears when the levels of MDM2 is low, p300 acts as a positive regulator of p53. However, once MDM2 is induced, p300 is converted into a negative regulator of p53 stability. As we demonstrate in this study, p300 does so by stabilizing MDM2 and thereby augmenting its ability to target p53 for degradation. The finding that p300 promotes p53 degradation in MDM2-expressing cells is consistent with the recent report by Grossmanet al. which showed that p300 participates in the MDM2-mediated p53 degradation (10Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We, however, extend this observation further by showing that p300 exerts its negative influence on p53 stability by increasing the half-life of MDM2. Experiments conducted in cells expressing temperature-sensitive p53 mutant allowed us to recapitulate precisely the effects of p300 on p53 stability under different conditions, specifically in the presence or absence of induction of endogenous MDM2 expression. These data provided compelling evidence to demonstrate that MDM2 is the key determinant of the p300 effect on p53 stability. Our finding that MDM2 stabilization by p300 is acetylase-dependent identifies MDM2 as yet another non-histone substrate of p300, an observation consistent with recently reported results (15Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). MDM2 itself is a very unstable protein that undergoes self-ubiquitination and is degraded by the proteasome-mediated pathway. Whether MDM2 is directly acetylated by p300 in vivo and how p300 acetylase activity contributes to increased MDM2 protein stability is currently under investigation. Together with findings reported by others, our results suggest a dual function for p300 in the regulation of p53 stability. p300 seems to enhance the opposite processes in the p53/MDM2-negative regulatory feedback loop. In proliferating cells, the p53 protein is maintained at low levels via the action of the p53/MDM2 negative regulatory feedback loop, which is blocked upon exposure to stress signals that activate p53 response. p300 plays a critical role in initial activation and accumulation of p53. After the damaged DNA is repaired or severely compromised cells are removed via apoptosis, it is necessary to down-regulate p53 levels so that cells can resume DNA replication and reenter the cell cycle. p300 ensures the removal of p53 via its stabilizing effects on MDM2. In conclusion, p300 plays an important role in both p53 activation in response to stress, and also contributes to cellular recovery process.

VKD precursors are targeted to the carboxylase by their carboxylase recognition site, which in most cases is a propeptide. We have identified a second tethering site for carboxylase and VKD proteins that is required for carboxylase activity, called the vitamin K-dependent protein site of interaction (VKS). Several VKD proteins specifically bound an immobilized peptide comprising amino acids 343–355 of the human carboxylase (CVYKRSRGKSGQK) but not a scrambled peptide containing the same residues in a different order. Association with the 343–355 peptide was independent of propeptide binding, because the VKD proteins lacked the propeptide and because the 343–355 peptide did not disrupt association of a propeptide factor IX-carboxylase complex. Analysis with peptides that overlapped amino acids 343–355 indicated that the 343–345 CVY residues were necessary but not sufficient for prothrombin binding. Ionic interactions were also suggested because peptide-VKD protein binding could be disrupted by changes in ionic strength or pH. Mutagenesis of Cys343 to Ser and Tyr345 to Phe resulted in 7–11-fold decreases in vitamin K epoxidation and peptide (EEL) substrate and carboxylase carboxylation, and kinetic analysis showed 5–6-fold increases in K m values for the Glu substrate. These results suggest that Cys343 and Tyr345 are near the catalytic center and affect the active site conformation required for correct positioning of the Glu substrate. The 343–355 VKS peptide had a higher affinity for carboxylated prothrombin (K d = 5 μm) than uncarboxylated prothrombin (K d = 60 μm), and the basic VKS region may also facilitate exiting of the Gla product from the catalytic center by ionic attraction. Tethering of VKD proteins to the carboxylase via the propeptide-binding site and the VKS region has important implications for the mechanism of VKD protein carboxylation, and a model is proposed for how the carboxylase VKS region may be required for efficient and processive VKD protein carboxylation.

Most of the VKD proteins are secreted out of the cell, and carboxylation of their Gla domain confers the ability to bind phospholipid bilayers, where these proteins exert their effects. Carboxylation is thus required for the biological activity of VKD proteins, which function in hemostasis, calcium homeostasis, and growth control. In addition, a novel subset of mammalian VKD proteins with potential functions in signal transduction has recently been identified by sequence homology (3Kulman J.D. Harris J.E.

Unlike the other VKD proteins, these proteins apparently have a single-pass transmembrane domain with the extracellular domain containing the predicted carboxylated region. Inhibition of VKD protein activities forms the basis of anticoagulant therapies with warfarin and coumadin, in which the carboxylation of hemostatic VKD proteins, as well as the other VKD proteins, is reduced by limiting the supply of vitamin K cofactor to the carboxylase.Although the carboxylase was first identified in mammals, carboxylase homologs and activity have been found in fish, the fish-hunting cone snails of the genus Conus, and the fruit flyDrosophila (5Stanley T.B.

VKD proteins have not yet been isolated in Drosophila, and so the function of carboxylation in the fruit fly is not currently known.The carboxylase modifies VKD proteins by using O2 and vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) to abstract the γ-hydrogen of glutamyl residues to form a carbanion intermediate, which then incorporates CO2 via nucleophilic attack to form the Gla (1Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berkner K.L. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1877-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). During each Glu to Gla conversion, one molecule of KH2 is oxidized to vitamin K epoxide, and the carboxylase is also an epoxidase. Insights into the molecular mechanism for this reaction have only recently been revealed. Early studies with thiol-specific inhibitors implicated Cys residues as part of the carboxylase active site (16Canfield L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Chemical modeling based on those studies led to a proposed base strength amplification mechanism where a weak base (thiolate) initiates KH2 oxygenation to generate a strong base that can abstract the γ-hydrogen of Glu to form the carbanion intermediate (17Dowd P. Hershline R. Ham S.W. Naganathan S. Science. 1995; 269: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We determined that two Cys residues in the carboxylase, Cys99 and Cys450, were modified byN-ethylmaleimide, a thiol-specific inhibitor that inactivated both carboxylation and epoxidation (18Pudota B.N.

Individual mutation of each Cys residue to a Ser greatly reduced both carboxylation and epoxidation, and kinetic analysis suggested that the Glu substrate coordinates at least one Cys residue and KH2in a complex required to initiate oxygenation of KH2(18Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Multiple Glu residues are carboxylated in VKD proteins, with as many as 12 Glus converted to Glas per molecule (in human factor IX (fIX)) (1Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,2Berkner K.L. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1877-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Carboxylation occurs through a processive mechanism in which the multiple Glu to Gla conversions all result from a single binding event between VKD protein and carboxylase (19Stenina O. Pudota B.N. McNally B.A. Hommema E.L. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10301-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Morris D.P. Stevens R.D. Wright D.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30491-30498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One of those studies (19Stenina O. Pudota B.N. McNally B.A. Hommema E.L. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10301-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) also indicated that there is a driving force for VKD protein carboxylation, which is likely based on the ability of the carboxylase to distinguish Glus from Glas. However, how such a distinction is accomplished is not known.Processivity is mediated by the binding of VKD proteins to the carboxylase through a carboxylase recognition sequence (CRS) in VKD proteins that tethers them to the carboxylase throughout the reaction. This sequence is immediately adjacent to the Gla domain where modification occurs. In most instances, VKD proteins are synthesized as precursor proteins where the CRS is a propeptide that is cleaved in the Golgi subsequent to carboxylation, and the CRS is frequently referred to as the propeptide (1Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berkner K.L. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1877-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This sequence confers high affinity binding; covalent attachment to small peptides derived from the Gla domain reduces the K m values of such peptides by 103–104-fold, from the mm to the μm range (1Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three nearly invariant residues in the propeptide have been shown to be important for carboxylase recognition. Other residues clearly affect binding, however, because propeptides with these three residues exhibit up to a 100-fold difference in affinities (21Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To date, the propeptide-binding site is the only known tethering point between the carboxylase and its substrate protein.The propeptide-binding site, like most functional regions of the carboxylase, has not been identified. Biochemical mapping of the carboxylase has been difficult because the carboxylase is a large (95 kDa) integral membrane protein that is purified in a micelle. Consequently, most structural information has been low in resolution. In two conflicting reports, cross-linking studies mapped the propeptide-binding site to either amino acids 50–225 (22Yamada M. Kuliopulos A. Nelson N.P. Roth D.A. Furie B. Furie B.C. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or ∼349–500 (23Wu S.M. Mutucumarana V.P. Geromanos S. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11718-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because of the difficulties in biochemical mapping, alternative approaches for analyzing carboxylase structure function have been pursued. Two human genetic variants with phenotypic consequences have been identified (24Brenner B. Sanchez-Vega B. Wu S.M. Lanir N. Stafford D.W. Solera J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Spronk H.M. Farah R.A. Buchanan G.R. Vermeer C. Soute B.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 3650-3652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the low number detected is not surprising given the broad range of VKD protein-mediated functions affected by the carboxylase. Mutagenesis studies have also identified potentially important carboxylase residues whose alterations affect activity (26Sugiura I. Furie B. Walsh C.T. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17837-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Shimizu A. Sugiura I. Matsushita T. Kojima T. Hirai M. Saito H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); however, to date there has been no independent confirmation by biochemical mapping to support their functional significance. Thus, high resolution biochemical information has been limiting but is essential for elucidating the structural basis for the carboxylase mechanism.We discovered a region of the human carboxylase, amino acids 343–355, that binds VKD proteins with high affinity. This region binds VKD proteins that lack the CRS/propeptide, showing that it defines a new tethering site on the carboxylase distinct from the CRS/propeptide-binding site. Biochemical identification of 8 amino acids within this site that are required for VKD protein binding and subsequent mutational analysis showed that this region is important for carboxylation and epoxidation. A new site of interaction likely affects the efficiency of protein carboxylation. Results showing that this region has a higher affinity for carboxylated than uncarboxylated VKD protein and the previous processivity studies showing that the VKD protein remains tethered to the carboxylase throughout the reaction to become multiply and fully carboxylated (19Stenina O. Pudota B.N. McNally B.A. Hommema E.L. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10301-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggest that this region facilitates the driving force that accomplishes processive, comprehensive carboxylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCarboxylase-derived PeptidesPeptide synthesis, HPLC purification, and structure verification by mass spectrometry were performed by the Lerner Research Institute Molecular Biotechnology Core as described at www.lerner.ccf.org/services/molecbiotech/peptide.html.Binding Assay for VKD Protein-Carboxylase Peptide InteractionColumn Chromatography AssayPeptides derived from the carboxylase were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a final concentration of 500 μm. Mixtures of prothrombin (PT) (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and BSA (Pierce), both at 1 μm in a volume of 10 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) were passed over 2-ml peptide columns. The columns were rinsed with 20 ml of buffer A, then rinsed with 20 ml buffer A lacking Nonidet P-40, and then eluted with 2 ml of 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 2.5, followed by neutralization of the eluant with 1.5m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Aliquots corresponding to 1% of the starting sample, flow through, and eluant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. A similar assay was also performed with fIX (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and ovalbumin (Sigma), except that loading concentrations of 0.2 μm were used.Human or rabbit serum was also chromatographed on carboxylase-derived peptide columns as above. The eluants were analyzed in a Western blot using affinity-purified polyclonal Abs against fIX (28Lingenfelter S.E. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8234-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), protein C (29Berkner K.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 450-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), factor X (American Diagnostica), or PT. The anti-PT Ab was rabbit Ab against human PT and was affinity-purified using a PT-Sepharose column (5 ml, 2 mg/ml PT). All Abs were used at 0.2 μg/ml, and detection was by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Determination of the KdHuman PT (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and a carboxylase-derived peptide (343–355 of the human carboxylase) that had a biotin group at the C terminus were incubated for 1 h at 21 °C in 120 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The concentrations of PT and VKS peptide varied from 2 to 20 μm, and duplicate samples were analyzed at each concentration. The samples (100 μl) were then chromatographed on 2-ml G-75 Sephadex columns, and 100-μl fractions were collected to separate free from PT-bound peptide. Preliminary experiments indicated that the PT-peptide complex did not dissociate during the time frame of the chromatography (∼2 min). Initial experiments also verified that the void volume, which contained PT and the PT-peptide complex, was well separated from free peptide.The amounts of PT and 343–355 peptide in the void volume were quantitated by PT and carboxylase peptide (343) ELISAs. For the PT ELISA, the samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl to disrupt PT-peptide binding. A monoclonal anti-PT Ab (Biodesign International) was used for antigen capture, and detection was with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-PT Ab. Pure human PT was used for the standard curve (0.03–0.9 nm). The carboxylase peptide (343) ELISA used Neutravidin plates (Pierce; capacity, 25 pmol biotin/well) to capture the biotinylated peptide and polyclonal anti-peptide Ab for detection. The anti-peptide Ab was against the human 343–355 peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemacyanin and was generated in rabbits. The antiserum was chromatographed on a 5-ml 343–355 peptide column (2 mg/ml, coupled to Sepharose) and then on a protein A-Sepharose column (5 ml; Sigma) to generate a homogeneous preparation of Ab as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. A standard curve of biotinylated peptide (5–40 nm) was used for quantitation.Assay for Propeptide fIX-Carboxylase Complex DissociationThe propeptide fIX-carboxylase complex was isolated from a BHK cell line (cultured without vitamin K) expressing recombinant human fIX and recombinant human carboxylase (30Berkner K.L. Pudota B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and tested for stability in the presence of various peptides. Solubilized microsomes from the recombinant human fIX, recombinant human carboxylase BHK cell line (1 ml, 2 mg/ml protein and 5 × 106 cpm/hr of carboxylase peptide activity) were incubated with anti-fIX Ab resin (300 μl, 5 μg/μl of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-fIX Ab) overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed six times at 4 °C with 1 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.25% CHAPS, 0.25% phosphatidyl choline, and 5 mmdithiothreitol) by gently rocking the resin in buffer B and then centrifuging for 1 min at 1000 × g to remove the supernatant. After the last wash, the resin was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B, and the slurry was divided into aliquots (100 μl). Equal volumes (100 μl) of various peptides, which are described under “Results,” were then added (each at a final concentration of 100 μm). The samples were rocked overnight at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was assayed for peptide carboxylation activity.Construction of Carboxylase MutantsThe C343S, Y345F, and K346A/R347A carboxylase mutants were each generated using 10 overlapping oligonucleotides that replaced the 145-base pair MscI-MscI fragment of pGC2 (a pUC118 plasmid bearing the 3′ EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the carboxylase cDNA (18Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The C343S mutation changed the TGT codon to TCC, the Y345F mutation changed the TAT codon to TTC, and the K346A/R347A mutation changed the AAG·AGG codons to GCT·GCG. A silent mutation, G1043T, was also introduced into each mutant to create a new HindIII site that facilitated screening for positive clones. All of the mutants were confirmed by double-strand DNA sequencing, and the EcoRI-BstBI fragment (bases 954–2196 of the sequence in GenBankTM accession numberM81592) bearing these mutations was used to replace the corresponding wild type sequence in a plasmid containing full-length wild type carboxylase in a pBakPAK1vector (CLONTECH) (18Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Construction of Carboxylase-expressing BaculovirusPlasmids bearing carboxylase cDNAs in pBacPAK1 (500 ng) were cotransfected with 100 ng of Bsu36I-digested viral DNA (BacPAK6, CLONTECH) using Lipofectin on SF21 cells. Individual plaques (6–10 for each mutant) were isolated and analyzed by preparing SF-21-infected cell lysates that were screened for carboxylase peptide activity, as previously described (31Berkner K.L. McNally B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 313-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Representative viruses for each mutant were then scaled up, and microsomes were prepared, as described (18Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Carboxylase Activity AssaysCarboxylase peptide activity in solubilized microsomes from baculovirus-infected insect cells (10–50 μl, 2 mg/ml) was measured in a 150-μl reaction mixture, as described (30Berkner K.L. Pudota B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of microsomes, then incubated for 15 min at 21 °C, and terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (1 ml, 10%), followed by boiling and counting 14C cpm as previously described (31Berkner K.L. McNally B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 313-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The epoxidase assay was carried out in the same manner except that 2.5 mm cold NaHCO3 was used, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol:hexane (3:2 v/v). Samples were processed for HPLC analysis as described (18Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using a vitamin K epoxide standard (provided by Dr. James Sadowski and quantitated by absorbance). In experiments that compared the carboxylase and epoxidase activities of carboxylase mutants, the assays were performed on the same day using aliquots of the same microsomal sample.To measure the effect of varying cofactor and substrate concentrations on enzyme activity, solubilized microsomes (50 μl) were incubated in a 200-μl reaction mixture (30Berkner K.L. Pudota B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in a 15-min assay initiated by the addition of microsomes. The K m for CO2was determined by varying the [14C]NaHCO3concentration from 0.3 to 2 mm in the presence of 2 mm EEL and 150 μm KH2. TheK m for KH2 was determined by varying the KH2 concentration from 4 to 60 μm in the presence of 3 mm EEL and 2.4 mm[14C]NaHCO3. The K m for EEL was determined by varying the EEL concentration from 0.05 to 0.7 mm (wild type enzyme) or 0.3 to 3.5 mm (C343S and Y345F enzymes) in the presence of 150 μmKH2 and 2.4 mm[14C]NaHCO3. In all cases, eight different concentrations were tested in duplicate.Carboxylase carboxylation was assayed using the same reaction mixture as in the peptide assay (30Berkner K.L. Pudota B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), except that EEL was omitted. The reaction was initiated by the addition of solubilized microsomes (25 μl) to reaction mixture (50 μl), and aliquots at 30 s and 1 min were taken and quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading dye. The samples were electrophoresed on an 8% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel along with a [14C]BSA standard curve. The [14C]BSA used was first chromatographed on a G-75 Sephadex column to remove any unincorporated radioactivity. After electrophoresis, the gel was rinsed in destain (5% acetic acid, 40% methanol), then dried, and exposed for 1 month using a 14C-sensitive PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). The rate of carboxylase carboxylation was calculated by measuring the amount of 14CO2incorporation into the carboxylase, and the activities were normalized to the relative amounts of carboxylase protein as determined by a quantitative Western blot.Quantitative Western Blot AnalysisCarboxylase levels in solubilized microsomes were quantitated using fluorescence-based Western blot analysis, as described (18Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, several aliquots corresponding to ∼10–100 ng of carboxylase were coelectrophoresed with the same amount of pure human carboxylase on SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using affinity-purified, anti-C-terminal human carboxylase anti-peptide Ab (1 μg/ml) (18Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ab (ECF;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitation on a Storm Imager (Molecular Dynamics).Preparation of Uncarboxylated PTA human PT cDNA, provided by Dr. Sandra Friezner-Degen (32Degen S.J. MacGillivray R.T. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the ZEM229 vector (33Busby S.J. Mulvihill E. Rao D. Kumar A.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15286-15292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and BHK cell lines stably expressing PT were generated by transfection and selection for resistance to dihydrofolate reductase. To prepare uncarboxylated PT, a clonal isolate was cultured in the absence of vitamin K. Secreted protein was purified using anti-human PT Ab, affinity-purified and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. The preparation was shown to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and the secreted PT did not contain detectable propeptide, as determined by N-terminal sequence analysis (data not shown).Uncarboxylated PT was also generated by heat decarboxylation (34Price P.A. Nelson C. Williamson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) of pure plasma PT. PT (3.5 mg, Enzyme Research Laboratories) was dialyzed against 0.1 m NH4HCO3 pH 8.0, and then lyophilized to dryness. The sample was heated at 110 °C for 5 h under nitrogen, then resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and dialyzed against the same solution. The sample was quantitated alongside the initial carboxylated PT in a protein assay (BCA, Pierce), and SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining showed that the heat-decarboxylated PT was fully intact. Gla quantitation (29Berkner K.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 450-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used to verify decarboxylation and showed that the number of Glas/molecule was reduced from 10 (starting PT) to 2 (heat-decarboxylated PT).

Mutations leading to increased expression of these enzymes are a common cause of resistance to many cephalosporins including extended spectrum cephalosporins. Recent reports of plasmid- and integrin-encoded class C β-lactamases are a cause for concern because these enzymes are likely to spread horizontally to susceptible strains. Because of their increasing clinical significance, it is critical to identify the determinants of catalysis and substrate specificity of these enzymes. For this purpose, the codons of a set of 21 amino acid residues that encompass the active site region of the P99 β-lactamase were individually randomized to create libraries containing all possible amino acid substitutions. The amino acid sequence requirements for the hydrolysis of ceftazidime, an extended spectrum cephalosporin commonly used to treat serious infections, were determined by selecting resistant mutants from each of the 21 libraries. DNA sequencing identified the residue positions that are critical for ceftazidime hydrolysis. In addition, it was found that certain amino acid substitutions in the ω-loop region of the P99 enzyme result in increased ceftazidime hydrolysis suggesting the loop is an important determinant of substrate specificity.

These antibiotics act by inhibiting transpeptidase enzymes (also called penicillin-binding proteins or PBPs1) that are essential for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall (1Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frere J.-M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis results in death of growing bacteria and accounts for the antimicrobial effect of β-lactam antibiotics. In response, bacteria have evolved defense mechanisms to resist the lethal effects of these drugs (2Davies J. Science. 1994; 264: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Due to widespread β-lactam antimicrobial use, bacterial resistance has increased and now represents a serious threat to human health (3Tenover F.C. Hughes J.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 275: 300-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most common mechanism of bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is the synthesis of β-lactamases that cleave the amide bond in the β-lactam ring to generate ineffective products (4Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). Based on primary amino acid sequence homology, β-lactamases have been grouped into four classes. Classes A, C, and D are active site serine enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the β-lactam antibiotic via a serine-bound acyl intermediate (5Ghuysen J.-M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Class B enzymes require zinc for activity, and catalysis does not proceed via a covalent intermediate (6Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The active site serine β-lactamases belong to a larger family of penicillin-recognizing enzymes that includes the PBPs that cross-link bacterial cell walls (7Massova I. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes contain the active site serine as well as a conserved triad of K(S/T)G located between the active site serine and the C terminus (7Massova I. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). X-ray structure analysis of several class A enzymes, three class C enzymes, and two PBPs indicates that these enzymes have a similar three-dimensional structure, particularly around the active site, suggesting a common evolutionary origin for the penicillin-recognizing enzymes (1Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frere J.-M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The structures of several class B enzymes confirm the lack of similarity with the serine β-lactamases and PBPs and indicate an independent evolutionary origin for these enzymes (8Carfi A. Pares S.

Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Class C β-lactamases (also named AmpC) are most commonly encoded on the chromosome of Gram-negative bacterial species and are inducible (4Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). Derepression of the gene leads to class C enzyme production and resistance to most cephalosporins, including extended spectrum cephalosporins commonly used to treat serious infections (4Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). The high level of resistance to cephalosporins is due to the fact that class C β-lactamases hydrolyze cephalosporins very efficiently (12Bulychev A. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1743-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the class A enzymes, class C enzymes are not inhibited by the mechanism-based inhibitor clavulanic acid (4Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). In recent years, plasmid-encoded class C β-lactamases have been identified in several Gram-negative species (13Marchese A. Arlet G. Schito G.C. Lagrange P.H. Philippon A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 464-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Horii T. Arakawa Y. Ohta M. Ichiyama S. Wacharotayankun R. Kato N. Antimicrob.

The increase in clinical importance of class C enzymes, and their ability to hydrolyze extended spectrum cephalosporins and α-methoxy-β-lactams such as cefoxitin, has lead to an increased interest in the structure and function of these enzymes. The three-dimensional structures of the class C enzymes fromCitrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae P99, and Escherichia coli have been determined (16Usher K.C. Blaszczak L.C. Weston G.S.

A. 1993; 90: 11257-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As described above, the class A and class C enzymes have a similar fold and contain conserved amino acids that act similarly in catalysis (18Lobkovsky E. Moews P.C. Liu H. Zhao H. Frere J.-M. Knox J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11257-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, there are also many differences in the active sites, and importantly, the molecular basis responsible for the differences in substrate specificity between the classes has not been resolved. Therefore, it is of interest to identify the determinants of substrate hydrolysis for a number of β-lactam antibiotics. We present the results of analysis of the determinants of substrate hydrolysis of the P99 β-lactamase for the clinically important antibiotic ceftazidime. Chloramphenicol and cephaloridine were purchased from Sigma. Ceftazidime was a gift from Glaxo Wellcome. All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs except for T7 DNA polymerase, which was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotide primers were custom-synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. E-test strips for antibiotic susceptibility testing were purchased from AB Biodisc. SP-Sepharose and G-75 gel filtration columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The plasmid pGR32 was constructed previously (19Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains a chloramphenicol resistance gene as well as a polylinker region for cloning heterologous genes. Heterologous genes are expressed under the control of atac promoter (20Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). E. coli XL1-Blue (recA1, endA1, gyrA96,thi-1, hsdR17, supE44,relA1, lac,(F9 proAB lacI qlacZDM15,Tn10 (tetr))) (Stratagene, Inc.) was used for construction and selection of the libraries (21Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar).E. coli RB791 (strain W3110 lacI q L8) was used to express and purify β-lactamase mutants (20Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A construct containing the wild-type P99 gene was cloned into the pGR32 plasmid as anSacI-XbaI DNA fragment using the P99-top and P99-bot primers used for the random library constructions described below. The template used for the original PCR was the plasmid pHU354, which contains the wild type P99 gene and was provided by A. Dubus (22Galleni M. Lindberg F. Normark S. Cole S. Honore N. Joris B. Frere J. Biochemistry. 1988; 250: 753-760Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid construct was named pYY12. The pYY12 plasmid was used as template for all library constructions. Individual codons of the E. cloacae P99 β-lactamase gene were randomized by overlap extension PCR as described previously (23Huang W. Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14984-14988Google Scholar). The two outside primers, P99-top 5′-CCGCGCGAGCTCCGTTTGTCAGGCACAGTCAAATC-3′ and P99-bot 5′-CCCCCCTCTAGACCCGGCAATGTTTTACTGTAGCG-3′, were used in conjunction with overlapping primers that were designed to randomize individual codons to create a PCR product containing the P99 gene with a randomized codon. The PCR fragment was digested with theXbaI and SacI restriction enzymes and ligated into the pGR32 vector that had been digested with XbaI andSacI (19Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ligation reaction was electroporated intoE. coli XL1-Blue cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and spread on LB agar plates containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol (LB-CMP). The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the colonies then were pooled and stored at −80 °C in 15% glycerol. Each library consisted of a minimum of 10,000 pooled colonies. Therefore, each library has a greater than 99% probability of containing all possible sequences for the codon randomized (24Palzkill T. Botstein D. Proteins. 1992; 14: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells from each library were diluted into LB medium and spread on LB agar plates containing 0.5 μg/ml ceftazidime (LB-CAZ). The selections were performed in the absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside so that the β-lactamase gene was expressed at the low, constitutive levels of thetac promoter (20Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). As a control, the library was also spread on LB-CMP plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The colonies were counted, and the P99 gene was amplified from 20 clones by colony PCR. The clones were sequenced directly from the PCR product by cycle DNA sequencing. The sequences were determined using an ABI 377 automated DNA sequencing instrument. The MIC for ceftazidime was determined for each of the clones that were selected for DNA sequencing. The clones were inoculated into 5 ml of LB containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture was grown at 37 °C overnight and diluted to an A 600of 0.3. A total of 100 μl of each diluted culture was spread on an LB agar plate. The plates were allowed to dry and then an E-test strip embedded with ceftazidime was applied. The MIC was read after overnight incubation at 37 °C. An E. coli strain containing the wild-type P99 gene was used as a control for all MIC measurements. The wild type P99 enzyme as well as mutant derivatives were expressed and purified for the determination of kinetic parameters. The pYY12 plasmid described above was transformed into E. coli RB791 cells for large scale expression (20Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A 1-liter culture was grown at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.5 and then induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was then incubated overnight at 25 °C with shaking. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of sucrose buffer. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 2 times 2 liters of 25 mm MES (pH 6.2). The protein lysate was fractionated on an SP-Sepharose column and eluted with a 0.5 m NaCl gradient. The enzyme was further purified using a G-75 gel filtration column in 25 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The purity of the final preparation was higher than 90% based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enzyme kinetics measurements were carried out using a Beckman DU-40 UV spectrophotometer as described previously (26Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29144-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A reaction mixture containing the antibiotic substrate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in a total volume of 0.5 ml. A total of 5 μl of a β-lactamase stock solution was added, and the initial reaction velocity was measured by the change in UV absorbance. For ceftazidime, the initial reaction velocity was calculated from the first 5 min of the reaction because ceftazidime is a poor substrate. Cephalosporin C hydrolysis was monitored at 280 nm, whereas ceftazidime hydrolysis was measured at 260 nm. The change in the extinction coefficient of cephalosporin C and ceftazidime are 2390 and 8660 m−1cm−1, respectively. The k cat andK m values were calculated from the initial velocity data using non-linear regression fit. The β-lactamase sequences used for the alignment to generate the data for Fig. 5 were chosen such that none of the sequences had 90% or greater identity to any other sequence in the alignment. The sequences, the GenBankTM accession number, and if available, the reference number are as follows: P99 (X07274) (22Galleni M. Lindberg F. Normark S. Cole S. Honore N. Joris B. Frere J.

The alignment was generated using the pile-up program of the Wisconsin Package version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI. As described above, derepression of class C β-lactamase synthesis is a widespread source of resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to extended spectrum cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Because of the significant role of P99 and highly related class C β-lactamases in antibiotic resistance, it is of interest to understand how the amino acid sequence of the enzyme determines its structure and activity. For this reason, we determined the amino acid sequence requirements for the hydrolysis of ceftazidime for a set of 21 residues that encompass the active site and substrate-binding pocket of the P99 β-lactamase (Fig.1). Although the 21 residues under study are all in the vicinity of the active site, not all of these residues are likely to contribute equally to the structure and function of the enzyme. Some residue positions are likely to be essential, and therefore substitutions at these positions will result in a non-functional enzyme. However, other residue positions may be less important, and thus substitutions at these positions will be more freely tolerated. The location of essential residues identifies those positions in the amino acid sequence that are the most important determinants of P99 β-lactamase structure and activity. The tolerance of each residue to amino acid substitutions was determined using saturation mutagenesis followed by a functional selection for active mutants (24Palzkill T. Botstein D. Proteins. 1992; 14: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The strategy consists of randomizing the DNA sequence of a single codon to create a random library containing all possible amino acid substitutions for the position randomized. The active site region of the enzyme was randomized in a set of 21 random libraries (Fig. 1). Each of the 21 random libraries was used to transform E. coli, and functional mutants were selected by spreading the transformed cells on agar plates containing 0.5 μg/ml ceftazidime. This is the maximal concentration on which E. coli containing the wild-type P99 gene on the plasmid used to construct the random libraries can grow on agar plates after transformation. Thus, phenotypically wild-type mutants were selected from each of the libraries. It should be noted that this concentration is not the same as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ceftazidime of an E. coli strain containing the wild-type P99 gene, which is 3 μg/ml as determined using E-test strips (Table I; see under “Experimental Procedures”). The difference is most likely due to an inoculum effect whereby fewer plasmid-containing cells are spread on agar plates after transformation than in the E-test strip experiment. The DNA sequence of at least 10 functional mutants selected from each library was determined (Fig. 2). In addition, to confirm that the selected mutants exhibited resistance levels similar to wild type, the minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for each non-wild-type mutant that was sequenced (Table I). The ceftazidime MIC values of the mutants ranged from ∼6-fold less (0.5 μg/ml) to 21-fold (64 μg/ml) greater than the MIC of E. coli containing wild-type P99. Furthermore, the average MIC for all of the mutants was found to be ∼2-fold greater (6.75 μg/ml) than wild type. Therefore, the selection for ceftazidime resistance on agar plates is stringent enough to identify mutants with phenotypically wild-type activity.Table IMinimum inhibitory concentrations for β-lactamase mutantsβ-LactamaseCAZμg/mlWild-type P993.0L119V2.0L119N4.0L119I4.0L119M3.0Q120K12.0Q120R3.0Q120H1.0R204L4.0R204F6.0R204Y4.0R204V8.0R204S6.0D217S6.0D217G8.0D217E8.0A220S3.0A220F4.0A220L3.0A220R1.5A220W1.5Y221A64.0Y221K3.0Y221G24.0Y221W2.0Y221N6.0S289T6.0S289G6.0S289Y6.0S289V6.0L293P0.5L293E4.0L293V8.0L293C3.0L293I8.0L293S8.0L293D4.0T319L0.5T319M0.5S343T6.0S343A3.0S343R1.0S343N3.0N346I20.0N346A4.0N346V16.0R349K6.0 Open table in a new tab In addition to the clones selected for ceftazidime resistance, several colonies were sequenced from the naive library that had not been selected on a β-lactam antibiotic. This control was performed to ensure that the appropriate codons were mutagenized in the starting libraries. At least eight clones from each library were sequenced, and the results are presented in Fig. 2. Although eight clones is too few to rigorously prove that the libraries are completely random, it is enough to demonstrate that the correct codon was mutagenized and that a diverse collection of mutants are represented in each starting library. The naive library sequences are also informative when compared with the sequences from the clones selected for ceftazidime resistance. For example, sequencing of the Glu272 naive library revealed a diverse collection of sequences (Fig. 2). After selection for ceftazidime resistance, however, only glutamate codons were present among the sequenced clones. This strongly suggests that glutamate is the only amino acid capable of providing wild-type levels of function at position 272. Based on this result, Glu272 is interpreted to be essential for the structure and function of the enzyme. Note, however, that this result does not indicate whether Glu272 is essential for substrate binding and catalysis. It is possible, for instance, that the glutamate residue is essential for the structural integrity of the enzyme. In contrast to residue Glu272, a diverse set of amino acids was found at position Leu293 both before and after the selection for ceftazidime resistance. This result suggests Leu293 is not critical for the structure and function of the enzyme. Note that the Arg349 library appears from the sequencing of the unselected clones to be biased toward the wild-type arginine codon (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, useful information could still be obtained about this position due to the different spectrum of substitutions among the ceftazidime-selected clones. Despite the bias toward arginine in the starting library, the lack of lysine in the starting library combined with the multiple occurrences of lysine in the selected library indicates that a positive charge is important at position 349 (Fig. 2). The sequencing results from the naive and ceftazidime-selected libraries were used to place the 21 mutagenized positions into four classes (Fig. 1). First, a position is considered as essential if all of the sequences of clones selected for ceftazidime resistance are the wild-type amino acids. Second, the position is considered as wild-type predominant if the majority of the selected clones have the wild-type sequences but some conservative substitutions are also found. Third, the position is classified as non-wild-type predominant if the sequences of the selected clones are strongly biased toward a non-wild-type amino acid. Finally, a position is considered unimportant if there is not a strong bias toward any amino acid among the selected clones. In total, nine positions were found to contain only the wild-type amino acid after selection and are essential for hydrolysis of ceftazidime by the P99 enzyme. These positions include residues Ser64, Lys67, Tyr150, Asn152, and Lys315, which are believed to be involved in catalysis based on previous mutagenesis and x-ray crystallographic studies (18Lobkovsky E.

These residues reside on the β-strand that composes a wall of the active site pocket of the P99 enzyme (18Lobkovsky E. Moews P.C. Liu H. Zhao H. Frere J.-M. Knox J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11257-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The Thr316side chain hydroxyl group may interact with the free carboxyl group of β-lactam antibiotics either directly or through a bridging water molecule (44Patera A. Blasczak L.C. Shoichet B.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 10504-10512Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 45Dubus A. Wilkin J.-M. Raquet X. Normark S. Frere J.-M. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous mutagenesis results suggest that the proposed interaction is most important for binding and hydrolysis of cephalosporin antibiotics (45Dubus A. Wilkin J.-M. Raquet X. Normark S. Frere J.-M. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The finding that Thr316 is essential for hydrolysis of the cephalosporin ceftazidime is consistent with the previous result. It is unclear, however, why a serine residue does not function at this position. The strict conservation of glycine among functional mutants at position 317 is explained by the fact that any other residue at this position would, for steric reasons, interfere with the binding of substrate (18Lobkovsky E. Moews P.C. Liu H. Zhao H. Frere J.-M. Knox J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11257-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A similar result was obtained after randomization and functional selection of the analogous residue in the class A TEM-1 β-lactamase (25Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The main chain amide nitrogen of Ser318 forms the putative “oxyanion” hole of class C β-lactamases (16Usher K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2005803418,"Very little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the findings that binding of nuclear receptors (NR) to some promoter elements leads to transcriptional activation, whereas binding to others leads to repression. Case in point is the group of epidermal keratin genes and their DNA sequences responsible for repression by NR. Keratin response elements (KREs) interact with receptors for retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and glucocorticoids. KREs, by their structure and sequence, direct the binding of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone as homodimers and glucocorticoids as monomers. Such specific DNA-receptor interactions are crucial for the repression signal of transcription. In this paper we have analyzed the interactions between the KREs and NR that lead to such repression. We have found that KREs are promoter-independent. They not only provide a docking platform for the receptors, but also play a key role in directing the receptors to bind into particular configurations and coordinating the interactions among different receptors. Both an intact KRE and an intact receptor DNA-binding domain are necessary for the regulation to occur, which emphasizes the importance of interaction between the DNA and NR for proper signaling. Furthermore, KREs allow simultaneous binding of multiple receptors, thus providing fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation. The DNA/DNA-binding domain interactions in keratin promoters exemplify tissue and gene specificity of hormone action.

GC, similar to thyroid hormone and retinoids, mediate their effect through nuclear receptors (NR) that regulate the transcription of specific genes. NR constitute a large family of transcription factors that act by binding to specific sequences, response elements (RE), in the regulated genes (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

Once bound to the DNA, the receptors interact with co-regulators and the transcriptional machinery to regulate transcription (6McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

These studies led to the current dogma that heterodimers of T3R and RAR with RXR are the functional protein complexes involved in gene regulation. Indeed, very few exceptions to this rule have been found. The complex TRE in theTSH gene contains a palindrome that activates and an independent half-site that mediates binding of a monomer of T3R and repression of transcription (11Carr F.E. Wong N.C. J.

Similarly the TRE inthyrotropin-releasing hormone andapolipoprotein A1 genes contains a complex element that involves the T3R monomer and a T3R-RXR heterodimer (13Taylor A.H. Wishart P. Lawless D.E.

Furthermore, formation of a monomer + homodimer of GR was found to inhibit transcription of the POMC gene (15Drouin J. Sun Y.L. Chamberland M. Gauthier Y. De Lean A. Nemer M. Schmidt T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the sequence of a given RE and the context of the promoter region in which the RE is located play important roles in GR regulation and interactions with AP1 transcription factors (16Pearce D.

Keratin response elements (KREs), which we have identified in a family of epidermal keratin genes, also constitute exceptions to the dimerization rules. KREs mediate repression of K5, K14, K6, K16, and K17 keratin genes by binding of homodimers of RAR and T3R in addition to monomers of GR (17Tomic-Canic M. Day D. Samuels H.H. Freedberg I.M.

Minars T.J. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 566-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). KREs have a similar structure, with clusters of sites providing a number of possible combinations for binding of NR. Additionally, we have identified the “signature” sequences in the acidic keratin and basic keratin gene families (19Radoja N. Diaz D.V. Minars T.J. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 566-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Signature sequences are highly conserved clusters (over 90% identical) of binding sites found within the acidic keratin and basic keratin gene group. Interestingly, they are found only in the group of keratin genes that are regulated by all three receptors: RAR, T3R, and GR, but not in the keratin or other epidermal genes that are regulated only by RAR or GR (19Radoja N.

Sci. 27,192–205.In this paper we analyze the molecular function of such specific, complex response elements that mediate repression of transcription in a selected group of genes. We found that KREs are promoter independent. We also found that KREs, by positioning a receptor in a particular configuration, form a signal for repression. This does not arise from blocking or displacing an activator. Both an intact KRE and a receptor's DBD are necessary for repression. Furthermore, KREs allow simultaneous binding of at least two receptors (T3R and GR), and T3R dominates over GR in transcriptional regulation. Therefore, the role of KREs is to instruct the receptors to bind in a specific configuration and to create a relative order of binding among the receptors. This means that in addition to interacting with NRs in a very specific manner, KREs introduce a new level of transcriptional regulation allowing simultaneous interplay of multiple receptors.DISCUSSIONIn this study we show that the molecular function of the complex response elements in keratin genes (KREs) is to determine a specific configuration of the bound receptors and cause them to repress transcription. This means that the KREs create the message of repression by instructing the receptors how to bind. In addition, KREs, by providing simultaneous binding and interaction of multiple receptors create a hierarchy among the receptors, a new level of transcriptional regulation. KREs serve as an excellent example of sequences customized to select for specific receptor configuration, and to allow simultaneous receptor binding to provide a gradient of hormone action. We found that the KREs function independently of the promoter context and that sequence of the KREs and receptors DBD are necessary for the regulation to occur.The concept of DNA as a regulator of transcriptional signal is not novel (for review, see Refs. 33Guido E.C. Delorme E.O. Clemm D.L. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Miner J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1178-1190PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R.

For example, studies by Lefstin and Yamamoto included a variety of positive GREs and suggested that REs may act as “ligands for regulators” (34Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that in the case of KREs, DNA creates a signal to shut down the transcription of its own promoter, i.e. the DNA acts as an “antagonist” for the receptor. However, KREs do even more than that. They allow the interplay of multiple nuclear receptors, thus creating a gradient of hormonal action. The sequences of KREs, supplying the signal for repression, allow three receptors with their respective ligands to respond to a large variety of physiological conditions under which the repression of keratin genes is required. This is extremely important in the epidermis because it is a target tissue that is exposed to and depends on complex hormonal regulation. The purpose of the receptor interplay is to provide the fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation of keratin genes in a large variety of physiological and pathological conditions.The hierarchy in receptor regulation of keratin genes is the following: RAR dominates over T3R (17Tomic-Canic M. Day D. Samuels H.H. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and T3R dominates over GR, although both receptors can simultaneously bind to the KRE. The footprinting results with these receptors on KRE suggest such a hierarchy. The RAR footprint is the largest, dominating the space and occupying almost the entire KRE, whereas the T3R, although overlapping, occupies a much smaller segment. Furthermore, GR binds as four monomer units and all four must be bound for regulation to occur. Therefore, one can envision multiple regulatory levels that are being introduced. The first is the concentration of the hormones that reach and are produced in epidermis (36Randolph R.K. Simon M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1374-1383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Slominski A. Gomez-Sanchez C.E. Foecking M.F. Wortsman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For example, if there is a high concentration of RA in the epidermis, the differentiation process is inhibited and keratinocytes become “basal-like” by changing their phenotype and keratin gene expression pattern (1Fisher C. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 284-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the simultaneous presence of two hormones multiply the possibilities of regulatory patterns. For example, if RA and T3 are present, RAR will dominate over the T3R in regulating keratin genes (17Tomic-Canic M. Day D. Samuels H.H. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The presence of T3 will allow GC regulation whereas its absence will block it.Furthermore, the type and amount of the hormones become irrelevant if there are no receptors. Therefore, the next regulatory level is the presence and a relative amount of a particular receptor. Keratinocytes express multiple NRs, such as RARγ, RXRα, T3R, GR, ER, progesterone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and farnesoid X receptor etc. (1Fisher C. Blumenberg M.

Invest. 1997; 100: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the case of the presence of multiple receptors, their relative amounts become an important factor. Combined, the type and amount of receptors with the type and the amount of respective hormones determine the next regulatory level: which co-regulators will interact and participate in transcriptional regulation. For example, if the GC are present in high amounts GR binds KRE as four monomers. In this context, none of the common co-regulators (SRC-1, GRIP-1, and NCoA) are involved due to a specific conformation of the GR (18Radoja N. Komine M. Jho S.H. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the liganded RAR or T3R interact with KRE, NCoA/SRC-1 become co-repressors rather than co-activators. 3S. H. Jho and M. Tomic-Canic, unpublished results.Obviously, there is a large variety of possible scenarios, all examples of fine-tuning necessary for maintenance of the target tissue, epidermis. It is no longer “only” the DNA-receptor and its ligand co-regulators integrators and transcriptional machinery. The complex elements, such as KREs, provide numerous combinations of possible interactions among three receptors independently and simultaneously, their ligands and their interactive proteins. The important point is that such complicated, fine-tuning is made possible by very specific DNA elements, e.g. the chaos is well organized by the KREs. By providing the binding of a specific configuration of the receptors and multiple receptor binding, KREs introduce a new dimension in the transcriptional regulatory systems. Although these DNA elements are uniquely present in the keratin gene family, we believe that as we focus our studies more on native hormone elements in their physiological contexts, simultaneous multiple transcriptional signals maintained by specific DNA elements will probably become a general phenomenon. Glucocorticoids (GC)1and retinoic acid (RA) are important regulators of development, differentiation, and gene expression in many tissues, including epidermis (1Fisher C. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M.

Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the liganded RAR or T3R interact with KRE, NCoA/SRC-1 become co-repressors rather than co-activators. 3S. H. Jho and M. Tomic-Canic, unpublished results.Obviously, there is a large variety of possible scenarios, all examples of fine-tuning necessary for maintenance of the target tissue, epidermis. It is no longer “only” the DNA-receptor and its ligand co-regulators integrators and transcriptional machinery. The complex elements, such as KREs, provide numerous combinations of possible interactions among three receptors independently and simultaneously, their ligands and their interactive proteins. The important point is that such complicated, fine-tuning is made possible by very specific DNA elements, e.g. the chaos is well organized by the KREs. By providing the binding of a specific configuration of the receptors and multiple receptor binding, KREs introduce a new dimension in the transcriptional regulatory systems. Although these DNA elements are uniquely present in the keratin gene family, we believe that as we focus our studies more on native hormone elements in their physiological contexts, simultaneous multiple transcriptional signals maintained by specific DNA elements will probably become a general phenomenon. In this study we show that the molecular function of the complex response elements in keratin genes (KREs) is to determine a specific configuration of the bound receptors and cause them to repress transcription. This means that the KREs create the message of repression by instructing the receptors how to bind. In addition, KREs, by providing simultaneous binding and interaction of multiple receptors create a hierarchy among the receptors, a new level of transcriptional regulation. KREs serve as an excellent example of sequences customized to select for specific receptor configuration, and to allow simultaneous receptor binding to provide a gradient of hormone action. We found that the KREs function independently of the promoter context and that sequence of the KREs and receptors DBD are necessary for the regulation to occur. The concept of DNA as a regulator of transcriptional signal is not novel (for review, see Refs. 33Guido E.C. Delorme E.O. Clemm D.L. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Miner J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1178-1190PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 35Wu Y. Xu B. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3936-3939Google Scholar). For example, studies by Lefstin and Yamamoto included a variety of positive GREs and suggested that REs may act as “ligands for regulators” (34Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that in the case of KREs, DNA creates a signal to shut down the transcription of its own promoter, i.e. the DNA acts as an “antagonist” for the receptor. However, KREs do even more than that. They allow the interplay of multiple nuclear receptors, thus creating a gradient of hormonal action. The sequences of KREs, supplying the signal for repression, allow three receptors with their respective ligands to respond to a large variety of physiological conditions under which the repression of keratin genes is required. This is extremely important in the epidermis because it is a target tissue that is exposed to and depends on complex hormonal regulation. The purpose of the receptor interplay is to provide the fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation of keratin genes in a large variety of physiological and pathological conditions. The hierarchy in receptor regulation of keratin genes is the following: RAR dominates over T3R (17Tomic-Canic M. Day D. Samuels H.H. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and T3R dominates over GR, although both receptors can simultaneously bind to the KRE. The footprinting results with these receptors on KRE suggest such a hierarchy. The RAR footprint is the largest, dominating the space and occupying almost the entire KRE, whereas the T3R, although overlapping, occupies a much smaller segment. Furthermore, GR binds as four monomer units and all four must be bound for regulation to occur. Therefore, one can envision multiple regulatory levels that are being introduced. The first is the concentration of the hormones that reach and are produced in epidermis (36Randolph R.K. Simon M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1374-1383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Slominski A. Gomez-Sanchez C.E. Foecking M.F. Wortsman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For example, if there is a high concentration of RA in the epidermis, the differentiation process is inhibited and keratinocytes become “basal-like” by changing their phenotype and keratin gene expression pattern (1Fisher C. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 284-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the simultaneous presence of two hormones multiply the possibilities of regulatory patterns. For example, if RA and T3 are present, RAR will dominate over the T3R in regulating keratin genes (17Tomic-Canic M. Day D. Samuels H.H. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The presence of T3 will allow GC regulation whereas its absence will block it. Furthermore, the type and amount of the hormones become irrelevant if there are no receptors. Therefore, the next regulatory level is the presence and a relative amount of a particular receptor. Keratinocytes express multiple NRs, such as RARγ, RXRα, T3R, GR, ER, progesterone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and farnesoid X receptor etc. (1Fisher C. Blumenberg M.

Combined, the type and amount of receptors with the type and the amount of respective hormones determine the next regulatory level: which co-regulators will interact and participate in transcriptional regulation. For example, if the GC are present in high amounts GR binds KRE as four monomers. In this context, none of the common co-regulators (SRC-1, GRIP-1, and NCoA) are involved due to a specific conformation of the GR (18Radoja N. Komine M. Jho S.H. Blumenberg M. Tomic-Canic M. Mol.

RFP represses transcription by interacting with Enhancer of Polycomb and is localized to the cytoplasm or nucleus depending on the cell type. Here, we have identified the nuclear export signal (NES) located in the coiled-coil region of RFP. Mutation of this NES or treatment with leptomycin B abrogated the nuclear export of RFP in NIH3T3 cells. In addition, fusion of this NES to other nuclear proteins, such as yeast transcription factor Gal4, resulted in their release into the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 cells.

Depending on their overall domain structure, proteins have been grouped into gene families, whose members often share similar functions in cells or organisms. Members of one such gene family, the RING-B box-coiled-coil (RBCC)1 family (1Douarin B.L. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), are characterized by their possession of a tripatic motif consisting of a RING finger (2Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N.

These domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and allow RBCC family members to participate in various cellular processes depending on their subcellular localization. In transformed cells, three members of the RBCC family (PML, transcriptional intermediary factor 1α, and RFP) were found to be oncogenic after their RBCC domains were linked to other proteins by DNA rearrangements. In acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, a reciprocal chromosomal translocation fuses the PML gene with the retinoic acid receptor α gene, resulting in the expression of a PML-RARα fusion protein (6Kakizuka A.

Similarly, the N-terminal RBCC domain of transcriptional intermediary factor 1α recombines with the serine/threonine kinase domain of B-Raf in the T18 oncogene (10Douarin B.L. Zechel C. Garnier J.M.

The RBCC motifs are required for the transforming capacities of these oncogenes (14Hasegawa N. Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H. Iwata Y. Isomura T. Goto H. Hayakawa T. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and oncogenesis may depend on the distinct cellular localizations of the fusion proteins (9Melnick A. Light J.D.

Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and mouse (16Cao T. Shannon M. Handel M.A. Etkin L.E. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and found to be highly expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids during spermatogenesis, suggesting that it participates in male germ cell differentiation (16Cao T.

Int. 1999; 49: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type or tissue, RFP is localized either to the cytoplasm or nucleus (16Cao T. Shannon M. Handel M.A. Etkin L.E. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Tezel G. Nagasaka T. Iwahashi N. Asai N. Iwashita T. Sakata K. Takahashi M. Pathol. Int. 1999; 49: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This localization requires the RBCC motif and homodimerization through the coiled-coil domain (18Cao T. Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the nucleus, RFP associates with the nuclear matrix (19Isomura T. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Taniguchi M. Matsuyama M. Ishigaki T. Sakuma S. Takahashi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5305-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and is a component of PML nuclear bodies (20Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H. Chen J.D. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) where it binds directly to PML (21Cao T. Duprez E. Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, RFP can interact with theint-6 gene product, another component of PML nuclear bodies (22Morris-Desbois C. Bochard V. Reynaud C. Jalinot P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, RFP was shown to repress transcription by interacting with Enhancer of Polycomb (23Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a member of Polycomb proteins. The Polycomb group proteins were originally identified inDrosophila as being involved in the maintenance of the correct expression pattern of homeotic genes. Polycomb group proteins form a large macromolecular complex and are involved in the epigenetic gene silencing. However, no biological function has yet been defined for RFP in the nucleus or cytoplasm, and mechanisms governing RFP subcellular localization remain largely unknown. The separation of the cytoplasm and nucleus in eukaryotic cells provides an important way to regulate cellular processes through compartmentalization. As was shown for NF-AT (24Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) or IκBα (25Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear import and export through the nuclear envelope can control gene expression in a signal-dependent manner by restricting the access of transcription factors to their target genes. The exchange between cytoplasm and nucleus occurs through the nuclear pore complex, and this process is mediated in most cases by specific amino acid sequences. Localization sequences exist for nuclear localization (nuclear localization sequence, NLS) (27Jans D.A. Xiao C.-Y. Lam M.H.C. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 28Görlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and for nuclear export (nuclear export signal, NES) (29Adam S.A. Curr. Opin.

Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The leucine-rich NES is specifically recognized by CRM1, which functions as an export receptor mediating the fast release of proteins with this sequence from the nucleus (32Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 33Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Masking of the NLS or NES through their binding to other factors or through post-translational modifications would allow for controlled shuttling of factors between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Here we have studied the cellular localization of RFP and found that it can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear export of RFP is dependent on a functional NES, which can be activated by protein kinase C (PKC). The regulation of RFP localization by PKC points to an important role for RFP in the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. The NIH3T3 and HepG2 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-containing atmosphere using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Nissui Pharmaceuticals) with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone) or 10% fetal calf serum (Roche), respectively. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), H7, and staurosporine were obtained from Sigma. Leptomycin B (LMB) was a gift from Dr. M. Yoshida. Drug concentrations and incubation times are indicated in the figure legends. Serum concentrations were reduced to 2% when drugs were added to the cell cultures. FLAG-tagged forms of RFP were expressed from pSG5-FLAG-Nt, and Gal4 fusion proteins from pCMX-Gal4 and pG4polyII (35Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P.

For the expression of GFP fusion proteins, the vectors pEGFP-C2, pEGFP-C3, pEGFP-N3, and pEYFP-nuc (CLONTECH) were used. Mutations in the putative NES and PKC phosphorylation sites were introduced by polymerase chain reaction and verified by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors for PKCα were described by Ueda et al. (36Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). To express the activated Ha-Ras, the SV40 promoter-containing vector pcEXV-1 was used. The SRα promoter-containing vector was used to express Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1).

For each 3-cm dish, 2 × 105NIH3T3 cells or 4 × 105 HepG2 cells were seeded, and on the next day the cells were transfected with 3 or 1.5 μg of the expression vector using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed and stained with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PKCα (Santa Cruz). Fusion proteins containing the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4-DBD) were detected by mouse monoclonal anti-Gal4-DBD antibody (Santa Cruz). The signals were visualized by rhodamine- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510). Nuclear DNA was stained with TO-PRO®-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) and used as a nuclear marker. GFP fusion proteins were analyzed in the same way directly after fixation and DNA staining with TO-PRO®-3 iodide. In Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, two types of staining pattern, which showed the predominantly nuclear or cytoplasmic RFP, were observed, and the cells showing uniform distribution in both nucleus and cytoplasm were not detected. Approximately 50–150 cells were examined, and the percentages of cells with cytoplasmic RFP were calculated. Photographs and numbers from representative experiments are shown in the figures.Figure 8Effect of PKC inhibitors on RFP localization.

PKC activity in NIH3T3 and HepG2 cells was measured in crude extracts using a PKC assay kit (Calbiochem). Detection of PKCα and a phosphorylated form of PKCα/β (Thr-638) was performed by Western blotting using 50 μg of total protein from NIH3T3 and HepG2 cells, anti-PKCα (C-20, Santa Cruz), or an anti-phospho-PKCα/β (Thr-638) antibody (New England BioLabs). RFP is highly expressed in tumor cell lines, and its subcellular localization depends on cell type. Exogenously expressed mouse RFP is located predominantly in the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 cells, whereas it is localized in the nucleus of HepG2 cells (18Cao T. Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore chose NIH3T3 and HepG2 cells to study mechanisms that control human RFP shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged RFP (Fig.1 A) or an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled form of RFP were transfected into NIH3T3 and HepG2 cells, and their localization was analyzed by confocal microscopy using TO-PRO®-3 iodide as a nuclear marker. As expected, both forms of human RFP were found in the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B), associated with structures that resembled the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus. Depending on the expression level, RFP showed a grainy pattern or clear dot-like structures. Small amounts of RFP were also visible in the nucleus, where they appeared as small dots. In contrast to NIH3T3 cells, both forms of human RFP localized to the nucleus of HepG2 cells (Fig.1 C). Staining was observed for the whole nucleoplasm with some preferences for the perinuclear region. Although RFP was reported to associate with PML nuclear bodies (21Cao T. Duprez E. Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), colocalization of RFP and PML nuclear bodies was observed only at low frequency. We next analyzed the mechanisms controlling the cytoplasmic localization of RFP in NIH3T3 cells. Because N-terminally linked EGFP-RFP fusion proteins showed a localization similar to that of FLAG-tagged RFP in both NIH3T3 and HepG2 cell lines (Fig. 1), EGFP-labeled deletion mutants of RFP were used to determine which domains of RFP affected its localization in NIH3T3 cells. Expression vectors encoding EGFP alone or EGFP fusion proteins for N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutations of RFP were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and their subcellular localization was analyzed along with a nuclear marker (Fig. 2). The EGFP control protein was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm because its small molecular mass of 27 kDa allows it to diffuse freely into the nucleus. However, the RFP fusion proteins used in this study had molecular masses in excess of 40 kDa, which may preclude their passive diffusion into the nucleus (30Turpin P. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the deletion of the RING finger domain of RFP (RFP96–513) had little effect on RFP localization, further deletion of the RING finger and B box, as in EGFP-RFP(132–513), led to distinct patterns of localization. Although the dot-like structures in the cytoplasm were maintained, increased staining of the nucleoplasm was observed. An additional deletion of the coiled-coil region (EGFP-RFP(315–513)) resulted in the disappearance of the dot-like structures in the cytoplasm and redistribution of RFP throughout the whole cell with a preference for the nucleus. A similar pattern was observed for a mutant lacking the C-terminal part of RFP, which contains the RING finger and the B box (EGFP-RFP(1–132)), although the distribution between the cytoplasm and nucleus was more uniform. Addition of the coiled-coil region to the RING finger and the B box (EGFP-RFP(1–258)) reestablished the localization of RFP as dot-like structures in the cytoplasm. Because the deletion analysis of RFP pointed to an overall importance of the coiled-coil region for RFP localization, a deletion mutant of RFP (EGFP-RFPΔcc), lacking the coiled-coil region, was constructed, and its subcellular localization was analyzed. As expected, the protein was distributed throughout the whole cell with preferential localization to the nucleus. These results indicate that the coiled-coil region is required for the cytoplasmic localization of RFP in NIH3T3 cells. The results described above led us to speculate about the presence of an NES in the coiled-coil region of RFP. In fact, sequence analysis of the coiled-coil region of RFP revealed the putative leucine-rich NES (41Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattji I.W. Lührmann R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) with the putative leucine-rich NES of RFP indicated a perfect homology (Fig.3 A). To examine whether RFP contains a functional NES, the three most conserved leucine residues in the putative NES of RFP (Leu-204, Leu-207, and Leu-209 in Fig.3 A) were mutated to alanines, and the localization of the mutated RFP (RFPmut) as a FLAG-tagged fusion protein was analyzed by immunostaining (Fig. 3 B). RFPmut was located predominantly in the nucleus of NIH3T3 cells, and in some of those cells it localized in dot-like structures similar to PML nuclear bodies. In addition, NIH3T3 cells transfected with the RFP expression vector were treated with the CRM1 inhibitor LMB (31Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 46Wolf B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Treatment of NIH3T3 cells with LMB enhanced the nuclear localization of RFP. Similar to RFPmut, wild-type RFP in LMB-treated cells could be seen in the whole nucleus or in some cases in dot-like structures. NES function can be studied by linking it to nuclear proteins, such as the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 (Gal4-DBD), which changes its subcellular localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when fused to an NES (47Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To study the function of the putative NES in RFP, the full-length RFP and the coiled-coil regions of RFP, comprising either normal or mutated versions of the putative NES, were expressed as Gal4-DBD fusion proteins in NIH3T3 cells, and their subcellular localizations were analyzed using anti-Gal4-DBD antibody (Fig.4 A). In contrast to the Gal4-DBD control protein, the wild-type RFP fusion protein was localized preferentially to the cytoplasm, and mutations in the putative NES resulted in relocalization of the Gal4-DBD-RFP fusion protein to the nucleus. Similar results were obtained with Gal4-DBD fused to the coiled-coil regions of RFP. The wild-type coiled-coil region of RFP was able to relocate the Gal4-DBD to the cytoplasm. This relocation was again blocked by point mutations in the putative NES. In the addition to the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, fusion proteins of the Gal4-DBD with the coiled-coil region of RFP were found in filament-like structures when the fusion proteins were expressed at very high levels (data not shown). Thus, the NES in the coiled-coil region can function alone. To confirm the function of the NES in RFP further, we also fused the RFP protein derivatives to the nuclear form of GFP, which harbors three NLS signals (EGFPnuc). The expression vectors for various EGFPnuc-RFP fusion proteins were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and their subcellular localizations were analyzed (Fig. 4 B). Similar to the results obtained with the Gal4-DBD fusion proteins, wild-type RFP was again able to relocalize EGFPnuc to the cytoplasm. NES mutations led to nuclear localization of the fusion protein to the dot-like structure that resembled those of PML. In contrast, however, fusions of RFPmut with Gal4-DBD were almost uniformly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4 A). This difference could be because, unlike EGFPnuc, Gal4-DBD has DNA binding activity. Because RFP was reported to form nuclear dot-like structure under certain conditions (21Cao T. Duprez E. Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the DNA binding activity of Gal4-DBD may disturb the localization of the fusion proteins to the nuclear dot-like structure. Deletion of the coiled-coil region also resulted in nuclear localization of RFP. However, these fusion proteins were distributed throughout an entire nucleoplasm. Thus, the results obtained with two different nuclear proteins (Gal4-DBD and EGFPnuc) have demonstrated that RFP harbors a functional NES in its coiled-coil region. In mouse, RFP homodimerization through the coiled-coil region was reported to be important for RFP localization (18Cao T. Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human RFP can dimerize in a similar way through its coiled-coil region. 2M. Harbers and S. Ishii, unpublished results. Because the NES is in the coiled-coil region of RFP, we investigated whether point mutations in the NES affect the homodimerization using a yeast two-hybrid system. The results showed that wild-type RFP was able to interact with RFPmut, indicating that the point mutations in the NES did not destroy the overall structure of the coiled-coil domain.2 In contrast to NIH3T3 cells, RFP is localized predominantly in the nucleus in HepG2 cells. To address whether the NES of RFP is functional in HepG2 cells, the Gal4-DBD-RFP fusion proteins were also expressed in HepG2 cells, and their localizations were analyzed as in NIH3T3 cells (Fig.5 A). The coiled-coil region of RFP was able to relocate the Gal4-DBD protein to the cytoplasm, whereas mutations in the NES reestablished the nuclear localization of the Gal4-DBD fusion protein, indicating that the NES of RFP is also functional in HepG2 cells. In contrast, however, the fusion protein containing full-length RFP was still localized in the nucleus, and this was unaffected by point mutations in the putative NES (Gal4-DBD-RFPmut). These results indicate that the activity of NES in full-length RFP is masked by its interaction with other domain(s) in the RFP protein or with other protein(s). In addition to using Gal4-DBD fusion proteins, RFP fused to the nuclear form of GFP (EGFPnuc) was also expressed in HepG2 cells (Fig.5 B). Similar to the results obtained with the Gal4-DBD fusion proteins, full-length RFP failed to relocalize EGFPnuc to the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2073604311,"Most heterodimeric proteins are stabilized by intersubunit contacts or disulfide bonds. In contrast, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and other glycoprotein hormones are secured by a strand of their β-subunits that is wrapped around α-subunit loop 2 “like a seatbelt.” During studies of hCG synthesis in COS-7 cells, we found that, when the seatbelt was prevented from forming the disulfide that normally “latches” it to the β-subunit, its carboxyl-terminal end can “scan” the surface of the heterodimer and become latched by a disulfide to cysteines substituted for residues in the α-subunit. Analogs in which the seatbelt was latched to residues 35, 37, 41–43, and 56 of α-subunit loop 2 had similar lutropin activities to those of hCG; that in which it was latched to residue 92 at the carboxyl terminus had 10–20% the activity of hCG. Attachment of the seatbelt to α-subunit residues 45–51, 86, 88, 90, and 91 reduced lutropin activity substantially. These findings show that the heterodimer can form before the β-subunit has folded completely and support the notions that the carboxyl-terminal end of the seatbelt, portions of α-subunit loop 2, and the end of the α-subunit carboxyl terminus do not participate in lutropin receptor interactions. They suggest also that several different architectures could have been sampled without disrupting hormone activity as the glycoprotein hormones diverged from other cysteine knot proteins.

Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) that is wrapped around α-subunit loop 2. The composition of the seatbelt determines the receptor binding specificity of hCG (4Campbell R.K. Dean Emig D.M. Moyle W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The LHR is a G protein-coupled receptor that contains a large extracellular domain that binds hCG with high affinity and specificity (7Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar). Based on its leucine-rich repeat motif (7Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar), the LHR extracellular domain is usually presumed to be horseshoe-shaped, similar to ribonuclease inhibitor (8Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The surfaces of hCG most likely to contact the LHR remain debated. The carboxyl-terminal end of the α-subunit, which is adjacent to a portion of the seatbelt in the heterodimer (2Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J.

Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar, 9Chen F. Wang Y. Puett D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 914-919PubMed Google Scholar) and was proposed to be a receptor contact more than 25 years ago (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). Based partially on this observation, Jiang et al. (10Jiang X. Dreano M. Buckler D.R. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. Tayar N.E. el Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) suggested that the long axis of hCG docks with the concave surface of a horseshoe-shaped extracellular domain. In their view, the hormone is perpendicular to the extracellular domain of the receptor such that the α-subunit carboxyl-terminal end, parts of β-subunit loop 2, and the seatbelt form key contacts with the concave surface of the receptor extracellular domain. Remy et al.(11Remy J.-J. Couture L. Pantel J. Haertle T. Rabesona H. Bozon V. Pajot-Augy E. Robert P. Troalen F. Salesse R. Bidart J.-M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 125: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggest that similar portions of the hormone contact a region nearer the rim of the extracellular domain. In this model the position of the hormone is tilted relative to that of Jiang et al.(10Jiang X. Dreano M. Buckler D.R. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. Tayar N.E. el Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) such that the ends of α-subunit loops 1 and 3 contact residues in the receptor transmembrane domain to initiate signal transduction. This explained the finding that an antibody to the α-subunit bound hCG when the hormone was complexed with the receptor extracellular domain but not with the intact receptor (12Pantel J. Remy J.-J. Salesse R. Jolivet A. Bidart J.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A third view of the hormone-receptor complex (13Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N.V. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20020-20031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) suggested that the long axis of hCG is oriented parallel to the plane of the extracellular domain such that the hormone contacts its rim at two widely separated sites. Contacts with the amino-terminal half of the extracellular domain contribute to the high affinity of the hormone for the receptor (14Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and those near the carboxyl-terminal end influence receptor binding specificity (15Bernard M.P. Myers R.V. Moyle W.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In principle, these models should be readily distinguished using site-directed mutagenesis to identify portions of the hormone and receptor that contact one another. Unfortunately, mutations of the α-subunit carboxyl terminus and β-subunit seatbelt alter the positions of the subunits within the heterodimer (13Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N.V. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20020-20031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Wang Y.H. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and have made it difficult to interpret the influence of these key parts of the hormone on its function. Efforts to test the role of the α-subunit in hormone-receptor interaction led us to design a scanning mutagenesis strategy useful for identifying residues that do not contact the LHR. We prepared hCG analogs in which the seatbelt is cross-linked by a disulfide to specific residues in α-subunit loop 2 and carboxyl terminus. In these analogs, β-subunit residues at the end of the seatbelt and at the beginning of the carboxyl terminus are located adjacent to specific parts of the α-subunit where they would be in a position to disrupt contacts between the α-subunit and the receptor. Cross-linked α-subunit residues of analogs that had high activities in LHR binding assays would be expected not to participate in key receptor interactions. Each model of the hormone-receptor complex makes specific predictions about contacts between the α-subunit and the LHR. Thus, a finding that one or more of these predictions is likely to be erroneous would suggest the model is wrong. Analogs that had little or no LHR activity are much less informative, because it is not possible to determine if the cross-link reduced hormone activity by disrupting a key receptor contact, by changing the conformation of the heterodimer, or both. Our rationale for attempting to prepare analogs having an architecture in which the seatbelt is attached to the α-subunit was based partly on the proposal made by Ruddon et al. (17Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Prot. Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that the seatbelt latch disulfide forms after the α-subunit has docked with the hCG β-subunit during hCG synthesis in cells. Following docking, seatbelt residue Cys-110 is thought to scan the surface of the heterodimer until it encounters β-subunit residue Cys-26 with which it forms the disulfide that latches the seatbelt to β-subunit loop 1 and that stabilizes the heterodimer. Conversion of β-subunit Cys-26 to alanine is known to prevent heterodimer formation, presumably because it blocks formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide (18Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We anticipated that Cys-110 of this β-subunit analog might form disulfides with cysteines that had been substituted for various residues in the α-subunit, resulting in an intersubunit disulfide cross-link. As shown here, many α-subunit analogs that contained an additional free cysteine combined with a β-subunit analog in which Cys-26 was converted to alanine. These were much more stable than hCG at low pH and, remarkably, some were as active as hCG in receptor binding and signal transduction assays. hCG was purified from a urinary extract as described previously (19Bahl O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sources of all monoclonal antibodies used in these studies have been identified (13Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K.

Procedures for Western blotting have also been described previously (20Moyle W.R. Matzuk M.M. Campbell R.K. Cogliani E. Dean Emig D.M. Krichevsky A. Barnett R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8511-8518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit antisera used in cAMP measurements were obtained from Strategic BioSolutions (Newark, DE). cAMP was radiolabeled as described before (21Brooker J. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the analogs used in these studies are illustrated in Fig. 1. DNA sequences encoding these analogs were prepared by standard methods, including cassette and PCR mutagenesis similar to those that have been described (4Campbell R.K. Dean Emig D.M. Moyle W.R.

The proteins were produced by transient expression in COS-7 cells in serum-free media as noted (4Campbell R.K. Dean Emig D.M. Moyle W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and quantified by sandwich immunoassays (22Moyle W.R. Ehrlich P.H. Canfield R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2245-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) employing α-subunit antibody A113 for capture and radioiodinated β-subunit antibody B110 for detection. The biological activities of the analogs were determined in receptor binding and signal transduction assays employing CHO cells that had been transfected with the rat LHR (23Lin W. Ransom M.X. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 152: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These assays were performed on samples that had been concentrated ∼100-fold by ultrafiltration (Centriprep YM-10, Millipore, Bedford, MA) followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline or by pouring the culture media into a dialysis bag and placing the bag on a bed of Aquacide II (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) until the samples were dry. The latter samples were rehydrated by dialyzing them in phosphate-buffered saline, and the concentration of the analog was determined using the A113/125I-B110 sandwich immunoassay. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). To learn if the analogs had become cross-linked by a disulfide, we added concentrated HCl to reduce the pH below 2 for 30 min at 37 °C, a condition known to promote the dissociation of the hCG heterodimer (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). The pH was neutralized by the addition of 0.017 volume of 1m Tris (pH 7.5) plus an amount of NaOH equivalent to the HCl used for acidification, and the concentration of heterodimer was determined using the A113/125I-B110 sandwich immunoassay. We did not detect any heterodimer in the media of COS-7 cells that had been co-transfected with vectors encoding the native α-subunit and hCG-βC26A, the β-subunit analog in which Cys-26 had been converted to alanine (Table I). This observation confirms the result obtained by Suganuma et al.(18Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is consistent with the idea that the stability of the native hCG heterodimer depends on the seatbelt being “latched” to Cys-26 of β-subunit loop 1. The amounts of heterodimers secreted into the medium by COS-7 cells that had been co-transfected with vectors encoding hCG-βC26A and several α-subunit constructs were comparable to that of hCG (Table I). These included α-subunit analogs having an additional cysteine at or near the α-subunit carboxyl terminus (i.e. αT86C, αY88C, αS92C) or in parts of α-subunit loop 2 (i.e. αR35C, αY37C, αL41C, αR42C, αS43C, αT46C, αL48C). The use of α-subunit analogs containing a cysteine in place of residues 5, 45, 47, 49, 51, 56, 64, 90, or 91 (i.e. αQ5C, αK45C, αM47C, αV49C, αK51C, αE56C, αS64C, αH90C, αK91C) led to the accumulation of less heterodimer in the medium. We failed to detect reproducible secretion of heterodimer when hCG-βC26A was expressed with the native α-subunit or analogs αL12C, αN15C, αF17C, αG22C, αP38C, αP40C, αK44C, αN52C, αV53C, αM71C, αG73C, and αY89C (Table I).Table IProperties of heterodimers released into the mediaAnalogAmount in mediumRemaining after pH 2125I-B111/ 125I-B1101-cThe amounts of radiolabeled125I-B111 and 125I-B110 bound in A113/125I-B110 and A113/125I-B111 sandwich assays were determined at each of several concentrations of hCG and βC26A,C110A-α.

Open table in a new tab To reduce the possibility that the differences we observed in heterodimer formation were caused by limitations of our assay procedures, we compared the abilities of the α-subunit analogs to be expressed with the native hCG β-subunit using similar assay protocols. The α-subunit antibodies used to capture these analogs in sandwich assays, A113 and A116, recognize epitopes located primarily on opposite surfaces of α-subunit loop 1 (13Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K.

Except for αY89C, each of the α-subunit analogs was captured by one or both of these antibodies when expressed with the native β-subunit (not shown). The β-subunit antibodies used to monitor these analogs recognize sites on loops 1 and/or 3, a portion of the native hCG β-subunit detected readily before and after it has combined with the α-subunit. The B111 epitope includes the seatbelt latch (20Moyle W.R. Matzuk M.M. Campbell R.K. Cogliani E. Dean Emig D.M. Krichevsky A. Barnett R.W. Boime I. J. Biol.

Although this antibody bound each of the α-subunit analogs when they were combined with the native hCG β-subunit (not shown), it was unable to recognize hCG-βC26A (Fig. 2) or any of the cross-linked heterodimers (Table I). B110 is unable to bind hCG at the same time as B111, but its epitope does not involve residues in the seatbelt and it recognizes analogs such as hCG-βC26A in which the seatbelt is not latched or heterodimers such as αL41C/hCG-βC26A in which the seatbelt is latched to the α-subunit (Fig. 2). The B112 epitope includes residue Asn-77 on a surface of β-subunit loop 3 (20Moyle W.R. Matzuk M.M. Campbell R.K. Cogliani E. Dean Emig D.M. Krichevsky A. Barnett R.W. Boime I. J. Biol.

This surface of the β-subunit is distant from the seatbelt latch disulfide, an observation that explains why B111 and B112 bind hCG at the same time. Unlike B111, B112 binds the free hCG-βC26A subunit and heterodimers containing hCG-βC26A (Fig. 2). B112 and B110 recognized each of the cross-linked heterodimers that had been captured by A113 in an equivalent fashion (Table II). Based on this observation and the fact that we have much greater access to B110 than B112, we routinely used B110 to quantify the analogs described here even though its affinity for hCG is lower than that of B112.Table IIDetection of analogs in A113/ 125 I-B112 and A113/ 125 I-B110 sandwich immunoassaysAnalogRatio B112/B110α41C-βC26A1.06α42C-βC26A0.99α43C-βC26A1.02α48C-βC26A1.09α50C-βC26A0.63α90C-βC26A1.08α91C-βC26A1.23α86C-βC26A1.40α92C-βC26A0.94 Average1.05 ± 0.07The same samples were analyzed in each assay relative to hCG as a standard.

As can be seen here, both assays gave essentially the same result. We subjected the media to a brief acid treatment to learn if the analogs produced by the COS-7 cells had an intersubunit cross-link that made them more stable than hCG. As expected from the known acid instability of the glycoprotein hormones (26Li C.H. Starman B. Nature. 1964; 202: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), transient treatment of hCG at low pH caused its subunits to dissociate, making it no longer detectable in A113/125I-B110 sandwich assays (Table I). Unlike hCG, each of the heterodimeric analogs tested was readily measured in the A113/125I-B110 sandwich assay following acid treatment, showing that its subunits were tethered by an intersubunit disulfide. We also tested the stability of the analog containing a cross-link to α-subunit residue 41 to 10 murea denaturation. Western blots (Fig. 2) revealed that urea treatment caused the complete dissociation of hCG but had no influence on the analog detected using A113, B110, or B112. Due to the presence of a free thiol in each free subunit, it was conceivable that we might observe the formation of stable disulfide cross-linked αα and ββ homodimeric analogs. Unlike hCG β-subunit analogs that were engineered to form homodimers by replacing loop 2 with its α-subunit counterpart (27Moyle W.R. Myers R.V. Wang Y. Han Y. Lin W. Kelley G.L. Ehrlich P.H. Rao S.N.V. Bernard M.P. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 241-254Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar), hCG-βC26A did not appear to form significant amounts of homodimers (Fig. 2). We have also described methods for preparing α-subunit homodimers in mammalian cells (27Moyle W.R. Myers R.V. Wang Y. Han Y. Lin W. Kelley G.L. Ehrlich P.H. Rao S.N.V. Bernard M.P. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 241-254Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although we did not test the ability of each of the α-subunit analogs to form homodimers, we were unable to detect the formation of αL41C homodimers in Western blots (Fig. 2). With the exception of αY89C, we observed that each α-subunit analog combined with the native hCG β-subunit and was secreted into the medium (not shown), albeit not always at the same level as hCG. This showed that most cysteine substitutions did not disrupt the folding of the α-subunit analog, prevent docking of the α-subunit with the hCG β-subunit, or block the passage of heterodimer through the secretory pathway. Comparisons of the amounts of cross-linked heterodimers produced (Table I) with the positions of the α-subunit cysteines and their distances from parts of the seatbelt in hCG (Table III) suggested that secretion of these analogs was limited by their abilities to form a disulfide with hCG-βC26A. Residues of α-subunit analogs that combined well with hCG-βC26A were located in a circumscribed surface on the α-subunit centered near the midpoint of the seatbelt (Fig. 3). This suggested that movements of the carboxyl-terminal half of the seatbelt (i.e. between β-subunit residues 101 and 110) were required for formation of the intersubunit disulfide cross-links.Table IIIDistance between Cα carbons of residues in hCGhCG or Analogβ-Subunit amino acid residueβC110βA91βG101ÅβC26 (hCG)63326αQ5C321625αQ27C422124αG22C573641αR35C191111αY37C141512αP38C141613αT39C131812αP40C102212αL41C102517αR42C102616αS43C132312αK44C152314αK45C152717αT46C172514αM47C192314αL48C222516αV49C232515αQ50C202115αK51C191712αN52C181714αV53C171411αE56C19136αS64C402623αM71C573337αG73C573336αV76C482628αT86C26169αY88C28147αY89C311810αH90CUnknownUnknownUnknownαK91CUnknownUnknownUnknownαS92CUnknownUnknownUnknownValues shown were measured from the crystal structure of hCG except for that of αS92C, which is indeterminate.

In the current report we show that the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is also involved in the induction of this gene by IFN-β. NF-κB is a dimer of members of the Rel family of proteins, including p50, p52, c-Rel, RelA/p65, and RelB. NF-κB dimers bind to DNA segments collectively referred to as κB elements (5Chen F.E. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytosol with oligomeric inhibitory components, termed IκB. Stimulation of cells with appropriate inducers results in the rapid degradation of IκB and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where it binds target sequences to initiate transcription. Increasing evidence suggests that a second signaling pathway, independent of IκBα degradation (6Wang D. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol.

For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) the NF-κB binding site (5′-GAGCAGAGGGAAATTCCGTAACTT-3′) from thehIP-10 gene was used as a probe. Nuclear extracts were prepared and gel-shift assays performed as described earlier (18Majumder S. Zhou L.Z. Chaturvedi P. Babcock G. Aras S. Ransohoff R.M. J.

In vitro phosphorylation was performed using ∼1 μg of GST-fused p65 protein in 23 μl of kinase buffer containing 3 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (19Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts from IFN-β-, IFN-α-, or TNF-α-treated cells (3 μg of protein in a volume of 2 μl) were added to the reaction and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min (8Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H.

Following the kinase reaction, phosphorylated protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Western analysis with anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to quantitate the total amount of p65 protein. We performed a functional analysis of the β-R1 ISRE-like element using wt-β-R1 and mutant mISRE-β-R1 (Fig.1 a). In transient transfection assays, IFN-β responsiveness of mISRE-β-R1 was reduced by more than 80% compared with the wt-β-R1 promoter (Fig. 1 a). This result confirmed the requirement of this ISRE-like element for the induction of β-R1 by IFN-β. The induction of mISRE-β-R1 activity by IFN-γ was also significantly reduced by about 70% compared with wt-β-R1 (Fig. 1 a). These results are consistent with our earlier observation in U2A cells (which lack the p48/IRF-9 ISRE recognition factor) of loss of induction of β-R1 by IFN-β or IFN-γ (3Rani M.R. Foster G.R. Leung S. Leaman D. Stark G.R. Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22878-22884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We proposed that a second cis-element might be involved in the induction of the β-R1 gene (3Rani M.R. Foster G.R. Leung S. Leaman D. Stark G.R. Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22878-22884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We had previously observed 3M. R. S. Rani and R. M. Ransohoff, unpublished data. synergistic induction of β-R1 by IFN-β and TNF-α, the latter being a well characterized activator of transcription factor NF-κB. Hence, a salient choice for analysis was the κB element on the promoter of β-R1. Using transient transfection assays, wt-β-R1 or mκB-β-R1 promoter-reporters were analyzed for IFN-β responsiveness. Mutation of the κB element on the promoter of β-R1 markedly reduced IFN-β induction of the promoter, by 70% (Fig. 1 b). Induction of the wild-type and mκB-β-R1 constructs by IFN-γ differed only slightly (Fig. 1 b). This result indicated that the κB element was specifically required for IFN-β but not IFN-γ-mediated induction. We used EMSAs to address whether the requirement for the κB binding site was associated with IFN-β induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding by NF-κB. Analysis of extracts of U1.wt cells revealed, as previously reported (20Plattner R. Gupta S. Khosravi-Far R. Sato K.Y. Perucho M. Der C.J. Stanbridge E.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1807-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Wiest J.S. Burnett V.L. Anderson M.W. Reynolds S.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2449-2454PubMed Google Scholar), basal NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig.2 a). Super-shift experiments showed complexes composed of p65 homodimers, and p65/p50 heterodimers (results not shown). No IFN-β-inducible increase in DNA binding activity was detected by densitometric analysis of the ratios of the specific NF-κB complexes to a nonspecific band (Fig.2 b). To address the possibility that basal nuclear NF-κB activity might be essential for induction of β-R1 by IFN-β, we analyzed two sibling cell lines that differed in basal NF-κB. Wild-type 293 cells did not contain basal nuclear NF-κB as detected by EMSA, whereas Z5 cells contained constitutive NF-κB (Fig. 2 c). The major κB binding complex in Z5 cells consisted of p65 and p50 subunits (Fig.2 d). IFN-β treatment did not produce a detectable change in NF-κB in either cell line. RNase protection analysis documented the induction of β-R1 by IFN-β in Z5 cells but not in 293 cells (Fig. 2 e), although another type I IFN-inducible gene (6Wang D. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol.

TNF-α, in combination with IFN-β, mediated synergistic induction of β-R1 in both Z5 and 293 cells, confirming the existence of an intact NF-κB pathway in both cell lines. We also over-expressed super-repressor mutant isoform of IκBα in U1.wt cells, resulting in diminished induction of the wt-β-R1 promoter-reporter by IFN-β (Fig. 2 f). To exclude nonspecific effects of IκBα over-expression, we analyzed IFN-β-mediated induction of a promoter-reporter construct derived from the p561 gene (a type I IFN-induced gene). Induction of the 561 promoter-reporter (which lacks a κB site) was unaffected by IκBα (Fig. 2 f). In transient transfection assays, a 6xκB promoter-reporter construct was not activated by IFN-β, but TNF-α gave a 6-fold induction (Fig. 2 g). We asked whether homodimers of p50 (which lack a transactivation domain and are transcriptionally inactive) were sufficient to promote β-R1 transcription by virtue of occupancy at the κB site. For these experiments, p50 was over-expressed in U1.wt cells along with the wt-β-R1 promoter-reporter, and reporter gene activation in response to IFN-β was examined. IFN-β responsiveness of the promoter was reduced by 60% to a level similar to that obtained by disruption of the NF-κB binding site (TableI). This result indicated that p50 homodimers were insufficient to support transcription of β-R1 and suggested the requirement of transcriptionally competent NF-κB complexes.Table IRequirement of p65 but not p50 for the induction of β-R1 by IFN-βPlasmidsNormalized luciferase activity1-aLuciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency as described under “Experimental Procedures” and expressed in arbitrary units.

Taken together these results indicated that transcriptionally competent NF-κB complexes were required for maximal transcription of the β-R1 gene in response to IFN-β.

To address IFN-β-mediated phosphorylation of NF-κB proteins, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibodies, which co-precipitated p65, p50, and IκB (Fig. 3 a). The identity of the phosphorylated proteins was confirmed by Western analysis (results not shown). This analysis revealed increase in p65 phosphorylation in cells treated with 1FN-β or TNF-α (Fig.3 a). Phosphorylation of p65 in untreated U1.wt cells was anticipated, as these cells contain basal NF-κB nuclear activity. We also detected IFN-β-mediated increases in p50 and IκB phosphorylation. Strikingly, phosphorylated IκBα remained intact in IFN-β-treated cells but was rapidly degraded in TNF-α-treated cells. Between 5 min and 1 h, we observed rapid IκBα degradation in response to TNF-α but not to IFN-β (Fig. 3 c). Experiments using GST-fused p65 revealed that an inducible p65 phosphorylating activity was present in nuclear extracts of IFN-β- or TNF-α treated cells (Fig. 3 b) but not in IFN-α-treated cells (Fig. 3 d). Here, we address the role of NF-κB in the induction of β-R1 by IFN-β. We had previously hypothesized that ISGF-3 was essential but not sufficient for the induction of the gene and proposed that an additional component might be required (3Rani M.R. Foster G.R. Leung S. Leaman D. Stark G.R. Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22878-22884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We studied NF-κB because of the striking synergy between TNF-α and IFN-β for induction of β-R1, despite the fact that neither TNF-α nor interleukin-1β alone induced β-R1. Site-directed mutagenesis of the κB element in the β-R1 promoter or over-expression of a super-repressor mutant of IκBα blocked the induction of the β-R1 gene by IFN-β, indicating that NF-κB components were required. However, IFN-β did not induce increased NF-κB DNA binding activity by EMSA. Further IFN-β treatment did not activate transcription from a NF-κB reporter-construct. To address the question of whether the physical presence of κB binding activity was sufficient to enhance the transcriptional response of the β-R1 gene to IFN-β, we individually over-expressed transcriptionally inert p50 or transcriptionally active p65. Over-expression of p50 suppressed β-R1 transcription, whereas over-expression of p65 elevated basal β-R1 promoter activity but supported a further 6-fold increase in response to IFN-β. These results confirmed a requirement for active NF-κB complexes to drive maximal transcription of the β-R1 gene. In Daudi and other cell lines, type I IFN was reported to signal to NF-κB via a pathway involving PI3K and serine-threonine kinase Akt (22Yang H.C. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Kim J.G. Donner D.B. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13756-13761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The output of this pathway comprised markedly increased NF-κB. IFN-mediated endogenous NF-κB-dependent gene expression was not documented in these or prior reports (22Yang H.C. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Kim J.G. Donner D.B. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13756-13761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), implicated STAT3 as a docking site for PI3K components. Such signaling is not observed in HT1080 cells, where STAT3 activation is dispensable for generating PI3K lipid kinase activity and where physical interaction between STAT3 and PI3K does not occur (25Rani M.R.

Given these dissimilar signaling characteristics of type I IFN receptor activation in HT1080 cells as compared with Daudi cells (26Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc.

We have previously reported that excretory-secretory component (native DiAg) isolated fromDirofilaria immitis induces both total IgE production in human spleen cells and CD23 expression on human splenic B cells in the presence of IL-4 (7Yamaoka K. Kolb J.P. Miyasaka N. Inuo G. Fujita K. Immunology. 1994; 81: 507-512PubMed Google Scholar). Lee et al. demonstrated thatAscaris suum pseudocoelomic body fluid contains a B cell mitogen (8Lee T.D.G. Xie C.Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1247-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and induces high levels of total circulating IgE (9Lee T.D.G. McGibbon A. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 102: 185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We previously purified a factor from D. immitisthat induces antigen-nonspecific IgE in mice and rats and named it DiAg (10Furuhasi Y. Imai S. Tezuka H. Fujita K. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2001; 125: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DiAg was identical to one already identified as a polyradderprotein, or neutrophil chemotactic factor (DiNCF; GenBankTM accession number D88757) (11Horii Y. Fujita K. Owhashi M. J. Parasitol. 1986; 72: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To further characterize DiAg, we produced its recombinant protein, rDiAg, inEscherichia coli and analyzed its characteristics in a number of studies. rDiAg induces transmission of a mitogenic signal to mouse B cells, which in turn induces secretion of IgE in the presence of IL-4. Immune responses to parasitic helminth are usually characterized by two quite mysterious phenomena: dominance of Th2-like immunity and antigen-nonspecific IgE secretion. DiAg might cause these unique phenomena in the case of filarial infection. A number of critical questions about the mechanisms of polyclonal IgE synthesis remain to be resolved. First, it is not clear which molecules play an essential role in DiAg-induced activation of B cells. Second, the mechanisms by which IL-4 induces IgE secretion in helminth infection are not clear, although it has been established that the process is dependent on activated Th2 cells. T cell-dependent antigen-specific IgE synthesis in B cells requires that the signal be delivered by interaction of the B cell surface antigen CD40 with its ligand (CD40L) (12Noel R.J. Roy M.

CD40L is directly bound to CD40 on B cells and induces mitogenicity in murine and human B cells (18Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Strockbine L. Clifford K.N. Macduff B.M. Sato T.A. Maliszewski C.R.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 3671-3680PubMed Google Scholar); it can also induce secretion of all immunoglobulin isotypes in the presence of cytokines (20Maliszewski C.R. Grabstein K. Fanslow W.C. Armitage R.J. Spriggs M.K. Sato T.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). rDiAg has been previously shown to induce IgE secretion of splenic B cells from naive mice with IL-4 in vitro culture system in the absence of T cells. 1H. Tezuka, S. Imai, Y. Furuhashi, R. Muto, and K. Fujita, submitted for publication. It suggests that the engagement of antigen-specific T cell to B cells is not involved in induction of IgE by rDiAg. DiAg might induce the IgE class switching via the CD40 molecule with the IL-4. We therefore investigated the biochemical characteristics of DiAg as a CD40 agonist. CD40L has been shown to induce cytokine production in peripheral blood monocytes and T cells (22Armitage R.J. Tough T.W. Macduff B.M. Fanslow W.C. Spriggs M.K. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2326-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is known that human monocyte-like THP-1 cells produce proinflammatory cytokines by CD40L stimulation (23Yoshimoto T. Nagase H. Ishida T. Inoue J. Nariuchi H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that rDiAg induces IgE production in rats. However, actions of rDiAg on human cell lines remain to be elucidated. We report here that rDiAg have various biological activity to the human cell lines and B cell population. The V1 domain (a repeating unit) of DiAg gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers (5′-primer, including NdeI restriction site: 5′-GCATATGAATGATCATAATTTAGAAAGC-3′, 3′-primer, including BamHI restriction site: 5′-CTAAAGGATCCTATCACCGCTTACGCCGTTCATTCATTG-3′) from pDi6 (24Owhashi M.

Amplified DNA was digested with NdeI andBamHI and cloned into pET3a vectors for expression inE. coli HMS174 (DE3). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The purification of rDiAg was performed as follows. Five g of cell paste was suspended in 30 ml of 50 mm HCl and 5 mm EDTA at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. Recombinant DiAg in the supernatant was precipitated by 60–80% saturated ammonium sulfate and then applied on a Superdex 200 column. Contaminants of pyrogen from E. coliwere removed from concentrated rDiAg solution by immobilized polymixin B. The isolated rDiAg protein was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. The extracellular domain of the human CD40 gene was amplified by PCR with primers (5′-primer: 5′-GCTCATATGCCAGAACCACCCACTGC-3′, antisense primer: 5′-GGAGCCAGGAAGATCGTCGGGAAA-3′) from cDNA (CLONTECH) of human leukocytes. Amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into pET3a vectors for expression in E. coli HMS174 (DE3). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The purification of rsCD40 was performed as follows. Five g of cell paste was suspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8) and sonicated by sonicator on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 5 mm φ × 50 mm) preequilibrated with the same buffer. The active fraction was pooled and was precipitated by adding 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was suspended in PBS2 and then applied on a Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 10 mm φ × 300 mm) column chromatography preequilibrated with PBS. Contaminants of pyrogen from E. coli were removed from concentrated rsCD40 solution by immobilized polymixin B. Construction procedure of rsCD40-Ig was performed as described by Hsu (25Hsu Y-M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Osmotic pumps (Alza) filled with rDiAg or ovalbumin in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were subcutaneously infused in female 6-week-old mice (wild-type C57BL/6 or CD40-deficient B6.129P2-Tnfsf5tm1Kik; Jackson Laboratory stock number 002928). The pumping rate of an osmotic pump is 0.25 μl/h continuously, and the duration is 14 days. IgE concentrations of plasma were measured by the ELISA kits (Bethyle). Antigen-specific IgE were measured by ELISA. One microgram of rDiAg or ovalbumin in 100 μl was coated onto a 96-well plate (Maxisorb, Nunc) at 4 °C for 16 h. The wells were then washed with PBS and blocked with milk casein (BlockA, Yukijirushi) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, 100 μl of diluted serum (100–12800 folds dilution in PBS) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, bound antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgE (Nordic Immunological Laboratory) antibody. PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood obtained from normal non-atopic donors by density-gradient centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were then washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin (complete medium). Purified B cell populations were isolated from PBMCs by positive sorting by magnetic cell sorting system (Miltenyi Biotec) with magnetic beads conjugated to CD19 according to the manufacturer's instructions. For IgE production, human B cells (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in complete medium in the presence of IL-4 (500 units/ml) plus either rsCD40L (2 μg/ml) or rDiAg (10 μg/ml). After 14 days, supernatants were harvested and assessed for their IgE content. In certain experiments, rsCD40-Ig and rsTNFR-Ig were added to the cultures. Levels of human IgE in culture supernatants were measured using ELISA kit (Bethyl). Net IgE synthesis was calculated by subtracting the amount of IgE detected in the supernatants of cycloheximide-treated (100 μg/ml) cell cultures. The sensitivity of the assay was 3 ng/ml. THP-1 cells (2 × 106) were cultured in 24-well plates with 10 μg/ml of rDiAg, rsCD40L, and LPS in 1 ml of culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) with (for TNF-α induction) 2 mm hydroxyurea and 50 μg/ml silica powder or without (for IL-12 induction) and with or without 20 units/ml IL-10 at 37 °C for 24 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For IL-12 inhibition assays, various concentration (0.3–30 μg/ml) of rsCD40-Ig or rsTNFR-Ig was added to cell culture with 1 μg/ml of rDiAg, rsCD40L, and LPS. After 24 h, supernatants were recovered for determination of IL-12 and TNF-α concentrations. The IL-12 and TNF-α concentrations of supernatants were measured by the ELISA kits (IL-12, Endogen; TNF-α, R&D Systems). THP-1 or Ramos cells were cultured in 250 ml of culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) at 37 °C for 24 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The confluent cells (3 × 108) were homogenized in buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml subtilicin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine) by a politron homogenizer at maximum speed on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was suspended in buffer (75 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml subtilicin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine) and the aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. rDiAg and rsCD40L were radiolabeled with Bolton-Hunter reagent (diiodinate 163 TBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Radiolabeled rDiAg and rsCD40L were purified by gel filtration. Membrane aliquots (40 μg of proteins) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with or without a protecting ligand in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Preincubated membranes were incubated with ∼0.98–31.2 nm125I-rDiAg or 125I-rsCD40L with or without competitor for 15 h at 4 °C. After incubation, radioligand binding membranes were filtrated on Whatman GF/B filters by a cell harvester, and the filters were washed with phosphate buffer saline. The radioactivity of filters was then determined by a γ counter (Aloka). Serial dilutions of purified rDiAg, rsCD40L, and TNF-α were coated onto a 96-well plate (Maxisorb, Nunc) at 4 °C for 16 h. The wells were then washed with PBS and blocked with milk casein (BlockA, Yukijirushi) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, 100 μl of rsCD40-Ig or rsTNFR-Ig (2 μg/ml diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) was added and was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, bound antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG Fc antibody (Jackson). Cell preparation MLN-B cells were freshly prepared from small intestine of wild-type or CD40-deficient mice. Briefly, MLN cells were placed on 25-mm2 tissue culture flasks at 37 °C for 1 h to deplete adherent cell fractions contaminating macrophages (repeat three times). Nonadherent cell fraction was treated with rabbit anti-mouse Thy-1.2 antibody (diluted 1:20; Cedalane Laboratory) at 4 °C for 1 h and subsequently with low-tox rabbit complement (diluted 1:10; Cedalane Laboratory) at 37 °C for 1 h to deplete T cell fraction. Cell proliferation MLN-B cells (1 × 106cells/ml) were incubated with various doses of rDiAg or LPS for several hours in a total volume of 1 ml in 24-well flat-bottomed plates. The cell proliferation was measured by a modified colorimetric MTT reduction assay. Briefly, at 4 h before the end of the culture, the cells were resuspended with 1 ml of fresh serum-free medium, and 100 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well. After incubation for 4 h, 900 μl of acid-isopropanol (0.04 n HCl in isopropanol with 10% Me2SO) was added to each well and mixed well by pipetting. The mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature. Two hundred ml of each medium was aliquoted into 96-well plates, and the dissolved MTT crystals were quantitated. The optical densities were measured at 570 nm, attest wavelength, and at 630 nm, a reference wavelength, using a microplate reader. Serum immunoglobulin levels of C57BL/6J mice are shown in Fig.1 a. A significant level of IgE production was induced in rDiAg-infused mice, with peak IgE production occurring on day 21, and the level decreased gradually until day 28. In contrast, antigen-specific IgE levels were not detected at anytime points measured (Fig. 1 b). Our results were in agreement with the previous report of marked elevation of polyclonal IgE levels in the early phase of Nippostrongylus brasiliensisinfections (5Jarrett E.E. Miller H.R.P. Prog. Allergy. 1982; 31: 178-233PubMed Google Scholar). The same phenomenon has also been observed in rats (10Furuhasi Y. Imai S. Tezuka H. Fujita K. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2001; 125: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). rsCD40L or rDiAg in the presence of IL-4 induced IgE synthesis in highly purified human normal B cells in vitro cell culture systems. To assess the role of CD40L in the induction of IgE synthesis by rDiAg in normal B cells, we examined the effect of blocking CD40L-CD40 interactions. For this purpose, we used a recombinant soluble CD40-IgG fusion protein (rsCD40-Ig), which has been shown previously to inhibit IL-4-driven CD40L-dependent IgE synthesis in PBMCs (26Fanslow W.C Anderson D.M Grabstein K.H Clark E.A Cosman D Armitage R.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 655-660PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jabara H.H. Geha R.S. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows that rsCD40-Ig, but not the control recombinant human soluble TNF receptor I immunoglobulin fusion protein (rsTNFR-Ig; R&D Systems), inhibits induction of IgE synthesis by sCD40L+IL-4 or rDiAg+IL-4. The enhancement of IgE synthesis observed with rsTNFR-Ig in the experiment presented was not reproducible, because it was not observed in other experiment. These results support the notion that induction of IgE isotype-switching by rDiAg+IL-4 is dependent on CD40. The immune responses of human cell lines to the addition of rDiAg remain to be elucidated. In this study, therefore, we first examined the response of rDiAg to a human cell line. THP-1 cells secreted IL-12 upon activation by rDiAg, rsCD40L (Bender Medsystems), or LPS, as shown in Fig. 3 a. Stimulation with 10 μg/ml rDiAg resulted in an up to 6-fold increase in secretion compared with that in non-treated controls. The addition of IL-10 to THP-1 cells stimulated with rDiAg rsCD40L, or LPS profoundly inhibited the production of IL-12. Phagocytosis of the cells was stimulated by addition of silica powder and hydroxyurea to the THP-1 cell culture medium, and TNF-α secretion was induced by rDiAg, rsCD40L, or LPS. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the addition of IL-10 to LPS-activated THP-1 cells stimulation profoundly inhibited the production of TNF-α. In contrast, when THP-1 cells were activated by rsCD40L or rDiAg, the production of TNF-α was not significantly affected by the addition of IL-10. To demonstrate a casual relationship between the DiAg-induced and CD40-induced productions of inflammatory cytokines in THP-1 cells, rsCD40-Ig fusion protein (25Hsu Y-M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was added to the cell culture (Fig.3 c). The addition of rsCD40-Ig to THP-1 cells activated by rDiAg and rsCD40L stimulation inhibited the production of IL-12. In contrast, when THP-1 cells were activated by LPS, the production of IL-12 was not affected by the addition of rsCD40-Ig. Following addition of rsTNFR-Ig into the cell culture as a negative control, none of the stimulations of activated THP-1 cells studied had any effect on IL-12 production (data not shown). To investigate the effects of direct binding of rDiAg to cell membrane molecules, binding assays with 125I-rDiAg were conducted on THP-1 cells expressing human CD40. 125I-rDiAg bound to the THP-1 cell membrane fractions in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4 a). 125I-rDiAg binding to membrane fractions revealed a large number of receptors (K d = 8.4 nm; 16,000 sites/cell) by Scatchard plot analysis (Fig. 4 b). Binding of125I-rDiAg to the THP-1 cell surface membrane was competitively inhibited by addition of rsCD40L and unlabeled rDiAg (Fig. 4 c). IC50 by rsCD40L and rDiAg were 3.6 × 10−8m and 2.4 × 10−7m, respectively. To confirm the ability of rDiAg to competitively inhibit 125I-rsCD40L binding to cell membrane molecules, binding assays with 125I-rsCD40L were conducted on Burkitt's lymphoma Ramos cells expressing human CD40 (28Ning Z.Q. Norton J.L. Li J. Murphy J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2356-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 125I-rsCD40L bound to the Ramos cell membrane fractions in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4 d). 125I-rsCD40L binding to membrane fractions revealed the possible existence of two types of receptors (K d high = 1.4 nm; 36,000 sites/cell and K d low = 30 nm; 1.8 × 105 sites/cell) by Scatchard plot analysis (Fig. 4 e). The high affinity of receptor was similar to the affinity of rDiAg binding. Binding of 125I-rsCD40L to the Ramos cell surface membrane was competitively inhibited by addition of unlabeled rsCD40L and rDiAg (Fig. 4 f). IC50 by rsCD40L and rDiAg were 3.3 × 10−8m and 3.8 × 10−7m, respectively. The data described above suggest that DiAg activated the immune system by binding to CD40. However, there is a possibility that 125I-rDiAg binds to molecules other than CD40 because CD40 is a member of the TNF-α receptor family (29van Kooten C. Banchereau J.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to determine whether or not rDiAg directly binds to rsCD40. The purified rDiAg and rsCD40L were immobilized on a 96-well plate and incubated with rsCD40-Ig and rsTNFR-Ig and then detected by incubating with anti-IgG Fc antibody. The specificity of binding was determined by competition with the excess of ligands added with the rsCD40. The purified rDiAg and rsCD40L were able to bind rsCD40-Ig in an immobilized ligand concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5 a), but rDiAg and rsCD40L were not able to bind rsTNFR-Ig (Fig. 5 b). To confirm whether the IgE-inductive and cell proliferation effects were due to CD40 agonist properties of DiAg, we compared the effects of DiAg in wild-type and CD40-deficient mice (30Kawabe T. Naka T. Yoshida K. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kisimoto T. Kikutani H. Immunity. 1994; 1: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) (Strain Name: B6.129P2-Tnfrsf5tm1Kik, Jackson Laboratory). The serum immunoglobulin levels of control and CD40-deficient mice are shown in Fig. 1. Basal serum levels of IgE in CD40-deficient mice were not significantly different from those in wild-type mice (Fig.1 a; day 0). CD40-deficient mice were infused with rDiAg or ovalbumin as a control. Total IgE production of wild-type mice was already significant at 14 days and was maximal at 21 days after administration of rDiAg (Fig. 1 a). On day 21 after administration, total and specific IgE production of ovalbumin was slightly increased, but DiAg-specific IgE production was not detected (Fig. 1 b). In contrast, total IgE production of CD40-deficient mice was completely absent. MLN-B cells were purified from CD40-deficient mice or wild-type mice to assess their ability to respond to stimulation of DiAgin vitro. As shown in Table I, MLN-B cells from CD40-deficient and wild-type mice exhibited comparable proliferative responses to LPS. MLN-B cells from wild-type mice stimulated with rDiAg showed enhanced proliferative responses. In contrast, MLN-B cells from CD40-deficient mice stimulated with rDiAg did not show such enhanced proliferation. It is known (30Kawabe T. Naka T. Yoshida K. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kisimoto T. Kikutani H. Immunity. 1994; 1: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) that B cells from CD40-deficient mice and wild-type mice exhibited commensurable proliferative responses to LPS, anti-IgM, and IL-4, although only CD40L did not respond to B cell from the CD40-deficient mice. This result resemble to our results of MLN-B cells responses by DiAg.Table ICD40-deficient mice MLN-B cell proliferative responsesStimulusWild-typeCD40-deficient%None100.0 (0.9)100.0 (1.0)rDiAg 3 μg/ml179.3 (2.4)95.1 (2.0)rDiAg 10 μg/ml251.7 (1.4)99.5 (1.4)LPS 10 μg/ml613.8 (2.6)175.1 (2.3)MLN-B cells were freshly prepared from small intestine of wild-type or CD40-deficient mice.

Data are shown as the mean % (± SE) of four samples from separate animals. Dendritic cells are professional antigen-presenting cells that are specialized in the initiation of T cell-dependent immune responses. It is known that human dendritic cells (DC) secrete high levels of TNF-α and IL-12 upon either activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CD40 engagement (31Kato T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 181: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The addition of IL-10 during DC stimulation profoundly inhibited the production of the cytokines by LPS-activated DC (32Buelenes C. Verhasselt V. Groote D.D. Thielemans K. Goldman M. Willems F. Eur.

In contrast, when DCs were activated by co-culture with CD40L transfectants, TNF-α were not significantly affected by the addition of IL-10, but IL-12 levels were markedly decreased (32Buelenes C.

It is also known that antigen-presenting THP-1 cell lines produce proinflammatory cytokines (23Yoshimoto T. Nagase H. Ishida T. Inoue J. Nariuchi H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) such as IL-12 and TNF-α by CD40L stimulation. We found that rDiAg directly stimulated a human immune cell line, THP-1 cell, and induced proinflammatory cytokine production. When THP-1 cells were stimulated with rDiAg or recombinant human soluble CD40L (rsCD40L), IL-12 and TNF-α were induced. These results demonstrate that human antigen-presenting cells show similar responses to both CD40L and rDiAg. And the production of IL-12 was inhibited by addition of recombinant human soluble CD40 (rsCD40). rDiAg-induced cytokine production was not due to contamination of LPS in the preparation of recombinant protein for the following three reasons. First, the level of LPS within rDiAg, as revealed by Endotoxin Test-D (Seikagaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), was below the detectable limit (sensitivity: 0.0058 enzyme units; 2 pg/ml ≤;). Second, C3H/HeJ mice, which are nonresponsive to LPS, responded to rDiAg as well as wild-type C3H/HeN mice (data not shown). Third, rDiAg activity was not affected by addition of polymixin B, an inhibitor of LPS (data not shown). rsCD40L competitively inhibited rDiAg binding to the membrane of these cells. 125I-rDiAg or 125I-rsCD40L bound to the cell membrane fraction, and this binding was competitively inhibited by addition of rsCD40L or rDiAg. Moreover, rDiAg bound directly to rsCD40. rDiAg was not affected in CD40-deficient mice. The experimental evidence (30Kawabe T. Naka T. Yoshida K. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kisimoto T. Kikutani H. Immunity. 1994; 1: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) with the CD40-deficient mice showed that the in vivo T cell-dependent immunoglobulin class switching but not the T cell-independent antibody responses is affected. Our results showed that polyclonal IgE induction by DiAg was affected in CD40-deficient mice. It means that DiAg induced polyclonal IgE by the mechanism that is not the T cell-independent antibody responses. If DiAg induces the class switching by the signals other than via CD40 molecules, DiAg induces polyclonal IgE production in CD40-deficient mice. Therefore, DiAg might induce the IgE class switching via the CD40 molecule with the IL-4. We concluded that DiAg is an agonist for human CD40. DiAg nonspecifically activates B cells through CD40 and secretes a large amount of polyclonal IgE antibodies. Antigen-nonspecific polyclonal IgE may be involved in the survival of the invading parasitic helminth. On the other hand, DiAg might interfere with the antigen-specific helper T cell activation by the CD40-CD40L binding. However, IL-4 is necessary for the IgE class switching and the differentiation into the Th2 cells, and the activation by DiAg are indispensable. DiAg might stimulate IL-4 production by Th2 cells in an as-yet-undefined manner. Armitage (22Armitage R.J. Tough T.W. Macduff B.M. Fanslow W.C. Spriggs M.K. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Eur. J.

This response is accompanied by the production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 but is largely IL-2 independent. These data demonstrated that CD40L is a T cell stimulatory factor, which may play an important role in interaction between T cells following activation through helminth infection. As an agonist of CD40, DiAg might be a T cell-stimulatory factor in the same manner as CD40L. In fact, low-level CD40 expression has previously been reported on some human T cell lines and gibbon T cell lymphomas (33Ware C.F. Crowe P.D. Vanarsdale T.L. Andrews J.L. Grayson M.H. Jrezy R.

During its several hundred million years of coexistence with a host, the helminth may have acquired the means to escape attack from the host immune system. To escape the host immune system, the parasitic helminth might have acquired the analogue of CD40L. As for the homologues of DiAg (36Spence H.J. Moore J. Brass A. Kennedy M.W. Mol. Biochem.

These homologues are called polyproteins, which consist of repeating units including a cluster of tetra-basic amino acid sequences. The repeating units of all polyproteins might have agonistic effects for CD40. In fact, we found that a recombinant ABA-1 (Ascaris lumbricoides polyprotein) has similar biological activity to rDiAg (data not shown). The preservation of a similar protein by numerous species might indicate that the protein plays an important role. It has been reported that ABA-1 has other biological activities, including binding to small lipids (40Xia Y. Spence H.J. Moore J. Heaney N. Mcdermott L. Cooper A. Watson D.G. Mei B. Komuniecki R. Kennedy M.W. Parasitology. 2000; 120: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the binding to the lipid induces the production of IgE in B cells, or whether it induces the cytokine production in monocyte cell lines. The maximum K d value of binding to the lipid of recombinant ABA-1 is about 1 mm, and its binding affinity is low. Such binding power is not sufficient to explain the specific biological activity on the part of this polyprotein. The binding of rDiAg to CD40 occurs with relatively high affinity and could explain the specificity of the immune responses by rDiAg. The homology between the amino acid sequences of DiAg and sCD40L is not high. In the isoelectric point forecast from the amino acid sequence, rDiAg was 8.5 and rsCD40L was 9.5. There was little similarity in the presumable secondary structure between the two peptides (data not shown). It has been reported that the soluble recombinant form of CD40L has a trimeric structure (21Mazzei G.J. Edgerton M.D. Losberger C. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Garber P. Durandy A. Gauchat J-F. Bernard A. Allet B. Bonnefoy J-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7025-7028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and that the three-dimensional structure of rDiAg might be similar to the trimeric structure of sCD40L. It is known that the anti-CD40 antibody often shows agonistic activity. Such foreign proteins as anti-CD40 antibodies and rDiAg might show agonistic activity, since the ligand recognition of the CD40 molecule is a little vague. The similarity of the responses of DiAg between humans and rodents shows that specificity in the interspecies of CD40 is low. It is not unusual for numerous species to share in common a molecule that serves a similar function. We hypothesize that DiAg is a molecule newly acquired to maintain the species by the process of evolution within the special environment of parasitism. The potential role of the CD40/CD40L engagement is very important, and many immunologists have been engaged in the study of this molecule in recent years. The helminth can be said to have recognized the importance of this molecule for several hundred million years. And indeed, it is quite a feat to have acquired such a molecule for the purpose of evading the host immune system. The parasitic helminth may have acquired the ability to escape the host immune system through evolutionary acquisition of CD40 agonist. We thank Dr. M. Owhashi (University of Tokushima) for discussions and for providing the DiNCF cDNA used in this study."

The PLC pathway involves two important second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, released by cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). The PI3K pathway involves the activation of some membrane-trafficking proteins and enzymes such as the phosphoinositide-dependent kinases, protein kinase B, and S6 kinases by the key second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) (6Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). PI(3,4,5)P3 is generated from PI(4,5)P2 through phosphorylation at the D3 position of the inositol ring by PI3Ks that are linked to tyrosine-based receptors or G proteins. A fundamental link between the two distinct signaling pathways results because each utilizes primarily the same substrate, PI(4,5)P2. However, PI(4,5)P2 is the product of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks). PI4K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the 4′ position to produce phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI(4)P), which is then converted to PI(4,5)P2 by PIP5K (8Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Because synthesis, degradation, and subsequent resynthesis of the phosphoinositides form a metabolic cycle, it should be expected that there might be equilibrium among PI(4,5)P2, PI(4)P, and PI in resting cells. If PLC and PI3K were activated by the fMLP stimulation in cells such as neutrophils, was there enough PI(4,5)P2 available for initiating the PLC pathway or PI3K pathway fully? In other words, is a concomitant activation of PI4K needed to produce additional PI(4)P and its converted PI(4,5)P2 for the activated PLC or PI3K to utilize? Up until now, there has been no such an investigation reported.There have been a number of investigations showing the key role played by PI3K in the fMLP-activated neutrophil (9Traynor-Kaplan A.E.

However, little is known about the role of PI4K in the activation of neutrophils. To study PI4K, some specific inhibitor of PI4K may be necessary. Wortmannin is known to be an effective inhibitor of PI3K and has been employed as an alternative mode to classify PI4K. It was also reported that multiple isoforms of PI4K existed (13Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Some of the isomers, such as type III enzymes, PI4K230 and PI4K92, are wortmannin-sensitive and can be inhibited half-maximally at a higher concentration of wortmannin (submicromolar concentration) (14Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 15Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Some of the isomers, such as type II enzyme, the 55-kDa forms, are insensitive to wortmannin (16Downing G.J. Stanley K. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The wortmannin-sensitive and -insensitive PI4K might both be involved in the agonist-stimulated polyphosphoinositide turnover. Although wortmannin could inhibit the activity of some isoforms of PI4K, its strong inhibitory effect on PI3K would obscure the role of PI4K. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO) has been used as an inhibitor of PI4K to examine the participation of PI4K in nerve growth factor retrograde axonal transport within sympathetic and sensory neurons (17Reynolds A.J. Heydon K. Bartlett S.E. Hendry I.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It was reported that PAO inhibited the production of PI(4)P by interfering with the activity of PI4K (18Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and inhibited the endocytosis of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting PI4K activity (19Sorensen S.D. Liseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Heacock A.M. Fisher S.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 827-836PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specificity of PAO was not checked carefully. In this study, PAO and a monoclonal antibody directed against type II PI4K were used to study the role of type II PI4K in the fMLP-simulated respiratory burst in human neutrophils. The specificity of both PAO and the monoclonal antibody was investigated.DISCUSSIONIncreasing evidence has accumulated to show that the macromolecules of molecular mass in the range of several tens to several hundred kDa can penetrate the cell surface and enter the cytosol by endocytosis. It has been reported that125I-labeled bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) can be internalized into growing astrocytes in primary culture and return to the extracellular space after cycling (28Megias L. Guerri C. Fornas E. Azorin I. Bendala E. Sancho-Tello M. Duran J.M. Tomas M. Gomez-Lechon M.J. Renau-Piqueras J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 209-221PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins caveolin, clathrin, rab5, and β-COD were claimed by the authors to be involved in endocytosis. In addition, several investigators have reported the internalization of horseradish peroxidase (44 kDa) in NIHK 3025 cells (29Berg K. Selbo P.K. Prasmickaite L. Tjelle T.E. Sandvig K. Moan J. Gaudernack G. Foodstad O. Kjolsrud S. Anholt H. Rodal G.H. Rodal S.K. Hogset A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1180-1183PubMed Google Scholar) and goldfish intestinal epithelium (30Kiliaan A.J. Scholten G. Bijlsma P.B. Dekker K. Groot J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 28: 551-556Google Scholar). Similar to the antibody used in this study, the uptake of the IgG complex (150–200 kDa) by macrophages was also reported (24Mattana J. Sankaran R.T. Singhal P.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 14: 7529-7540Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed a gradual accumulation of the fluorescence-labeled PI4K antibody in the cytosol of neutrophils after the antibody was added to the cell-containing buffer in terms of digital fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence microscopic imaging of the cells clearly shows that the antibody does enter the cells from extracellular space with a slow time course. The time course seems consistent with the dependence of either the inhibition of the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst or the activation of PI4K on the time that cells were preincubated with the antibody (see Fig. 2). The latter not only indicates that a certain period of time is needed for enough antibody to enter into cells, but also that the internalized antibody can function as an inhibitor for the respiratory burst and inactivator of PI4K in cells.The measured effects of PAO and the PI4K antibody on both the respiratory burst and the activity of PI4K in fMLP-stimulated cells demonstrate that both of them inhibit the respiratory burst by inactivating PI4K. However, PAO inhibits not only the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst, but also PMA (a direct activator of protein kinase C)-stimulated one, which indicates that PAO inhibits the respiratory burst not only by inhibiting PI4K but also by some other mechanism. In this regard, PAO may not be a specific inhibitor of PI4K. Fortunately, It was found that the antibody directed against type II PI4K inhibited the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst but not the respiratory burst stimulated by PMA. Although some nonspecific antibody effect on the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst was observed using the cells preincubated with human IgG as an irrelevant monoclonal antibody, the specificity of the monoclonal antibody in activating PI4K activity observed in this study seems reasonable and expectable. The PI4K activity measurements showed that only the PI4K antibody but not the IgG inhibited the activity of PI4K in the fMLP-stimulated neutrophils. The time course of PI4K activity with the antibody provides further evidence that more PI4Ks were inactivated when more PI4K antibodies were entered into cells. The assay of PI4K activities in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils showed that PAO seems more effective than the antibody in inactivating PI4K activity. This may because the used antibody can only inactivate the type II PI4K but not other isoforms of PI4K which may still provide some PI(4,5)P2 for either PI3K or PLC to utilize.It was interesting to notice that the inhibition of PI4K activity by the antibody was less than the inhibition of fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst by the antibody. For example, the antibody at a concentration of 20 ng/ml inhibited the cell response by about 70%, but PI4K activity was inhibited by only about 40%. This discrepancy may be because during the preincubation of cells with the antibody the PIP2 and/or PIP3 pools may be depleted to some extent by reduced replenishment of PI(4)P, then the inactivation of PI4K by the antibody and the depletion of existing PIP2and/or PIP3 in the pools together result in an inhibition of the cell response. Thus, the reduced activity of PI4K at the moment of fMLP stimulation partially accounts for the inhibition of the stimulated respiratory burst in the cells, and the depletion of the PIP2 and/or PIP3 pools accounts for the response as another part. In this study, the maximal inhibition of the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst by the PI4K antibody was found to be about 70%, and the maximal inactivation of PI4K activity was about 40% (see Figs. 2 and 3). It may be deduced that about 30% of the inhibition on the cell response by the antibody is possibly the result of the depletion in the PIP2 and/or PIP3pools.If we consider the PLC signaling and PI3K signaling as a whole, we may conclude that about 40% of the PI(4,5)P2 is promptly converted from PI by type II PI4K and PIP5K activated in the fMLP-activated neutrophils.This result may also suggest that the contribution of PI4K cannot be excluded from the role played by PI3K in signal transduction and that PI3K, PI4K, and PIP5K must be considered as an integrated family for the PI(3,4,5)P3-initiated signaling. In addition, PI4K and PIP5K also play a role in PLC signaling, for which some further investigation may be needed.

Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). PI(3,4,5)P3 is generated from PI(4,5)P2 through phosphorylation at the D3 position of the inositol ring by PI3Ks that are linked to tyrosine-based receptors or G proteins. A fundamental link between the two distinct signaling pathways results because each utilizes primarily the same substrate, PI(4,5)P2. However, PI(4,5)P2 is the product of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks). PI4K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the 4′ position to produce phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI(4)P), which is then converted to PI(4,5)P2 by PIP5K (8Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Because synthesis, degradation, and subsequent resynthesis of the phosphoinositides form a metabolic cycle, it should be expected that there might be equilibrium among PI(4,5)P2, PI(4)P, and PI in resting cells. If PLC and PI3K were activated by the fMLP stimulation in cells such as neutrophils, was there enough PI(4,5)P2 available for initiating the PLC pathway or PI3K pathway fully? In other words, is a concomitant activation of PI4K needed to produce additional PI(4)P and its converted PI(4,5)P2 for the activated PLC or PI3K to utilize? Up until now, there has been no such an investigation reported. There have been a number of investigations showing the key role played by PI3K in the fMLP-activated neutrophil (9Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Pmann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F.

Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Haslett C. Chilvers E.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of PI4K in the activation of neutrophils. To study PI4K, some specific inhibitor of PI4K may be necessary. Wortmannin is known to be an effective inhibitor of PI3K and has been employed as an alternative mode to classify PI4K. It was also reported that multiple isoforms of PI4K existed (13Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Some of the isomers, such as type III enzymes, PI4K230 and PI4K92, are wortmannin-sensitive and can be inhibited half-maximally at a higher concentration of wortmannin (submicromolar concentration) (14Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 15Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Some of the isomers, such as type II enzyme, the 55-kDa forms, are insensitive to wortmannin (16Downing G.J. Stanley K. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The wortmannin-sensitive and -insensitive PI4K might both be involved in the agonist-stimulated polyphosphoinositide turnover. Although wortmannin could inhibit the activity of some isoforms of PI4K, its strong inhibitory effect on PI3K would obscure the role of PI4K. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO) has been used as an inhibitor of PI4K to examine the participation of PI4K in nerve growth factor retrograde axonal transport within sympathetic and sensory neurons (17Reynolds A.J. Heydon K. Bartlett S.E. Hendry I.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It was reported that PAO inhibited the production of PI(4)P by interfering with the activity of PI4K (18Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and inhibited the endocytosis of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting PI4K activity (19Sorensen S.D. Liseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Heacock A.M. Fisher S.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 827-836PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specificity of PAO was not checked carefully. In this study, PAO and a monoclonal antibody directed against type II PI4K were used to study the role of type II PI4K in the fMLP-simulated respiratory burst in human neutrophils. The specificity of both PAO and the monoclonal antibody was investigated. DISCUSSIONIncreasing evidence has accumulated to show that the macromolecules of molecular mass in the range of several tens to several hundred kDa can penetrate the cell surface and enter the cytosol by endocytosis. It has been reported that125I-labeled bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) can be internalized into growing astrocytes in primary culture and return to the extracellular space after cycling (28Megias L. Guerri C. Fornas E. Azorin I. Bendala E. Sancho-Tello M. Duran J.M. Tomas M. Gomez-Lechon M.J. Renau-Piqueras J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 209-221PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins caveolin, clathrin, rab5, and β-COD were claimed by the authors to be involved in endocytosis. In addition, several investigators have reported the internalization of horseradish peroxidase (44 kDa) in NIHK 3025 cells (29Berg K. Selbo P.K. Prasmickaite L. Tjelle T.E. Sandvig K. Moan J. Gaudernack G. Foodstad O. Kjolsrud S. Anholt H. Rodal G.H. Rodal S.K. Hogset A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1180-1183PubMed Google Scholar) and goldfish intestinal epithelium (30Kiliaan A.J. Scholten G. Bijlsma P.B. Dekker K. Groot J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 28: 551-556Google Scholar). Similar to the antibody used in this study, the uptake of the IgG complex (150–200 kDa) by macrophages was also reported (24Mattana J. Sankaran R.T. Singhal P.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 14: 7529-7540Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed a gradual accumulation of the fluorescence-labeled PI4K antibody in the cytosol of neutrophils after the antibody was added to the cell-containing buffer in terms of digital fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence microscopic imaging of the cells clearly shows that the antibody does enter the cells from extracellular space with a slow time course. The time course seems consistent with the dependence of either the inhibition of the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst or the activation of PI4K on the time that cells were preincubated with the antibody (see Fig. 2). The latter not only indicates that a certain period of time is needed for enough antibody to enter into cells, but also that the internalized antibody can function as an inhibitor for the respiratory burst and inactivator of PI4K in cells.The measured effects of PAO and the PI4K antibody on both the respiratory burst and the activity of PI4K in fMLP-stimulated cells demonstrate that both of them inhibit the respiratory burst by inactivating PI4K. However, PAO inhibits not only the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst, but also PMA (a direct activator of protein kinase C)-stimulated one, which indicates that PAO inhibits the respiratory burst not only by inhibiting PI4K but also by some other mechanism. In this regard, PAO may not be a specific inhibitor of PI4K. Fortunately, It was found that the antibody directed against type II PI4K inhibited the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst but not the respiratory burst stimulated by PMA. Although some nonspecific antibody effect on the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst was observed using the cells preincubated with human IgG as an irrelevant monoclonal antibody, the specificity of the monoclonal antibody in activating PI4K activity observed in this study seems reasonable and expectable. The PI4K activity measurements showed that only the PI4K antibody but not the IgG inhibited the activity of PI4K in the fMLP-stimulated neutrophils. The time course of PI4K activity with the antibody provides further evidence that more PI4Ks were inactivated when more PI4K antibodies were entered into cells. The assay of PI4K activities in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils showed that PAO seems more effective than the antibody in inactivating PI4K activity. This may because the used antibody can only inactivate the type II PI4K but not other isoforms of PI4K which may still provide some PI(4,5)P2 for either PI3K or PLC to utilize.It was interesting to notice that the inhibition of PI4K activity by the antibody was less than the inhibition of fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst by the antibody. For example, the antibody at a concentration of 20 ng/ml inhibited the cell response by about 70%, but PI4K activity was inhibited by only about 40%. This discrepancy may be because during the preincubation of cells with the antibody the PIP2 and/or PIP3 pools may be depleted to some extent by reduced replenishment of PI(4)P, then the inactivation of PI4K by the antibody and the depletion of existing PIP2and/or PIP3 in the pools together result in an inhibition of the cell response. Thus, the reduced activity of PI4K at the moment of fMLP stimulation partially accounts for the inhibition of the stimulated respiratory burst in the cells, and the depletion of the PIP2 and/or PIP3 pools accounts for the response as another part. In this study, the maximal inhibition of the fMLP-stimulated respiratory burst by the PI4K antibody was found to be about 70%, and the maximal inactivation of PI4K activity was about 40% (see Figs. 2 and 3). It may be deduced that about 30% of the inhibition on the cell response by the antibody is possibly the result of the depletion in the PIP2 and/or PIP3pools.If we consider the PLC signaling and PI3K signaling as a whole, we may conclude that about 40% of the PI(4,5)P2 is promptly converted from PI by type II PI4K and PIP5K activated in the fMLP-activated neutrophils.This result may also suggest that the contribution of PI4K cannot be excluded from the role played by PI3K in signal transduction and that PI3K, PI4K, and PIP5K must be considered as an integrated family for the PI(3,4,5)P3-initiated signaling. In addition, PI4K and PIP5K also play a role in PLC signaling, for which some further investigation may be needed.

https://openalex.org/W2050570265,"The present study describes the distribution and properties of enzymes of the catabolic pathway of pyrimidine nucleotides in Riftia pachyptila, a tubeworm living around deep-sea hydrothermal vents and known to be involved in a highly specialized symbiotic association with a bacterium. The catabolic enzymes, 5′-nucleotidase, uridine phosphorylase, and uracil reductase, are present in all tissues of the worm, whereas none of these enzymatic activities were found in the symbiotic bacteria. The 5′-nucleotidase activity was particularly high in the trophosome, the symbiont-harboring tissue. These results suggest that the production of nucleosides in the trophosome may represent an alternative source of carbon and nitrogen for R. pachyptila, because these nucleosides can be delivered to other parts of the worm. This process would complement the source of carbon and nitrogen from organic metabolites provided by the bacterial assimilatory pathways. The localization of the enzymes participating in catabolism, 5′-nucleotidase and uridine phosphorylase, and of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase, shows a non-homogeneous distribution of these enzymes in the trophosome. The catabolic enzymes 5′-nucleotidase and uridine phosphorylase activities increase from the center of the trophosome to its periphery. In contrast, the anabolic enzymes aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase activities decrease from the center toward the periphery of the trophosome. We propose a general scheme of anatomical and physiological organization of the metabolic pathways of the pyrimidine nucleotides in R. pachyptila and its bacterial endosymbiont.

We propose a general scheme of anatomical and physiological organization of the metabolic pathways of the pyrimidine nucleotides in R. pachyptila and its bacterial endosymbiont. aspartate transcarbamylase dihydroorotase 2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid uracil reductase uridine phosphorylase p-nitrophenyl phosphate Riftia pachyptila is a tubeworm living in the close vicinity of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Pacific ocean (1Gaill F. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This organism thrives in a community that is almost completely isolated from the biosystems of the rest of the planet. In the vent environment these animals encounter both physical and chemical obstacles, such as elevated pressure, high temperature, and chemical toxicity. R. pachyptila is one of the dominant organisms adapted to this extreme environment, and its anatomical organization is shown in Fig.1 (2Jones M.L. Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash. 1981; 93: 1295-1313Google Scholar, 3Jones M.L. Science. 1981; 213: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The only tissue of the worm that is in direct contact with the surrounding water is the plume; this plume presents a large, highly vascularized surface, which allows an efficient exchange of metabolites and waste products between the environment and the animal. The other tissues are sequestered within the Riftia tube. The vestimentum is a muscle that the animal uses to position itself in the tube. The trophosome is located within the large sac made by the body wall and terminated by the opisthosome, and it is bathed by coelomic fluid (1Gaill F. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The trophosome tissue is densely colonized by a sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic endosymbiotic bacterium (4Cavanaugh C.M. Gardiner S.L. Jones M.L. Jannasch H.W. Waterbury J.B. Science. 1981; 213: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 5Felbeck H. Science. 1981; 213: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 6Nelson D.C. Fisher C.R. Karl D.M. The Microbiology of Deep-sea Hydrothermal Vents. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 125-167Google Scholar). The bacteria are estimated to represent between 15 and 35% of the total volume of the trophosome (4Cavanaugh C.M. Gardiner S.L. Jones M.L. Jannasch H.W. Waterbury J.B. Science. 1981; 213: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 7Powell M.A. Somero G.N. Biol. Bull. 1986; 171: 274-290Crossref Google Scholar). Most of the metabolite exchanges between the trophosome and the environment are mediated via the vascular system, whose obvious function is to supply host tissues with oxygen and to transport CO2, O2, H2S, NH3, and minerals to the bacteria. The transport of O2 and H2S is ensured by a high molecular weight hemoglobin (8Zal F. Lallier F.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8869-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In return, the bacteria produce metabolic energy from the oxidation of H2S and provide organic compounds as sources of carbon and nitrogen to the worm. In this manner, the nutritional organization involves specific metabolic exchanges between the two organisms. We reported recently (9Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B. Gaill F. Hervé G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23777-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. (Berlin). 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that the first three enzymes of the “de novo ” pathway of pyrimidine nucleotides biosynthesis, carbamyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase),1 and dihydroorotase (DHOase), are present only in the trophosome, and we demonstrated the bacterial origin of these enzymes. In contrast, the succeeding enzymes of de novo pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, are present in all the body parts of the worm as well as in the bacteria. Furthermore, analysis of the enzymes of the “salvage” pathway (cytidine deaminase, cytidine kinase, and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase) in the trophosome strongly suggested that they belong to the worm. Accordingly, none of these enzymatic activities were found in the isolated bacteria. These results indicate that the animal is fully dependent on the symbiont for the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines. The presence of the enzymes of the salvage pathway in all worm tissues suggests that the synthesis of pyrimidines is indeed possible in those tissues that lack bacteria by starting from intermediary metabolites provided by the trophosome or from the degradation of nucleic acids. Thus, the presence of the enzymes involved in the salvage pathway in worm tissues implies the presence of their substrates, nucleosides. Furthermore, these nucleosides might provide substrates not only for this pathway but also for the enzymes involved in their “catabolism” (11Berlin R.D. Olivier J.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1975; 42: 287-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this case the catabolism of nucleosides might represent a possible source of carbon and nitrogen for the worm. To study catabolism of the pyrimidine nucleotides in R. pachyptila, we investigated the presence of 5′-nucleotidase, uridine phosphorylase, and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (uracil reductase named uracilRase) in the different parts of the worm. 5′-Nucleotidase controls intracellular levels of nucleoside 5′-monophosphate by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the phosphate esterified on the 5′-carbon of the ribose and deoxyribose portions of nucleotide molecules (12Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). This is a key enzyme for both the salvage pathway and for catabolism because its enzymatic products, nucleosides, can be used in both pathways. Uridine phosphorylase (UPase) catalyzes phosphorolysis of uridine, resulting in the formation of uracil and ribose 1-phosphate (13Niedzwicki J.G. el Kouni M.H. Chu S.H. Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase catalyzes the further reduction of uracil to 5,6-dihydrouracil using NADPH as the reductant (14Podschun B. Wahler G. Schnackerz K.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After several enzymatic steps, 5,6-dihydrouracil is transformed into CO2, NH3, and malonyl-CoA (15Borel J.P. Maquart F.X. Le Peuch C. Randoux A. Gillery P. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Biochimie Dynamique. De Boeck Université, Paris1997: 773-785Google Scholar) which can be further metabolized. The results obtained here emphasize the possibility that pyrimidine catabolism can constitute a source of carbon and nitrogen for the worm. These results together with the data reported previously (9Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B. Gaill F. Hervé G. J. Biol.

Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The radioactively labeled substrates,l-[14C]aspartate (224.8 mCi/mmol), [2-14C]CMP (60.4 mCi/mmol), and [2-14C]UMP (46.1 mCi/mmol), were also purchased from Sigma. [14C]CTP (450 mCi/mmol) was purchased from the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France). Samples of theR. pachyptila were collected in the east Pacific volcanic range at a depth of 2600 m (Hope 99 cruise), using the submersible “Nautile,” and recovered in a seawater box for the trip to the surface. To preserve tissue identity and avoid interference with subsequent enzymatic tests, the specimens were immediately bled and dissected on board, and isolated organs were frozen in liquid nitrogen, as described previously (9Minic Z.

Immediately after collecting and bleeding the animal, the bacterial symbiont was purified by the method proposed by Distel and Felbeck (16Distel D.L. Felbeck H. Mar. Biol. (Berlin). 1987; 96: 97-106Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), under the conditions described previously (9Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B. Gaill F. Hervé G. J. Biol.

To test enzymatic activities in various zones of the trophosome, the frozen trophosome was dissected into central, middle, and exterior parts, each about 3 mm wide. These fractions were treated as described below for the preparation of the cell-free extracts. Protein extracts from all organs were freshly prepared before the enzyme assays. Frozen tissue (∼2 g) was suspended in 6 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm l-dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 4 μm sodium cacodylate, and the following protease inhibitors: 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg/ml EDTA, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to the extraction buffer for 5′-nucleotidase activity. The mixture was homogenized in a Potter homogenizer (Teflon pestle). The homogenate was disrupted further by sonication three times for 60 s each with a Biosonik III sonicator at 20 kilocycles/s. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 9000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting dialyzed supernatant was utilized for subsequent enzymatic assays. Pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase activity was assayed by following the conversion of [2-14C]UMP to [2-14C]uridine and [2-14C]CMP to [2-14C]cytidine, using a protocol similar to those of West and Beutler (17West J.T.C. Beutler E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1977; 90: 563-568PubMed Google Scholar) and Ellims et al. (18Ellims P.H. Bailey L. Van der Weyden B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1978; 88: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm[2-14C]UMP (0.45 mCi/mmol), or 0.5 mm[2-14C]CMP (0.3 mCi/mmol) and 50 μl of tissue extract (0.3–1.0 mg of protein) in a final volume of 150 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction for UMP-5′-nucleotidase was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 2 min, and the incubation mixture was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. The corresponding control was stopped at time 0. Aliquots of 50 μl of the reaction mixture were spotted on DE81 paper squares and dried at room temperature. The paper was transferred to a scintillation vial, and 2 ml of distilled water was added. The vial was then agitated in a shaker for 1 h; the paper was removed, and 8 ml of scintillant was added. After incubation of the reaction mixture for the assay of CMP-5′-nucleotidase, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.3 ml of 0.15m Ba(OH)2, 0.3 ml of 0.15 mZnSO4, and 750 μl of water. Controls were stopped at time 0. The activity for CMP-5′-nucleotidase was determined as described in the protocol of West and Beutler (17West J.T.C. Beutler E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1977; 90: 563-568PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate specificity studies for 5′-nucleotidase were performed as described in the protocol by Niedzwiecka and Jaroszewicz (19Niedzwiecka J. Jaroszewicz L. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 221: 471-476Google Scholar). The UPase assay (20Scocca J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was performed by spectrophotometric measurement. The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.9, 5 mm l-dithiothreitol, 10 mmuridine, and protein extract (0.3–1.0 mg of protein). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.8 ml of 0.01 m NaOH. The absorbance at 290 nm was determined and corrected for a blank that had been stopped at zero time. Specific activity was calculated from the change of absorbance during the first 30 min, using an extinction coefficient for uracil of 5.7 mm−1 cm−1. Enzyme activity for this reaction was determined at 37 °C by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanied the conversion of NADPH to NADP+(21Schmitt U. Jahnke K. Rosenbaum K. Cook P.F. Schnackerz K.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 200 μm NADPH, 250 μmuracil, and protein extract (0.5–1.5 mg of protein) in a final volume of 2 ml. The reaction was initiated with uracil and run against a blank containing the identical reaction mixture without uracil. The extinction coefficient used for the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ was 6.22 mm−1cm−1. The aspartate transcarbamylase activity was measured by the radioactive method (9Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B.

Hervé G. Mar. Biol. (Berlin). 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The standard conditions were 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm l-[14C]aspartate (0.3 mCi/mmol), and 10 mm carbamylphosphate. The reaction mixture was incubated 30 min at 37 °C. The DHOase activity was measured by the spectrophotometric method adapted by Minic et al. (9Minic Z. Simon V. Penverne B. Gaill F. Hervé G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23777-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The buffer system used to determine the pH dependence of the enzyme activity was composed of 51 mmdiethanolamine, 51 mmN-ethylmorpholine, and 100 mm MES (22Léger D. Hervé G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4293-4298Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The tri-buffer system covers the entire range of pH, without significant change of ionic strength. The pH dependence assay for UPase was carried out in 100 mmpotassium phosphate. The hydrolysis products of CTP were determined by an adaptation of the protocol of Papas (23Papas P.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Each assay reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm (0.2 mCi/mmol) [14C]CTP, and 10 mg of protein extract in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was carried out for 3 h at 37 °C and terminated by heating the reaction mixture to 90 °C for 60 s and immediate cooling in an ice bath. A 500-μl aliquot of reaction mixture was injected on a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (Sigma) column (1.5 × 6 cm) to separate unhydrolyzed CTP from its hydrolyzed products. Products of hydrolysis were washed from the column with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), first alone and then with a discontinuous gradient of 0–0.4 mCH3COONH4. Individual fractions were counted for radioactivity, and the peaks for each fraction containing cytosine, CMP, CDP, and CTP were expressed as percent of total radioactivity. The soluble protein extract of trophosome or vestimentum in a volume of 0.5–1.0 ml (20 mg) was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) anion-exchange column (1.5 × 1.6 cm). Proteins were then eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl in presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.8), first alone and then with a 0–0.5 m NaCl discontinuous gradient. One-ml fractions were collected and assayed for 5′-nucleotidase activity. Total protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (see Ref. 24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin dissolved in extraction buffer as the standard. In a first attempt to study the degradation of nucleotides in R. pachyptila, we tested the hydrolysis of CTP by the dialyzed cell-free extracts of various tissues of the worm. The results reported in Table I show the production of CDP, CMP, and cytidine in all tissues tested. The degradation to CMP can result from the presence of enzymes such as phosphatases and pyrophosphatases (25Zimmermann H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), whereas the hydrolysis of CMP into cytidine results from the action of a 5′-nucleotidase (12Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). These enzymes are present in all the tissues. The proportion of CMP and cytidine obtained with the trophosome extract suggests the presence of a high nucleotidase activity in this tissue. In contrast, by using the bacterial extract, only a very small degradation of CTP and no production of cytidine were observed, indicating that the bacterial symbiont would possess phosphatase and/or pyrophosphatase but no nucleotidase activity. On the basis of these results, we focused the analysis on 5′-nucleotidase and the two subsequent enzymes in the catabolism of pyrimidine nucleotides, UPase and uracilRase.Table IDetermination of the CTP hydrolysis products in various body parts of R. pachyptilaBody partHydrolysis productsCytidineCMPCDP%Branchial plume51724Vestimentum181142Trophosome32731Body wall4638Opisthosome201320Blood9618Isolated bacteriaND57Samples of 10 mg of dialyzed protein extracts of various body parts ofR. pachyptila were incubated with 0.1 mm CTP at pH 8.5 for 3 h at 37 °C.

The results of analyses on the distribution of the activities of 5′-nucleotidase, UPase, and uracilRase are given in Table II. All three enzymatic activities were present in all tissues of the host. A very high UPase activity was found in the body wall. In contrast, this tissue exhibited very low 5′-nucleotidase activity. This 5′-nucleotidase activity was especially high in the trophosome. However, the isolated bacteria did not exhibit any activity for these enzymes of the catabolic pathway, in accordance with the result reported above for 5′-nucleotidase.Table IIActivities of the specific enzymes that participate in the catabolism of pyrimidine nucleotides in the host tissues and isolated bacteria of R. pachyptilaBody partSpecific activities5′-NucleotidaseUPaseUracilRaseUMPCMPnmol/min/mg proteinBranchial plume0.14 ± 0.13 (3)0.26 ± 0.23 (3)0.78 ± 0.15 (3)1.63 ± 0.57 (3)Vestimentum0.25 ± 0.11 (3)0.32 ± 0.05 (3)1.58 ± 0.16 (3)1.76 ± 0.73 (3)Trophosome0.50 ± 0.09 (3)0.53 ± 0.10 (3)0.34 ± 0.12 (3)0.78 ± 0.38 (3)Body wall0.05 ± 0.02 (3)0.04 ± 0.02 (3)7.33 ± 1.73 (3)1.38 ± 0.39 (3)Opisthosome0.21 ± 0.19 (3)0.36 ± 0.24 (3)0.20 ± 0.09 (3)1.64 ± 0.59 (3)Isolated bacteriaNDNDNDNDSee “Experimental Procedures” for the experimental details.

Although none of these enzymatic activities were detected in the bacterial extracts, we sought to obtain information on the origin of these three catabolic enzymes in the trophosome. The pH activity profiles of 5′-nucleotidase, UPase, and uracilRase determined in trophosome were compared with those of the enzymes present in another host tissue, the vestimentum. The results obtained are presented in Fig. 2. The profiles of UPase and uracilRase were identical in these two tissues. Taken together with the lack of these activities in the bacteria, these results indicate that these two enzymes belong to the host. In contrast, the pH profiles of 5′-nucleotidase in these two tissues were different, suggesting the presence of different enzymes. Consequently, the 5′-nucleotidase activity was further investigated. The results presented above show important differences between the different tissues of Riftia in terms of 5′-nucleotidase activity (Table II). However, it is known that 5′-nucleotidase is strongly inhibited in crude protein extracts by physiological inhibitors (26Neu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3905-3911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Uchino K. Ogawara H. Akiyama T. Fukuchi A. Shibata S. Takahashi K. Narui T. J. Antibiot.

To determine whether the differences observed result from the presence of such inhibitors in some tissues, the 5′-nucleotidase activity was measured in the extracts of the various parts ofRiftia after ion-exchange chromatography, a method that was shown previously to separate the enzyme and the inhibitors (26Neu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3905-3911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Uchino K. Ogawara H. Akiyama T. Fukuchi A. Shibata S. Takahashi K. Narui T. J. Antibiot.

Two peaks of 5′-nucleotidase activity were observed. TableIII shows the activities corresponding to these two peaks that were detected in all tissues tested, except that peak II was absent in the branchial plume. It appears that under these conditions the highest 5′-nucleotidase activity was again found in the trophosome, particularly in peak II. However, 5′-nucleotidase activity was not observed in the absence of Triton X-100. This would indicate that the two detected 5′-nucleotidase peaks of activity belong to membrane proteins.Table IIIProportion of the two peaks of 5′-nucleotidase activity in the different body parts of R. pachyptilaBody partActivitiesPeak IPeak IITotalnmol/minBranchial plume2.7ND2.7Vestimentum19.16.425.5Trophosome22.0113.5135.5Body wall1.95.97.8Opisthosome12.914.227.1Blood5.25.310.5The protein extract of each body tissues of R. pachyptila(20 mg of protein) was chromatographed on a 1.5 × 1.6-cm DEAE-Sepharose column as reported in Fig. 3.

The presence of two peaks of activity is illustrated in Fig.3 in the cases of trophosome and the vestimentum. In these experiments all the tissues exhibited the two peaks of 5′-nucleotidase at the same position, suggesting a common host origin for both enzymes. Since it was observed previously that the pH activity profiles of the 5′-nucleotidase present in the trophosome and in the vestimentum were different, the dependence on pH of the two peaks of 5′-nucleotidase activity was determined in the trophosome and in the vestimentum. Fig.4 (A and B) shows that the corresponding peaks of the two types of tissues show the same pH profiles. These findings provide additional evidence that the two 5′-nucleotidase activities present in the trophosome belong to the host. The difference in the pH activity profiles of the trophosome and vestimentum crude extracts (Fig. 2) might result from the presence of different proportions of these two enzyme species in the extracts (Table III). The activity of 5′-nucleotidase produces nucleosides, metabolites that can be used by both the pyrimidine and purine salvage metabolic pathways and the catabolic pathway. Such a key role could explain the high level of this enzyme found in the trophosome. Furthermore, it is well known that nucleoside monophosphates can be hydrolyzed not only by nucleotidase"
