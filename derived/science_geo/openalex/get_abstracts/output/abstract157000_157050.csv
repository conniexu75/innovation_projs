Here we report that inH. pylori infection p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) activates NF-κB. Activated PAK1 associates with NF-κB-inducing kinase, which upon activation directs the activity of IκB kinases to IκBα. Our results indicate that in epithelial cells PAK1 participates in a unique pathway that links H. pylori-dependent effector molecules to the activation of NF-κB and the induction of the innate immune response.

The liberated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)1 dimers are translocated to the nucleus, where they activate transcription of target genes (1Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Key components of the intracellular signal transduction pathways regulating NF-κB activation are represented by NIK (2Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) and the IκB kinases (IKKs) (3Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ are the catalytic subunits of a protein kinase complex that phosphorylates IκB molecules (4Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). IKKγ (or NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)) represents the regulatory subunit (5Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). We have studied the mechanism of NF-κB activation in response to human pathogenic Helicobacter pylori in epithelial cells where NF-κB, one of the main activators of the inflammatory response, triggers the induction of immune function including cytokine/chemokine production, growth control, and apoptosis (1Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The epithelial cytokine/chemokine response is particularly important in the early stages of H. pylori-induced inflammation and is often followed by diseases like gastritis, peptic ulcer (7Blaser M.J. Gastroenterology. 1987; 93: 371-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gastric cancer (rarely), and low grade B-cell mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue gastric lymphoma (8Parsonnet J. Hansen S. Rodriguez L. Gelb A.B. Warnke R.A. Jellum E. Orentreich N. Vogelman J.H. Friedman G.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). The major disease-associated, genetic difference in H. pylori strains is the presence or absence of a pathogenicity island (PAI) containing 31 genes, which code for proteins involved in a specialized type IV secretion machinery (9Covacci A. Telford J.L. Del Giudice G. Parsonnet J. Rappuoli R. Science. 1999; 284: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). H. pylori infection modulates the host cells by bacterial protein translocation. Several groups have recently shown for the first time that H. pylori translocates the CagA protein by a type IV secretion system. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA induces changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of proteins in the epithelial cell (10Segal E.D. Cha J. Lo J. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 11Stein M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 2000; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Knockouts of certain PAI genes (CagA, CagF, and CagN), which are not necessary for the functional integrity of the type IV secretion apparatus, suppress or reduce the activation of NF-κB (15Glocker E. Lange C. Covacci A. Bereswill S. Kist M. Pahl H.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2346-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and affect the secretion of cytokines/chemokines (16Bodger K. Crabtree J.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus the integrity of the type IV secretion machinery is an absolute requirement for NF-κB activation in H. pylori infection. The identity of the effector molecule(s) of H. pylori and the mechanism of integration of the signals that induce NF-κB are not known so far. Therefore, we examined the mechanism of the H. pylori-induced activation of proinflammatory cytokine genes in the course of NF-κB activation in detail. Gastric epithelial cells (AGS) and 293 or HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 4 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. 16 h before infection, the medium was replaced by fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum. The H. pylori P12 strain or the PAI strain (17Wessler S. Höcker M. Fischer W. Wang T. Rosewicz S. Haas R. Wiedenmann B. Meyer T. Naumann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3629-3636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was cultured for 48–72 h on agar plates containing 10% horse serum in a microaerophilic atmosphere (generated by Campy Gen, Oxoid) at 37 °C. For the infection, the cell monolayer (50–70% confluence) was incubated with the bacteria to the multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 50 for different periods of time. Infection with H. pylori was routinely monitored by light microscopy. Nuclear extracts were prepared by using a nonionic detergent method as described previously (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Detection of NF-κB was performed with a [α-32P]dATP-labeled Igκ oligo probe containing the NF-κB recognition site. The DNA binding reactions were performed with 20 μl of binding buffer (2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmHEPES, pH 8.4, 60 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at 30 °C. For competition experiments, the cold oligonucleotide probe was used, and supershift analysis was performed using antibodies against p65, p50, or c-Rel (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The reaction products were analyzed via 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12.5 mm Tris, 12.5 mm boric acid, and 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.3. The gels were dried and exposed to Amersham TM film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA with Superscript IIRT (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) primers. Amplification of cytokine cDNAs and β-actin cDNA as an internal control in each reaction was carried out by polymerase chain reaction with the primers as described previously (19Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Meyer T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A subsaturating number of cycles allowed a semi-quantitative analysis within the infection kinetics. For inhibition of IκBα degradation by the 26 S proteasome, the cells were preincubated for 60 min using 10 μmlactacystin (Affiniti) before the bacteria were added. Polymerase chain reaction products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis. Transactivating activity of NF-κB was analyzed in 293 or HeLa cells by cotransfection of a luciferase expression plasmid (400 ng) containing three repeats of the NF-κB human immunodeficiency virus-binding site and expression constructs using cationic liposomes (DAC-30, Eurogentec). 16 h after transfection cells were infected with H. pylori, treated with 10 ng ml−1 tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (Promega), or left untreated. Luciferase assays were performed 3–4 h after treatment as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The data presented are representative of more than three independent experiments. A pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega) was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. The results were recorded on a Wallac 409 β-counter (Berthold-Wallac) and given as fold induction or as percent induction compared with the control. From the radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 4 μm aprotinin) lysed cell immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-α-PAK (sc-881, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IKKα (Pharmingen), anti-IKKβ (BIOSOURCE), anti-Ha (sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Vsv (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-Myc (Pharmingen), or anti-Flag (Sigma) antibodies. The immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were separated via SDS-PAGE and blotted as described previously (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was achieved with antibodies as indicated (anti-α-PAK1, sc-882 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-IκBα, sc-847 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-NEMO (BIOSOURCE), etc.). For in vitro kinase reactions, immunocomplexes were recovered, washed, and incubated with the kinase buffer (100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 6 mm MgCl2, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) using 2.5 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology) and 0.5 μg of IκBα (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) as substrates for PAK1 and IKKs, respectively. The samples were separated via SDS-PAGE and dried, and phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Equal amounts of the total lysates were analyzed in an immunoblot to indicate equivalent protein amounts in all lanes.In vitro translation was performed using a TNT kit (Promega), and coimmunoprecipitation was performed with translation reactions diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. AGS cells (neuroendocrine differentiated gastric carcinoma cells) infected with H. pylori or treated with TNFα for various periods of times, fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear components, and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay show an equivalent increase of NF-κB DNA binding activity within 90 and 10 min, respectively (Fig. 1 a, lanes 1–9). The H. pylori-induced binding activity was strongly reduced and partially super-shifted when anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies were used, whereas an anti-c-Rel antiserum or preimmune serum did not show a reduction (Fig. 1 a, lanes 10–13). The specificity of the DNA binding activity was examined by adding increasing amounts of the non-labeled double-stranded Igκ oligonucleotide for competition (Fig. 1 a, lanes 14–16). In contrast to the wild type H. pylori strain, an isogenic mutant strain (PAI, no expression of the type IV secretion machinery) did not show NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 a,lanes 17–19). This experiment excludes a role for lipopolysaccharide in H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation in epithelial cells. To determine whether NF-κB activation is sustained at later stages of the infection, we studied H. pylori infection up to 6 h after infection. Maximal DNA binding of NF-κB was observed between 90 and 180 min after infection and was not detectable later than 240 min after infection (Fig. 1 a, lanes 20–22). De novo protein synthesis was not required for H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation (data not shown). Furthermore, H. pyloriinfection or TNFα stimulation led to a rapid loss of IκBα as analyzed in an immunoblot (Fig. 1 b). To assess changes in cytokine gene expression, AGS cells were challenged to infection withH. pylori. Cytokine mRNA expression was determined at different time points after infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of total RNA prepared from infected cells. The cytokine mRNA levels were compared with the constitutive β-actin mRNA in the same polymerase chain reactions. Infection with H. pylori led to an increased synthesis of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNFα, and interleukin-8 as soon as 45 min after infection (Fig. 1 c, lanes 1–4). Treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin prior to H. pyloriinfection suppressed the cytokine mRNA expression (Fig. 1 c, lanes 5–8). The correlation of NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation, which is blocked by a proteasome inhibitor, demonstrates that cytokine/chemokine genes are indeed subject to a coordinate cellular regulation in response toH. pylori infection. To address whether H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation involves IKK activity, we tested the ability ofH. pylori to induce phosphorylation of endogenous IKKs. AGS cells were infected for the indicated periods of time. IKKα or IKKβ (Fig. 2, a and b) were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with appropriate antibodies and analyzed subsequently in an in vitro kinase assay using IκBα as a substrate. H. pylori infection as well as TNFα treatment of cells resulted in increased IKKα (Fig. 2 a, lanes 1–8, upper panel) and IKKβ (Fig. 2 b, lanes 1–8, upper panel) kinase activity on the substrate IκBα. Compared withH. pylori-infected cells, TNFα-treated cells induced IKKα and IKKβ faster in the analyzed time course as expected. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of similar quantities of IKK proteins in each of the extracts used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2,a and b, lower panels). To analyze the ability of H. pylori to induce NF-κB transactivation activity, we tested the effects of activation ofH. pylori on the expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in transiently transfected 293 cells. H. pylori infection (MOI 50) or TNFα treatment of cells increased transcription of the reporter gene (Fig. 2 c). When we tested the effect of a kinase-inactive IKKβ(K44A) construct on the expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in transiently transfected and H. pylori-infected or TNFα-treated 293 cells, we observed suppression of NF-κB activation. This indicates thatH. pylori-induced NF-κB activation involves IKKβ (Fig. 2 d). For a control, we analyzed the effect of kinase-inactive MAP kinase kinase (MKK4(K116R)) on the H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation, which was not affected. Several kinases (e.g. NIK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), IKK-i, TANK-binding kinase 1/NF-κB-activating kinase, mixed-lineage kinase 3) have been shown to be signaling intermediates that act as direct activators of the IKK complex (2Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 20Lee F. Peters R. Dang L. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cellular selection of the kinases might be dependent on cell type specificity and distinct extracellular stimuli. To study the H. pylori-induced upstream kinase involved in activation of the IKK complex, we analyzed the role of NIK and the MEKK1 in H. pylori-induced expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in transiently transfected 293 cells. H. pylori- or TNFα-stimulated NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activity was suppressed when kinase-inactive mutants of NIK (NIK(624–947); NIK(K429A,K430A)) were expressed (Fig. 3 a). In contrast to kinase-inactive NIK, the kinase-inactive MEKK1(K432M) did not significantly block H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 a), whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced NF-κB activation was affected by MEKK1(K432M) (data not shown). These results suggest that H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation involves NIK but not MEKK1 in this kinase cascade and exclude a functional cooperation between those kinases in the activation of IKK activity. Compelling evidence that NIK is involved in the activation of NF-κB has been shown in response to CD40 and CD3/CD28 induction (25Garceau N. Kosaka Y. Masters S. Hambor J. Shinkura R. Honjo T. Noelle R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Lin X. Cunningham E. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our experimental evidence that the MAPK kinase kinase NIK represents a crucial factor in H. pylori-directed activation of the IKK complex led us to search for putative upstream regulators of NIK. Colinear amino acid sequence alignment of the kinase domain in NIK revealed homology to MEKK1 and Ste11 apart from other kinases, and Ste11 represents a downstream kinase of Ste20, the yeast homologue of mammalian PAK1 (27Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether PAK1, which is a stress response kinase of the MAPK kinase kinase kinase level, represents an upstream kinase for NIK. In AGS cells the activity of PAK1 was induced severalfold in response to pathophysiological stress raised by H. pylori infection. The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated PAK1 was measured with myelin basic protein as a substrate (Fig. 3 b, lanes 1–4, upper panel). TNFα weakly induced PAK1 (Fig. 3 b,lanes 5–7, upper panel). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of similar quantities of PAK1 in each of the extracts used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 b, lower panel). To study the mechanism of NF-κB activation, we analyzed whether PAK1 affects the H. pylori-induced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity. Kinase-inactive PAK1(K299R) blocked the expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in transiently transfected and H. pylori-infected 293 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 c). In contrast to H. pylori infection, kinase-inactive PAK1(K299R) only slightly affected the NF-κB transactivation activity in TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 3 c). To exclude possible effects on the putative upstream components of PAK1 due to titration of Rho-GTPases, we performed experiments with a PAK1(K299R) construct mutated in histidine 83 and 86, which prevents the binding of Rho-GTPases. This construct clearly blocked H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we used a PAK1 construct containing the residues 83–149. PAK1(83–149) has been demonstrated to inhibit the autophosphorylation of PAK1 by blocking a critical phosphoacceptor site that is required for its kinase activity and does not bind to Rac1 (28Zhao Z. Manser E. Chen X. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of this construct blocked H. pylori-induced activation of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 c). For a control, we transiently transfected a PAK1(83–149) construct with the leucine 107 to phenylalanine mutation (PAK1(83–149,L107F)), which inactivates the autoinhibitory domain of PAK1. This construct did not block H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation. To determine the signaling pathways that couple PAK1 to NF-κB activation, we tested whether kinase-inactive NIK(K429A,K430A) could block signaling from constitutive active PAK1(L107F) in transiently transfected HeLa cells. The inactive NIK mutant NIK(K429A,K430A) blocked the activation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression by PAK1(L107F), whereas overexpression of inactive PAK1 (PAK1(K299R) and PAK1(H83L,H86L,K299R)) had little effect on NIK-induced activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3 d). Our results raise the possibility that PAK1 may function as an activator of NIK to mediate NF-κB activation in H. pylori infection. To identify NIK as a potential downstream component of PAK1 in H. pylori infection, we studied the interaction of these kinases. AGS or HeLa cells were transfected with Ha-tagged PAK1 constructs or Flag-tagged NIK constructs. The kinases were then immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed in an immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. We observed interaction of Ha-PAK1(K299R) with Flag-NIK (Fig. 4 a, lane 1), high affinity interaction between Ha-PAK1(K299R) and Flag-NIK(K429A,K430A) (lane 2), and interaction of Ha-PAK1 with Flag-NIK(K429A,K430A) (lane 3). We also performed these experiments with constitutive active Ha-PAK1(L107F), which resulted in a detectable interaction with Flag-NIK(K429A,K430A) (lane 4). These results indicate that kinase-active PAK1 could target the MAPK kinase kinase NIK. In contrast to the PAK1/NIK interaction, we observed no direct interaction between PAK1 and the IKK complex components IKKα, IKKβ, or NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 4, b and c). Appropriate controls show that NIK interacted with IKKα (Fig. 4 b) and that IKKβ interacted with NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 4 c). Similar to the kinase-inactive PAK1(K299R), the constitutively active PAK1(L107F) did not interact with an IKK subunit (data not shown). To analyze endogenous PAK1/NIK interaction, we tried to derive HeLa cells stably expressing an epitope-tagged version of NIK. Unfortunately, cells which had integrated the NIK wild type cDNA did not survive. To circumvent this problem we transiently transfected small amounts of kinase-inactive Flag-NIK(K429A,K430A) in a titration experiment and determined an amount that still allowed interaction with activated PAK1 induced in H. pylori infection. Interestingly, H. pylori infection caused an inducible interaction of the endogenous PAK1 and the kinase-inactive Flag-NIK(K429A,K430A) (Fig. 4 d, lanes 2–4,upper panel), whereas the non-stimulated or TNFα-treated cells exhibited no PAK1/NIK interaction (lanes 1,5, and 6, upper panel). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of similar quantities of Flag-NIK and endogenous PAK1 in each of the extracts used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 d, middle and lower panels). To study whether this interaction is direct, we carried out an in vitro analysis using 35S-labeled proteins translated in wheat germ extracts. After cotranslation of Flag-NIK and HaPAK1 (Fig. 4 e, lane 1) followed by anti-Flag immunoprecipitation (lane 4), we detected PAK1 in the immunoprecipitate. The converse experiment of immunoprecipitation with an anti-Ha antibody allowed the detection of Flag-NIK in the immunoprecipitate (data not shown). Our results raised the possibility that PAK1 could function as the kinase that activates NIK in H. pylori infection. The analysis of H. pylori-infected cells, which were transfected with kinase-inactive NIK(K429A,K430A), resulted in the occurrence of an additional NIK form with a slightly decreased mobility in SDS-PAGE as detected in an immunoblot (Fig. 5 a, lane 2). When NIK(K429A,K430A) was expressed without H. pylori infection, this slower migrating form of NIK was weakly visible (Fig. 5 a, lane 1). Cells cotransfected with constitutive active PAK1(L107F) caused an accumulation of the more slowly migrating band of NIK(K429A,K430A) (Fig. 5 b,lane 4), whereas cotransfection with kinase-inactive PAK1(K299R) suppressed this slower band (lane 3). The upshifted band of NIK in H. pylori-infected cells was eliminated by λ phosphatase treatment (Fig. 5 a, lane 5), suggesting that it represented phosphorylated NIK. These data suggest that, once activated, PAK1 binds and phosphorylates NIK. To show that PAK1 is critical for H. pylori-induced activation of the IKK complex, IKKα was cotransfected with kinase-inactive PAK1(K299R), and the cells were either infected withH. pylori or stimulated with TNFα. Kinase assays of immunoprecipitated IKKα were performed, and the effect of kinase-inactive PAK1 on IKKα phosphorylation was analyzed (Fig. 5 b). Kinase-inactive PAK1(K299R) (Fig. 5 b, lane 5) as well as NIK(K429A,K430A) (lane 6) could efficiently block the H. pylori-induced IKKα phosphorylation (lane 4), whereas TNFα-induced IKKα phosphorylation (lane 2) was not blocked by PAK1(K299R) (lane 3). These findings strongly suggest that PAK1 and NIK represent crucial components in H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, like Cot/TPL2, TAK1(TAB1/TAB2), Raf, and PKCθ (26Lin X. Cunningham E. Mu Y.

The activation of the IKK complex by these kinases is indirect and involves other kinases or adaptor molecules, and not all signals proceed through IKKα. It has been shown that PKCθ-induced signaling targets IKKβ (35O'Mahony A. Lin X. Geleziunas R. Greene W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and that the adaptor protein receptor-interacting protein targets NEMO/IKKγ to recruit the IKK complex to the TNF receptor (36Zhang S. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), which could involve TRAF2 (37Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In summary, our results identify PAK1 as an integral component of the H. pylori-induced activation of NF-κB in epithelial cells. Activated PAK1 phosphorylates NIK and directs the activity of IKKs to IκBα. This signaling causes NF-κB activation and induction of proinflammatory cytokines in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells (Fig. 6). Because PAK1 does not play an important role in NF-κB activation by TNFα or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, this study corroborates the concept that different NF-κB-activating stimuli use different signaling components. Because the integrity of the type IV secretion machinery is an absolute requirement for NF-κB activation in H. pylori infection (38Naumann M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1109-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that the component(s) that induce(s) this transcription factor must either be injected into the eucaryotic target cell or activate(s) contact-dependent eucaryotic cell-surface receptors. This hypothesis is supported by the notion that only those PAI factors (CagA, CagF, and CagN) that are not necessary for the functional integrity of the type IV secretion apparatus do not induce activation of NF-κB (15Glocker E. Lange C. Covacci A. Bereswill S. Kist M. Pahl H.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2346-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus PAK1 functions in gastric epithelial cells in a unique pathway that links H. pylori-dependent effector molecules to the activation of NF-κB and the induction of the innate immune response. The central role of NF-κB in the innate immune response suggests that many pathogenic microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to interfere with the function of NF-κB or modulate the NF-κB signal transduction. In contrast to H. pylori, the microbial pathogenYersinia pseudotuberculosis inhibits the activation of NF-κB by active translocation of the virulence factor yersinia outer protein J via a type III secretion system. The yersinia outer protein J protein was shown to bind to IKKβ and the superfamily of mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases and inhibits phosphorylation and subsequent activation of these kinases (39Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Thus, by blocking IKKβ and MKKsYersinia inhibits the release of cytokines and other immunomodulatory factors during innate immune response. The identity of the effector molecule(s) of H. pylori that induce(s) NF-κB is not known so far. We speculate that PAK1 becomes targeted directly or indirectly by H. pylori factor(s). The identification of the H. pylori factor(s) in this process of NF-κB activation will unravel the mechanism of the H. pylori-induced signaling in the future. Interestingly, the viral protein negative regulatory factor from human simian immunodeficiency virus targets PAK1 and induces nuclear responses. The negative regulatory factor-induced mechanism of PAK1 activation involves the simultaneous interaction of negative regulatory factor with the SH3 domain of Vav, which induces its guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for Cdc42 and Rac1. The activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 leads to their subsequent dissociation from Vav and strongly increases their affinity for PAK1 (40Fackler O. Lu X. Frost J. Geyer M. Jiang B. Luo W. Abo A. Alberts A. Peterlin B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on their structure the PAK kinases in mammals can be divided into two subfamilies: the PAK subfamily, containing an NH2-terminal catalytic p21-binding domain (also known as cdc42/Rac1-interactive binding domain) and a COOH-terminal kinase domain, and the germinal center kinase-like subfamily, which contains an NH2-terminal catalytic domain and lacks the p21-binding domain. In the first description of PAK it was shown that the serine/threonine protein kinase activity of PAK could be stimulated by the binding of activated GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42. More recently, a variety of studies have suggested that PAKs can participate in a broad range of cellular events that include cytoskeletal responses as well as certain signaling events (41Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). For example, PAKs can catalyze the phosphorylation of the heavy chain in myosin 1 (42Wu C. Lee S.F. Furmaniak-Kaszmierczak E. Cote G.P. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31787-31790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), in p47-phox (43Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and in LIM kinase (44Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In our study we have shown for the first time that PAK1 interacts with and phosphorylates NIK, which represents a specific activating mechanism in NF-κB regulation in H. pylori-infected epithelial cells. The recent observation that PAK1-mediated NF-κB activation does not involve activation of the IKKs could be explained by a different experimental approach (45Frost J.A. Swantek J.L. Stippec S. Yin M.J. Gaynor R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19693-19699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In our future work we plan to analyze the whole process of H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation including the identification of the microbial factors. Regarding the phosphorylation of NIK by PAK1, further experiments will determine the phosphorylation sites. NIK putatively contains a consensus site for phosphorylation by PAK (46Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 36: 16059-16064Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, NIK phosphorylation could take place in the NH2-terminal region, possibly activating NIK to autophosphorylate and stimulate catalytic activity, as proposed for the activation of NIK by TAK1 (29Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Because PAK1 is known to activate the JNK pathway in H. pylori infection (47Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Covacci A. Haas R. Meyer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31655-31662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), this finding contributes to our understanding of how a given stimulus can simultaneously activate JNK as well as NF-κB. Other kinases could also act as dual activators of JNK and NF-κB, e.g. MEKK1 or mixed-lineage kinase 3 activate JNK via phosphorylation of MKK4 (48Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dual activation of JNK and NF-κB activities has been shown by ectopic expression of plenty of SH3s, a Rac1-regulated protein, which consists of four SH3 domains (50Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Gastric inflammation is a hallmark of H. pylori infection, and our work contributes to the elucidation of the steps involved inH. pylori-induced NF-κB signal transduction and activation of an innate host immune response. The understanding of the host cell response mechanism may reveal potential targets for drug intervention in the case of pathological activation of this transcription factor in inflammatory diseases.

Here we show that recombinant human caspases can process PKCζ at three sites in the hinge region between the regulatory and catalytic domains. Caspase-3, -6, -7, and -8 chiefly cleaved human PKCζ at EETD↓G, and caspase-3 and -7 also cleaved PKCζ at DGMD↓G and DSED↓L, respectively. Processing of PKCζ expressed in transfected cells occurred chiefly at EETD↓G and DGMD↓G and produced carboxyl-terminal polypeptides that contained the catalytic domain. Epitope-tagged PKCζ that lacked the regulatory domain was catalytically active following expression in HeLa cells. Induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells by tumor necrosis factor α plus cycloheximide evoked the conversion of full-length epitope-tagged PKCζ to two catalytic domain polypeptides and increased PKCζ activity. A caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, prevented epitope-tagged PKCζ processing and activation following the induction of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis in rat parotid C5 cells produced catalytic domain polypeptides of endogenous PKCζ and increased PKCζ activity. Caspase inhibitors prevented the increase in PKCζ activity and production of the catalytic domain polypeptides. Treatment with lactacystin, a selective inhibitor of the proteasome, caused polyubiquitin-PKCζ conjugates to accumulate in cells transfected with the catalytic domain or full-length PKCζ, or with a PKCζ mutant that was resistant to caspase processing.

Two members of the family, zeta (ζ) and iota/lambda (ι/λ), are atypical (aPKCs), because they lack a functional C1 domain and, therefore, are not activated by C1 ligands such as diacylglycerol and phorbol ester tumor promoters (1Newton A.C.

For example, studies with a kinase-dead, dominant-negative PKCζ mutant indicate that PKCζ is required for the mitogenic activation of mouse fibroblasts (4Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I.

PKCζ binds and phosphorylates transcription factor Sp1, which controls the expression of a variety of mammalian genes, including vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (5Pal S.

Activation of NF-κB opposes the induction of apoptosis, which suggests that aPKCs transduce one or more survival signals (8Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) found that spontaneously apoptotic U937 cells had about 20% as much PKCζ as did exponentially growing cells. In contrast to the depletion of PKCζ protein, induction of apoptosis in NIH-3T3 cells by UV radiation inhibited the activity of aPKCs without changing the aPKC protein level (12Berra E. Municio M.M.

A family of cysteinyl proteases called caspases (>13 genes), which are related to the ced-3 death gene ofCaenorhabditis elegans, are the key players in a pervasive pathway of apoptosis in mammalian cells (14Kidd V.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 533-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Caspases are among the most specific of proteases with an unusual requirement for cleavage after aspartic acid. Caspases that mediate induction of apoptosis fall into two classes: initiator caspases (e.g. caspase-8, -9), which activate downstream effector caspases (e.g.caspase-3, -6, -7) that process a wide variety of cellular proteins (14Kidd V.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 533-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Generally processing of target proteins by caspases either activates proapoptotic functions or turns off survival pathways. Widmann et al. (16Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) have shown that caspase-dependent cleavage of Raf-1 and Akt-1 inhibited their kinase activity and may explain the inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated and Akt pathways during the progression of apoptosis.

Moreover, transfection of HeLa cells with CFδ, but not an inactive CFδ (K378R) mutant, induced nuclear fragmentation and cell death (19Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C.

Analogous results were obtained with a carboxyl-terminal fragment of PKCθ (20Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20317-20320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). PKCθ was processed by caspase-3 (or a closely related caspase) in vitro and in vivo to CFθ, which induced apoptosis following expression in U937 cells (20Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J.

Here we identify three caspase cleavage sites of human PKCζ, which lie in the hinge segment between the regulatory and catalytic domains. Induction of apoptosis in nontransfected parotid C5 cells, or HeLa transfected with epitope-tagged PKCζ, produced 40- and 50-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragments of PKCζ and stimulated PKCζ immune complex kinase activity. Our demonstration of PKCζ activation following the induction of apoptosis appears to be unprecedented. Caspase processing appears to be an alternative mechanism to phosphorylation for activating the kinase function of PKCζ. A carboxyl-terminal segment of PKCζ that contained the catalytic domain was active and formed polyubiquitin conjugates following expression in mammalian cells. The conjugates accumulated in cells treated with Lacta, a selective inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, which governs the abundance of many influential proteins (22Peters, J.-M., Harris, J. R., and Finley, D. J., eds. (1998) Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell, pp. 1472, Plenum, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 23Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6822) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the free catalytic domain of PKCζ that is produced by caspases is subject to degradation by the Ub-proteasome pathway, which is a novel mechanism for down-regulation of the kinase lacking the regulatory domain. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.

The PCR product was TA cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), excised with HindIII and SacII, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1B+ (Invitrogen). A kinase-deficient K281R mutant of PKCζ and CATζ was produced with the QuikChange kit using the following primers: forward, 5′-C CAA ATT TAC GCC ATG AGA GTG GTG AAG AAA AGA GC; reverse, 5′GC TCT TTT CTT CAC CAC TCT CAT GGC GTA AAT TTG G. Epitope-tagged wild type and mutant PKCζ-V5 constructs were prepared from a pcDNA3.1/GS plasmid containing the 1776-bp human PKCζ open reading frame (H-L14283) with carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope and hexahistidine tags (Invitrogen). A 1.4-kbpNotI/BamHI segment of the open reading frame was excised and replaced with the 1.4-kb fragment of the kinase-deficient or caspase-resistant mutants or wild type PKCζ constructs described above. A catalytic domain mutant with V5 and hexahistidine tags (CATζ-V5) lacking amino acids 16–239 was produced by PCR from wild type PKCζ in pcDNA3 with the following primers: 5′-TTT AAA GCG GCC GCG GAA TCA AAA TCT CTC; and 5′-GAA CCG GGG GAT CCG GAT G. The PCR product was agarose gel-purified and TA-cloned with pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The 0.7-kb NotI/BamHI fragment was excised from pCR2.1 and ligated into the corresponding site of the PKCζ pcDNA3.1/GS plasmid. Similarly, a kinase-deficient K281R CATζ-V5 was prepared using the K281R PKCζ as the PCR template. All mutant PKCζ cDNA clones were subjected to automated DNA sequencing of both strands, which confirmed that the constructs were correct. Purified recombinant human caspase-2, -3, -4, -6, -7, and -8 were prepared as described (25Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). [35S]Met (10 μCi/20-μl reaction)-labeled PKCζ was produced by in vitro transcription and translation with the T7 Quick TNT kit (Promega). Caspase treatments were for 30 min at 30 °C in buffer (CB) containing 0.1 m Hepes adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 μl of the TNT reaction. The caspase reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample solution and a 5-min incubation in boiling water. BHK cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and disrupted by Dounce homogenization in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm NaEGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C at 16,000 × g. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method with γ-globulin as a standard (Bio-Rad). The reaction was started by adding 0.1 mg of lysate to 2 ml of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm Ac-DEVD-amc. Fluorescence due to the production of free AMC was continuously recorded at 440 nm (380-nm excitation). Transfected cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with a buffer containing (in mm): 10 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 NaCl, 50 NaF, 30 sodium pyrophosphate, 5 NaEDTA, 5 NaEGTA, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. The lysates were homogenized by passage through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the BCA method (Pierce Chemical) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the preparation of cytosol and membrane fractions from parotid C5 cells, they were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and disrupted by Dounce homogenization with C5 lysis buffer which contained (in mm): 20 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 EDTA, 0.5 EGTA, 25 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × gat 4 °C to obtain cytosol and particulate fractions. Membrane proteins were extracted from the particulate fraction with C5 lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Proteins (50 μg) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with the PKCζ antibody as described (21Reyland M.E. Anderson S.M. Matassa A.A. Barzen K.A. Quissell D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19115-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis a protein sample (30 μg) was mixed with SDS sample solution and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). TBS contained (per liter) 8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, and 3 g of Tris base and was adjusted to pH 7.4 at room temperature, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 in the case of TBS containing Tween 20. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of PKCζ antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) in 5 ml of TBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were rinsed and processed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Transduction Laboratories) and a chemiluminescent substrate as described (26Lee H.-W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Smith J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 439-447PubMed Google Scholar). An HRP-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was used for Western analysis of immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with epitope-tagged PKCζ. Immunoprecipitations were done with a polyclonal antibody (usually 3 μg) to a carboxyl-terminal peptide of (amino acids 576–592) of rat PKCζ (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or with 1 μg of anti-V5 epitope monoclonal (Invitrogen). The antibody was incubated with the lysate for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose (20 μl of a 50% slurry) was added during the last hour. Immune complexes were washed six times with ice-cold lysis buffer as described (26Lee H.-W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Smith J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 439-447PubMed Google Scholar) and twice with kinase assay buffer as described below. The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated V5-tagged PKCζ from HeLa cells was assayed in 25 μl of buffer, which contained 25 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 5 μg of MBP, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min at 30 °C the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample solution and boiling for 5 min. Samples (10 μl) were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and 32P-labeled MBP was quantified autoradiographically after fixing and drying the gel. To estimate the relative amounts of the V5 epitope-tagged proteins in the immunoprecipitates, 10-μl samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and immunostained with an HRP-conjugated anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Statistical analysis was done by two-tailed Student's t test. The Ub monoclonal antibody 6C1 was prepared by immunization of BALB/c mice with bovine erythrocyte Ub, which was coupled to ovalbumin with glutaraldehyde (27Chen L. Smith L. Accavitti-Loper M.A. Omura S. Smith J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Ascites (10 μl/5 ml of TBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk) containing the Ub antibody (IgG2a class) was used for Western blotting as described previously (27Chen L. Smith L. Accavitti-Loper M.A. Omura S. Smith J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the antibody with purified bovine erythrocytes Ub abolished the immunostaining of polyubiquitinylated proteins (27Chen L. Smith L. Accavitti-Loper M.A. Omura S. Smith J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Lacta was prepared as described previously (28Omura S. Matsuzaki K. Fujimoto T. Kosuge K. Furuya T. Fujita S. Nakagawa A. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1991; 44: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and used to block protein degradation by the Ub-proteasome pathway (29Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed with 95 °C SDS lysis buffer, which contained (in mm): and 10 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 EDTA, 2 EGTA, 5 N-ethylmaleimide, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 50 μm ALLN. N-Ethylmaleimide inhibits deubiquitinylating enzymes, and ALLN blocks the proteasome. Protein concentration was measured by the BCA method (Pierce Chemical) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For immunoprecipitation of PKCζ and Ub-PKCζ conjugates, a sample of the SDS lysate (usually 0.5 mg of protein) was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (IB), which contained (in mm): 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 0.2 sodium orthovanadate, 30 sodium pyrophosphate, 50 NaF, 50 μmALLN, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Immunoprecipitation was done with 3 μg of the C-20 antibody for 2 h, and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose was added after the first hour. Immunoprecipitates were rinsed twice with IB, twice with IB containing 0.5 m NaCl, twice with lower salt IB (no NaF, sodium pyrophosphate, or sodium orthovanadate), and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Proteins were extracted with SDS sample solution for 5 min in a boiling water bath, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), and transferred to a nylon membrane for immunostaining with the Ub antibody, which was done essentially as described for Western blot analysis of PKCζ. [35S]Met-labeled PKCζ (70 kDa) was produced by coupled transcription and translation and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 90 ng of recombinant human caspase-2, -3, -4, -6, -7, and -8 (Fig. 1). Under these conditions caspase-3, -6, and -8 processed essentially all of the [35S]Met-labeled PKCζ, and caspase-7 processed most of the [35S]Met-labeled PKCζ. Caspase-2 and -4 processed about 50% of [35S]Met-labeled PKCζ. Caspase-3 and -7 produced F1, F2, and F3 fragments with apparent masses of 50, 40, and 25 kDa, respectively. Caspase-6 and -8 produced F1 and F3 (Fig. 1). To identify the sites of caspase cleavage, candidate Asp residues were mutated to Ala and the sensitivity of wild type and PKCζ mutants to processing by caspase was determined (Fig. 1). These studies show that caspase-3 processed [35S]Met-labeled PKCζ chiefly at EETD210 and DGMD239, whereas caspase-6 and -8 processed PKCζ chiefly at EETD210 (Fig. 1, B–D). Caspase-7 processed [35S]Met-labeled PKCζ at EETD210 and DSED230, but not at DGMD239 (Fig. 1 E). These results show that PKCζ is a substrate of both initiator and effector caspases in vitro and that the processing sites are caspase-specific. Intracellular processing of human PKCζ occurred chiefly at EETD210 and DGMD239 as shown by transfection experiments with wild type PKCζ, and the mutants with alanine substituted for aspartate at the caspase cleavage sites as discussed below (see Fig. 4). To determine the effect of caspase processing on PKCζ kinase function, HeLa cells were transfected with PKCζ-V5, which has a carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope tag, and apoptosis was induced by treatment with TNFα plus CHX. Induction of apoptosis in HeLa and other cell types requires the combination of TNFα plus CHX (30Wajant H. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Muhlenbeck F. Kreuz S. Schübert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24357-24366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 31Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The treatment markedly increased the accumulation of carboxyl-terminal fragments (F1 and F2) of PKCζ-V5 and decreased the steady-state level of full-length PKCζ-V5, as determined by Western analysis of anti-V5 immunoprecipitates with an HRP-conjugated V5 antibody (Fig. 2 A). Treatment with the general caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, prevented the depletion of full-length PKCζ-V5 and accumulation of F1 and F2 (Fig. 2 A). Additionally, we assayed the kinase activity of the anti-V5 immune complexes. Treatment with TNFα plus CHX markedly increased immune complex kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, treatment with zVAD-fmk, which prevented the conversion of full-length PKCζ-V5 to the C-terminal fragments (F1 and F2), abolished the increase in kinase activity produced by TNFα plus CHX (Fig. 2 B). This result suggests that the conversion of full-length PKCζ-V5 to one or both of the carboxyl-terminal fragments was responsible for the increase in kinase activity. Also note that the zVAD-fmk treatment decreased F2 and kinase activity of the immune complex from the cells that were not treated with TNFα plus CHX (Fig. 2). This result suggests that there was a basal rate of F2 production and disappearance in the untreated cells. Transfection of the cells with a kinase-deficient K281R PKCζ-V5 mutant produced no detectable kinase activity in untreated cells as expected (Fig. 2 B). The kinase-deficient mutant was expressed to a similar extent as wild type PKCζ,-V5, and the TNFα plus CHX treatment depleted full-length K281R PKCζ-V5 similarly to wild type PKCζ-V5, although there was much less accumulation of the F1 and F2 fragments of the kinase-deficient mutant (Fig. 2 A). One possible explanation of this result is that the K281R mutant of F1 and F2 is less stable following the TNFα plus CHX treatment than wild type F1 and F2. In agreement with this explanation, the TNFα plus CHX treatment decreased K281R CATζ-V5 more than wild type CATζ (Fig. 2 A). To confirm that the catalytic domain of PKCζ-V5 was active, HeLa cells were transfected with CATζ-V5 or K281R CATζ-V5, which are mutants that lack the regulatory domain. As expected, CATζ-V5 was active following immunoprecipitation from transfected cells, but K281R CATζ-V5 had no detectable activity (Fig. 2 B). Note that the amounts of the immunoprecipitated CATζ-V5, K281R CATζ-V5, and full-length PKCζ-V5 polypeptides were similar (Fig. 2 A). CATζ-V5 had 68 ± 20% (n = 3, p= 0.04) more kinase activity than full-length PKCζ-V5 based on the ratios of the 32P-MBP to the immunostained protein bands. Treatment with TN"
https://openalex.org/W1991349041,"The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are characterized by their requirement for dual phosphorylation at a conserved threonine and tyrosine residue for catalytic activation. The structural consequences of dual-phosphorylation in the MAP kinase ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulatedkinase 2) include active site closure, alignment of key catalytic residues that interact with ATP, and remodeling of the activation loop. In this study, we report the specific effects of dual phosphorylation on the individual catalytic reaction steps in ERK2. Dual phosphorylation leads to an increase in overall catalytic efficiency and turnover rate of approximately 600,000- and 50,000-fold, respectively. Solvent viscosometric studies reveal moderate decreases in the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for both ATP and myelin basic protein. However, the majority of the overall rate enhancement is due to an increase in the rate of the phosphoryl group transfer step by approximately 60,000-fold. By comparison, the rate of the same step in the ATPase reaction is enhanced only 2000-fold. This suggests that optimizing the position of the invariant residues Lys52 and Glu69, which stabilize the phosphates of ATP, accounts for only part of the enhanced rate of phosphoryl group transfer in the kinase reaction. Thus, significant stabilization of the protein phosphoacceptor group must also occur. Our results demonstrate similarities between the activation mechanisms of ERK2 and the cell cycle control enzyme, Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2). Rather than dual phosphorylation, however, activation of the latter is controlled by cyclin binding followed by phosphorylation at Thr160.

The prototype member of the MAP kinase family that mediates signaling by all polypeptide mitogens is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ERK2. Like all MAP kinases, ERK2 participates in a three-tier protein phosphorylation cascade that, in response to growth factor receptor signaling, is activated by dual phosphorylation catalyzed by an upstream activating kinase, MEK1/MEK2. Among the targets of ERK2 are downstream kinases involved in cellular growth control as well as nuclear transcription factors. Thus, ERK2 provides an essential link in transducing the diverse signals from transmembrane growth factor receptors into gene regulatory events (for review see Refs. 1Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar and 2Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic structure of ERK2 (357 amino acids) reveals a conserved catalytic core (residues 22–311) flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions that lie on the surface of the molecule. Like all protein kinases, the catalytic core is globular, consisting of an N- and C-terminal lobe, whose interface defines the active site cleft. Within the active site, the adenine ring of ATP is deeply buried, with the γ-phosphate pointing toward the mouth of the active site where protein substrates bind and where phosphotransfer occurs (3Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). All protein kinases display near their active sites an “activation loop,” the conformation of which must be optimized for high catalytic activity (4Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). For most, but not all, protein kinases, this activity is dependent upon phosphorylation at a single conserved residue located at the C-terminal end of the activation loop (4Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). In many cases, phosphorylation at this site is catalyzed by a heterologous kinase and constitutes a physiological mechanism for kinase regulation. For example, phosphorylation of the cyclin-dependent kinases at the conserved activation loop threonine (Thr160in Cdk2) by a cdk activating kinase (CAK) is critical for regulation of cell cycle progression (5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Similarly, the MAP kinases are regulated by phosphorylation by their upstream activators, the MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), in response to extracellular signaling (2Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hallmark of the MAP kinases is their unique requirement for dual phosphorylation at a conserved threonine and tyrosine residue belonging to the consensus sequence T XY for catalytic activation (6Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). In ERK2, these sites are Thr183 and Tyr185. The phosphorylation of both of these residues is catalyzed by the dual-specific upstream kinases MEK1 or MEK2 (2Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural role of both phosphorylations in catalytic activation has been revealed by comparison of the crystallographic structures of (non-p)ERK2 (3Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and (pp)ERK2 (7Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The major alteration upon dual phosphorylation is a closure of the active site cleft, which results in optimal alignment of the key catalytic residues that contact the phosphate groups of ATP. In addition, there is significant remodeling of the activation loop as well as the P+1surface pocket, 2P0 is the substrate phosphorylation site. the latter of which is necessary to accept the P+1 proline residue essential for the recognition of all ERK substrates. Given the structural consequences of dual phosphorylation revealed by x-ray crystallography, it is not known how such changes in structure specifically affect the kinetics of individual reaction steps along the catalytic reaction pathway. Thus, a correlation between structure and mechanism, and therefore regulation, cannot be made. In this study, the catalytic reaction pathway for nonphosphorylated ERK2 was determined and compared with that of the fully active, dual-phosphorylated enzyme. The results provide a quantitative understanding of the mechanistic basis for catalytic activation by dual phosphorylation. Finally, our studies reveal functional similarities between ERK2 and Cdk2 in terms of their mechanisms of activation. All chemicals (KCl, EDTA, MgCl2, MOPS, sucrose, dithiothreitol) were purchased from Fisher, except for ATP (Sigma), and [γ-32-P]ATP (ICN). Myelin basic protein (MBP) was purified from a bovine brain acetone powder (Sigma B0508) by acid extraction followed by cation exchange chromatography as described previously (8Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the recombinant rat ERK2 N-terminally fused to a hexahistidine tag was carried out as described previously (9Zhang F. Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, ERK2 overexpressed in Escherichia coli was purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography followed by FPLC anion exchange chromatography on Uno Q (Bio-Rad). Select fractions from peak 1 (see “Results”) were used for all experiments. (pp)ERK2 was generated as described previously (8Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). (non-p)ERK2 purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography was subject to phosphorylation by recombinant MEK1 in vitro, and the dual-phosphorylated material was further purified by FPLC anion exchange chromatography on Uno Q (Bio-Rad). ERK2 was confirmed to be dual-phosphorylated by electrospray mass spectrometry. Both (non-p)ERK2 and (pp)ERK2, purified as described above, were essentially homogeneous based on analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration of ERK2 was determined spectrophotometrically based on an extinction coefficient (ε280 = 44, 825 cm−1m−1) calculated from its primary amino acid sequence (10Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Kinase activity was monitored by a radioisotope assay in which the rate of incorporation of32P from [γ-32P]ATP into MBP was directly measured. Reactions were carried out in phosphorylation buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2(total)) containing 3 μm ERK2 and varied concentrations of MBP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (300–500 cpm/pmol) at varied concentrations and allowed to proceed at 23 °C for 45 min, after which time they were terminated with 25% acetic acid. The32P-labeled MBP product was resolved from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP by ascending chromatography on P81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) as described previously (8Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified by Cerenkov counting. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear least squares analysis of initial velocity data obtained from several concentrations of MBP at several fixed concentrations of ATP. The following equation (Equation 1) for a two-substrate sequential reaction was globally fit to the data using the program Scientist (Micromath Inc.),v=V·A·B/(KiA·KmB+KmB·A+KmA·B+A·B)Equation 1 where v is the initial velocity, V is the maximal initial velocity, A and B are the fixed and varied substrates, respectively,Km is the Michaelis constant, and Ki A is the dissociation constant for A.kcat was determined by dividing the maximal initial velocity by the enzyme concentration. Steady-state assays, as described above, were carried out in buffer containing sucrose ranging from 0 to 40%, to give relative solvent viscosities ranging between 1 and 4.2. Relative solvent viscosity was determined as described previously (8Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of (non-p)ERK2 was determined in a radioisotope assay in which the rate of 32P production was monitored. Reactions were performed in phosphorylation buffer in a total volume of 20 μl at 23 °C. Typically, reactions containing 3 μm (non-p)ERK2 were initiated by the addition of [γ32-P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol) at various concentrations, allowed to proceed for 2 h at 23 °C, then terminated in 1 ml of 0.1 n HCl. To determine the amount of phosphate produced, the stopped reactions were incubated with 200 μl of charcoal solution (10% activated charcoal (Sigma C-6289), 10% acetic acid, 2.5 mm KH2PO4) for 1 h on ice and then centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 30 min. Radioactivity in the supernatant was quantified by counting 500 μl of the supernatant using the Cerenkov method. ATPase activity of (pp)ERK2 was determined using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (11Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R.

The coupling reagents and their concentrations were as follows: 15 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 7.5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mmP-enolpyruvate, and 130 μm NADH. All reactions were performed in phosphorylation buffer in a total volume of 75 μl at 23 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μm (pp)ERK to the reaction mix containing ATP at various concentrations. Progress of the reaction was monitored by a continuous decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in a Shimadzu UV1601 spectrophotometer. Initial velocities in μm/min were calculated based on an extinction coefficient for NADH of 6220 cm−1m−1at 340 nm. Measurement of ATPase activity of (pp)ERK2 by spectrophotometric or by radioisotope labeling methods gave identical results. Steady-state kinetic parameters for both (non-p)ERK2 and (pp)ERK2 were determined from nonlinear regression analysis of initial velocities as a function of ATP concentration using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Experiments to determine solvent viscosity effects on kcat and kcat/Km for ATPase reactions were carried out under the following conditions: (non-p)ERK2, 2 mm and 800 μm ATP; (pp)ERK2, 4 mmand 90 μm ATP. Sucrose was varied between 0 and 40%. (non-p)ERK2 was expressed and purified from E. coli. Purification using anion exchange chromatography revealed two peaks of protein corresponding to ERK2, both of which displayed identical activities and activation properties. These observations are consistent with those reported previously during the crystallization of ERK2, in which only peak 1 formed crystals (9Zhang F. Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have used this fraction of ERK2 for all of our studies. The activity of each fraction from peak 1 was determined. When assayed for kinase activity, it was found that the latter fractions of the peak exhibited substantially higher kinase activity than those eluting earlier (Fig. 1). The high specific activity associated with the later fractions may be attributable to enzyme that had undergone autophosphorylation during induction. In all our studies, however, fractions free of the high kinase activity (fractions 42–43, Fig. 1) were used. In these fractions, the profile of kinase activity corresponded to the ERK2 protein concentration exactly, and when subjected to phosphorylation by MEK1 the enzyme could be activated to a form that displayed high catalytic activity (kcat/Km = 1 μm−1s−1 and kcat = 10 s−1) (8Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetic parameters for the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by (non-p)ERK2 were determined. MBP phosphorylation was linear for at least 2 h, indicating that autoactivation of (non-p)ERK2 did not occur within this time frame. A data set of initial reaction velocities obtained under conditions of varied MBP concentrations at several fixed concentrations of ATP was analyzed. Fig.2 shows the experimental data and the best-fit regression curves in double reciprocal form. The regression analysis yielded values of kcat = 2 × 10−4 s−1,Km (MBP) = 50 μm and Km (ATP) = 700 μm. The kcat value is down 50,000-fold from that of (pp)ERK2, whereas the Km values for MBP and ATP are each up by only 10-fold. The changes in the steady-state parameters correspond to an overall catalytic efficiency toward MBP (kcat/Km (MBP)), which is attenuated 600,000-fold. The Michaelis-Menten parameters described above are a composite of microscopic rate constants combined in a manner dependent upon the order of substrate addition. The steady-state data for (non-p)ERK2 are consistent with both randomly and compulsorily ordered mechanisms. However, if the kinetic mechanism of this enzyme is ordered, it is necessarily ordered with ATP binding first. This is true because the crystal structure of (non-p)ERK2 has been obtained with bound ATP alone (3Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In addition, (non-p)ERK2 displays measurable ATPase activity in the absence of MBP (see below). Under saturating conditions of ATP, the catalytic mechanism of (non-p)ERK2 can therefore be described by SchemeFS1. In this scheme, catalytic efficiency is given by [kcat/Km (MBP) =k2·k3/(k−2+ k3)], whereas the turnover rate is given by [kcat =k3·k4/(k3+ k4)] (12Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3220-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To solve for the microscopic constants, k2, k−2,k3, and k4, we employed steady-state solvent viscosometric techniques, which allow separation of the diffusive (k2,k−2, k4) from the nondiffusive (k3) reaction steps (13Brouwer A.C. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 14Caldwell S.R. Newcomb J.R. Schlecht K.A. Raushel F.M.

Initial velocity data were obtained as a function of MBP concentration at several fixed concentrations of sucrose, and the effect of solvent viscosity on kcat or kcat/Km (MBP) was determined. Since it was not possible to carry out these experiments at a single, saturating concentration of ATP, because of the high Km (ATP) value, viscosity data were collected at several subsaturating ATP concentrations. The viscosity effect on app kcat (Fig.3 A) orapp kcat/Km (MBP)(Fig. 3 B) was determined at each ATP concentration by plotting the fold decrease in the respective rate parameter as a function of the relative solvent viscosity. The viscosity effect is given by the slopes of the best-fit lines in Fig. 3, A and B. The true viscosity effect on kcatand kcat/Km (MBP)was determined by extrapolation to infinite ATP concentration. We saw no significant viscosity effect on either rate parameter at any ATP concentration tested, and we therefore conclude that both kcat and kcat/Km (MBP) are insensitive to the relative solvent viscosity.Figure 3Solvent viscosity effects on kcat and kcat/Km (MBP) for the phosphorylation of MBP. The “viscosity effect” on a given rate parameter is defined as the rate of change in reaction rate with respect to the relative solvent viscosity and corresponds to the slopes of the lines in panels A and B. The true viscosity effects on kcat (panel A) or kcat/Km(MBP)(panel B) were determined from the apparent rate values measured at three subsaturating concentrations of ATP (— — •— —, 0.2 mm; —–□—–, 1 mm; ——○——, 2 mm) as a function of increasing relative solvent viscosity, followed by extrapolation to infinite ATP concentration. In panel A, MBP was either varied or fixed at 600 μm. In panel B, MBP was fixed at 20 μm. The viscosity effects on kcat/Km(kmη) and kcat(kcatη) relate to the individual rate constants in Scheme FS1 as follows:kcat/Kmη = k3/(k−2 +k3); kcatη= k3/(k3 +k4 (16Nakatani H. Dunford H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 83: 2662-2665Google Scholar). A value for kcat/Kmηand kcatη approaching zero implies that k−2≫ k3 and k3 ≪ k4, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The viscosity effect (designated by superscripted η) on kcat/Km (MBP) is given by [kcat/Km (MBP)η= k3/(k−2 +k3)], whereas the viscosity effect on kcat is given by [kcatη =k3/(k3 +k4)] (16Nakatani H. Dunford H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 83: 2662-2665Google Scholar). The kinetic constants derived from the viscosity studies are shown in TableI. The lack of viscosity effect on kcat implies that the overall rate of substrate turnover is limited by phosphoryl group transfer (k3) and that the diffusion of either product from the active site (k4) is not rate-limiting. The rate of phosphoryl group transfer can therefore be assigned a value of 0.012 min−1, which is 60,000-fold lower than that in (pp)ERK2.Table IKinetic and thermodynamic parameters for (non-p)ERK2 versus (pp)ERK2(non-p)ERK2(pp)ERK21-aValues for the kinase reaction of (pp)ERK2 are from Prowse et al.

Open table in a new tab The viscosity effect on kcat/Km for ATP was also determined. 3Initial velocities were determined at 1 mm MBP, 175 μm ATP, and varied sucrose. Identical conditions, except in 300 μm ATP, gave proportionally higher rates, indicative of true kcat/Km conditions. No viscosity effect on this parameter was observed. Thus, the lack of a viscosity effect on both kcat/Km (MBP) and kcat/Km (ATP), as well as on kcat, supports a kinetic scheme in which both substrates exist in rapid equilibrium with the ternary Michaelis complex, whose breakdown to form products is entirely limited by phosphoryl group transfer. In such a model, the true affinities (Kd s) of both substrates to form the ternary complex are given by their Km values. Thus, our steady-state data reveal that dual phosphorylation enhances the affinity of ATP binding by approximately 12-fold, whereas the affinity for MBP is enhanced ≥100-fold. An important consequence of dual-phosphorylation is the optimization of the alignment of the invariant residues, Lys52, which coordinates to the α- and β-phosphates of ATP, and Glu69, which stabilizes Lys52, in (pp)ERK2 (7Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). To determine the relative contribution of these interactions to the overall increase in the phosphoryl group transfer step of the kinase reaction, we compared the fold increase in catalytic parameters of the kinase reaction to those of the ATPase reaction (Table I). The steady-state parameters and individual rate constants for the ATPase reaction for both (non-p)ERK2 and (pp)ERK2 were determined by solvent viscosometric analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Similar to the kinase reaction, the major effect of dual phosphorylation was a large (2000-fold) increase in the phosphotransfer rate, whereas the observed increase in ATP binding affinity was only 12-fold. However, the 2,000-fold increase in the rate of phosphotransfer is significantly less than the 60,000-fold rate enhancement of this step seen in the kinase reaction. This finding suggests that the net stabilization of the transition-state complex for phosphoryl group transfer to MBP occurs only in part by stabilization of the ATP moiety and that significant stabilization of the protein phosphoacceptor substrate moiety must also occur. We previously characterized the kinetic reaction pathway of the dual-phosphorylated form of ERK2 (8Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In comparison to (pp)ERK2, (non-p)ERK2 displays kcat/Km (MBP) and kcat values that are decreased by approximately 600,000- and 50,000-fold, respectively (Table I). Yet, the Km values for MBP and ATP are each increased by only 10-fold. Therefore, the exceedingly low activity of (non-p)ERK2 is due to the dramatically decreased rates of substrate capture and turnover and not the inability to saturate the enzyme with substrate under steady-state conditions. The extreme rate enhancements caused by dual phosphorylation are the most dramatic of any protein kinase for which the kinetic basis for activation by phosphorylation has been investigated. The large increases in catalytic efficiency and turnover rate are attributable to an approximate 60,000-fold increase in the rate of phosphotransfer, 12-fold higher binding affinity for ATP, and a minimum 100-fold higher affinity for MBP. The ability to bind MBP more tightly correlates to a remodeling of the P+1 surface pocket that functions to bind the essential proline residue found in all ERK2 substrates; this is achieved in part by hydrogen bonding between the phosphoryl group oxygens of PO3–Tyr185 and the side chains of Arg189 and Arg192 (7Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Although our data provides only a lower limit value on the absolute enhancement in substrate binding affinity, it should be noted that tighter binding of the substrate to (pp)ERK2 will not result in higher catalytic efficiency, because the rate of MBP binding to (pp)ERK2 already occurs at the diffusion-controlled limit (8Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the dual-phosphorylated enzyme depends only on the rate of substrate encounter. Dual phosphorylation results in a rotation of the N- and C-terminal lobes, which closes the active site cleft and optimizes the alignment of the essential catalytic residues, Lys52 and Glu69 (7Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). This results in a 12-fold tighter binding of ATP to the enzyme, and a 2000-fold increase in the rate of phosphoryl group transfer with respect to the ATPase reaction. Nonetheless, this increase in phosphotransfer rate is approximately 30-fold down from that seen in the kinase reaction, demonstrating that stabilization of the phosphate moieties of ATP accounts for only a portion of the overall enhanced rate of chemistry with respect to the phosphorylation of protein substrates. Correlation of the ATPase and kinase activities of ERK2 reveals similarities in its mechanism of activation to that of Cdk2/cyclin A. For example, activation of both enzymes involves two steps. In Cdk2/cyclin A, these steps are cyclin binding followed by phosphorylation at Thr160 (5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar), whereas in ERK2, phosphorylation at Tyr185 followed by phosphorylation at Thr183 is required (6Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 17Haystead T.A. Dent P. Wu J. Haystead C.M. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In Cdk2/cyclin A, the rate of phosphotransfer in the ATPase reaction is unchanged by phosphorylation at Thr160 (18Hagopian J.C. Kirtley M.P. Stevenson L.M. Gergis R.M. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Parsons S.M. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This is consistent with crystallographic information which shows that the role of phosphorylation at Thr160 is not to align the conserved lysine (Lys33) and glutamate (Glu51) side chains, thus stabilizing ATP. Instead, alignment of these residues in Cdk2 is achieved by the binding of cyclin. However, the rate of the same step in the kinase reaction of Cdk2/cyclin A is enhanced nearly 3000-fold (18Hagopian J.C. Kirtley M.P. Stevenson L.M. Gergis R.M. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Parsons S.M. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, although cyclin binding serves to stabilize the ATP portion of the transition state for phosphoryl group transfer, phosphorylation at Thr160 serves to stabilize the protein phosphoacceptor group. Thr160 in Cdk2 and Thr183 in ERK2 occupy structurally analogous roles (4Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar); both coordinate to a positively charged triad of arginine side chains that bridge the N- and C-terminal lobes of the catalytic cores. Thus, it is possible that phosphorylation at Thr183 in ERK2 may function analogously to that at Thr160 in Cdk2/cyclin A, whereas phosphorylation at Tyr185 in ERK2 may play a role analogous to cyclin binding. In summary, we have demonstrated that dual phosphorylation of ERK2 results in 10–100-fold greater rate enhancements compared with other protein kinases in which activation is dependent on phosphorylation at only a single site. Most of the increase in catalytic power in ERK2 is attributable to an increased rate of phosphotransfer, which is coordinately accomplished by two independent mechanisms: 1) stabilization of the phosphate moieties of ATP via alignment of Lys52 and Glu69 and 2) stabilization of the protein phosphoacceptor group. In Cdk2, we propose that these may be separately achieved by cyclin binding and phosphorylation at Thr160, respectively (18Hagopian J.C. Kirtley M.P. Stevenson L.M. Gergis R.M. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Parsons S.M. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that a similar mechanism of activation may be functionally conserved in ERK2, except that stabilization of the ATP and protein phosphoacceptor groups may instead be controlled separately by phosphorylation at Tyr185 and Thr183. We are grateful to Dr. Larry Brunton, University of California, San Diego, Biomedical Sciences Program, for invaluable support and encouragement."

When Escherichia coli is exposed to an osmotic upshock, which is accompanied by a loss of turgor, then the primary response is an accumulation of K+ (1Csonka L.N. Microbiol.

E. coli uses several K+ transport systems to adjust the intracellular K+ concentration (3Altendorf K. Epstein W. Lee A.G. Biomembranes. JAI Press Inc., London1996: 403-420Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions the constitutive K+ uptake systems TrkG, TrkH, and Kup are operating. Upon osmotic upshock and under K+-limiting growth conditions ([K+] < 2 mm) the high affinity K+-transport complex KdpFABC is induced. Expression of the kdpFABC operon is under control of the regulatory proteins KdpD and KdpE, which constitute a typical sensor kinase/response regulator system (4Polarek J.W. Williams G. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2145-2151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensor kinase KdpD is an integral protein of the cytoplasmic membrane consisting of a large cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, four putative transmembrane domains and an extended cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (5Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). KdpD undergoes autophosphorylation (probably at His-673) (6Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and subsequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to the response regulator KdpE (probably at Asp-52). Phosphorylated KdpE exhibits an increased affinity for a 23-base pair sequence immediately upstream of the canonical −35 and −10 regions of the kdpFABC promoter (7Sugiura A. Nakashima K. Tanaka K.

Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This model has been challenged by the finding that under some conditions expression ofkdpFABC is only significantly induced when the osmolality of the medium is increased by salt and not in the case of sugar (10Sutherland L. Cairney J. Elmore M.J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 805-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Asha H. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4528-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of kdpD mutants, which constitutively expresskdpFABC independent of the K+ concentration of the medium, but retain the ability to respond to changes in medium osmolality, led to the suggestion that the sensing mechanisms of KdpD for K+ limitation and osmotic upshock can be mechanistically discriminated (11Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we developed and applied a new in vitro assay based on RSO-MV1 to elucidate the nature of the primary stimulus for KdpD. The advantage of this system is that the orientation of KdpD in the cytoplasmic membrane is that of the intact cell. Based on the results obtained with this system, it is suggested that KdpD autophosphorylation activity is directly affected by changes of intracellular parameters due to changes of environmental conditions.

E. coli strain TKR2000 transformed with plasmid pPV5 carrying kdpD was grown aerobically at 37 °C in KML complex medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% KCl) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were harvested at an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼0.5. The preparation of RSO-MV was carried out according to the lysozyme-EDTA method of Kaback (15Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-115Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The EDTA solution was adjusted to the desired pH with NaOH instead of KOH. Potassium phosphate buffer was replaced by Tris/HCl buffer of the same ionic strength. The spheroplast suspension was transferred into 100 volumes of various prewarmed (30 °C) lysis buffers (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol containing NaCl or KCl when indicated). Thus, the composition of the lysis buffer established the composition of the buffer in the lumen of the vesicles. To remove unbroken cells the lysate was centrifuged at 1,100 ×g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in the smallest possible volume (usually 50 μl/125 μl spheroplast suspension) of various buffers. In the first experiments membrane vesicle preparations were layered on top of 60% (w/v) sucrose in lysis buffer and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor following the detailed instructions as described previously (15Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-115Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar) to remove quantitatively whole cells and partially lysed cells. Since no differences in the phosphorylation pattern were observed when this very time-consuming step was omitted, the following experiments were performed without further purification of the vesicles. Membrane vesicles were prepared fresh for each experiment. The lumen of RSO-MV can be made accessible for ATP in the presence of Mg2+, due to a permeabilizing effect of this cation (16Liu C.E. Liu P.Q. Ames G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, both buffers (inside and outside) contained 20 mm MgCl2. Autophosphorylation of KdpD in RSO-MV (3 mg of protein/ml) (isoosmolar buffers outside and inside) was initiated by addition of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.38 Ci/mmol). Autophosphorylation of KdpD in RSO-MV was found to be linear within the first 2 min. To obtain sufficient amounts of phosphorylated KdpD in all experiments, the reaction was stopped after 2 min by addition of an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS-sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). When the osmolality outside of the RSO-MV was varied, vesicles were incubated in lysis buffer for 1 min with ATP, centrifuged (14,000 ×g, 0.5 min), and the pellet was then resuspended in the higher osmolar buffer lacking ATP and Mg2+ (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, plus osmolytes). After 1-min incubation the reaction was stopped as described above. All samples were immediately subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Shortly before stopping SDS-PAGE, an [γ-32P]ATP standard was loaded on the gels. Gels were dried, and phosphorylation of the proteins was detected by exposure of the gels to a storage phosphor screen. Phosphorylated proteins were quantified by image analysis using the PhosphorImager SI of Molecular Dynamics. To detect free ATP in the lumen of the RSO-MV, vesicles in isoosmolar buffer inside and outside (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm dithiothreitol) were incubated with 20 μm ATP for 2 min. RSO-MV were washed twice by centrifugation following resuspension in the same buffer without Mg2+. An aliquot (25 μl) of these vesicles was added to the ATP detection assay following the instructions of the luciferase/luciferin ATP monitoring kit. Luminescence was immediately measured with a Wallac-Luminometer. The cuvette containing the whole mixture was put in a sonification bath (Sonifier B220, Branson) for 30 s to destabilize membrane vesicles, and luminescence was immediately measured again. For calculation of the intravesicular ATP concentration, a value of 2.2 μl of intravesicular fluid/mg of membrane protein (18Ramos S. Schuldiner S. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1892-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) was used. Protein was assayed by the method described in (19Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 9 or 12% acrylamide gels. Immunodetection of KdpD or KdpE proteins with polyclonal antibodies against KdpD or KdpE was performed as described previously (6Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD in RSO-MV, [γ-32P]ATP has to be provided in the lumen of the vesicles. The use of an ATP generating system (20Hugenholtz J. Hong J.S. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3446-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or heterolog expression of the plastidic ATP/ADP transporter gene in E. coli (21Tjaden J. Schwoppe C. Mohlmann T. Quick P.W. Neuhaus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9630-9636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) failed, because the required ADP concentrations were inhibitory for KdpD kinase activity (data not shown). Therefore, we took advantage of the method described by Liu et al. (16Liu C.E. Liu P.Q. Ames G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which is based on the incorporation of ATP into vesicles in the presence of Mg2+ ions (20 mm). To confirm that free ATP was available inside the vesicles, we determined the ATP content of loaded RSO-MV before and after sonification. The details of this procedure are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Before sonification, only a basal luminescence was detectable. Luminescence increased rapidly after sonification, indicating the release of ATP from the lumen of the vesicles (data not shown). Based on the luminescence of an ATP standard and the internal volume of the vesicles (18Ramos S. Schuldiner S. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1892-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the internal ATP concentration was calculated to be 13.7 μm. This is lower than the ATP concentration provided outside (20 μm). Since ATP was rapidly used in the bioluminescence assay, the time difference between sonification and luminescence measurement might be the reason for an underestimation of the internal ATP concentration. ATP incorporation was found to be dependent on the Mg2+concentration. When the test was performed at a Mg2+concentration, which corresponded to the ATP concentration (20 μm), then only about 10% of the ATP penetrated into the lumen of the vesicles. This result is in accord with the finding that Mg2+ concentrations lower than 20 mm result only in low amounts of phosphorylated KdpD in RSO-MV (data not shown). In vitroexperiments with everted membrane vesicles (6Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or proteoliposomes (27Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) 2K. Jung, and K. Altendorf, unpublished data. in which the hydrophilic domains of KdpD are exposed to the outside (inside-out orientation) have shown that KdpD autophosphorylation activity is stimulated by an increase of the salt concentration (NaCl, KCl), whereas non-ionic solutes at the same osmolality have no effect. Since it is conceivable that stimulus perception by KdpD is affected by the orientation of the sensor kinase in the membrane, the RSO-MV-basedin vitro test system described here has two advantages: (i) the orientation of KdpD is that of the whole cell, and (ii) the buffer composition outside and inside of the vesicles can easily be varied. In the first experiments we tested the influence of an increase of the salt concentration (NaCl, KCl, RbCl) and of the buffer concentration (HEPES/NaOH buffer) inside the vesicles on the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD. For comparable conditions and to avoid disruption of the vesicles, the buffer outside was held constant at a relatively high osmolality. In each case, RSO-MV were incubated with radiolabeled ATP, and KdpD autophosphorylation was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An increase of the NaCl or RbCl concentration up to 100 mm inside the vesicles led to an increase of the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD (Fig. 2). At higher concentrations the amount of phosphorylated KdpD was declining. In contrast, K+ at low concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 mm) slightly stimulated KdpD autophosphorylation activity. However, the amount of phosphorylated KdpD fell even below the basal level (without K+) at K+ concentrations higher than 1 mm (Fig. 2). These data provide first evidence for an inhibitory effect of K+ on KdpD autophosphorylation activity. Finally, an increase of the HEPES/NaOH buffer concentration was accompanied by an increase of autophosphorylation activity of KdpD (Fig. 2). The influence of Na+ and K+ ions on the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD was tested in a further experiment, in which isoosmolar buffers inside and outside of the RSO-MV of varying NaCl and KCl concentrations were used. In RSO-MV maintained in NaCl-containing buffer, autophosphorylation activity of KdpD was rising with an increase of the NaCl concentration. In the case of KCl KdpD autophosphorylation was not observed at any concentration (Fig. 3). To distinguish between either an inhibitory effect of K+ or a failure of K+ to stimulate, the simultaneous effect of Na+and K+ on the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD was tested. As before, isoosmolar buffers inside and outside of the RSO-MV were used. Autophosphorylation activity of KdpD in the presence of NaCl as a stimulatory compound was strongly inhibited by KCl at a concentration as low as 1 mm (Fig. 4). Generally, higher NaCl concentrations resulted in a higher degree of KdpD phosphorylation indicating the mixed influence of K+ and Na+. Taken together with the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3, the results reveal that autophosphorylation of KdpD increases with an increase of the ionic strength inside the vesicles, whereas K+ concentrations higher than 1 mm are inhibitory. It is known that a sudden increase in medium osmolality also induces kdpFABC expression inE. coli. However, it has to be mentioned here that under certain conditions salts as osmotic solutes are much more effective to induce kdpFABC expression compared with non-ionic compounds,e.g. sugars. The reason for this difference is unknown. To shed light on this matter, the following experiments were carried out to test the influence of ionic versus non-ionic osmolytes outside of RSO-MV on the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD. For each test RSO-MV were loaded with radiolabeled ATP, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in buffer of increasing osmolality. Sucrose, glucose, and sorbitol were used as non-ionic and NaCl and KCl as ionic osmolytes. The results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that an increase of the osmolality with salts as osmolytes significantly stimulates KdpD autophosphorylation activity, whereas sugars are less effective. The highest stimulation was obtained with NaCl (4-fold), followed by KCl (2.7-fold) and sucrose, sorbitol, and glucose (2–2.4-fold). However, the maximal autophosphorylation activities of KdpD determined in these experiments were lower compared with those described above, indicating that variations of the buffer outside of the vesicles have a weaker effect on KdpD autophosphorylation activity than the variation of the osmolality inside. To increase the overall phosphorylation level and to get closer to the conditions within whole cells, the same experiments were carried out with RSO-MV loaded with 100 mm NaCl or 150 mmHEPES/NaOH buffer, conditions for which the highest activation of KdpD was shown. Although under these conditions higher autophosphorylation activities were detectable, the ratios between the stimulatory effects of salts and sugars remained the same (data not shown). So far, no effects of amphipathic compounds on wild-type KdpD in whole cells, inverted membrane vesicles, or with purified protein in proteoliposomes were detectable. 3K. Jung, unpublished observation. However, Mizuno's group (11Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that certain KdpD derivatives, which fail to respond to an increase of the external K+ concentration, became sensitive toward amphipathic compounds. It is known that this kind of compounds, e.g. procaine (a local anesthetic) or chlorpromazine, intercalate into lipid bilayers and might thereby mimic the stimulus for KdpD. Therefore, we also tested the effect of increasing concentrations of the amphipathic compounds procaine and chlorpromazine. However, none of these compounds at any tested concentration or after various incubation times affected the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD (data not shown). To test whether the inhibitory effect of K+ ions (inside of the vesicles) on KdpD autophosphorylation is an artifact of the vesicle system or is of physiological significance, a KdpD derivative was used, which causes constitutive kdpFABC expression in vivo (22Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26415-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, RSO-MV bearing KdpD, in which Arg at position 511 is replaced with Gln (KdpD-R511Q), were prepared. These vesicles were tested for autophosphorylation activity of KdpD-R511Q with isoosmolar buffers of varying NaCl or KCl concentrations on both sides of the membrane. As shown for wild-type KdpD, an increase of the NaCl concentration led to an increase of the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD (Fig. 6). In contrast to wild-type KdpD, a stimulatory effect was also observed for KCl, indicating that this KdpD derivative lost the ability to distinguish between Na+ and K+. Little is known to which stimulus (stimuli) the membrane-bound sensor kinase KdpD is responding to. Epstein and co-workers (23Malli R. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5102-5108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have put forward the hypothesis that KdpD is a turgor sensor. In contrast, the model of Mizuno et al. (11Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) describes two mechanisms for KdpD activation: K+ limitation and osmotic upshift. Other groups argue that the K+ signal is related to the internal K+ level and/or the processes of K+ transport (24Asha H. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4528-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Frymier J.S. Reed T.D. Fletcher S.A. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3061-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the external K+ concentration (26Roe A.J. McLaggan D. O'Byrne C.P. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our studies presented here show for the first time that KdpD autophosphorylation is directly influenced by the internal concentration of K+ and the ionic strength. In vitro phosphorylation assays with inverted membrane vesicles (6Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), or proteoliposomes (27Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar),2 revealed that KdpD autophosphorylation activity is stimulated by salts, whereby both NaCl and KCl were effective. Using the RSO-MV test system described here, in which KdpD has the same orientation as in whole cells, an inhibitory effect of K+ (inside) on KdpD autophosphorylation activity was detected. These data provide for the first time evidence for a correlation between K+ concentration and KdpD autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, these results reveal that the domains, which are exposed to the cytoplasmic side, are affected by K+. Based on these results it is proposed that the intracellular K+ concentration directly influences KdpD by down-regulating the autophosphorylation activity. It is conceivable that under K+-limiting growth conditions the intracellular K+ concentration falls below a certain threshold, thereby suspending the inhibitory effect of K+ on KdpD autophosphorylation activity. That this observation is physiologically significant is supported by the finding that the single replacement of Arg-511 with Gln in KdpD abolishes its K+ sensitivity. It was recently found that KdpD-R511Q causes constitutivekdpFABC expression independent of extracellular K+ concentration (22Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26415-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In RSO-MV, the autophosphorylation activity of this protein was not inhibited by K+; to the contrary, an increase of the KCl concentration was accompanied by an increase of the autophosphorylation activity. As already mentioned above, K+ at concentrations higher than 1 mm inhibits autophosphorylation activity of KdpD in RSO-MV. However, the intracellular K+ concentration in whole cells is close to 200 mm, thus vastly greater than the sensitivity displayed here. This apparent discrepancy may be due to the fact that the K+ sensitivity of KdpD is displayed at different levels in whole cells and RSO-MV. Differences betweenin vivo and in vitro activities were, for example, reported for the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP). The channel derives its name from the fact that it is blocked by intracellular ATP. However, KATP channel activity was detected in intact cells at intracellular ATP concentrations that inhibited the channel activity almost completely in isolated membrane patches. Recent studies identified the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate as the compound, which reduces the ATP sensitivity drastically (28Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 29Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar).kdpFABC expression in intact cells is also found in response to an osmotic upshift, where the K+ content of the cells is normal or even higher. Therefore, in addition to the K+concentration, other primary stimuli for KdpD activation must exist. An increase of the ionic strength (NaCl, RbCl, or HEPES/NaOH) inside the RSO-MV has led to a stimulation of the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD. In experiments in which the external buffer was held constant at a relatively high osmolality, a maximum of autophosphorylation activity was found around 100 mm salt. When isoosmolar buffers outside and inside of increasing ionic strength were used, a clear correlation between ionic strength and KdpD autophosphorylation activity was detectable. The dependence of KdpD activity on ionic strength was still present in the KdpD-R511Q derivative, suggesting that an increase of the ionic strength inside the vesicles is a positive stimulus for KdpD autophosphorylation activity. In vivo, due to the loss of K+ or due to an osmotic upshock, cells lose water leading to an increase of the concentration of all molecules (30Record M.T.J. Courtenay E.S. Cayley D.S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which in turn increases the ionic strength. Thus, it is conceivable that the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD is stimulated under these conditions. Although turgor cannot be established across the membrane of RSO-MV, they still behave like osmometers. For example, it has been shown that the transporter and osmosensor ProP of E. coli is activated by hyperosmotic shifts imposed by NaCl or sucrose in RSO-MV (31Milner J.L. Grothe S. Wood J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increased osmolality outside the RSO-MV also stimulated KdpD autophosphorylation activity. The highest stimulation was found with NaCl and KCl, although the effect with KCl was significantly smaller at higher osmolalities. Since it cannot be excluded that KCl reaches the lumen of the vesicles, both the inhibitory effect and the stimulatory effect from the outside might cancel each other out in this autophosphorylation experiment. The non-ionic solutes, sucrose, glucose, and sorbitol, stimulated KdpD autophosphorylation activity about 2-fold. These results indicate that changes in membrane strain (shrinkage) influence KdpD activity; however, salts are more effective than sugars. An increase of the osmolality outside of the vesicles leads to shrinkage due to loss of water from the lumen. Since ATP was incorporated in the vesicles before the osmotic shift, it is difficult to differentiate whether non-ionic osmolytes stimulate KdpD activity due to changes of membrane strain or simply by an increase of the intravesicular ATP concentration. Moreover, the maximal stimulatory effect from the outside was smaller compared with that observed by an increase of the salt concentration inside the RSO-MV. Furthermore, KdpD in RSO-MV could not be activated in the presence of amphiphilic compounds. These results are in favor of a special effect of salts rather than changes of membrane strain on KdpD activation. Alsoin vivo salts are more effective in the induction ofkdpFABC expression than non-polar compounds at the same osmolality. This can be explained either by a specific effect of salts on phospholipids or by an effect on the interaction between phospholipids and protein. In accord with this is the finding that KdpD autophosphorylation activity is dependent on negatively charged phospholipids (32Stallkamp I. Dowhan W. Altendorf K. Jung K. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on the results presented here the following model for the regulation of KdpD activity is proposed (Fig. 7). KdpD catalyzes several reactions: its autophosphorylation, the transfer of the phosphoryl group to KdpE, and the dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P. The autophosphorylation activity of KdpD is inhibited by [K+], but stimulated by ionic strength from the inside. Salts at the outside also stimulate the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD, whereas sugars have only a weak or no effect at all. In accord with a recently identified and characterized regulatory ATP-binding site (33Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the data suggest that autophosphorylation activity of KdpD is not a result of changes in turgor per se. Instead, various, mainly intracellular, factors, which are all related to a decrease in turgor, influence the autophosphorylation activity of KdpD. This conclusion might also be true for the activation of other osmosensors of bacteria. We thank Anne Revermann for excellent technical assistance."

Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The small phosphoprotein is composed of a cytosolic N-terminal domain (residues 1–30) and a highly hydrophobic, C-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 31–52). In cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, PLB mediates the hormonally controlled regulation of the Ca2+-pump by modulating the apparent affinity of the ATPase for calcium (3Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Odermatt A. Kurzydlowski K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of PLB at Ser-16 and/or at Thr-17 in the cytosolic domain restores the high apparent Ca2+ affinity, causing an activation of ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+-transport at submicromolar ionized calcium while leaving theVmax of the enzyme measured at saturating ionized calcium concentration largely unchanged (2Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). On SDS-PAGE, PLB exhibits a remarkable pattern of oligomerization, being distributed mainly between populations of monomers (20%) and homopentamers (80%) (5Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine- and phenylalanine-scanning mutagenesis has been utilized to identify key amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain of PLB that are critical for pentamer formation. The pentamer-stabilizing amino acids are Leu residues 37, 44, and 51 and Ile residues 40 and 47, all of which are located in the transmembrane α-helix (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). When plotted on a heptad repeat, these residues appear at a 3–4-residue spacing, with the critical Leu and Ile residues required for pentamer stabilization found clustered on one face of the PLB transmembrane α-helix, at positions a andd, respectively (Fig. 1 A). On SDS-PAGE, single Ala (or Phe) substitutions at any one of these Leu and Ile residues is sufficient to substantially disrupt pentamer formation (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation to Ala (or Phe) at sites b, c,e, and f (i.e. on the other face of the PLB transmembrane helix (Fig. 1 A)) does not affect pentamer formation substantially. A Leu/Ile zipper model of PLB was proposed to explain its unique oligomerization, in which the aliphatic side chains of the Leu and Ile residues at positionsa and d of adjacent PLB protomers interdigitate and, by hydrophobic forces, promote the assembly of protomers into pentamers (Fig. 1 B). Further supporting the Leu/Ile zipper model was the observation that isomeric mutations at positions 37, 44, and 51 (Leu to Ile), and at position 47 (Ile to Leu) facilitated a partial restoration of PLB oligomerization (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In an independent study employing alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the transmembrane domain of PLB, Kimura et al. (7Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Moreover, these investigators extended the earlier work by co-expressing the mutated PLB molecules with the Ca2+-ATPase and measuring functional effects. A relatively strong correlation was observed in which Ala point mutations in the Leu/Ile zipper region of PLB that disabled PLB pentamerization on SDS-PAGE actually enhanced PLB inhibitory function on Ca2+ transport activity (7Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These strong monomeric inhibitors of the Ca2+-pump were called “supershifters” because they lowered the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme substantially more than wild type PLB (WT-PLB) (7Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Based on these results, the hypothesis was proposed that the monomeric form of PLB is, in fact, the inhibitory species that is responsible for binding to the Ca2+-pump and inhibiting it. In parallel studies, Autry and Jones (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) observed that the monomeric mutant of PLB, L37A-PLB, was a much stronger inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase than was pentameric WT-PLB and also proposed that the PLB monomer is the species inhibiting the Ca2+-pump. This active monomer hypothesis (7Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), based on correlations between SDS-PAGE analyses of oligomeric states of different PLB mutants and the abilities of these mutants to inhibit the SERCA2a Ca2+-pump in expression systems, was supported by measurements of the intramembrane oligomeric states of purified WT- and L37A-PLB in lipid bilayers. When reconstituted in phospholipids, the oligomeric states of WT- and L37A-PLB were found to be mainly pentameric and mainly monomeric, respectively, as predicted from SDS-PAGE results. Moreover, the distribution of PLB oligomers in lipid bilayers appeared to be in a dynamic equilibrium regulated by PLB phosphorylation (9Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, dissociation of PLB monomers from pentamers was proposed to occur in native sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, where Ca2+-pump molecules are present and may interface with inhibitory domains of the PLB monomers. In support of this, using spectroscopic techniques capable of detecting intramembrane protein interactions, Reddy et al. (10Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3954-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) recently observed that co-reconstitution of the Ca2+-pump in lipid membranes along with native PLB specifically promoted the depolymerization of the PLB homopentamers into populations of PLB monomers and smaller oligomers. In the alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of the transmembrane region of PLB in which PLB was co-expressed with the Ca2+-pump, Kimura et al. (7Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) also noted that several point mutations of PLB disrupted its inhibitory interaction with the Ca2+-pump. Remarkably, all of these were located on the face of the PLB transmembrane helix opposite to the Leu/Ile zipper residues (i.e. at positions e,b, and f in Fig. 1 A), suggesting that this region of the PLB membrane-spanning helix is the one responsible for binding to and inhibiting the Ca2+-pump. Thus, for the first time, specific residues that might be necessary for Ca2+-pump inhibition were identified in the transmembrane domain of PLB (7Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In summary, mutagenesis results addressing PLB topology and structure/function suggest that the transmembrane region of PLB contains two major protein interface domains; at one face of the transmembrane helix are located residues whose function is to promote PLB pentamer stabilization-destabilization (6Simmerman H.K.B.

In this “two-faced” model of PLB transmembrane domain interaction with the Ca2+-pump (2Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. Physiol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas residues at positions b,e, and f of the PLB transmembrane helix are responsible for Ca2+-pump inhibition (7Kimura Y.

However, not all mutations in the membrane-spanning region of PLB that have been investigated produce functional effects that are consistent with this two-faced mode of action. For example, the C41F mutation of PLB produces all monomers on SDS-PAGE but gives a somewhat weaker inhibition of the Ca2+-pump than does WT-PLB (12Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); the I40L mutant of PLB, in contrast to I40A-PLB, produces a substantial fraction of pentamers on SDS-PAGE but nonetheless remains a much stronger inhibitor of the Ca2+-pump than WT-PLB, being comparable in inhibitory potency with I40A-PLB (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). N27A-PLB, which harbors the Ala substitution in the cytoplasmic domain of PLB, is the strongest SERCA2a supershifting inhibitor of all of the PLB point mutants tested to date, including the monomeric transmembrane mutants, yet retains pentameric stability comparable with WT-PLB (14Kimura Y.

Muchnok T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, we completed our previous mutational study on the Leu/Ile zipper residues of PLB (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) by correlating hydrophobic residue substitutions in this region with functional effects on Ca2+-pump activity. Previously, only Ala substitutions in this region have been analyzed in any detail for functional effects on Ca2+-pump activity, and it is from results of these Ala mutagenesis studies that the two-faced model of PLB action was largely developed (2Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 7Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Since several of the Leu-Ile isomeric substitutions in this region retain pentamer stability, whereas all of the Phe substitutions are pentamer-disruptive (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we reasoned that if the two-faced model of PLB transmembrane action is correct, then pentamer-retaining mutations in the Leu/Ile zipper region of PLB should all be relatively weak inhibitors of the Ca2+-pump compared with the monomeric mutants, whereas pentamer-disruptive mutations in this region should all be strong inhibitors. Surprisingly, this supposition proved to be wrong. Some point mutations in the Leu/Ile zipper region of PLB produced very strong superinhibition of the Ca2+-pump but nevertheless were quite effective in maintaining a considerable fraction of stable pentamers, whereas other mutations in this region were completely pentamer-disruptive but were substantially weaker inhibitors of the Ca2+-pump. The combined results of the mutational analysis call into question the two-faced model of monomer action and suggest that a more complicated mechanism must be invoked to rationally explain how PLB inhibits the Ca2+-pump. DNA synthesizing, modifying, and restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The Sequenase™ sequencing kit was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [α-35S]dATP and 125I-labeled protein A were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sf21 insect cells were purchased from Invitrogen, and the BaculoGoldTMtransfection system was obtained from Pharmingen. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Point mutations were introduced in the canine isoform of PLB, as described previously, using the Altered Sites II Mutagenesis SystemTM (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). All DNA mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Mutated inserts were subcloned into the BglII site of the pVL1393 transfection vector and co-transfected into Sf21 with BaculoGoldTM-linearized baculovirus DNA using the BaculoGoldTM transfection kit (Pharmingen). Recombinant baculovirus clones were isolated using a plaque assay as described previously (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Plaques were amplified individually, and PLB expression was confirmed by immunoblotting. Canine SERCA2a and PLB were co-expressed in Sf21 insect cells as described previously (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Sf21 cells were maintained at 27 °C in suspension cultures that were split every 72 h with Grace's insect cell medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 0.1% Pluronic® F-68 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. The cells were maintained at densities between 0.3 and 4.0 × 106 cells/ml. For expression, multiplicities of infection of 10–15 and 5 were used for SERCA2a and PLB, respectively. The virus-infected cells were cultured in suspension for 48 h, after which they were sedimented at 1000 ×g at 4 °C in a Beckman GPR centrifuge. The cell pellets were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, in the same flasks and under the same conditions of centrifugation. All subsequent operations were at 4 °C. For preparation of Sf21 cell microsomes, the washed pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of medium containing 10 mmNaHCO3 and 0.2 mm CaCl2, supplemented with the protease inhibitors aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), and Pefabloc SC (0.1 mm). The cells were transferred to JA-20 centrifuge tubes and homogenized with a Polytron three times for 30 s at 14,000 rpm with 10-s breaks. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 45 min in a Beckman JA-20 rotor, and the supernatants were collected and spun in a Beckman type 70 Ti rotor at 50,000 ×g for 35 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1.5–2 ml in 50 mm MOPS, 0.3 m sucrose, and 5 mmNaN3 (pH 7.0) supplemented with the protease inhibitors above and subjected to a final homogenization in a 2-ml Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. The protein concentration of the microsomal suspension was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was between 4 and 6 mg/ml. The yield of microsomal protein was typically 10 mg from 120 ml of cell culture suspension. Microsomes were stored frozen in small aliquots at −80 °C. Microsomal samples were solubilized with an equal volume of SDS-dissociation medium containing 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 5% glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, and different SDS concentrations as described under “Results.” SDS-PAGE was performed in 8% polyacrylamide and 0.1% SDS using the buffer system of Porzio and Pearson (17Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) with a Hoefer 600 series electrophoresis unit. Typically, 5 μg of protein in a total volume of 30 μl were loaded in each gel lane. Electrophoresis was conducted at 25 mA/gel until the samples completely entered the gel slab, and then the current was raised to 75 mA/gel until the tracking dye was 1 cm from the bottom of the gel. Water circulation in the buffer tank was set at 10 °C. Electrophoresed proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose sheets and immunoblotted with anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody 2A7-A1 or with anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 2D12 (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Antibody-binding protein bands were visualized by 125I-protein A and autoradiography. Quantitative analysis of protein expression was performed using a Bio-Rad Personal Fx phosphor imager. Prior to Ca2+-ATPase measurements, the microsomal samples were incubated for 20 min on ice with and without the 2D12 anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, at a ratio of 1:1 (mg of microsome protein/mg of antibody) (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase assays were then carried out at 37 °C on 96-well microplates using an enzyme-coupled continuous assay. The assay medium was composed of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/mlA23187, 0.5 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 10 IU/mll-lactic dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, and 0.18 mm NADH. CaCl2 was added to achieve the desired ionized calcium concentrations (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The concentration of microsomes in the assay wells was 0.13 mg/ml in a volume of 0.15 ml. Reactions were initiated by adding ATP to a final concentration of 2.4 mm, and the rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the rate of NADH decay determined by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm in a SPECTRAmax® PLUS (Molecular Devices) microplate spectrophotometer. Reactions were typically conducted for 15 min, during which the rates of ATP hydrolysis were constant. To calculate the Ca2+-dependent activation of SERCA2a, the data were fit to the empirical Hill equation for cooperative binding of multiple ligands, v=VmaxKCan[Cai] n+KCanEquation 1 where v represents the turnover rate at a particular concentration of ionized calcium, Vmax is the maximum turnover rate at optimal calcium, n is the Hill coefficient, and KCa is the concentration of free calcium at which v is one-halfVmax. Basal ATPase activities, measured in the absence of added Ca2+, were subtracted from total ATPase activities to yield the Ca2+-ATPase activities reported. Descending segments of the curves obtained at very high ionized calcium concentrations (18Jones L.R. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1979; 557: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were excluded from the analyses. Leu37 is a key residue located in the Leu/Ile zipper region of PLB (2Simmerman H.K.B.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, we correlated effects of single amino acid substitutions here on the pentameric stability of PLB with the functional effects on SERCA2a activity. Fig. 2 shows the effect of SDS concentration on the oligomeric stability of WT-PLB and PLB mutated at Leu 37 with amino acids of varying hydrophobicity. Consistent with previous results (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), when PLB was co-expressed with the Ca2+-pump in Sf21 cell microsomes and solubilized in 3.5% SDS, WT-PLB migrated predominantly as a pentamer on SDS-PAGE, whereas L37A-PLB was almost totally monomeric (Fig. 2,A and B). L37F-PLB solubilized in 3.5% SDS was also virtually completely monomeric, whereas L37I-PLB formed a substantial fraction of pentamers (Fig. 2, C andD). Similar analyses on the oligomeric structure of PLB have been conducted previously, in which a single high concentration of SDS was used for PLB solubilization (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M.

By using a range of SDS concentrations in the sample solubilization buffer, however, some interesting new features on the ability of PLB to oligomerize became apparent (Fig. 2). First, the two mutants thought previously to be incapable of forming significant amounts of pentamers, L37A- and L37F-PLB (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), in fact formed appreciable amounts of stable pentamers when the concentration of SDS in the solubilization buffer was lowered. For example, at SDS concentrations between 0.5 and 1.0%, L37A- and L37F-PLB formed 20–45% stable pentamers; only at 3.5% or higher SDS concentrations were these mutants completely monomeric, as reported previously (6Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Second, L37I-PLB was a much more stable pentamer than either L37A- or L37F-PLB, rivaling WT-PLB in its ability to oligomerize (Fig. 2 C). Between 0.5 and 1.5% SDS, this mutant formed 50% stable pentamers (Fig. 2 E). Third, WT-PLB formed the same amount of pentamers regardless of the SDS concentration. Between 0.5 and 7.5% SDS, the fraction of WT-PLB pentamers remained virtually constant at 70–80% (Fig. 2, A and E). By plotting the fraction of pentamers formed at each SDS concentration for each mutant (Fig. 2 E), a much better estimate of pentameric stability was allowed than by using a single high concentration of SDS as in previous reports (6Simmerman H.K.B.

In cardiomyocytes, mitogen-activated protein kinases as well as protein kinase C isoforms have been shown to be important in the transduction of trophic signals. The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin has also been suggested to play a role in cardiac growth. In the present report, we investigate possible cross-talks between calcineurin, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in controlling angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy. Angiotensin II-stimulated cardiomyocytes and mice with angiotensin II-dependent renovascular hypertension were treated with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. Calcineurin, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activations were determined. We show that cyclosporin A blocks angiotensin II-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in cultured primary cardiomyocytes and in the heart of hypertensive mice. Cyclosporin A also inhibits specific protein kinase C isoforms. In vivo, cyclosporin A prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy, and this effect appears to be independent of hemodynamic changes. These data suggest cross-talks between the calcineurin pathway, the protein kinase C, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades in transducing angiotensin II-mediated stimuli in cardiomyocytes and could provide the basis for an integrated model of cardiac hypertrophy.

Laragh J.H. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management. Raven Press, New York1990: 1287-1317Google Scholar). The renin-angiotensin system also plays a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, since drugs that inhibit Ang II production or its binding to specific receptors, reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Normalization of blood pressure is followed by a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy that is usually associated with chronic hypertension (2Dahlöf B. J. Hum. Hypertens. 1995; 9 (suppl.): 37-44Google Scholar). In addition to its hemodynamic effects, Ang II also contributes directly to the hypertrophic response via its growth factor properties on cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts (3Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Different intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated in transducing Ang II-induced hypertrophic stimuli. Signaling through the Ang II Gq protein-coupled AT1 receptors leads to the activation of phospholipase C, which results in the production of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate. In turn, diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (PKC), and inositol triphosphate induces a raise in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) (4Dostal D.E. Hunt R.A. Kule C.E. Bhat G.J. Karoor V. McWhinney C.D. Baker K.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2893-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ang II receptors also stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (5Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). At least three families of MAPK have been described, namely the extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK or p42/44), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) also known as the stress-activated kinases, and the p38 MAPK (6Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Activation of MAPK is the result of phosphorylation cascades involving the small GTP-binding proteins Ras and Rac. Moreover, PKC has also been suggested to participate in the activation of MAPK (7Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 8Kudoh S. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Takekoshi N. Yazaki Y. Circ.

Recent studies identified the pathway involving the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) as important in the development of cardiac hypertrophy (10Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). CaN dephosphorylates a family of transcription factors known as NF-ATs (nuclear factor of activatedT cells) (11Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In particular, NF-AT3, which is expressed in cardiomyocytes (12Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), binds upon dephosphorylation to the transcription factor GATA4 to up-regulate cardiac-specific gene expression (13Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits CaN activity through binding to the inhibitory protein cyclophilin (14Bierer B.E. Hollander G. Fruman D. Burakoff S.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, CsA was shown to reduce cardiac hypertrophy induced in transgenic mice by a constitutive form of CaN (10Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Recent studies using more physiological models have also reported a role for CaN in the development of cardiac hypertrophy (15Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N. Robbins J.

Kudoh S. Shibasaki F. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CsA inhibits Ang II-stimulated gene expression in rat primary cardiomyocytes in vitro (10Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Similarly, CaN is suggested to be involved in the cardiac expression of the immediate response genes in the hypertrophied heart (16Shimoyama M. Hayashi D. Takimoto E. Zou Y. Oka T. Uozumi H. Kudoh S. Shibasaki F. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of CaN in mediating Ang II-dependent cardiac growth in vivo remains to be established (17Luo Z. Shyu K.G. Gualberto A. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1092-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Müller J.G. Nemoto S. Laser M. Carabello B.A. Menick D.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1007Google Scholar, 19Zhang W. Kowal R.C. Rusnak F.

In this model, one renal artery is constricted to reduce renal perfusion, and the other kidney remains untouched. In response to low renal arterial pressure, plasma renin concentrations and then AngII levels are rapidly increased, resulting in chronic elevation of blood pressure and subsequent cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study, we used mouse primary cardiomyocytes and a murine model of renovascular hypertension (22Wiesel P. Mazzolai L. Nussberger J. Pedrazzini T. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) to investigate whether CaN could play a role in cardiac hypertrophy. Results demonstrate that CsA inhibits Ang II-induced MAPK activation in primary cardiomyocytes as well as in cardiac tissue possibly via a PKC-dependent mechanism. In addition, CaN blockade also prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy during renovascular hypertension. Taken together, these results suggest cross-talks between the CaN and the MAPK pathways for Ang II-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy Eight-week-old, male C57BL/6 mice (Iffa Credo, L'Arbresle, France) were injected intraperitoneally with either saline or 25 mg of CsA (Sandimmun®, Novartis, Switzerland)/kg of body weight twice daily starting on the day of clipping. Mice were maintained on sterile tap water and regular rodent diet ad libitum. Neonatal C57BL/6 mouse ventricles were separated from atria. Cardiomyocytes and nonmyocyte cells were purified as described (23Pellieux C. Sauthier T. Domenighetti A. Marsh D.J. Palmiter R.D. Brunner H.R. Pedrazzini T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and plated at a density of 0.1 × 106 cells/cm2 on gelatin-coated wells and noncoated wells, respectively. After 24 h in culture, cells were switched to no serum medium, and Ang II was added 24 h later. Nonmyocyte cells were passaged once before the addition of no serum medium. Cells were pretreated with either 250 ng/ml CsA or 150 ng/ml FK506 for 20 min prior to the addition of 100 nm Ang II. Stimulation time was 5 min for p38 and ERK and 10 min for JNK. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNaVO3, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The lysates were either heated at 95 °C for 5 min for SDS-PAGE or kept frozen until used. In some experiments, cells were cultured in absence of calcium. In this case, cardiomyocytes were switched to calcium-free medium and then treated for 2 h. with 100 μm thapsigargin. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using 1.5% halothane in oxygen. The left kidney was exposed, and a clip (0.12-mm opening) was inserted on the renal artery isolated by blunt dissection as described (22Wiesel P. Mazzolai L. Nussberger J. Pedrazzini T. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sham procedure included the entire surgery with the exception of artery clipping. For blood pressure and heart rate measurement, the right carotid artery was exposed through cervical incision. A silicon catheter filled with 5% glucose solution containing heparin (300 IU/ml) was inserted into the vessel and tunneled subcutaneously to exit at the back of the neck. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in conscious mice by connecting the catheter to a pressure transducer using a computerized data acquisition system (Notocord, Paris, France). Heart and kidneys were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until used. Heart wet weight (without the atria) was normalized to the tibial length and to body weight. Hearts were rapidly excised and rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Atria were removed, and ventricles were homogenized on ice in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. Homogenates were sonicated on ice for three bursts of 5 s each and centrifuged for 15 min at 4200 rpm at 4 °C. Lysates were kept frozen until used or SDS-PAGE loading buffer (125 mmTris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) was added to reach a final concentration of 25%. Lysates were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and run in 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford. Thirty μg of soluble proteins were run in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (ECL nitrocellulose; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phosphorylated MAPK were detected by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies for the phosphorylated forms of p38, ERK, and JNK (New England Biolabs). After overnight incubation at 4 °C in blotto (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk), first antibodies were revealed using anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MAPK phosphorylation was quantified by laser-scanning densitometry of specific phosphorylated bands (NIH Image). Cells were lysed in 50 μl in 12.5 mm Tris, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 120 μmpepstatin A, 200 μm leupeptin, 200 μmaprotinin, pH 7.4. Extracts were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Soluble fractions were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in 2× SDS loading buffer. Particulate fractions were washed once in lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min in 2× loading buffer. Samples were run in SDS-PAGE and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane as above. PKC isoforms were detected using isoform-specific antibodies (Biomol). The activity of the different PKC isoforms (α, β, ε, ζ) in vivo was measured by immunoprecipitating from cardiac protein extracts each isoform using specific antibodies (Biomol). Activity was assayed at 30 °C in the presence of 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (24Alexander D.R. Graves J.D. Lucas S.C. Cantrell D.A. Crumpton M.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The amounts of32P-labeled peptide were measured by liquid scintillation counting. To block the different PKC isoforms, cardiomyocytes were treated with 2 μm of isoform-specific PKC inhibitors (Biomol) for 24 h. Assay was performed essentially as described (21Meguro T. Hong C. Asai K. Takagi G. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Vatner S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts or cultured cardiomyocytes were homogenized in 1 ml of assay buffer (0.1 m MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Soluble cardiac extracts were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 μmCaCl2, 500 μm dithiothreitol, 100 nm calmodulin, 500 nm okadaic acid, pH 8, in the presence of 2 × 106 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled RII peptide. Free 32P was separated from RII substrate using a Dowex AG 50W-X8 cation exchange resin (Bio-Rad). Remaining phosphorylated RII substrate was quantitated by scintillation counting. Total RNA was purified with TriPure (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Ten μg of total RNA was separated on 1% formamide-agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kidney RNAs were hybridized with a radiolabeled mouse renin probe (kindly provided by Dr. K. Nakayama, University of Tsukuba, Japan), and heart RNAs were hybridized with a mouse brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) probe. The intensity of hybridization signals was quantified with an Instant Imager detector (Packard Instruments). The blots were then stripped and hybridized with a mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe for normalization. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. Group means were compared by analysis of variance using a Student-Newman-Keuls test for post hoc comparison.p values < 0.05 were considered significant. To investigate possible cross-talks between the Ang II-activated MAPK and CaN pathways, cardiac myocytes and nonmyocyte cells were stimulated with Ang II, and phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and JNK was measured. All three kinases were activated in cardiac myocytes in response to Ang II (Fig. 1, A–D). In contrast, in nonmyocyte cells, p38 was not activated (Fig. 2, A–D). In addition, Ang II stimulation led to a marked increase in CaN activity in myocytes (TableI). This activity was completely inhibited in the presence of CsA. Blockade of the CaN pathway in cardiomyocytes using CsA resulted in the complete inhibition of the activation of all three MAPK by Ang II (Fig. 1, A–D). To exclude nonspecific inhibition of CsA on MAPK activation, we studied the effects of FK506, a different CaN blocker (14Bierer B.E. Hollander G. Fruman D. Burakoff S.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This drug was as effective as CsA in inhibiting Ang II-induced MAPK activation in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1, A–D). Similarly, ERK and JNK phosphorylation was inhibited by CsA treatment in nonmyocyte cells (Fig. 2, A–D).Figure 2Inhibition of MAPK activation in Ang II-stimulated (100 nm) nonmyocyte cells treated with CsA (250 ng/ml).

To investigate whether PKC could be affected by CsA treatment, we determined the activity of two calcium-dependent (PKCα and -β) and two calcium-independ-ent (PKCε and -ζ) isoforms of PKC in Ang II-stimulated primary cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3 A). Ang II activated all four PKC isoforms as shown by the translocation of the protein from the soluble to the particulate cellular fraction (Fig. 3 A). CsA differently affected the activity of the different isoforms. First, CsA completely inhibited the Ang II-induced translocation of calcium-independent PKC isoforms. Interestingly, CsA alone was able to stimulate the activation of calcium-dependent PKC isoforms. To further study the stimulation of PKCα and -β by CsA, the experiment was repeated in the absence of calcium (Fig. 3 B). In this case, CsA was not able to activate PKCα and -β. In accordance with previously published data, calcium removal also inhibited Ang II-stimulated activation of PKCα and -β. As expected, the absence of calcium had no effect on calcium-independent PKC isoforms (PKCε and -ζ). To determine whether the PKC isoforms, which were inhibited by CsA, were implicated in Ang II-induced MAPK activation in cardiomyocytes, we used a series of isoform-specific PKC inhibitors. Blockade of the activity of calcium-independent PKC isoforms (PKCε and -ζ) completely abolished Ang II-stimulated MAPK activation (Fig. 4, A–D). In contrast, the inhibition of a calcium-dependent PKC isoform (β) had no effect on MAPK stimulation by Ang II (Fig. 4,A–D). To study the possible role of CaN in the development of cardiac hypertrophy induced by a chronic elevation of blood pressure, CsA was administered to sham-operated and 2K1C mice with Ang II-dependent hypertension. Four weeks after clipping, a significant increase in systemic blood pressure was observed in untreated 2K1C mice (Fig. 5 A). In these animals, elevated pressure resulted in the development of cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 5, B and C, and TableII). In contrast, CsA treatment completely blocked the increase in cardiac mass. To exclude the possibility that a detrimental effect of CsA on animal growth could represent a confounding factor in these experiments, the development of cardiac hypertrophy was followed by calculating both heart weight to tibial length as well as heart weight to body weight ratios. Both parameters showed consistent CsA-dependent inhibition of cardiac growth. In addition, body weights did not significantly vary in CsA-treated animals (body weight in sham untreated: 25.4 ± 0.7 g; sham CsA-treated: 24.7 ± 0.3 g; clipped untreated: 25.2 ± 0.7 g; clipped CsA-treated: 24.3 ± 0.7 g). Importantly, blood pressure was as high in 2K1C mice receiving CsA as that measured in untreated 2K1C mice (Fig. 5 A). To further evaluate the effect of CsA on cardiac tissues, BNP expression was measured as an index of cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 6 A). Clipped animals showed a 3-fold increase in BNP expression in cardiac tissues as compared with controls. In contrast, CsA-treatment blocked stimulated BNP transcription in 2K1C mice. To verify if the type of hypertension that developed in CsA-treated 2K1C mice was still renin-dependent, renin expression in the clipped kidney was determined. Renin mRNA levels were significantly elevated in both untreated and CsA-treated 2K1C mice as compared with values observed in respective control animals (Fig. 6 B).Table IIEffect of CsA treatment on cardiac hypertrophy and activation of MAPKs in vivoGroupnDays after clippingHeart wet weightTibial lengthHW/TL 2-aHW, heart weight; TL, tibial length.ratiop38ERKJNKmgmmmg/mmSham untreated4394 ± 217.5 ± 0.15.4 ± 0.11.00 ± 0.051.00 ± 0.021.00 ± 0.034790 ± 617.3 ± 0.25.2 ± 0.31.00 ± 0.061.00 ± 0.031.00 ± 0.05528100 ± 317.4 ± 0.15.7 ± 0.11.00 ± 0.041.00 ± 0.041.00 ± 0.07Clipped untreated53100 ± 317.7 ± 0.25.7 ± 0.10.90 ± 0.021.20 ± 0.05*1.24 ± 0.03*47102 ± 417.4 ± 0.25.9 ± 0.21.03 ± 0.071.51 ± 0.06*1.55 ± 0.05*728113 ± 3*17.7 ± 0.16.4 ± 0.2*1.80 ± 0.10*1.72 ± 0.05*1.70 ± 0.05*Sham CsA-treated6379 ± 216.7 ± 0.14.4 ± 0.11.00 ± 0.060.98 ± 0.050.99 ± 0.029782 ± 117.3 ± 0.24.7 ± 0.10.99 ± 0.051.01 ± 0.041.01 ± 0.0592889 ± 117.6 ± 0.15.1 ± 0.10.92 ± 0.060.94 ± 0.070.91 ± 0.06Clipped CsA-treated5380 ± 2*17.7 ± 0.24.6 ± 0.1*0.90 ± 0.021.00 ± 0.021.00 ± 0.024781 ± 317.6 ± 0.14.6 ± 0.20.95 ± 0.051.05 ± 0.051.15 ± 0.0762885 ± 2*17.4 ± 0.24.9 ± 0.1*1.00 ± 0.061.02 ± 0.031.05 ± 0.052-aHW, heart weight; TL, tibial length.MAPK activities are expressed as means of fold-increase values ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05 compared with sham untreated group.2-a HW, heart weight; TL, tibial length.

We first confirmed that CsA treatment resulted in CaN inhibition in vivo. Data in Table I demonstrated that CaN activity in the heart of 2K1C mice was indeed completely inhibited by CsA administration. MAPK activation was then followed during the development of cardiac hypertrophy in these mice. We first confirmed that p38, ERK, and JNK were activated in response to chronic hypertension (Table II and Fig. 7). Significant activation of both ERK and JNK was observed 3 days after clipping. In contrast, p38 appeared significantly activated only after 4 weeks. MAPK phosphorylation correlated with the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, maximum cardiac enlargement occurred concomitantly with p38 activation. Since CsA treatment prevented the increase in cardiac mass induced by renovascular hypertension (Fig. 5 and Table II) and inhibited MAPK phosphorylationin vitro (Figs. 1 and 2), we studied whether CaN blockade interfered with MAPK activation in the heart of 2K1C mice. Stimulation of all three MAPK pathways was fully inhibited by CsA injection (TableII and Fig. 7). Moreover, the activation of calcium-independent PKC isoforms (PKCε and -ζ) was also abolished by CsA treatment (TableIII). In contrast, calcium-dependent PKC isoforms (PKCα and -β) were not affected. On the contrary, in accordance to what observed in vitro, these isoforms were significantly activated by CsA (Fig. 3and Table III).Table IIIEffect of CsA treatment on isoform-specific PKC activation in vivoGroupPKCαPKCβPKCɛPKCζSham untreated1.00 ± 0.071.00 ± 0.091.00 ± 0.121.00 ± 0.05Clipped untreated1.41 ± 0.10*1.57 ± 0.04*1.69 ± 0.07*1.42 ± 0.06*Sham CsA treated1.31 ± 0.07*1.36 ± 0.05*1.07 ± 0.041.09 ± 0.12Clipped CsA treated1.47 ± 0.09*1.55 ± 0.07*1.01 ± 0.041.06 ± 0.07Means of fold-increase values ± S.E. are shown; *,p < 0.05 compared to sham untreated group.

Chronic elevation of blood pressure induces the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which appears to depend in part on MAPK activation. In the present study, we show that CaN blockade inhibits MAPK activation and prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy in renovascular hypertension, indicating points of convergence between these two pathways. The fact that a different calcineurin inhibitor, namely FK506, also blocks MAPK activation in cardiomyocytes argues against a nonspecific inhibitory effect of CsA (Fig. 1). Ang II-induced MAPK activation appears to depend on the stimulation of calcium-independent PKC isoforms (Fig. 4 and Table III). Since the activity of these particular PKC isoforms was found to be blocked by CsA, it suggests that CsA-mediated inhibition of MAPK activation could result from an inhibitory effect of CsA on calcium-independent PKC isoforms. Since the initial observation on the preventive effect of CsA on the development of cardiac hypertrophy induced in transgenic mice (10Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J.

Some studies fail to demonstrate an inhibitory effect of CsA on hypertrophy (15Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N. Robbins J. Colbert M.C. Gualberto A. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D.

The effectiveness of the CsA treatment could depend on the duration of the hypertrophic stimulus. In mice with transverse aortic constriction, pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy was also insensitive to CsA treatment (18Müller J.G. Nemoto S. Laser M. Carabello B.A. Menick D.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1007Google Scholar, 20Ding B. Price R.L. Borg T.K. Winberg E.O. Halloran P.F. Lorell B.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Meguro T. Hong C. Asai K. Takagi G. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Vatner S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, constriction of the aortic arch does not activate the renin-angiotensin system (25Wiesner R.J. Ehmke H. Faulhaber J. Zak R. Ruegg J.C. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent study demonstrated a role for CaN in a model of cardiac hypertrophy following abdominal banding known to be partially Ang II-dependent (16Shimoyama M. Hayashi D. Takimoto E. Zou Y. Oka T. Uozumi H. Kudoh S. Shibasaki F. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Accordingly, our study describes the inhibitory effect of CsA in an Ang II-dependent model (22Wiesel P. Mazzolai L. Nussberger J. Pedrazzini T. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that CaN inhibition effectively blocks Ang II-mediated cardiac hypertrophy, such as that developing in response to abdominal aortic banding or following reduced renal perfusion in renovascular hypertension, and is less effective on mechanical stretch-stimulated cardiac growth. It is noteworthy that CsA treatment does not affect renin expression, since renin mRNA in the kidney of CsA-treated 2K1C animals is as high as that observed in untreated 2K1C mice (Fig. 6 B). This suggests that CsA prevention of Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy does not result from an inhibition of the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Although CsA has been reported to increase renin secretion and synthesis, our result is consistent with other studies in CsA-treated rats, in which intrarenal renin mRNA and plasma renin activity were elevated for 2 weeks but not different from that of controls by 4 weeks (reviewed in Ref. 26Lee D.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 248-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since CsA was shown to induce anorexia (27Thiel G. Mihatsch M.J. Stahl R.A. Hermle M. Brunner F.P. Clin. Nephrol. 1986; 25: S199-S204PubMed Google Scholar), we were concerned about possible toxic effects that could result in nonspecific reduction of cardiac tissues. We think that this is unlikely to play a significant role in the present experiments for several reasons. First, heart weight normalized to tibial length or body weight gave concordant results (Fig. 5, B and C). Second, CsA treatment led to an insignificant body weight reduction of less than 5% 4 weeks after clipping. Finally, the mortality rate was not higher in CsA-treated groups than that in untreated groups (less than 5% in each experimental group). Beside its hemodynamic properties, Ang II was shown to exert growth factor effects on cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts (3Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Indeed, Ang II has been shown to stimulate several pathways involved in mitogenic signals (4Dostal D.E. Hunt R.A. Kule C.E. Bhat G.J. Karoor V. McWhinney C.D. Baker K.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2893-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hence, various concomitant activation of different pathways occurs in the heart during Ang II-dependent renovascular hypertension. These include the phosphatase CaN pathway. Indeed, Ang II readily activated CaN in cultured cardiomyocytes and in the heart of 2K1C mice (Table I). In addition, CaN could stimulate cardiac growth in part through MAPK activation, since CaN blockade resulted simultaneously in the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and in a complete inhibition of the MAPK pathways in the heart of 2K1C mice. In addition, CsA inhibits Ang II-induced activation of MAPK in cultured cardiomyocytes, which also suggests cross-talks between the CaN and the MAPK pathways. PKC has been implicated in MAPK activation in cardiomyocytes (7Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 8Kudoh S. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Takekoshi N. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 9Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CsA completely inhibits Ang II-stimulated calcium-independent PKC isoforms (PKCε and -ζ), whereas it activates by itself calcium-dependent isoforms (PKCα and -β). CsA-induced activation of PKCα and -β probably occurs through the induction of calcium release, since the stimulation of PKCα and -β activity is blocked in the absence of calcium. Indeed, calcineurin has been shown to modulate intracellular calcium fluxes (28Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Because calcium-dependent PKC isoforms are activated in CsA-treated sham-operated mice without concomitant stimulation of the MAPK pathways and in absence of a significant increase in cardiac mass, it suggests that these particular PKC isoforms do not play a important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, specific blockade of calcium-independent PKC isoforms completely inhibited Ang II-induced MAPK activation in vitro andin vivo. Therefore, these results strongly suggest a pathway linking CaN, calcium-independent PKC isoforms, and MAPK. CaN has been suggested to synergize with PKC to activate Rac (29Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 30Avraham A. Jung S. Samuels Y. Seger R. Ben-Neriah Y. Eur. J.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and CaN has also been shown to potentiate Raf-dependent activation of MAPK stimulation (32Kanno T. Siebenlist U. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5277-5283PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the activation of all three MAPK pathways (i.e. ERK, JNK, and p38) has been shown to be dependent in part on PKC stimulation (7Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 8Kudoh S. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Takekoshi N. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 9Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The results of the present study are consistent with recently published data showing that CaN blockade prevents JNK and PKC activation in aortic banded rats (33De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this Ang II-independent model of pressure overload, it appears that the PKC isoforms that are inhibited by CsA are different from those affected in our study. Finally, one cannot rule out the possibility that CaN can also act through gene transcription to subsequently activate the different MAPK pathways during chronic hypertension in vivo. CsA treatment and then CaN inhibition could block the synthesis of an unidentified MAPK activator. However, this seems rather unlikely given the fact that CsA inhibits Ang II-induced MAPK activation in cultured cardiomyocytes, in which late response genes are not activated during the short activation time. CsA treatment also induces some reduction of cardiac weight in sham-operated mice. This reduction in heart weight is likely to result from complete inhibition of pathways that are already activated in the basal state. Therefore, this CsA effect could be consistent with tonic controls of normal cardiac mass by either activated CaN, PKC, or MAPK pathways. We thank T. Sauthier, D. Grand, and J.-F.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in channel function remain to be defined. In the present work, inside-out patch experiments were employed to elucidate the role of submembranous actin dynamics in the control of sodium channels in human myeloid leukemia K562 cells.

Functional coupling between channel proteins and the cortical cytoskeleton may play a key role in membrane ion transport and cellular signaling. Involvement of F-actin in ion channel functioning has been established and studied extensively in polarized epithelial cells (1Cantiello H.F. Stow J.L. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Am. J.

Specifically, several lines of evidence revealed an association between the amiloride-sensitive sodium channels and the actin-based cytoskeleton in renal epithelia. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy demonstrated that sodium channels in the apical membrane colocalize with actin, spectrin (fodrin), and ankyrin (5Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E.-h.

Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies on epithelial A6 cells showed that disruption of actin microfilament networks by cytochalasin D induced sodium channel activity both in cell-attached and excised patches (1Cantiello H.F. Stow J.L. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C882-C888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar effects were observed in the presence of actin or actin-gelsolin complexes added to the cytoplasmic side of excised inside-out patches, whereas the actin-DNase I complexes did not activate sodium channels. These results were explained by a model suggesting that the channels are activated by short actin filaments produced either by severing of endogenous long filaments with cytochalasin or by assembly from monomeric actin during spontaneous or gelsolin-mediated polymerization (1Cantiello H.F. Stow J.L. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C882-C888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observations were made on planar lipid bilayers containing cloned epithelial sodium channels (4Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.-L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.-J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37845-37854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G. Cantiello H.F. Ausiello D.A. Fuller C.M. Jovov B. Benos D.J. Ismailov I.I. J.

In addition, interaction of actin with epithelial channels was reported to modulate considerably the intrinsic channel characteristics including conductance and selectivity. Along with epithelial amiloride-sensitive sodium channels, novel non-voltage-gated sodium-selective channels insensitive to amiloride (up to 100 μm) and to tetrodotoxin have been described in different non-excitable cells, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells (8Van Renterghem C. Lazdunski M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1991; 419: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), macrophages (9Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 138: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and carcinoma (10Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Mozhayeva G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and leukemia cells (11Parekh A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23161-23168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Maximov A.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Negulyaev Y.A Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Katina I.E. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1997; 16: 163-173PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, single current measurements in different patch configurations showed that conductance, selectivity, and gating properties of the novel family of sodium channels proved to be very similar to those of the epithelial channels (14Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Extremely low sensitivity to amiloride and its derivatives is the major difference between these channels and epithelial sodium channels. This novel family of sodium channels is also clearly distinct from well known voltage-gated channels typically expressed in excitable membranes (15Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanisms of non-voltage-gated sodium-selective channels partially mediating sodium influx in different non-excitable cells are largely unknown. We have previously found that cytochalasin D treatment of K562 leukemia cells strongly increased the open probability of sodium channels recorded in cell-attached experiments, indicating that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the control of non-voltage-gated sodium channels (12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Maximov A.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further experiments on leukemia cells showed that activity of sodium channels could be increased by the actin-severing protein gelsolin applied to the cytoplasmic surface of membrane fragments at the micromolar level of [Ca2+]i (16Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Hinssen H. Khaitlina S.Y. Negulyaev Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the experiments on intact cells, the elevation of [Ca2+]i using the ionophore 4Br-A23187 also resulted in channel activation. Subsequent addition of actin to the cytoplasmic membrane surface reduced sodium currents to the background level (16Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Hinssen H. Khaitlina S.Y. Negulyaev Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This implies that calcium-dependent modulations of the actin cytoskeleton are involved in the regulation of sodium channels. More specifically, these data allowed us to suggest that inhibition of sodium currents by actin may be due to assembly of microfilaments at the cytoplasmic surface of cell membranes, whereas disassembly of submembranous F-actin induces channel activation. The aim of the present work was to verify these suggestions and to elucidate intracellular mechanisms underlying activation and inactivation of the novel non-voltage-gated sodium channels. The data presented here support the putative role of assembly-disassembly of cortical actin microfilaments in the control of sodium channels in leukemia cells. We show that the efficiency of actin in abolishing the sodium channel activity correlates with the kinetics of actin polymerization and that non-polymerizable actin does not affect sodium currents. These data represent the first direct evidence for involvement of actin polymerization in the regulation of non-voltage-gated sodium channels. Human myeloid leukemia K562 cells (Cell Culture Collection, Institute of Cytology, St. Petersburg, Russia) were kept in culture as described elsewhere (12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Maximov A.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For patch clamp experiments cells were plated on coverslips and maintained in culture for 1–3 days before use. Single channel currents were recorded using the standard inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique (17Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). Pipettes were pulled from soft glass capillaries to a resistance of 10–15 megohms when filled with external solution. Membrane currents were recorded using a homemade head stage, based on Burr-Brown operational amplifier OPA-128 with a 20-gigohm feedback resistor and a computer-controlled set of Bessels LM-202 filters and LM-201S amplifiers (L-Card, Moscow) for signal conditioning. Data were filtered at 200 Hz and sampled at a rate of 1 kHz by 12-bit analog-digital converter for analysis and display. Experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). Channel open probability (Po) was determined using the following equation: Po = I/iN, whereI is the mean current determined from the amplitude histograms, i is the unitary current amplitude, andN is the number of functional channels in the patch. Averaged data are given as the mean ± S.E. Recording pipettes were filled with normal external solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/Tris-OH (pH 7.3). Bath cytosol-like solution for inside-out measurements contained 140 mm potassium aspartate (or glutamate), 5 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2 (if not otherwise stated), 20 mmHEPES/KOH (pH 7.3), 2 mm EGTA, and an appropriate amount (0.98 mm) of CaCl2 to establish a free ionized calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) at the level of 0.1 μm (pCa 7). In the series of experiments with exogenous gelsolin the bath solutions contained different [Ca2+]i varying from 0.01 to 1 μmadjusted with 2 mm EGTA or HEDTA. In some experiments chloride or sulfate were used as a major anion in the cytosol-like solution. HEPES, EGTA, HEDTA, and cytochalasin D were from Sigma. G-actin isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle (18Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was stored in a low ionic strength solution (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.02% NaN3) within a week. An aliquot of G-actin stock solution was added to the bath to the final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Inactivated actin was obtained from intact actin by heating for 5 min at 70 °C. Inactivation of the sample was checked using the parameterA =I320/I365 of the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum, where I320 andI365 are the fluorescence intensities at 320 and 365 nm, respectively (19Turoverov K.K. Khaitlina S.Y. Pinaev G.P. FEBS Lett. 1976; 62: 4-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The values of the parameter Awere 2.5 and 1.3 for intact and inactivated actin, respectively. Proteolytically cleaved actin was prepared from intact actin by incubation of G-actin (2–3 mg/ml) with Escherichia coli A2 protease ECP 32 (20) at an enzyme:protein mass ratio of 1:100 for 2 h at room temperature. Gelsolin was isolated from pig smooth muscle as described (21Hinssen H. Small J.V. Sobieszek A. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and stored as a pelleted ammonium sulfate precipitate at −70 °C. Actin polymerization was registered as an increase in intensity of light scattering at 350 nm, at 90 °. The measurements were performed in a Shimadzu PC 5000 fluorometer. Under the control conditions the activity of non-voltage-gated sodium channels was very low, which is in agreement with our previous data on K562 cells (12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Maximov A.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Negulyaev Y.A Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Katina I.E. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1997; 16: 163-173PubMed Google Scholar, 16Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Hinssen H. Khaitlina S.Y. Negulyaev Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the first series of experiments we studied the effect of cytochalasin D on single currents in the inside-out patches (Fig. 1). Addition of 10 μg/ml cytochalasin D to the bath cytosol-like solution resulted in an activation of sodium-conducting channels in the membrane fragment (Fig. 1 A); well resolved inward currents representing single channel openings were observed at negative membrane potential. Fig. 1 B represents typical current records measured within 3 min after cytochalasin D application at different levels of holding potential up to +10 mV. Such recordings were analyzed to obtain current-voltage relation data (Fig. 1 C). A similar activation of transmembrane ionic currents elicited by cytochalasin D was observed in 14 inside-out patches. As a rule, an evident increase of channel open probability was observed in 2–3 min after cytochalasin D was added to the bath cytosol-like solution; thereafter the channels remained active. They were not affected by the following wash-out of cytochalasin D with the control bath solution. The amplitude of cytochalasin D-induced channel events did not depend on the change of the major anion in the bath “intracellular” solution, confirming a cationic nature of the currents. The mean current-voltage relation (Fig. 1 C) approximated by linear regression corresponds to a single channel conductance value of 12 picosiemens and a reversal potential of 23 mV; the estimation of relative permeability gives the value PNa/PK of about 3. These parameters are very similar to those obtained previously for non-voltage-gated sodium-permeable channels in human leukemia K562 cells (12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Maximov A.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Negulyaev Y.A Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Katina I.E. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1997; 16: 163-173PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the current-voltage relation data (Fig. 1 C) allow us to reliably identify the channels activated by cytochalasin D treatment of the cytoplasmic surface of membrane fragments; activation of the sodium channels seems to be due to the cytochalasin D-induced disassembly of membrane-attached actin filaments. We have previously shown that gelsolin activates sodium channels in a calcium-dependent manner (16Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Hinssen H. Khaitlina S.Y. Negulyaev Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 presents a comparison of the effect produced in excised patches by cytochalasin D with that produced by exogenous gelsolin. Addition of gelsolin to the bath cytosol-like solution containing 1 μm [Ca2+]icaused a significant increase in sodium channel activity (Fig. 2 A) similar to the cytochalasin D action (Fig. 2 B). The values of the channel open probability after cytochalasin D or gelsolin were similar; Po varied in the range of 0.3–0.4. Thus the efficiencies of these agents toward the sodium channel activation were comparable. However, at variance to the effect of gelsolin, which was not observed at low concentrations of free calcium (0.01 μm [Ca2+]i), the cytochalasin-induced activation of sodium channels was calcium-independent. In our previous work we have shown in inside-out experiments that variations in [Ca2+]i in the bath solution did not affect the open probability of non-voltage-gated sodium channels in leukemia cells (16Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Hinssen H. Khaitlina S.Y. Negulyaev Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); i.e. these channels are not directly calcium-activated. Thus, the strong calcium dependence of the gelsolin effect suggests that the channel activation is due to a specific severing of actin filaments associated with the membrane fragment. In addition, upon application of gelsolin, the open probability Po reached maximum values without marked delay, whereas a 1–3-min lag upon addition of cytochalasin D was typically observed. These data imply that the exact mechanisms of cytochalasin and gelsolin actions may be different. However, both mechanisms seem to involve disassembly of the submembranous actin filament system required for non-voltage-gated sodium channels to be opened. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the sodium channel activity elicited in response to F-actin disassembly by cytochalasin D or gelsolin (at 1 μm [Ca2+]i) could be strongly affected by application of G-actin to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane fragment. Specifically, addition of G-actin to the bath solution reduced the channel activity (and correspondentPo values) to the background level. Fig. 2 C shows the kinetics of the inhibitory effect of actin on sodium channels in a typical experiment; the amplitudes of the single currents were not affected, whereas Posignificantly decreased. Development of the channel inactivation was observed during a nearly 3 min-period after injection of an aliquot of G-actin stock solution to the bath solution. The actin-associated inhibition of sodium channel activity might be due to polymerization of actin induced by the physiological concentration of salts in the bath solution. To test this possibility a special series of patch clamp experiments was carried out in which the known characteristics of actin polymerization in solutions were exploited and in which non-polymerizable actin species were used. It is known that actin containing Mg2+ as a tightly bound cation (Mg-actin) polymerizes faster than actin containing tightly bound Ca2+ (Ca-actin) (22Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. 1983; 116: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, only a small increase in light scattering intensity characteristic of filament formation was observed within 8–10 min after polymerization of 12 μm Ca-actin was initiated by addition of 0.1m KCl (Fig. 3). In contrast, Mg-actin was completely polymerized within 2 min (Fig. 3). To avoid actin polymerization, we took advantage of the limited proteolysis of the actin polypeptide chain between Gly-42 and Val-43 with E. coli protease ECP32 (24Khaitlina S. Collins J.H. Kusnetsova I. Pershina V. Synakevich I. Turoverov K. Usmanova A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 49-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cleaved actin cannot polymerize while in the calcium form; ECP32-cleaved Mg-actin polymerizes slowly, and the critical concentration of its polymerization is very high (25Khaitlina S. Moraczewska J. Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that no polymerization of 12 μm ECP32-cleaved Mg-actin was observed during at least 10 min after addition of 0.1 m KCl. In addition, heat-inactivated actin, which cannot polymerize under any conditions (19Turoverov K.K. Khaitlina S.Y. Pinaev G.P. FEBS Lett. 1976; 62: 4-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), was used in the following patch clamp experiments. The results of inside-out experiments with application of different ionic conditions and different actin species are summarized in Fig. 4. The sodium channel activity was induced by cytochalasin D as described above, and then the effect of subsequent G-actin addition was monitored. Stock solutions of G-Ca-actins (see “Experimental Procedures”) were injected into the cytosol-like solution so that the final concentration of actin near the cytoplasmic membrane side was equal to 0.3 mg/ml (7.2 μm), being the same in all experiments. The concentration of free Ca2+ in the bath cytosol-like solutions was established at the level of 0.1 μm. Under these conditions, actin either remains in the calcium form or is inactivated due to loss of divalent cation. We found that addition of intact G-actin to the bath solution in the absence of Mg2+ did not affect sodium channel activity;i.e. no inhibition of the cytochalasin D-induced currents was observed during the 6–10-min recordings. The high level of channel activity was also not affected either by inactivated actin or by actin cleaved with protease ECP32. In contrast, sodium currents were rapidly abolished by intact actin when 1 mmMgCl2 was present in the bath solution, promoting a rapid replacement of tightly bound Ca2+ by Mg2+ and hence the transformation of Ca-actin to Mg-actin (22Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. 1983; 116: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Comparison of these results with the kinetics of actin polymerization (Fig. 3) indicates that the “closing” effect of actin correlates with the efficiency of filament formation. However, if actin had been incubated during a 10–30-min period in magnesium-containing cytosol-like solution before being added to the inside-out patch, this polymerized actin did not produce any effect on the channel activity (data not shown). This suggests that actin polymerization at the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane may be a factor regulating the activity of the non-voltage-gated sodium channels in leukemia K562 cells. The data presented here show that cytochalasin D and gelsolin, known to disassemble the actin filament network, induce activation of non-voltage-gated sodium channels in leukemia cells. On the other hand, addition of actin resulted in inactivation of the channels, and this effect strongly correlated with actin polymerization. The results of inside-out measurements of sodium channels activated by cytochalasin D are in full agreement with the previous data obtained in cell-attached experiments on leukemia K562 cells (12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Maximov A.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Earlier, electron microscopy studies of patch-clamped membranes demonstrated that the patch is not a bare bilayer but a membrane-covered bleb of cytoplasm that may include organelles and cytoskeleton (26Ruknudin A. Song M.J. Sachs F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The images of excised patches obtained using atomic force microscopy also indicated the presence of cytoskeleton structures forming a strong connection with the membrane (27Hörber J.K.H. Mosbacher J. Häberle W. Ruppesberg J.P. Sakmann B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1687-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together with these morphological data, the similarity of the effects of the F-actin disrupters on the excised membrane fragments with those on native cells implies that after patch excision the part of cortical microfilaments that plays a crucial role in channel regulation does remain attached to the cytoplasmic membrane surface. The disrupting effect of gelsolin on the cortical cytoskeleton remaining in the excised membrane fragment is in line with the results of gelsolin-produced disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton in permeabilized and microinjected cultured cells (28Huckriede A. Hinssen H. Jockusch B.M. Lazarides E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 506-512PubMed Google Scholar, 29Huckriede A. Fuchtbauer A. Hinssen H. Chaponnier C. Weeds A. Jockusch B.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 16: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This effect may be accounted for by changes that gelsolin generates in the cortical actin network by shortening actin filaments. On the other hand, being in excess, gelsolin can extract most of the actin from the peripheral cytoskeleton by formation of soluble actin-gelsolin 2:1 complexes. Whereas under our experimental conditions, the latter mechanism is likely to take place, both mechanisms may be involved in calcium-dependent rearrangements of the F-actin network and, hence, in regulation of channel activity in living cells.

Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence showed an interaction between the amiloride-sensitive sodium channels and the F-actin network in renal polarized readsorbing epithelia (1Cantiello H.F. Stow J.L. Prat A.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17704-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is reasonable, therefore, to compare the effects of actin rearrangement on non-voltage-gated sodium channels in leukemia cells with those on epithelial sodium channels. In agreement with the fast effects of cytochalasin D on the sodium channels in epithelial cells (1Cantiello H.F. Stow J.L. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C882-C888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Prat A.G. Bertorello A.M. Ausiello D.A. Cantiello H.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C224-C233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sodium channels in leukemia cells were also activated by F-actin disrupters. However, in contrast to the epithelial channels, sodium channels in leukemia cells were not inactivated during a prolonged incubation with cytochalasin D (12Negulyaev Y.A. Vedernikova E.A. Maximov A.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, in variance with epithelial sodium channels, in our experiments, polymerizing actin decreased rather than increased an open probability of the sodium channels in leukemia cells. Therefore, our data do not lead us to assume any special role of short filaments in channel activation. These variances may be due to the difference between epithelial amiloride-sensitive sodium channels (4Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.-L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.-J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

We also did not observe any actin cytoskeleton-dependent modulation of the sodium channel selectivity or conductance reported earlier for interaction of actin with epithelial sodium channels (4Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.-L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.-J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37845-37854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Berdiev B.K.

In most experiments, the background activity in the control patches was very low (or close to zero), making difficult a determination of single channel parameters before the channel activation was evoked. Nevertheless, the amplitude of single currents could be reliably monitored during the time course of the actin-induced channel inactivation (Fig. 2 C); it remained unchanged in the course of actin assembly. Inactivation of the amiloride-insensitive sodium channels with polymerizing actin could be due to actin assembly at the cytoplasmic membrane surface. Alternatively, the inactivation could result from interaction of the channels with filaments preformed in the cytosol-like solution. It is known that such an actin solution is a heterogeneous population of filaments of different lengths including a high proportion of short filaments (30Littlefield R. Fowler V.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In our experiments, addition of F-actin did not inactivate the channels. Therefore, we assume that the mechanism of sodium channel inactivation involves assembly of actin filaments at the membrane surface rather than interaction of the channel with long or short actin filaments. Thus, our data provide the novel mechanism for regulation of sodium channel activity via actin filament assembly-disassembly. Previously we have found that in intact cells elevation of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration by ionophore 4Br-A23187 also resulted in activation of the sodium channels and that actin reduced this activity to the background level (16Maximov A.V. Vedernikova E.A. Hinssen H. Khaitlina S.Y. Negulyaev Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is plausible, therefore, that a cellular mechanism of sodium channel regulation involves calcium-dependent rearrangements of the cortical cytoskeleton mediated by gelsolin at the disassembly (channel opening) step and can be promoted by actin-nucleating proteins at the assembly (channel closing) step."
https://openalex.org/W2126924371,"The regulation of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae DPP1</i>-encoded diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) phosphatase by inositol supplementation and growth phase was examined. Addition of inositol to the growth medium resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the level of DGPP phosphatase activity in both exponential and stationary phase cells. Activity was greater in stationary phase cells when compared with exponential phase cells, and the inositol- and growth phase-dependent regulations of DGPP phosphatase were additive. Analyses of DGPP phosphatase mRNA and protein levels, and expression of β-galactosidase activity driven by a P<sub>DPP1</sub>-<i>lacZ</i>reporter gene, indicated that a transcriptional mechanism was responsible for this regulation. Regulation of DGPP phosphatase by inositol and growth phase occurred in a manner that was opposite that of many phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes. Regulation of DGPP phosphatase expression by inositol supplementation, but not growth phase, was altered in <i>opi1</i>Δ, <i>ino2</i>Δ, and<i>ino4</i>Δ phospholipid synthesis regulatory mutants. CDP-diacylglycerol, a phospholipid pathway intermediate used for the synthesis of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, inhibited DGPP phosphatase activity by a mixed mechanism that caused an increase in <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and a decrease in<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>. DGPP stimulated the activity of pure phosphatidylserine synthase by a mechanism that increased the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate CDP-diacylglycerol. Phospholipid composition analysis of a <i>dpp1</i>Δ mutant showed that DGPP phosphatase played a role in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism by inositol, as well as regulating the cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol."

The protein also exists as a dimer in the crystal, as well as in solution, at least at concentrations in the region of 500 μg/ml. Recently it has been argued that proaerolysin becomes monomeric at concentrations below 100 μg/ml and that only the monomeric form of the protoxin can bind to cell surface receptors (Fivaz, M., Velluz, M.-C., and van der Goot, F.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] The channel-forming toxin aerolysin is secreted as an inactive precursor called proaerolysin by bacteria in the Aeromonasfamily. Proaerolysin binds to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptors on sensitive cells and is converted to aerolysin by proteases such as furin. Aerolysin then oligomerizes, and the heptamers that are formed insert into the bilayer, producing channels (1Buckley J.T. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, New York1999: 362-372Google Scholar). Proaerolysin exists as a dimer in the crystal, and the structure of the dimer has been solved (2Parker M.W. Buckley J.T Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In previous studies we have shown that proaerolysin is secreted as a dimer by Aeromonas salmonicida (3Hardie K.R. Schulze A. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 14: 1011-1093Google Scholar), and we have also found, using analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking, that it is a dimer in solution (4van der Goot F.G. Ausió J. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18272-18279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at least at concentrations in the range of 500 μg/ml (10 μm). The dimeric form of the protein may have several advantages over the monomer. First of all, it appears that only the dimer is recognized by the Aeromonas secretion machinery, which is responsible for transit of proaerolysin across the outer membrane of the bacteria. Thus dimerization in the periplasm is necessary for secretion by the bacteria (3Hardie K.R. Schulze A. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 14: 1011-1093Google Scholar). Second, a large area of the surface of the protein is protected in the dimer, and this could contribute to the unusual protease stability of aerolysin (2Parker M.W. Buckley J.T Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 5Garland W.J. Buckley J.T. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, two regions of the molecule appear to be involved in receptor binding, one at the top of the large lobe and another in the small lobe (6Mackenzie C.R. Hirama T. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the dimer the large lobe of one monomer is much closer to the small lobe of the other monomer than it is to its own small lobe (2Parker M.W. Buckley J.T Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Finally, dimerization may help control the oligomerization step in channel formation. The monomers presumably must separate for oligomerization to occur because the oligomer is heptameric (7Wilmsen H.U. Pattus F. Tichelar W. Buckley J.T. Leonard K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Moniatte M. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Pattus F. van Dorsselaer A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The stability of the dimer may reduce the risk that the protein will oligomerize in the absence of a target membrane. Recently, it has been argued that proaerolysin is a monomer in solution at concentrations below 100 μg/ml (∼2 μm) and that it is the monomer that binds to cell surface receptors (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These conclusions were based on the results of binding and cross-linking studies with radioiodinated proaerolysin, on concentration-dependent changes in the elution profile of proaerolysin using gel permeation chromatography with an agarose matrix, and on the apparent inability of a variant of proaerolysin (M41C) that is a covalent dimer to bind to surface proteins. In this paper we present contradictory evidence and alternative explanations of the data of the earlier study. We show that proaerolysin remains dimeric in solution at the lowest concentrations that we measured (less than 5 μg/ml) and that covalent proaerolysin dimers can indeed bind to cell surfaces. Trypsin and trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Sigma. Native proaerolysin and the proaerolysin variants were purified according to our published procedure (10Buckley J.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All of the samples migrated with an apparent mass of 52 kDa on reducing SDS-PAGE1 (data not shown). The production of M41C proaerolysin and the properties of this variant have been described previously (3Hardie K.R. Schulze A. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 14: 1011-1093Google Scholar). Two other covalent variants were made in the same way. Briefly, the structure of the native proaerolysin dimer was examined to locate single residues that lie within a few Angstroms of each other in the dimer (as Met-41 does). Two residues, Ser-13 and Lys-185, were identified, and two proaerolysin variants, S13C and K185C, were created by site-directed mutagenesis and purified. Some of the purified S13C migrated in nonreducing SDS-PAGE with the same apparent mass as M41C (∼100 kDa), indicating that an intermolecular bridge had formed between the cysteines at position 13 in the two monomers (see Fig. 1 A). The rest of the protein migrated as a monomer (non-covalent dimers are dissociated by the SDS in SDS-PAGE), indicating that intermolecular bridge formation was not complete. Consistent with this result, the S13C variant retained appreciable channel-forming activity, although it was rendered more active by reduction with dithiothreitol (data not shown). The K185C variant migrated entirely as a single band, more slowly than the S13C and M41C dimers (see Fig. 1 A), presumably because the new intermolecular bridge prevented complete unfolding in SDS. It migrated with the same apparent mass as native proaerolysin under reducing conditions (data not shown). Like the M41C variant, K185C was virtually inactive unless reduced. Samples of proaerolysin in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 were treated with 0.25 mm dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] (DSP, Pierce) at room temperature. After 30 min, 1 m Tris, pH 8, was added to a final concentration of 90 mm, and the incubation was continued for 5 min before adding sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Human erythrocytes from outdated blood were washed with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4. The cells were resuspended to 4% (v/v) in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight, 8000), 17.5 mm HEPES, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, containing either 5 × 10−9m native proaerolysin or one of the proaerolysin variants. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the cells were pelleted and lysed by suspending them in ice-cold 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The membranes were pelleted and washed in the phosphate buffer. They were then dissolved in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted to detect proaerolysin that had bound. Proaerolysin was dialyzed extensively against 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 and loaded into aluminum Kel-F 12-mm double sector cells. Sedimentation velocity runs were carried out in a Beckman Analytical XL-A ultracentrifuge using an An-55 Al (aluminum) rotor. Sedimentation equilibrium runs employed an An-60 Ti (titanium) rotor. Temperature and speed conditions are indicated in the figure legends. A partial specific volume of 0.745 cm3/g was used for the calculations (4van der Goot F.G. Ausió J. Wong K.R. Pattus F.

Sedimentation velocity scans were analyzed using XL-A Ultra Scan version 4.1 sedimentation data analysis software (Borries Demeler, Missoula, MT), which employs a published method of boundary analysis (11van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1401Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium scans were analyzed using a nonlinear, least squares, curve-fitting algorithm (12Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys.

SDS-PAGE was carried out under reducing or nonreducing conditions (13Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed in 10% gels in the absence of reducing agents (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). When necessary, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose and detected using a mouse anti-proaerolysin monoclonal antibody and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (15Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fivaz et al. (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that the M41C variant of proaerolysin was apparently unable to bind to proteins from baby hamster kidney cells and drew the conclusion that the proaerolysin dimer must dissociate for binding to occur. We compared the binding of native proaerolysin to human erythrocytes with the binding of the three covalent variants, including M41C. A blot of the membrane-associated proteins separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig.1 B. For comparison, a Coomassie-stained nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel of the proteins used is shown in Fig. 1 A. Dimers of both S13C and K185C were readily detected in amounts comparable with the amount of bound native monomer, indicating that both covalent dimers could bind to the erythrocyte membranes. Much less M41C was detected, suggesting that this variant binds more poorly than wild type and the S13C and K185C dimers, a result that is consistent with the previous finding (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previously we have found that treating native proaerolysin with dimethylsuberimidate produces cross-linked dimers; however, we did not try protein concentrations lower than ∼500 μg/ml or 10 μm (4van der Goot F.G. Ausió J. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18272-18279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fivaz et al. (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) used glutaraldehyde and proaerolysin concentrations as low as 50 μg/ml to study dimer cross-linking. They concluded that cross-linking was concentration-dependent and that this was an indication that the dimer was dissociating as the protein concentration was lowered (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They drew this conclusion despite the fact that their results appear to show that proportionally as much cross-linked dimer was formed at 50 μg/ml proaerolysin as at 100 μg/ml. In preliminary experiments we found that DSP cross-links proaerolysin much more efficiently than either dimethylsuberimidate or glutaraldehyde, and we used this reagent to look for evidence of the presence of dimers at proaerolysin concentrations as low as 4 μg/ml. The results in Fig.2 show that even at the lowest concentration, nearly all of the protoxin migrated with an apparent mass of ∼100 kDa after treatment with DSP, indicating that little or none of it was dissociated into monomers and contradicting the conclusion of the glutaraldehyde study (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our ability to cross-link proaerolysin dimers at low protoxin concentrations led us to believe that the protein might be stable enough to remain dimeric during non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. The results in Fig.3 A show that this is the case. Native proaerolysin migrated with the same mobility as M41C and K185C, both of which are covalent dimers under these conditions. Diluting the protein to concentrations as low as 0.1 μg/ml had no effect on its mobility (Fig. 3 B) The sedimentation velocity analysis of proaerolysin at 16 and 80 μg/ml is illustrated in Fig.4. It is clear that the protein was very homogeneous at both concentrations, as indicated by the convergence of the lines in the “fan plots” (11van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1401Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient was 5.2 ± 0.1 S at both protein concentrations, in agreement with the previous result obtained with 500 μg/ml proaerolysin (4van der Goot F.G. Ausió J. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18272-18279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus there is no significant change in the sedimentation coefficient or the homogeneity of proaerolysin, and hence no evidence for dimer dissociation, in the concentration range between 16 and 500 μg/ml. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis confirmed that proaerolysin is entirely dimeric at 16 μg/ml. At this concentration the data could be fitted to a single ideal component model of molecular mass 94.9 kDa (Fig. 5 A), very similar to the mass of 95.6 kDa we have obtained previously at higher protein concentrations (4van der Goot F.G. Ausió J. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18272-18279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the higher concentration of 91 μg/ml, the best fitting line for a monodisperse sample gave a molecular mass of 95.2 kDa (Fig. 5 B); however the fit to a single ideal component model was not as good as it was at the lower concentration. This is indicated by the nonrandom trend exhibited by the residuals. The systematic pattern observed at the higher concentration is indicative of the presence of some aggregation (16McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA1993Google Scholar). The results of the present study of the state of proaerolysin in solution lead to different conclusions than those reached by Fivaz et al. (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the protoxin is a dimer, even at very low concentrations, and that dimer dissociation is not required for binding to surface receptors. We believe that several factors may account for differences between our results and conclusions and those of Fivaz et al. (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These authors observed that the M41C variant did not bind to surface proteins and they interpreted this to mean that dimer separation is necessary for binding. A more likely explanation is that the M41C substitution reduces the ability of the protein to interact with the receptor. The mutation is in the carbohydrate binding fold or aerolysin pertussis toxin domain of proaerolysin, which we have identified previously (17Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Hazes B. Murzin A.G. Read R.J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have shown that changing other amino acids in this region can have pronounced effects on receptor binding (6Mackenzie C.R. Hirama T. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fivaz et al. (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) also found that they were unable to cross-link proaerolysin dimers with 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl propionate] after exposing baby hamster kidney cells to native proaerolysin that had been radioiodinated using IODO-GEN. They concluded that this was because dimers had dissociated and that only monomers were bound to surface receptors (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, even in control experiments using protoxin concentrations at which they readily observed dimer with glutaraldehyde, very little cross-linked dimer was produced with 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate]. This may indicate that this reagent is a poor cross-linking agent for proaerolysin. The use of radioiodinated proaerolysin may also have affected the outcome of their attempt to cross-link dimers to surface proteins. We have found that the use of IODO-GEN results in a product that is less active than normal proaerolysin, 2R. Barry, S. Moore, A. Alonso, J. Ausió, and J. T. Buckley, unpublished observation. perhaps because one or more tyrosines important for binding are affected. Two candidates are Tyr-61 and Tyr-162, because variants in which these residues are replaced bind more poorly to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins than does native proaerolysin (6Mackenzie C.R. Hirama T. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fivaz et al. (9Fivaz M. Velluz M.C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) noted an increase in the elution volume from a Sephadex gel filtration column with decreasing concentration of the proaerolysin applied and concluded that this was evidence that the dimer dissociated at low concentrations. We have found that proaerolysin will bind to agarose-based matrices such as Sephadex under a variety of conditions and that this can lead to increased retention with decreased concentration (data not shown here). It is possible that this kind of interaction may account for their observations. The dimeric state of proaerolysin in solution, which we confirm here, is consistent with several things we know about the protein, including its secretion, its stability to proteases, and the extensive interaction between monomers in the crystal (2Parker M.W. Buckley J.T Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some time after activation by proteolytic nicking, the monomers must separate, not only because there are an odd number of monomers in the oligomer, but because all of the monomers are thought to be in the same orientation in the oligomer, whereas they are in opposite orientations in the dimer (2Parker M.W. Buckley J.T Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). How and when dimer separation occurs remains to be established."
