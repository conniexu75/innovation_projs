https://openalex.org/W2011041653,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial surface receptor that triggers intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Recent genome-wide association studies have shown that a rare R47H mutation of TREM2 correlates with a substantial increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the basis for this genetic association, we studied TREM2 deficiency in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. We found that TREM2 deficiency and haploinsufficiency augment β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation due to a dysfunctional response of microglia, which fail to cluster around Aβ plaques and become apoptotic. We further demonstrate that TREM2 senses a broad array of anionic and zwitterionic lipids known to associate with fibrillar Aβ in lipid membranes and to be exposed on the surface of damaged neurons. Remarkably, the R47H mutation impairs TREM2 detection of lipid ligands. Thus, TREM2 detects damage-associated lipid patterns associated with neurodegeneration, sustaining the microglial response to Aβ accumulation."

Human selection of japonica rice has extended its growth zone to regions with lower temperature, while the molecular basis of this adaptation remains unknown. Here, we identify the quantitative trait locus COLD1 that confers chilling tolerance in japonica rice. Overexpression of COLD1jap significantly enhances chilling tolerance, whereas rice lines with deficiency or downregulation of COLD1jap are sensitive to cold. COLD1 encodes a regulator of G-protein signaling that localizes on plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with the G-protein α subunit to activate the Ca2+ channel for sensing low temperature and to accelerate G-protein GTPase activity. We further identify that a SNP in COLD1, SNP2, originated from Chinese Oryza rufipogon, is responsible for the ability of COLDjap/ind to confer chilling tolerance, supporting the importance of COLD1 in plant adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2100671540,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, but its molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) is a negative regulator of ferroptotic cancer cell death. Erastin, a specific ferroptosis-inducing compound, stimulates heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-dependent HSPB1 expression in cancer cells. Knockdown of HSF1 and HSPB1 enhances erastin-induced ferroptosis, whereas heat shock pretreatment and overexpression of HSPB1 inhibits erastin-induced ferroptosis. Protein kinase C-mediated HSPB1 phosphorylation confers protection against ferroptosis by reducing iron-mediated production of lipid reactive oxygen species. Moreover, inhibition of the HSF1-HSPB1 pathway and HSPB1 phosphorylation increases the anticancer activity of erastin in human xenograft mouse tumor models. Our findings reveal an essential role for HSPB1 in iron metabolism with important effects on ferroptosis-mediated cancer therapy."

We report that TINCR is strongly upregulated in human gastric carcinoma (GC), where it was found to contribute to oncogenesis and cancer progression. We also revealed that TINCR overexpression is induced by nuclear transcription factor SP1. Silencing TINCR expression inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, tumorigenicity and apoptosis promotion, whereas TINCR overexpression promoted cell growth, as documented in the SGC7901 and BGC823 cell lines. Mechanistic analyses indicated that TINCR could bind to STAU1 (staufen1) protein, and influence KLF2 mRNA stability and expression, then KLF2 regulated cyclin-dependent kinase genes CDKN1A/P21 and CDKN2B/P15 transcription and expression, thereby affecting the proliferation and apoptosis of GC cells. Together, our findings suggest that TINCR contributes to the oncogenic potential of GC and may constitute a potential therapeutic target in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2074387676,"A cornerstone of successful social interchange is the ability to anticipate each other's intentions or actions. While generating these internal predictions is essential for constructive social behavior, their single neuronal basis and causal underpinnings are unknown. Here, we discover specific neurons in the primate dorsal anterior cingulate that selectively predict an opponent's yet unknown decision to invest in their common good or defect and distinct neurons that encode the monkey's own current decision based on prior outcomes. Mixed population predictions of the other was remarkably near optimal compared to behavioral decoders. Moreover, disrupting cingulate activity selectively biased mutually beneficial interactions between the monkeys but, surprisingly, had no influence on their decisions when no net-positive outcome was possible. These findings identify a group of other-predictive neurons in the primate anterior cingulate essential for enacting cooperative interactions and may pave a way toward the targeted treatment of social behavioral disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2016123658,"Defining mechanisms that generate intratumour heterogeneity and branched evolution may inspire novel therapeutic approaches to limit tumour diversity and adaptation. SETD2 (Su(var), Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax-domain containing 2) trimethylates histone-3 lysine-36 (H3K36me3) at sites of active transcription and is mutated in diverse tumour types, including clear cell renal carcinomas (ccRCCs). Distinct SETD2 mutations have been identified in spatially separated regions in ccRCC, indicative of intratumour heterogeneity. In this study, we have addressed the consequences of SETD2 loss-of-function through an integrated bioinformatics and functional genomics approach. We find that bi-allelic SETD2 aberrations are not associated with microsatellite instability in ccRCC. SETD2 depletion in ccRCC cells revealed aberrant and reduced nucleosome compaction and chromatin association of the key replication proteins minichromosome maintenance complex component (MCM7) and DNA polymerase δ hindering replication fork progression, and failure to load lens epithelium-derived growth factor and the Rad51 homologous recombination repair factor at DNA breaks. Consistent with these data, we observe chromosomal breakpoint locations are biased away from H3K36me3 sites in SETD2 wild-type ccRCCs relative to tumours with bi-allelic SETD2 aberrations and that H3K36me3-negative ccRCCs display elevated DNA damage in vivo. These data suggest a role for SETD2 in maintaining genome integrity through nucleosome stabilization, suppression of replication stress and the coordination of DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2171835285,"Most cell-surface receptors for cytokines and growth factors signal as dimers, but it is unclear whether remodeling receptor dimer topology is a viable strategy to ""tune"" signaling output. We utilized diabodies (DA) as surrogate ligands in a prototypical dimeric receptor-ligand system, the cytokine Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EpoR), to dimerize EpoR ectodomains in non-native architectures. Diabody-induced signaling amplitudes varied from full to minimal agonism, and structures of these DA/EpoR complexes differed in EpoR dimer orientation and proximity. Diabodies also elicited biased or differential activation of signaling pathways and gene expression profiles compared to EPO. Non-signaling diabodies inhibited proliferation of erythroid precursors from patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm due to a constitutively active JAK2V617F mutation. Thus, intracellular oncogenic mutations causing ligand-independent receptor activation can be counteracted by extracellular ligands that re-orient receptors into inactive dimer topologies. This approach has broad applications for tuning signaling output for many dimeric receptor systems."
https://openalex.org/W2051270078,"A fundamental challenge in studying the frontal lobe is to parcellate this cortex into “natural” functional modules despite the absence of topographic maps, which are so helpful in primary sensory areas. Here we show that unsupervised clustering algorithms, applied to 96-channel array recordings from prearcuate gyrus, reveal spatially segregated subnetworks that remain stable across behavioral contexts. Looking for natural groupings of neurons based on response similarities, we discovered that the recorded area includes at least two spatially segregated subnetworks that differentially represent behavioral choice and reaction time. Importantly, these subnetworks are detectable during different behavioral states and, surprisingly, are defined better by “common noise” than task-evoked responses. Our parcellation process works well on “spontaneous” neural activity, and thus bears strong resemblance to the identification of “resting-state” networks in fMRI data sets. Our results demonstrate a powerful new tool for identifying cortical subnetworks by objective classification of simultaneously recorded electrophysiological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2132690090,"An axon is thought to faithfully conduct action potentials to its terminals. However, many features of the axon and axon terminals, especially at inhibitory synapses, remain unknown. By directly recording from the axon and terminal of a cultured cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC), we demonstrate that low membrane excitability of axon terminals shapes synaptic output. Simultaneous measurements of presynaptic capacitance and evoked IPSCs revealed PC axon terminals contained large readily releasable synaptic vesicles that exhibited a low release probability. Nevertheless, IPSCs evoked by stimulating a PC soma underwent frequency-dependent depression. Direct axonal recordings showed that high-frequency action potentials were faithfully conducted over axonal bifurcations but were attenuated around terminals. Sparse Na+ channels relative to enriched voltage-gated K+ channels in terminals caused short-term depression of IPSCs by reducing Ca2+ influx. Together with confirmation in slice recordings, our findings reveal a presynaptic mechanism that shapes short-term synaptic depression without depleting releasable vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1997547925,"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) development in Sjögren's syndrome (SS) remains a potentially lethal complication and efforts should focus on the identification of predictors that could aid in appropriate therapeutic decisions.In order to identify potential prognostic factors for outcome in SS-associated NHL, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 77 patients, diagnosed with NHL according to WHO classification criteria and meeting the American-European Consensus Classification (AECC) criteria for SS and examined the effect of SS-activity (defined as the EULAR SS disease activity index-ESSDAI) in the prognosis of SS-related NHLs, as defined in terms of overall and event-free survivals (OS and EFS). An event was defined as lymphoma relapse, treatment failure, disease progression, histological transformation or death. The effect of NHL clinical and laboratory characteristics was also investigated.MALT lymphomas constituted the majority (66.2%) of lymphomas. During the follow-up (median = 57.93 months), the 5-year OS was 90.91% (95% CI: 82.14-95.80%) and the EFS was 77.92% (95% CI: 67.37-85.82%). Patients with high ESSDAI score at lymphoma diagnosis had a greater risk for death (OR = 5.241, 95% CI: 1.034-26.568) or for event (OR = 4.317, 95% CI: 1.146-9.699, p = 0.008). These patients had also significantly worse EFS (HR = 4.541, 95% CI: 1.772-11.637) and OS (HR = 5.946, 95% CI: 1.259-28.077). In addition, post-chemotherapy ESSDAI improvement was significantly lower in patients who had experienced an event (p = 0.005). An unfavorable International prognostic index (IPI) score (high-intermediate/high) was associated with high risk of death and event (OR = 13.867, 95% CI: 2.656-72.387 and OR = 12.589, 95% CI: 3.911-40.526, respectively), worse EFS (log-rank p<0.001, HR = 8.718, 95% CI: 3.477-21.858), as well as with worse OS (log-rank p<0.001, HR = 11.414, 95% CI: 2.414-53.974). After adjustment for identified risk factors, IPI score retained a significant prognostic role following by a strong effect of ESSDAI in survival outcomes.At the point of NHL diagnosis, IPI and ESSDAI might be proved useful predictive tools in SS-associated lymphoma prognosis, directing to a more patient-tailored approach."

https://openalex.org/W1971641754,"Nine genes (LHCBM1-9) encode the major light-harvesting system of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have shown that those genes are all expressed albeit in different amounts and some of them only in certain conditions. However, little is known about the properties and specific functions of the individual gene products because they have never been isolated. Here we have purified several complexes from native membranes and/or we have reconstituted them in vitro with pigments extracted from C. reinhardtii. It is shown that LHCBM1 and -M2/7 represent more than half of the LHCBM population in the membrane. LHCBM2/7 forms homotrimers while LHCBM1 seems to be present in heterotrimers. Trimers containing only type I LHCBM (M3/4/6/8/9) were also observed. Despite their different roles, all complexes have very similar properties in terms of pigment content, organization, stability, absorption, fluorescence and excited-state lifetimes. Thus the involvement of LHCBM1 in non-photochemical quenching is suggested to be due to specific interactions with other components of the membrane and not to the inherent quenching properties of the complex. Similarly, the overexpression of LHCBM9 during sulfur deprivation can be explained by its low sulfur content as compared with the other LHCBMs. Considering the highly conserved biochemical and spectroscopic properties, the major difference between the complexes may be in their capacity to interact with other components of the thylakoid membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2036968549,"Stroke remains a significant problem despite decades of work on neuroprotective strategies. NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists are neuroprotective in preclinical models, but have been clinically unsuccessful, in part due to side effects. Here we describe a prototypical GluN2B-selective antagonist with an IC50 value that is 10-fold more potent at acidic pH 6.9 associated with ischemic tissue compared to pH 7.6, a value close to the pH in healthy brain tissue. This should maximize neuroprotection in ischemic tissue while minimizing on-target side effects associated with NMDAR blockade in noninjured brain regions. We have determined the mechanism underlying pH-dependent inhibition and demonstrate the utility of this approach in vivo. We also identify dicarboxylate dimers as a novel proton sensor in proteins. These results provide insight into the molecular basis of pH-dependent neuroprotective NMDAR block, which could be beneficial in a wide range of neurological insults associated with tissue acidification."
https://openalex.org/W2037536053,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is considered as a tumor suppressor protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previously, we have shown that SOCS1-deficient hepatocytes displayed increased responsiveness to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) due to enhanced signaling via the MET receptor tyrosine kinase. As aberrant MET activation occurs in many tumors including HCC, here we elucidated the mechanisms of SOCS1-mediated regulation. SOCS1 attenuated HGF-induced proliferation of human and mouse HCC cell lines and their growth as tumors in NOD.scid.gamma mice. Tumors formed by SOCS1 expressing HCC cells showed significantly reduced MET expression, indicating that SOCS1 not only attenuates MET signaling but also regulates MET expression. Mechanistically, SOCS1 interacted with MET via the Src homology 2 domain and this interaction was promoted by MET tyrosine kinase activity. The SOCS1-mediated reduction in MET expression does not require the juxtamembrane Y1003 residue implicated in Cbl-mediated downmodulation. Moreover, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, but not the inhibitors of lysosomal degradation bafilomycin and chloroquine, reversed the SOCS1-mediated reduction in MET expression, indicating that this process is distinct from Cbl-mediated downmodulation. Accordingly, SOCS1 promoted polyubiquitination of MET via K48-dependent but not K63-mediated ubiquitin chain elongation. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated downmodulation of Cbl did not abolish SOCS1-mediated reduction in MET expression in HCC cells. SOCS1-dependent ubiquitination of endogenous MET receptor occurred rapidly following HGF stimulation in HCC cells, leading to proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated MET receptor. These findings indicate that SOCS1 mediates its tumor suppressor functions, at least partly, by binding to MET and interfering with downstream signaling pathways as well as by promoting the turnover of the activated MET receptor. We propose that loss of this control mechanism due to epigenetic repression of SOCS1 could contribute to oncogenic MET signaling in HCC and other cancers, and that MET inhibitors might be useful in treating these patients."

Little is known, however, about how sulfate is sensed by cells. Sul1 and Sul2 are sulfate transporters in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strongly induced upon sulfur starvation and endocytosed upon the addition of sulfate. We reveal Sul1,2-dependent activation of PKA targets upon sulfate-induced exit from growth arrest after sulfur starvation. We provide two major arguments in favor of Sul1 and Sul2 acting as transceptors for signaling to PKA. First, the sulfate analogue, d-glucosamine 2-sulfate, acted as a non-transported agonist of signaling by Sul1 and Sul2. Second, mutagenesis to Gln of putative H+-binding residues, Glu-427 in Sul1 or Glu-443 in Sul2, abolished transport without affecting signaling. Hence, Sul1,2 can function as pure sulfate sensors. Sul1E427Q and Sul2E443Q are also deficient in sulfate-induced endocytosis, which can therefore be uncoupled from signaling. Overall, our data suggest that transceptors can undergo independent conformational changes, each responsible for triggering different downstream processes. The Sul1 and Sul2 transceptors are the first identified plasma membrane sensors for extracellular sulfate. High affinity transporters induced upon starvation for their substrate may generally act as transceptors during exit from starvation.

https://openalex.org/W2037270293,"Even when provided with feedback after every movement, adaptation levels off before biases are completely removed. Incomplete adaptation has recently been attributed to forgetting: the adaptation is already partially forgotten by the time the next movement is made. Here we test whether this idea is correct. If so, the final level of adaptation is determined by a balance between learning and forgetting. Because we learn from perceived errors, scaling these errors by a magnification factor has the same effect as subjects increasing the amount by which they learn from each error. In contrast, there is no reason to expect scaling the errors to affect forgetting. The magnification factor should therefore influence the balance between learning and forgetting, and thereby the final level of adaptation. We found that adaptation was indeed more complete for larger magnification factors. This supports the idea that incomplete adaptation is caused by part of what has been learnt quickly being forgotten."
https://openalex.org/W2028978429,"Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSDs) play a central role in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine in numerous species of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. PSDs are unusual decarboxylase containing a pyruvoyl prosthetic group within the active site. The covalently attached pyruvoyl moiety is formed in a concerted reaction when the PSD proenzyme undergoes an endoproteolytic cleavage into a large β-subunit, and a smaller α-subunit, which harbors the prosthetic group at its N terminus. The mechanism of PSD proenzyme cleavage has long been unclear. Using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system with the soluble Plasmodium knowlesi enzyme (PkPSD), we demonstrate that the post-translational processing is inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Comparison of PSD sequences across multiple phyla reveals a uniquely conserved aspartic acid within an FFXRX6RX12PXD motif, two uniquely conserved histidine residues within a PXXYHXXHXP motif, and a uniquely conserved serine residue within a GS(S/T) motif, suggesting that PSDs belong to the D-H-S serine protease family. The function of the conserved D-H-S residues was probed using site-directed mutagenesis of PkPSD. The results from these mutagenesis experiments reveal that Asp-139, His-198, and Ser-308 are all essential for endoproteolytic processing of PkPSD, which occurs in cis. In addition, within the GS(S/T) motif found in all PSDs, the Gly-307 residue is also essential, but the Ser/Thr-309 is non-essential.

https://openalex.org/W2091741421,"The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is present and active in humans, regulating glucose homeostasis. In normal glucose tolerant (NGT) human subjects, plasma ABA (ABAp) increases 5-fold after an oral glucose load. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an oral glucose load on ABAp in type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects. We chose two sub-groups of patients who underwent an oral glucose load for diagnostic purposes: i) 9 treatment-naive T2D subjects, and ii) 9 pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM), who underwent the glucose load before and 8–12 weeks after childbirth. Each group was compared with matched NGT controls. The increase of ABAp in response to glucose was found to be abrogated in T2D patients compared to NGT controls. A similar result was observed in the women with GDM compared to pregnant NGT controls; 8–12 weeks after childbirth, however, fasting ABAp and ABAp response to glucose were restored to normal in the GDM subjects, along with glucose tolerance. We also retrospectively compared fasting ABAp before and after bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD) in obese, but not diabetic subjects, and in obese T2D patients, in which BPD resulted in the resolution of diabetes. Compared to pre-BPD values, basal ABAp significantly increased 1 month after BPD in T2D as well as in NGT subjects, in parallel with a reduction of fasting plasma glucose. These results indicate an impaired hyperglycemia-induced ABAp increase in T2D and in GDM and suggest a beneficial effect of elevated ABAp on glycemic control."

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying its controlling somitogenesis. To uncover how foxc1a regulates zebrafish somitogenesis, we generated foxc1a knock-out zebrafish using TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nuclease) technology. The foxc1a null embryos exhibited defective somites at early development. Analyses on the expressions of the key genes that control processes of somitogenesis revealed that foxc1a controlled early somitogenesis by regulating the expression of myod1. In the somites of foxc1a knock-out embryos, expressions of fgf8a and deltaC were abolished, whereas the expression of aldh1a2 (responsible for providing retinoic acid signaling) was significantly increased. Once the increased retinoic acid level in the foxc1a null embryos was reduced by knocking down aldh1a2, the reduced expression of myod1 was partially rescued by resuming expressions of fgf8a and deltaC in the somites of the mutant embryos. Moreover, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay on zebrafish embryos revealed that Foxc1a bound aldh1a2 promoter directly. On the other hand, neither knocking down fgf8a nor inhibiting Notch signaling affected the expression of aldh1a2, although knocking down fgf8a reduced expression of deltaC in the somites of zebrafish embryos at early somitogenesis and vice versa.

https://openalex.org/W2169912921,"APOBEC3G (A3G) is a cellular cytidine deaminase that restricts HIV-1 replication by inducing G-to-A hypermutation in viral DNA and by deamination-independent mechanisms. HIV-1 Vif binds to A3G, resulting in its degradation via the 26 S proteasome. Therefore, this interaction represents a potential therapeutic target. To identify compounds that inhibit interaction between A3G and HIV-1 Vif in a high throughput format, we developed a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. A 307,520 compound library from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository was screened. Secondary screens to evaluate dose-response performance and off-target effects, cell-based assays to identify compounds that attenuate Vif-dependent degradation of A3G, and assays testing antiviral activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T cells were employed. One compound, N.41, showed potent antiviral activity in A3G(+) but not in A3G(−) T cells and had an IC50 as low as 8.4 μm and a TC50 of >100 μm when tested against HIV-1Ba-L replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. N.41 inhibited the Vif-A3G interaction and increased cellular A3G levels and incorporation of A3G into virions, thereby attenuating virus infectivity in a Vif-dependent manner. N.41 activity was also species- and Vif-dependent. Preliminary structure-activity relationship studies suggest that a hydroxyl moiety located at a phenylamino group is critical for N.41 anti-HIV activity and identified N.41 analogs with better potency (IC50 as low as 4.2 μm). These findings identify a new lead compound that attenuates HIV replication by liberating A3G from Vif regulation and increasing its innate antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W2010832103,"The transmembrane glycoprotein, CUB (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1) domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) is overexpressed in several cancer types and is a predictor of poor prognosis for patients on standard of care therapies. Phosphorylation of CDCP1 tyrosine sites is induced upon loss of cell adhesion and is thought to be linked to metastatic potential of tumor cells. Using a tyrosine-phosphoproteomics screening approach, we characterized the phosphorylation state of CDCP1 across a panel of breast cancer cell lines. We focused on two phospho-tyrosine pTyr peptides of CDCP1, containing Tyr707 and Tyr806, which were identified in all six lines, with the human epidermal growth factor 2-positive HCC1954 cells showing a particularly high phosphorylation level. Pharmacological modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation indicated that, the Src family kinases (SFKs) were found to phosphorylate CDCP1 at Tyr707 and Tyr806 and play a critical role in CDCP1 activity. We demonstrated that CDCP1 overexpression in HEK293 cells increases global phosphotyrosine content, promotes anchorage-independent cell growth and activates several SFK members. Conversely, CDCP1 downregulation in multiple solid cancer cell lines decreased both cell growth and SFK activation. Analysis of primary human tumor samples demonstrated a correlation between CDCP1 expression, SFK and protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Taken together, our results suggest that CDCP1 overexpression could be an interesting therapeutic target in multiple solid cancers and a good biomarker to stratify patients who could benefit from an anti-SFK-targeted therapy. Our data also show that multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites of CDCP1 are important for the functional regulation of SFKs in several tumor types."

Viral load in the respiratory tract was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and cytokine levels were measured by bead-based flow cytometery.Four patients survived and one died. Viral load in different clinical specimens was correlated with cytokine levels in plasma and broncho-alveolar fluid (BALF), therapeutic modalities used and clinical outcome. Intravenous zanamivir appeared to be better than peramivir as salvage therapy in patients who failed to respond to oseltamivir. Higher and more prolonged viral load was found in the sputum or endotracheal aspirates compared to throat swabs. Upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, MIP-1α/β, IL-1β and IL-8 was found in the plasma and BALF samples. The levels of cytokines in the plasma and viral load were correlated with disease severity. Reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1(HSV-1) was found in three out of five patients (60%).Expectorated sputum or endotracheal aspirate specimens are preferable to throat swabs for detecting and monitoring H7N9 virus.

Here we show a critical role for δ-catenin, a component of the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex, in regulating spine head width and length in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. The loss of Ctnnd2, the gene encoding δ-catenin, has been associated with the intellectual disability observed in the cri du chat syndrome, suggesting that the functional roles of δ-catenin are vital for neuronal integrity and higher order functions. We demonstrate that loss of δ-catenin in a mouse model or knockdown of δ-catenin in pyramidal neurons compromises spine head width and length, without altering spine dynamics. This is accompanied by a reduction in the levels of synaptic N-cadherin. The ability of δ-catenin to modulate spine architecture is critically dependent on its ability to interact with cadherin and PDZ domain-containing proteins. We propose that loss of δ-catenin during development perturbs synaptic architecture leading to developmental aberrations in neural circuit formation that contribute to the learning disabilities in a mouse model and humans with cri du chat syndrome.

In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, the majority of excitatory synapses are localized on the heads of spines. There is a strong correlation between the size of the spine and synaptic strength (1Tada T.

Interestingly, a partial duplication of Ctnnd2 in an individual with the cri du chat syndrome with deletion of Ctnnd2 in the chromosomal deletion associated with the syndrome leads to a milder cognitive phenotype, further supporting a key role for δ-catenin in the intellectual disability associated with this syndrome (20Sardina J.M.

We have previously identified a critical role for δ-catenin in regulating spine density and architecture in developing hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that the functional role of δ-catenin in regulating spine architecture extends to more mature synapses. Furthermore, we identified a molecular pathway that allows δ-catenin to mediate this functional role. Our data demonstrate that loss of δ-catenin in mature neurons of a mouse model leads to a significant reduction in spine head width and length. By taking advantage of shRNA-mediated knockdown in rat hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that knockdown of δ-catenin during development leads to a similar phenotype. This functional role of δ-catenin is critically dependent on its ability to interact with cadherin and PDZ domain-containing proteins. Our results provide evidence for a key signaling pathway in regulating spine architecture during development in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The compromise in synaptic architecture with loss of δ-catenin may underlie the behavioral phenotypes observed in the δ-catenin mouse model and individuals with cri du chat syndrome.

Cortical/hippocampal tissue from P21/22 male mice was homogenized in 10 volumes of sucrose buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA solution and protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce, EDTA-free). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g to obtain synaptosome-enriched pellet. The pellet was resuspended in the same sucrose buffer and layered onto a tube with 0.6/0.8/1.2 m sucrose layers. After centrifugation for 90 min at 75,600 × g, the synaptosome-enriched interface between 0.8 and 1.2 m was collected and diluted in the sucrose buffer. The sample was centrifuged again for 60 min at 200,000× g to pellet the synaptosomes. The isolated synaptosomes were resuspended in the sucrose buffer and frozen immediately and Western blotted as described previously. δ-Catenin N-term mice (also referred to as δ-catenin null mice) have been previously described (24Israely I.

Each sample was imaged for 5–8 h and 10–14 images of primary dendrite within 100 mm from the cell body of different individual neurons has been acquired. Time-lapse images were acquired using the following parameters: ×40, zoom 4, 512 × 512 frame size; 12 bit depth; Z-stack of 7 slices with 0.43-mm interval; 5 images were taken with a 5-min internal; definite focus was used during imaging.

Hippocampal development in the mouse proceeds through distinct stages in which differentiation and synapse formation occurs between E19 and P12 and synapse formation and maturation between P10 and P30 (29Mody M. Cao Y. Cui Z. Tay K.Y. Shyong A. Shimizu E. Pham K. Schultz P. Welsh D. Tsien J.Z. Genome-wide gene expression profiles of the developing mouse hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8862-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). δ-Catenin is well expressed at all stages of development, however, its cellular distribution is altered during development. We examined the distribution of δ-catenin in cortical synaptosomes from P21/22 mouse brains. Mouse cortical tissue was homogenized and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to obtain synaptosomes. Total homogenate, low speed pellet, high speed supernatant, and synaptosome fractions were immunoblotted with two separate commercial antibodies to δ-catenin. Enrichment of the synaptosome fraction was confirmed by immunoblotting with an antibody to PSD-95, an excitatory postsynaptic marker. Consistent with a functional role at synapses, δ-catenin was enriched in synaptosomes, similar to the enrichment observed for PSD-95 (Fig. 1). These results confirm that δ-catenin is enriched in synaptosomes during development and is consistent with a synaptic functional role for δ-catenin at more advanced stages of hippocampal development. We have previously demonstrated that loss of δ-catenin in a mouse model results in a reduction in spine head width and length during development (26Arikkath J. Peng I.F. Ng Y.G. Israely I. Liu X. Ullian E.M. Reichardt L.F. δ-Catenin regulates spine and synapse morphogenesis and function in hippocampal neurons during development.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5435-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is known that some proteins perturb synaptic structure and function during development, but not in the adult. For example, loss of SynGAP in a mouse model perturbs spine densities when eliminated before development, but not after development (30Clement J.P. Aceti M. Creson T.K. Ozkan E.D. Shi Y. Reish N.J. Almonte A.G. Miller B.H. Wiltgen B.J. Miller C.A. Xu X. Rumbaugh G. Pathogenic SYNGAP1 mutations impair cognitive development by disrupting maturation of dendritic spine synapses.Cell. 2012; 151: 709-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of loss of δ-catenin in the mouse model, we examined the spine head width and length in primary cultured neurons from control and δ-catenin N-term mice (Fig. 2) at DIV 21. Loss of δ-catenin in this mouse model leads to a reduction in the head width and length of spines. Thus δ-catenin is a critical regulator of spine architecture in both developing and mature neurons. However, these effects may also be a result of developmental alterations that occur in the absence of δ-catenin. To examine if acute loss of δ-catenin in mature neurons has similar effects, we took advantage of shRNA-mediated knockdown of δ-catenin in cultured rat neurons (75,000 neurons per coverslip). We have previously validated this shRNA (26Arikkath J. Peng I.F. Ng Y.G. Israely I. Liu X. Ullian E.M. Reichardt L.F. δ-Catenin regulates spine and synapse morphogenesis and function in hippocampal neurons during development.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5435-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Arikkath J. Israely I. Tao Y. Mei L. Liu X. Reichardt L.F. Erbin controls dendritic morphogenesis by regulating localization of δ-catenin.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7047-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rat primary neurons in culture were transfected with constructs expressing vector, shRNA, or shRNA, and a full-length cDNA of δ-catenin encoding an shRNA-resistant protein (δ-catenin*) at DIV 14. The plasmids for these also express EGFP. Neurons were fixed at DIV 21 and imaged by confocal microscopy, and spine head width and lengths were examined (Fig. 3a). Knockdown of δ-catenin resulted in a significant decrease in the spine length and spine head width (Fig. 3b), which was rescued by the expression of the shRNA-resistant form of δ-catenin. Taken together with our previous studies, these results indicate that (a) δ-catenin is a critical regulator of spine architecture in pyramidal neurons, (b) this functional role extends to different stages during development, and (c) this functional role of δ-catenin is cell autonomous. It is well established that plating primary neurons at different cell densities affects network activity and alters dendrites and spine significantly (31Ivenshitz M. Segal M. Neuronal density determines network connectivity and spontaneous activity in cultured hippocampus.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 1052-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Biffi E.

Synapse-to-neuron ratio is inversely related to neuronal density in mature neuronal cultures.Brain Res. 2010; 1359: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We examined if the δ-catenin loss-induced perturbation of spine architecture would be altered by changes in network activity. To this end, we plated neurons at a higher density (150,000 neurons per coverslip) and examined if knockdown of δ-catenin perturbs spine architecture (Fig. 4, a and b). High-density cultured neurons expressing shRNA to δ-catenin had a significant reduction in the head width and length that could be rescued by co-expression of the shRNA-resistant form of δ-catenin. These results suggest that loss of δ-catenin leads to an inherent compromise of spine architecture and this is independent of neuronal network activity. Because the architecture of spines was compromised in the absence of δ-catenin, we chose to examine if the dynamics of spine head width and length were altered in the absence of δ-catenin. To this end, neurons in culture were transfected with vector or shRNA at DIV 11 and examined by time-lapse microscopy on DIV 16–18 over a total of 20 min with images obtained every 5 min (Fig. 5a). Spine head widths and lengths were obtained at each time point. For the purpose of analysis, we split the spines into two groups, those with spine lengths less than or equal to 2 μm and those with spine lengths greater than 2 μm. Fig. 5, b–e, demonstrate head widths and lengths at different time points for a few spines as indicated in Fig. 5a. We examined spine head width and length parameters from similar experiments for larger groups of neurons to define average behavior. In the less than or equal to 2-μm head width group, the spine head widths in the shRNA group were smaller at all time points examined, whereas in the greater than 2-μm group, a significant difference in head width was only observed at some time points (Fig. 5f). We also performed a similar analysis for spine lengths. In the group of spines with lengths less than or equal to 2 μm, the lengths of the spines in the shRNA group were significantly smaller at each time point. However, in the greater than 2-μm group, the spine lengths between the vector and shRNA group showed no significant differences (Fig. 5g). In the less than or equal to 2-μm group, the absolute differences in spine head widths were not significantly different between the vector and the shRNA except at one time point. The greater than 2-μm group showed a trend toward alterations in the absolute difference in spine head width between the vector and shRNA, however, these differences were not significant (Fig. 5h). Similar results were obtained for the spine length (Fig. 5i). The sum of the absolute differences from T1 to T5 were significantly reduced in the less than or equal to 2-μm shRNA group, but not the greater than 2-μm group, in comparison to the vector group (Fig. 5j). Similar results were observed for spine length (Fig. 5k). The difference in spine head widths and spine lengths from T5 to T1 were not significantly different for any of the groups (Fig. 5, l and m). Taken together, these results suggest that δ-catenin may regulate the spine head width and length of the less than or equal to 2 μm and greater than 2 μm head width/length differentially. The effects of loss of δ-catenin on the smaller head width and length population are more prominent. In this group,"

We describe the specificity and amyloid β (Aβ)-clearing effect of a catabody construct engineered from innate immunity principles. The catabody recognized the Aβ C terminus noncovalently and hydrolyzed Aβ rapidly, with no reactivity to the Aβ precursor protein, transthyretin amyloid aggregates, or irrelevant proteins containing the catabody-sensitive Aβ dipeptide unit. The catabody dissolved preformed Aβ aggregates and inhibited Aβ aggregation more potently than an Aβ-binding IgG. Intravenous catabody treatment reduced brain Aβ deposits in a mouse Alzheimer disease model without inducing microgliosis or microhemorrhages. Specific Aβ hydrolysis appears to be an innate immune function that could be applied for therapeutic Aβ removal.

Catalytic antibodies (catabodies) hold potential for digesting the antigen into harmless soluble fragments with no dependence on accessory inflammatory cells. Conventional immunization procedures based on acquired immunity principles do not produce catabodies with hydrolytic rates sufficient for medical use. Recent studies suggest that catalysis is an innate property of the germ line immunoglobulin variable (V) domains that have developed over the course of Darwinian evolution (12Paul S. Planque S.A.

The innate V domain repertoire expressed prior to contact with an antigen is very large, containing diverse light and heavy chain V domains (VL and VH domains) that hold potential for specific recognition of individual antigenic epitopes. We reported the catalytic immunoglobulin V domain (IgV) construct 2E6 isolated from a human IgV library (14Taguchi H. Planque S. Sapparapu G. Boivin S. Hara M. Nishiyama Y. Paul S.

Here we present evidence showing that the IgV degrades and clears Aβ specifically with no evidence of microglial activation or microhemorrhages. IgV clones 2E6 and MMF6 were isolated from an IgV library cloned in pHEN2 vector from peripheral blood lymphocytes of three lupus patients without amyloid disease (14Taguchi H. Planque S. Sapparapu G. Boivin S. Hara M. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. Exceptional amyloid β peptide hydrolyzing activity of nonphysiological immunoglobulin variable domain scaffolds.J. Biol.

The two IgVs contain the same C-terminal VL2 domain and different N-terminal VL1 domains (GenBankTM accession numbers FJ231715 and KF018653, respectively). The mutant IgV 2E6 gene was synthesized by Mutagenex Inc. (Hillsborough, NJ) by replacing the VL1 domain framework regions (FRs; Kabat residues 1–23, 35–49, 57–88, and 98–107) with the corresponding FRs of IgV MMF6 VL1 domain and cloned into pHEN2 vector (NcoI/XhoI sites). IgV expression in culture supernatants after 24-h induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was 1.5–5.4 mg/liter. Aβ-binding IgG1 59 contains the VL-VH domain pair of a single chain Fv fragment that binds Aβ42 aggregates and clears brain Aβ deposits in a transgenic mouse model (15Fukuchi K. Tahara K. Kim H.D.

Assembled IgG1 59 in tissue culture supernatant (∼0.6 mg of IgG/liter) was concentrated 10 times, purified using immobilized Protein A, and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl (PBS), and the protein concentration was determined (16Sapparapu G.

The IgVs were purified from bacterial periplasmic extracts by binding of the C-terminal His6 tag to metal affinity columns followed by acid elution (pH 5.0, designated aIgV), yielding the 30-kDa intact IgV and its 18-kDa fragment in electrophoresis gels (14Taguchi H.

Unfractionated culture supernatants were prepared by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 30 min) of IgV-secreting and control bacteria grown to equivalent density as before (∼0.8 A600 units). Diagnostic anion exchange chromatography of culture supernatants (33 ml) was in a neutral pH buffer (MonoQ HR 5/5 FPLC column, 1 ml/min (GE Healthcare); 20-min 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CHAPS). The partially fractionated IgV 2E6 preparation was obtained on a larger scale by two cycles of anion exchange FPLC at neutral pH (designated nIgV; from 1 liter of culture supernatant concentrated 25-fold on a 10-kDa Pellicon 2 membrane followed by dialysis against chromatography buffer). The concentrated culture supernatant contained 160 mg of total protein and 1.1 mg of IgV 2E6, determined, respectively, by the micro-BCA method and dot blotting with antibody to the c-Myc peptide tag (14Taguchi H. Planque S. Sapparapu G. Boivin S. Hara M. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. Exceptional amyloid β peptide hydrolyzing activity of nonphysiological immunoglobulin variable domain scaffolds.J. Biol.

The first FPLC cycle was in the pH 7.4 chromatography buffer as before (Hitrap Q FF column, GE Healthcare; 3 ml/min). The unbound fraction containing the anti-c-Myc-reactive IgV 2E6 (retention volume, 4–16 ml) was subjected to the second FPLC cycle on the same column at more alkaline pH using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient over 20 min (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm CHAPS, adjusted to pH 8.0 with Tris base). Anti-amyloid tests were done using the resultant bound nIgV 2E6 fraction (protein content 1.8 mg, IgV content 0.11 mg). The culture supernatant from control bacteria harboring empty pHEN2 vector was fractionated identically by two chromatography cycles. Control IgV MMF6 eluted in the bound fraction from the first chromatography cycle conducted as described for nIgV 2E6 (retention volume, 44.1–56.2 ml; protein content, 3.8 mg; nIgV MMF6 content, 0.11 mg). nIgV 2E6 requires bound divalent metal for maintenance of the catalytic activity (18Nishiyama Y. Taguchi H. Hara M. Planque S.A. Mitsuda Y. Paul S. Metal-dependent amyloid β-degrading catalytic antibody construct.J. Biotechnol. 2014; 180: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To avoid diluting the protein, catalytically inactive nIgV 2E6 was prepared by dialysis for 24 h against PBS containing 0.1 mm CHAPS and 10 mm EDTA, followed by dialysis against the same buffer without EDTA (to remove the chelator). Synthetic Aβ40 from EZBiolab (Carmel, IN) treated with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP; Sigma-Aldrich) was radiolabeled with 125I at Tyr10. Aβ40 forms particulate aggregates slowly compared with Aβ42. Routine hydrolysis tests were conducted using 125I-Aβ40 (∼30,000 cpm) treated with nIgV or aIgV preparations (3–24 h) in PBS containing 0.1 mm CHAPS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation to separate the intact peptide from fragments (14Taguchi H. Planque S. Sapparapu G. Boivin S. Hara M. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. Exceptional amyloid β peptide hydrolyzing activity of nonphysiological immunoglobulin variable domain scaffolds.J. Biol.

Formic acid was added to 60% (v/v) prior to FPLC gel filtration of 125I-Aβ40 (50,000 cpm; ∼0.2 nm) digested with IgVs (2.5 μg/ml, 24 h; Superdex peptide column (GE Healthcare), run in 60% formic acid; 0.5-ml fractions). The nominal peptide mass was computed from the retention volumes of these markers: aprotinin (6,512 Da), vasoactive intestinal peptide (3,326 Da), N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-O-benzyl-Glu-Ala-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (721 Da), and Ala-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (246 Da). Apparent Km and turnover number (kcat) were estimated from initial hydrolysis rates measured at a constant 125I-Aβ40 amount (∼300,000 cpm) mixed with increasing Aβ40 concentrations (0.1 nm to 25 μm), assuming an IgV mass of 30 kDa (14Taguchi H. Planque S. Sapparapu G. Boivin S. Hara M. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. Exceptional amyloid β peptide hydrolyzing activity of nonphysiological immunoglobulin variable domain scaffolds.J. Biol.

Aβ42 (90 μg) was labeled with 125I using 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α,6α-diphenylglycouril-coated tubes (Pierce), and free 125I was removed (Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridge, Waters (Milford, MA)). The acetonitrile-eluted 125I-Aβ42 was dried, mixed with non-radiolabeled Aβ42 (1 mg), retreated with HFIP for 1 h, lyophilized, and stored (−80 °C). After reconstitution in dimethyl sulfoxide, the 125I-Aβ42 (5 mm) was diluted to a concentration of 50 μm in PBS and incubated for 92 h (37 °C), and fibrillar Aβ42 was collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min). The radioactivity content of fibrillar 125I-Aβ42 was 2.3 × 107 cpm/μmol of Aβ. Fibrillar 125I-Aβ42 (2.2 nmol/0.1 ml) was incubated with nIgV samples in PBS containing 0.1 mm CHAPS. Formic acid was added to 60% (v/v) in the supernatants collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min), and FPLC gel filtration in formic acid was conducted as before. The pelleted 125I-Aβ42 was dissolved in PBS containing 60% formic acid and analyzed by FPLC gel filtration similarly. For epitope identification, non-radioactive Aβ40, Aβ(1–16), Aβ(17–42), or Aβ(19–40) (Anaspec, Fremont, CA) was included as a competitive inhibitor in the 125I-Aβ40 hydrolysis reaction mixture (0.2 μg/ml nIgV 2E6; 3 h, 37 °C). Hydrolysis of soluble FLAG-tagged APP751 (83 kDa, 0.1 μm; Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD), glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged amphiphysin (153 kDa, 0.1 μm), and GST-tagged zinc finger protein 154 (43 kDa, 0.1 μm; Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan) treated with 2.5 μg/ml nIgV (24 h) was estimated by SDS electrophoresis and staining with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG or anti-GST IgG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) (16Sapparapu G.

TTR aggregation was confirmed by development of turbidity (400 nm) and increased thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence (λex = 440 nm; λem = 485 nm; photomultiplier tube, 600 V) compared with the starting non-aggregated TTR (turbidity, 0.61 ± 0.01 and 0.02 ± 0.01, respectively; ThT fluorescence, 144.9 ± 3.2 and 17.4 ± 6.9, respectively). The preaggregated TTR (0.1 μm) was incubated with 40 μg/ml IgV (60 h), and the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS and analyzed by electrophoresis (16.5% gels). Under these conditions, the physiological tetramer TTR species and amyloid TTR aggregates dissociate into the TTR monomer band (14 kDa), and a faint dimer band is detected (19Planque S.A.

Preaggregated fibrillar Aβ42 (starting Aβ42 peptide concentration, 20 μm; prepared as described for 125I-Aβ42) was treated with nIgVs (24 h, 37 °C) in PBS, 0.1 mm CHAPS, and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide. ThT (5 μm) was added, and fluorescence emission was measured after 30 min. Inhibition of fibrillization was determined similarly by treating non-aggregated Aβ42 (20 μm) with the nIgVs. The data were corrected for background ThT fluorescence of the same antibody without Aβ42 (<5–19 fluorescence units). For potency comparisons, ThT fluorescence for reaction mixtures containing nIgV 2E6 or IgG1 59 was expressed as a percentage of the value of the control antibody with the same scaffold structure (64–94 fluorescence units; nIgV MMF6 and IgG1 SKT03 directed to gp120) (20Nishiyama Y. Karle S. Mitsuda Y. Taguchi H. Planque S. Salas M. Hanson C. Paul S. Towards irreversible HIV inactivation: stable gp120 binding by nucleophilic antibodies.J. Mol.

Dissolution of preaggregated fibrillar Aβ42 (5 μm) treated with an equal volume of IgV-containing tissue culture supernatant was monitored by transmission electron microscopy using a JEOL 1400 microscope at 120 kV (5 μl of reaction mixture adsorbed for 1 min on glow-discharged 300-mesh Formvar carbon grids followed by three 30-s washes with water, negative staining for 1 min with 1% uranyl acetate in water, and another three 30-s washes with water). Oligomers were prepared by incubating Aβ42 (50 μm) in phenol red-free Ham's F-12 medium (4 °C, 24 h) (21Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J.

The oligomer preparation (total Aβ peptide concentration 40 μm) was treated (24 h, 37 °C) with nIgV 2E6 or MMF6 (3 μg/ml) in Ham's medium/PBS containing 0.1 mm CHAPS (4:1, v/v). SDS and β-mercaptoethanol were added (final concentrations, 2% and 0.46 m, respectively), and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis without prior boiling. The Aβ species mass (monomers, oligomers, and proteolytic fragments) was computed by comparison with reference proteins (1.4–27 kDa and 14–97 kDa ladders; Bio-Rad). Oligomer disappearance was monitored by densitometry of the SDS-stable trimer, tetramer, and high mass oligomer bands (45 kDa band, 64–84 kDa smear) following staining of gel blots with a mixture of mouse anti-Aβ monoclonal IgG 6E10, IgG 4G8 (both from Covance, Princeton, NJ), and IgG 6D4 (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA) (directed to Aβ(1–17), Aβ(17–24), and the Aβ C terminus, respectively). Freshly dissolved Aβ42 without prior oligomerization was mixed immediately with the nIgVs (3 μg/ml) to test the nIgV effect on oligomer accumulation over 24 h of incubation at 4 °C. Experimental and control antibody effects were studied using equivalently analyzed reaction mixtures (including equivalent gel staining and imaging procedures). Aβ42 binding by IgV 2E6 and IgG1 59 was tested by immunoblotting of oligomerized Aβ42 electrophoresed in SDS gels (1 μg of Aβ42/lane).

Two viruses, ABPV and SBV, were never detected. For adults without mite infestation, DWV, IAPV, BQCV and KBV were detected in the HMP colony; however, only BQCV was detected in the LMP colony but at similar levels as in the HMP colony. With mite infestation, the four viruses were detected in adults of the HMP colony but all at higher amounts than in the LMP colony. For brood without mite infestation, DWV and IAPV were detected in the HMP colony, but no viruses were detected in the LMP colony. With mite infestation of brood, the four viruses were detected in the HMP colony, but only DWV and IAPV were detected and at lower amounts in the LMP colony. An epidemiological explanation for these results is that pre-experiment differences in virus presence and levels existed between the HMP and LMP colonies. It is also possible that low V. destructor population growth in the LMP colony resulted in the bees being less exposed to the mite and thus less likely to have virus infections. LMP and HMP bees may have also differed in susceptibility to virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2054489328,"Humans can register another person’s fear not only with their eyes and ears, but also with their nose. Previous research has demonstrated that exposure to body odors from fearful individuals elicited implicit fear in others. The odor of fearful individuals appears to have a distinctive signature that can be produced relatively rapidly, driven by a physiological mechanism that has remained unexplored in earlier research. The apocrine sweat glands in the armpit that are responsible for chemosignal production contain receptors for adrenalin. We therefore expected that the release of adrenalin through activation of the rapid stress response system (i.e., the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system) is what drives the release of fear sweat, as opposed to activation of the slower stress response system (i.e., hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis). To test this assumption, sweat was sampled while eight participants prepared for a speech. Participants had higher heart rates and produced more armpit sweat in the fast stress condition, compared to baseline and the slow stress condition. Importantly, exposure to sweat from participants in the fast stress condition induced in receivers (N = 31) a simulacrum of the state of the sender, evidenced by the emergence of a fearful facial expression (facial electromyography) and vigilant behavior (i.e., faster classification of emotional facial expressions)."
https://openalex.org/W2053885727,"The genus Orthopyxis is widely known for its morphological variability, making species identification particularly difficult. A number of nominal species have been recorded in the southwestern Atlantic, although most of these records are doubtful. The goal of this study was to infer species boundaries in the genus Orthopyxis from the southwestern Atlantic using an integrative approach. Intergeneric limits were also tested using comparisons with specimens of the genus Campanularia. We performed DNA analyses using the mitochondrial genes 16S and COI and the nuclear ITS1 and ITS2 regions. Orthopyxis was monophyletic in maximum likelihood analyses using the combined dataset and in analyses with 16S alone. Four lineages of Orthopyxis were retrieved for all analyses, corresponding morphologically to the species Orthopyxis sargassicola (previously known in the area), Orthopyxis crenata (first recorded for the southwestern Atlantic), Orthopyxis caliculata (= Orthopyxis minuta Vannucci, 1949 and considered a synonym of O. integra by some authors), and Orthopyxis mianzani sp. nov. A re-evaluation of the traditional morphological diagnostic characters, guided by our molecular analyses, revealed that O. integra does not occur in the study area, and O. caliculata is the correct identification of one of the lineages occurring in this region, corroborating the validity of that species. Orthopyxis mianzani sp. nov. resembles O. caliculata with respect to gonothecae morphology and a smooth hydrothecae rim, although it shows significant differences for other characters, such as perisarc thickness, which has traditionally been thought to have wide intraspecific variation. The species O. sargassicola is morphologically similar to O. crenata, although they differ in gonothecae morphology, and these species can only be reliably identified when this structure is present."

Previously, we demonstrated a role for p38 MAPK-mediated norepinephrine transporter (NET) Thr30 phosphorylation in cocaine-induced NET up-regulation (Mannangatti, P., Arapulisamy, O., Shippenberg, T. S., Ramamoorthy, S., and Jayanthi, L. D. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 20239–20250). The present study explored the functional interaction between p38 MAPK-mediated NET regulation and cocaine-induced behaviors. In vitro cocaine treatment of mouse prefrontal cortex synaptosomes resulted in enhanced NET function, surface expression, and phosphorylation. Pretreatment with PD169316, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, completely blocked cocaine-mediated NET up-regulation and phosphorylation. In mice, in vivo administration of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 completely blocked cocaine-induced NET up-regulation and p38 MAPK activation in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. When tested for cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference (CPP), mice receiving SB203580 on cocaine challenge day or on postconditioning test day exhibited significantly reduced cocaine sensitization and CPP. A transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide strategy was utilized to test the involvement of the NET-Thr30 motif. In vitro treatment of synaptosomes with TAT-NET-Thr30 (wild-type peptide) completely blocked cocaine-mediated NET up-regulation and phosphorylation. In vivo administration of TAT-NET-Thr30 peptide but not TAT-NET-T30A (mutant peptide) completely blocked cocaine-mediated NET up-regulation and phosphorylation. In the cocaine CPP paradigm, mice receiving TAT-NET-Thr30 but not TAT-NET-T30A on postconditioning test day exhibited significantly reduced cocaine CPP. Following extinction, TAT-NET-Thr30 when given prior to cocaine challenge significantly reduced reinstatement of cocaine CPP. These results demonstrate that the direct inhibition of p38 MAPK or the manipulation of NET-Thr30 motif/phosphorylation via a TAT peptide strategy prevents cocaine-induced NET up-regulation, locomotor sensitization, and CPP, suggesting a role for Thr30-linked NET regulation in cocaine-elicited behaviors.

https://openalex.org/W2153588297,"Background Cigarette smoking presents a salient risk for HIV-positive populations. This study is among the first to examine smoking prevalence, nicotine dependence, and associated factors in a large sample of HIV-positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Vietnam. Methods A cross-sectional study of 1133 HIV-positive people was conducted from January to September 2013 at 8 ART clinics in Hanoi (the capital) and Nam Dinh (a rural area). Smoking history and nicotine dependence (Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence–FTND) were assessed by participant self-report. Logistic regression and Tobit linear regression were performed to identify factors significantly associated with smoking outcomes. Results Prevalence of current, former, and never smokers in the sample was 36.1%, 9.5%, and 54.4%, respectively. The current smoking proportion was higher in males (59.7%) than females (2.6%). The mean FTND score was 3.6 (SD = 2.1). Males were more likely to currently smoke than females (OR = 23.4, 95% CI = 11.6–47.3). Individuals with problem drinking (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1–2.9) and ever drug use (OR = 3.7, 95%CI = 2.5–5.7) were more likely to be current smokers. Older age and currently feeling pain were associated with lower nicotine dependence. Conversely, receiving care in Nam Dinh, greater alcohol consumption, ever drug use, and a longer smoking duration were associated with greater nicotine dependence. Conclusions Given the high prevalence of smoking among HIV-positive patients, smoking screening and cessation support should be offered at ART clinics in Vietnam. Risk factors (i.e., substance use) linked with smoking behavior should be considered in prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W1992710837,"To address the challenges of tracking the multitude of signaling molecules and metabolites that is the basis of biological complexity, we describe a strategy to expand the analytical techniques for dynamic systems biology. Using microfluidics, online desalting, and mass spectrometry technologies, we constructed and validated a platform well suited for sampling the cellular microenvironment with high temporal resolution. Our platform achieves success in: automated cellular stimulation and microenvironment control; reduced non-specific adsorption to polydimethylsiloxane due to surface passivation; real-time online sample collection; near real-time sample preparation for salt removal; and real-time online mass spectrometry. When compared against the benchmark of “in-culture” experiments combined with ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-IM-MS), our platform alleviates the volume challenge issues caused by dilution of autocrine and paracrine signaling and dramatically reduces sample preparation and data collection time, while reducing undesirable external influence from various manual methods of manipulating cells and media (e.g., cell centrifugation). To validate this system biologically, we focused on cellular responses of Jurkat T cells to microenvironmental stimuli. Application of these stimuli, in conjunction with the cell’s metabolic processes, results in changes in consumption of nutrients and secretion of biomolecules (collectively, the exometabolome), which enable communication with other cells or tissues and elimination of waste. Naïve and experienced T-cell metabolism of cocaine is used as an exemplary system to confirm the platform’s capability, highlight its potential for metabolite discovery applications, and explore immunological memory of T-cell drug exposure. Our platform proved capable of detecting metabolomic variations between naïve and experienced Jurkat T cells and highlights the dynamics of the exometabolome over time. Upregulation of the cocaine metabolite, benzoylecgonine, was noted in experienced T cells, indicating potential cellular memory of cocaine exposure. These metabolomics distinctions were absent from the analogous, traditional “in-culture” UPLC-ESI-IM-MS experiment, further demonstrating this platform’s capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2039278293,"We here show a new relationship between the human p14ARF oncosuppressor and the MDM2 oncoprotein. MDM2 overexpression in various cancer cell lines causes p14ARF reduction inducing its degradation through the proteasome. The effect does not require the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 and preferentially occurs in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, treatment with inhibitors of the PKC (Protein Kinase C) pathway and use of p14ARF phosphorylation mutants indicate that ARF phosphorylation could play a role in MDM2 mediated ARF degradation reinforcing our previous observations that ARF phosphorylation influences its stability and biological activity. Our study uncovers a new potentially important mechanism through which ARF and MDM2 can counterbalance each other during the tumorigenic process."
https://openalex.org/W2052052742,"The resistance of melanoma to current treatment modalities represents a major obstacle for durable therapeutic response, and thus the elucidation of mechanisms of resistance is urgently needed. The crucial functions of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) in the development and therapeutic resistance of melanoma have been previously reported, although the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report a protein kinase C-ɛ (PKCɛ)- and ATF2-mediated mechanism that facilitates resistance by transcriptionally repressing the expression of interferon-β1 (IFNβ1) and downstream type-I IFN signaling that is otherwise induced upon exposure to chemotherapy. Treatment of early-stage melanomas expressing low levels of PKCɛ with chemotherapies relieves ATF2-mediated transcriptional repression of IFNβ1, resulting in impaired S-phase progression, a senescence-like phenotype and increased cell death. This response is lost in late-stage metastatic melanomas expressing high levels of PKCɛ. Notably, nuclear ATF2 and low expression of IFNβ1 in melanoma tumor samples correlates with poor patient responsiveness to biochemotherapy or neoadjuvant IFN-α2a. Conversely, cytosolic ATF2 and induction of IFNβ1 coincides with therapeutic responsiveness. Collectively, we identify an IFNβ1-dependent, cell-autonomous mechanism that contributes to the therapeutic resistance of melanoma via the PKCɛ-ATF2 regulatory axis."
https://openalex.org/W1977463568,"Natural Killer (NK) cells perform many functions that depend on actin assembly, including adhesion, chemotaxis, lytic synapse assembly and cytolysis. HS1, the hematopoietic homolog of cortactin, binds to Arp2/3 complex and promotes actin assembly by helping to form and stabilize actin filament branches. We investigated the role of HS1 in transendothelial migration (TEM) by NK cells. Depletion of HS1 led to a decrease in the efficiency of TEM by NK cells, as measured by transwell assays with endothelial cell monolayers on porous filters. Transwell assays involve chemotaxis of NK cells across the filter, so to examine TEM more specifically, we imaged live-cell preparations and antibody-stained fixed preparations, with and without the chemoattractant SDF-1α. We found small to moderate effects of HS1 depletion on TEM, including whether the NK cells migrated via the transcellular or paracellular route. Expression of HS1 mutants indicated that phosphorylation of HS1 tyrosines at positions 222, 378 and 397 was required for rescue in the transwell assay, but HS1 mutations affecting interaction with Arp2/3 complex or SH3-domain ligands had no effect. The GEF Vav1, a ligand of HS1 phosphotyrosine, influenced NK cell transendothelial migration. HS1 and Vav1 also affected the speed of NK cells migrating across the surface of the endothelium. We conclude that HS1 has a role in transendothelial migration of NK cells and that HS1 tyrosine phosphorylation may signal through Vav1."

https://openalex.org/W1995478028,"In eukaryotes, NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is strictly mitochondrial and is a key enzyme in the Krebs cycle. To date, all known NAD(+)-specific IDHs (NAD-IDHs) in the mitochondria are believed to be heteromeric in solution. Here, a unique homodimeric NAD-IDH from Ostreococcus tauri (OtIDH), the smallest autotrophic picoeukaryote, was unveiled. Active OtIDH has a molecular weight of ∼93 kDa with each subunit of 46.7 kDa. In the presence of Mn(2+) and Mg(2+), OtIDH displayed 42-fold and 51-fold preference for NAD(+) over NADP(+), respectively. Interestingly, OtIDH exhibited a sigmoidal kinetic behavior in response to isocitrate unlike other homodimeric homologs, and a remarkably high affinity for isocitrate (S0.5 < 10 μM) unlike other hetero-oligomeric homologs. Furthermore, its coenzyme specificity can be completely converted from NAD(+) (ancient trait) to NADP(+) (adaptive trait) by rational mutagenesis based on the evolutionary trace. Mutants D344R and D344R/M345H displayed a 15-fold and 72-fold preference for NADP(+) over NAD(+), respectively, indicating that D344 and M345 are the determinants of NAD(+) specificity. These findings also suggest that OtIDH may be an ancestral form of type II IDHs (all reported members are NADP(+)-linked enzymes) and may have evolved into NADP(+)-dependent IDH for adaptation to the increased demand of NADPH under carbon starvation."
https://openalex.org/W2088374154,"Determining the composition of a bird's diet and its seasonal shifts are fundamental for understanding the ecology and ecological functions of a species. Various methods have been used to estimate the dietary compositions of birds, which have their own advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we examined the possibility of using long-term volunteer monitoring data as the source of dietary information for 15 resident bird species in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The data were collected from field observations reported by volunteers of regional naturalist groups. Based on these monitoring data, we calculated the monthly dietary composition of each bird species directly, and we also estimated unidentified items within the reported foraging episodes using Bayesian models that contained additional information regarding foraging locations. Next, to examine the validity of the estimated dietary compositions, we compared them with the dietary information for focal birds based on stomach analysis methods, collected from past literatures. The dietary trends estimated from the monitoring data were largely consistent with the general food habits determined from the previous studies of focal birds. Thus, the estimates based on the volunteer monitoring data successfully detected noticeable seasonal shifts in many of the birds from plant materials to animal diets during spring-summer. Comparisons with stomach analysis data supported the qualitative validity of the monitoring-based dietary information and the effectiveness of the Bayesian models for improving the estimates. This comparison suggests that one advantage of using monitoring data is its ability to detect dietary items such as fleshy fruits, flower nectar, and vertebrates. These results emphasize the potential importance of observation data collecting and mining by citizens, especially free descriptive observation data, for use in bird ecology studies."
https://openalex.org/W2036742049,"Objective Neuroimaging is an important diagnostic tool in the assessment of neurological disease, but often unmasks Incidental Findings (IFs). The negative impacts of IFs, such as ‘patient’ anxiety, present neurologists with management dilemmas, largely due to the limited knowledge base surrounding the medical significance of these IFs. In particular, the lack of evidence-based clinical trials investigating the efficacy of treatments for subclinical IFs makes management protocols challenging. The objective was to determine the impact IFs may have on neurologists’ workloads and healthcare budgets and to examine neurologists’ concerns regarding the clinical management of these ‘patients’. Methods Qualitative research based on constructivist grounded theory. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews of purposively sampled neurologists, coded, and concurrent comparative analysis performed. A substantive theory of the ‘IF impacts’ was developed after concept saturation. Results Neurologists managed the escalating workload caused by an increased number of referrals of ‘patients’ with IFs found during neuroimaging; however it was unclear whether this was sustainable in the future. Neurologists experienced IF management dilemmas and spent more time with ‘patients’ affected by anxiety. The lack of information provided to those undergoing neuroimaging by the referring clinician regarding the possibility of discovering IFs was highlighted. Conclusion The impact of IFs upon the neurologist, ‘patient’ and the health institution appeared considerable. Further research determining the natural history of subclinical IFs and the efficacy of intervention will help to alleviate these issues."
https://openalex.org/W2023270221,"The expression of rDNA in hybrids inherited from only one progenitor refers to nucleolar dominance. The molecular basis for choosing which genes to silence remains unclear. We report genetic imbalance induced by distant hybridization correlates with formation of rDNA genes (NORs) in the hybrids between Raphanus sativus L. and Brassica alboglabra Bailey. Moreover, increased CCGG methylation of rDNA in F1 hybrids is concomitant with Raphanus-derived rDNA gene silencing and rDNA transcriptional inactivity revealed by nucleolar configuration restriction. Newly formed rDNA gene locus occurred through chromosomal in F1 hybrids via chromosomal imbalance. NORs are gained de novo, lost, and/or transposed in the new genome. Inhibition of methyltransferases leads to changes in nucleolar architecture, implicating a key role of methylation in control of nucleolar dominance and vital nucleolar configuration transition. Our findings suggest that gene imbalance and methylation-related chromatin restructuring is important for rDNA gene silencing that may be crucial for synthesis of specific proteins."

Furthermore, hTAS2R39 activity can be blocked by 6-methoxyflavanones, 4’-fluoro-6-methoxyflavanone in particular. A structure-based pharmacophore model of the hTAS2R39 binding pocket was built using Snooker software, which has been used successfully before for drug design of GPCRs of the rhodopsin subfamily. For the validation of the model, two sets of compounds, both of which contained actives and inactives, were used: (i) an (iso)flavonoid-dedicated set, and (ii) a more generic, structurally diverse set. Agonists were characterized by their linear binding geometry and the fact that they bound deeply in the hTAS2R39 pocket, mapping the hydrogen donor feature based on T5.45 and N3.36, analogues of which have been proposed to play a key role in activation of GPCRs. Blockers lack hydrogen-bond donors enabling contact to the receptor. Furthermore, they had a crooked geometry, which could sterically hinder movement of the TM domains upon receptor activation. Our results reveal characteristics of hTAS2R39 agonist and bitter blocker binding, which might facilitate the development of blockers suitable to counter the bitterness of dietary hTAS2R39 agonists in food applications."
https://openalex.org/W1999278306,"The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic stability and cleavage sites of exendin-4 in rat tissue homogenates, as well as to identify the types of proteases involved in exendin-4 degradation. The stability of exendin-4 in kidney and liver homogenates from rats was evaluated using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) with gradient elution. Furthermore, we used a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and LC-ESI-MS/MS to identify the structures of the major degradation products of exendin-4, and peptidase inhibitors were used to characterize exendin-4 degradation in rat liver and kidney homogenates and to identify the proteases involved in exendin-4 metabolism. Exendin-4 had a half-life of 7.8 and 100.9 min in the kidney and liver homogenate, respectively. The enzymes most likely to be involved in the degradation of exendin-4 were aminopeptidases, serineproteases, and metalloproteases. Exendin-4(15-39) and exendin-4(16-39) were the predominant direct exendin-4 metabolites in the kidney, and the main product of exendin-4 metabolism in the liver was exendin-4(12-39). Our results indicated that the metabolism of exendin-4 involved an initial endoproteolytic cleavage and subsequent exoproteolytic digestion. The degradation of exendin-4 in the kidney and liver homogenates followed distinct patterns, and the primary cleavage sites of exendin-4 degradation in rat kidney homogenates were located after AA-14, and -15, whereas those in rat liver homogenates were located after AA-11."
https://openalex.org/W2024494620,"Reaction networks are useful for analyzing reaction systems occurring in chemistry, systems biology, or Earth system science. Despite the importance of thermodynamic disequilibrium for many of those systems, the general thermodynamic properties of reaction networks are poorly understood. To circumvent the problem of sparse thermodynamic data, we generate artificial reaction networks and investigate their non-equilibrium steady state for various boundary fluxes. We generate linear and nonlinear networks using four different complex network models (Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, Pan-Sinha) and compare their topological properties with real reaction networks. For similar boundary conditions the steady state flow through the linear networks is about one order of magnitude higher than the flow through comparable nonlinear networks. In all networks, the flow decreases with the distance between the inflow and outflow boundary species, with Watts-Strogatz networks showing a significantly smaller slope compared to the three other network types. The distribution of entropy production of the individual reactions inside the network follows a power law in the intermediate region with an exponent of circa -1.5 for linear and -1.66 for nonlinear networks. An elevated entropy production rate is found in reactions associated with weakly connected species. This effect is stronger in nonlinear networks than in the linear ones. Increasing the flow through the nonlinear networks also increases the number of cycles and leads to a narrower distribution of chemical potentials. We conclude that the relation between distribution of dissipation, network topology and strength of disequilibrium is nontrivial and can be studied systematically by artificial reaction networks."

https://openalex.org/W2008858875,"Fetal antigen 1/delta-like 1 homologue (FA1/dlk1) belongs to the epidermal growth factor superfamily and is considered to be a non-canonical ligand for the Notch receptor. Interactions between Notch and its ligands are crucial for the development of various tissues. Moreover, FA1/dlk1 has been suggested as a potential supplementary marker of dopaminergic neurons. The present study aimed at investigating the distribution of FA1/dlk1-immunoreactive (-ir) cells in the early postnatal and adult midbrain as well as in the nigrostriatal system of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned hemiparkinsonian adult rats. FA1/dlk1-ir cells were predominantly distributed in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (SNc) and in the ventral tegmental area. Interestingly, the expression of FA1/dlk1 significantly increased in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-ir cells during early postnatal development. Co-localization and tracing studies demonstrated that FA1/dlk1-ir cells in the SNc were nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, and unilateral 6-OHDA lesions resulted in loss of both FA1/dlk1-ir and TH-ir cells in the SNc. Surprisingly, increased numbers of FA1/dlk1-ir cells (by 70%) were detected in dopamine-depleted striata as compared to unlesioned controls. The higher number of FA1/dlk1-ir cells was likely not due to neurogenesis as colocalization studies for proliferation markers were negative. This suggests that FA1/dlk1 was up-regulated in intrinsic cells in response to the 6-OHDA-mediated loss of FA1/dlk1-expressing SNc dopaminergic neurons and/or due to the stab wound. Our findings hint to a significant role of FA1/dlk1 in the SNc during early postnatal development. The differential expression of FA1/dlk1 in the SNc and the striatum of dopamine-depleted rats could indicate a potential involvement of FA1/dlk1 in the cellular response to the degenerative processes."
https://openalex.org/W2024351332,"Pro-endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II), one component of the multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex, plays multiple roles in physiological and pathological processes of protein translation, signal transduction, immunity, lung development, and tumor growth. Recent studies have determined that pro-EMAP II has an essential role in maintaining axon integrity in central and peripheral neural systems where deletion of the C terminus of pro-EMAP II has been reported in a consanguineous Israeli Bedouin kindred suffering from Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease. We hypothesized that the N terminus of pro-EMAP II has an important role in the regulation of protein-protein interactions. Using a GFP reporter system, we defined a putative leucine zipper in the N terminus of human pro-EMAP II protein (amino acid residues 1-70) that can form specific strip-like punctate structures. Through GFP punctum analysis, we uncovered that the pro-EMAP II C terminus (amino acids 147-312) can repress GFP punctum formation. Pulldown assays confirmed that the binding between the pro-EMAP II N terminus and its C terminus is mediated by a putative leucine zipper. Furthermore, the pro-EMAP II 1-70 amino acid region was identified as the binding partner of arginyl-tRNA synthetase, a polypeptide of the multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex. We also determined that the punctate GFP pro-EMAP II 1-70 amino acid aggregate colocalizes and binds to the neurofilament light subunit protein that is associated with pathologic neurofilament network disorganization and degeneration of motor neurons. These findings indicate the structure and binding interaction of pro-EMAP II protein and suggest a role of this protein in pathological neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2060233475,"Accurately mapping and monitoring glacier changes over decades is important for providing information to support sustainable use of water resource in arid regions of northwest China. Since 1970, glaciers in the Eastern Altun Mountains showed remarkable recession. Further study is indispensable to indicate the extent and amplitude of glacial change at basin and individual glacier scale. In this study, spatiotemporal glacier changes referring to the year 1972, 1990, 2000 and 2010 were studied for the Eastern Altun Mountains using Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ images and glacier volume-area scaling. The results demonstrated that the total area and volume of glaciers in EAMs decreased significantly by 10.70±0.57 km² (19.56±10.41%) and 0.61±0.03 km³ (23.19±11.40%) during 1972–2010, respectively. More than half of the total receding area occurred during 1990–2000, primarily due to higher temperature increasing. However, varied response of individual glaciers indicated that glacier change was also affected by glacier dynamics, which was related to local topography. In addition, five glaciers unrecorded in the glacier inventory of China were reported in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2033061710,"Young drivers are overrepresented in collisions resulting in fatalities. It is not uncommon for young drivers to socially binge drink and decide to drive a vehicle a few hours after consumption. To better understand the risks that may be associated with this behaviour, the present study has examined the effects of a social drinking bout followed by a simulated drive in undergraduate students on the descending limb of their BAC (blood alcohol concentration) curve. Two groups of eight undergraduate students (n = 16) took part in this study. Participants in the alcohol group were assessed before drinking, then at moderate and low BAC as well as 24 hours post-acute consumption. This group consumed an average of 5.3 ± 1.4 (mean ± SD) drinks in an hour in a social context and were then submitted to a driving and a predicted crash risk assessment. The control group was assessed at the same time points without alcohol intake or social context.; at 8 a.m., noon, 3 p.m. and 8 a.m. the next morning. These multiple time points were used to measure any potential learning effects from the assessment tools (i.e. driving simulator and useful field of view test (UFOV)). Diminished driving performance at moderate BAC was observed with no increases in predicted crash risk. Moderate correlations between driving variables were observed. No association exists between driving variables and UFOV variables. The control group improved measures of selective attention after the third asessement. No learning effect was observed from multiple sessions with the driving simulator. Our results show that a moderate BAC, although legal, increases the risky behaviour. Effects of alcohol expectancy could have been displayed by the experimental group. UFOV measures and predicted crash risk categories were not sentitive enough to predict crash risk for young drivers, even when intoxicated."
