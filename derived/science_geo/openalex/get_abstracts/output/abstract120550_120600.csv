https://openalex.org/W2044247083,"Group I self-splicing introns catalyze their own excision from precursor RNAs by way of a two-step transesterification reaction. The catalytic core of these ribozymes is formed by two structural domains. The 2.8-angstrom crystal structure of one of these, the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila intron, is described. In the 160-nucleotide domain, a sharp bend allows stacked helices of the conserved core to pack alongside helices of an adjacent region. Two specific long-range interactions clamp the two halves of the domain together: a two-Mg2+-coordinated adenosine-rich corkscrew plugs into the minor groove of a helix, and a GAAA hairpin loop binds to a conserved 11-nucleotide internal loop. Metal- and ribose-mediated backbone contacts further stabilize the close side-by-side helical packing. The structure indicates the extent of RNA packing required for the function of large ribozymes, the spliceosome, and the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W2153564253,"A PARADOX that exists in auditory and electrosensory neural systems1,2 is that they encode behaviourally relevant signals in the range of a few microseconds with neurons that are at least one order of magnitude slower. The importance of temporal coding in neural information processing is not clear yet3–8. A central question is whether neuronal firing can be more precise than the time constants of the neuronal processes involved9. Here we address this problem using the auditory system of the barn owl as an example. We present a modelling study based on computer simulations of a neuron in the laminar nucleus. Three observations explain the paradox. First, spiking of an 'integrate-and-fire' neuron driven by excitatory postsynaptic potentials with a width at half-maximum height of 250 μs, has an accuracy of 25 μs if the presynaptic signals arrive coherently. Second, the necessary degree of coherence in the signal arrival times can be attained during ontogenetic development by virtue of an unsupervised hebbian learning rule. Learning selects connections with matching delays from a broad distribution of axons with random delays. Third, the learning rule also selects the correct delays from two independent groups of inputs, for example, from the left and right ear."

https://openalex.org/W2042670053,"Members of a previously unidentified family of potassium channel subunits were cloned from rat and human brain. The messenger RNAs encoding these subunits were widely expressed in brain with distinct yet overlapping patterns, as well as in several peripheral tissues. Expression of the messenger RNAs in Xenopus oocytes resulted in calcium-activated, voltage-independent potassium channels. The channels that formed from the various subunits displayed differential sensitivity to apamin and tubocurare. The distribution, function, and pharmacology of these channels are consistent with the SK class of small-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels, which contribute to the afterhyperpolarization in central neurons and other cell types."

https://openalex.org/W1986342078,"Secretion of proteins is initiated by their uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which possesses a proteolytic system able to degrade misfolded and nonassembled proteins. The ER degradation system was studied with yeast mutants defective in the breakdown of a mutated soluble vacuolar protein, carboxypeptidase yscY (CPY*). The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p participated in the degradation process, which was mediated by the cytosolic 26S proteasome. It is likely that CPY* entered the ER, was glycosylated, and was then transported back out of the ER lumen to the cytoplasmic side of the organelle, where it was conjugated with ubiquitin and degraded."

https://openalex.org/W2074538830,"A ""response window"" technique is described and used to reliably demonstrate unconscious activation of meaning by subliminal (visually masked) words. Visually masked prime words were shown to influence judged meaning of following target words. This priming-effect marker was used to identify two additional markers of unconscious semantic activation: (i) the activation is very short-lived (the target word must occur within about 100 milliseconds of the subliminal prime); and (ii) unlike supraliminal prime-target pairs, a subliminal pair leaves no memory trace that can be observed in response to the next prime-target pair. Thus, unconscious semantic activation is shown to be a readily reproducible phenomenon but also very limited in the duration of its effect."

https://openalex.org/W2133889652,"Two tandem Netrin genes in Drosophila are expressed at the midline of the developing CNS and in different subsets of neurons, muscles, and epidermal patches. In embryos carrying a small deficiency that deletes both genes, CNS axon commissures are partially missing or thinner. This phenotype is rescued by expressing either Netrin gene at the midline. Pan-neural expression of either gene causes disruption of commissural and longitudinal tracts, indicating that the pattern of Netrin expression is crucial and that Netrins function as instructive cues. The double mutant also shows defects in motor axon projections. Expression of either Netrin gene in all muscles also results in aberrant motor projections. Thus, Drosophila Netrins are required for the guidance of commissural axons at the midline, and of motor axons to their target muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2013036001,"STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are phosphorylated by Janus kinases in response to cytokines. Phosphorylated STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they transiently turn on specific sets of cytokine-inducible genes. The mechanism that controls the amounts of activated STAT proteins is not understood. STAT1 proteins activated by interferon-gamma treatment in HeLa cells were shown to be stabilized by a proteasome inhibitor and ubiquitinated in vivo. Thus, the amount of activated STAT1 may be negatively regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2077706363,"Synapse-associated proteins (SAPs) are constituents of the pre- and postsynaptic submembraneous cytomatrix. Here, we present SAP102, a novel 102kDa SAP detected in dendritic shafts and spines of asymmetric type 1 synapses. SAP102 is enriched in preparations of synaptic junctions, where it biochemically behaves as a component of the cortical cytoskeleton. Antibodies directed against NMDA receptors coimmunoprecipitate SAP102 from rat brain synaptosomes. Recombinant proteins containing the carboxy-terminal tail of NMDA receptor subunit NR2B interact with SAP102 from rat brain homogenates. All three PDZ domains in SAP102 bind the cytoplasmic tail of NR2B in vitro. These data represent direct evidence that in vivo SAP102 is involved in linking NMDA receptors to the submembraneous cytomatrix associated with postsynaptic densities at excitatory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2061603242,"Transient elevations of intracellular Ca2+ levels play critical roles in neuronal development, but such elevations have not been demonstrated in migrating neurons. Here, we show that the amplitude and frequency components of Ca2+ fluctuations are correlated positively with the rate of granule cell movement in cerebellar microexplant cultures. Moreover, depression of the amplitude and frequency components of Ca2+ fluctuations by blockade of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane results in a reversible retardation of cell movement. These results indicate that the combination of amplitude and frequency components of intracellular Ca2+ fluctuations may provide an intracellular signal controlling the rate of neuronal cell migration."

https://openalex.org/W2076682664,"We show that GGF/neuregulin is a mitogen for prooligodendrocytes (O4+/O1- cells), oligodendrocytes (O4+/O1+ cells), and type-2 astrocytes. Heregulin beta 1, another neuregulin isoform, is also mitogenic. The proliferative effect of glial growth factor (GGF) does not require, but is greatly potentiated by, serum factors. GGF also promotes the survival of pro-oligodendrocytes under serum-free conditions. High levels of GGF reversibly inhibit the differentiation and lineage commitment of oligodendrocyte progenitors and, in differentiated cultures, result in loss of O1 and myelin basic protein expression. All three erbB receptors are expressed by progenitors and are activated by GGF; the relative abundance of these receptors changes during differentiation. Finally, cortical neurons release a soluble mitogen for pro-oligodendrocytes that is specifically blocked by antibodies to GGF. These results implicate the neuregulins in the neuronal regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation, survival, and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1968544303,"The formation of intrapulmonary immune complexes in mice generates a vigorous inflammatory response characterized by microvascular permeability and polymorphonuclear neutrophil influx. Gene-targeted disruption of the substance P receptor (NK-1R) protected the lung from immune complex injury, as did disruption of the C5a anaphylatoxin receptor. Immunoreactive substance P was measurable in fluids lining the lung at time points before neutrophil influx and may thus be involved in an early step in the inflammatory response to immune complexes in the lung."

https://openalex.org/W2060943078,"Netrins are chemotropic guidance signals that play important roles in circumferential axon guidance in C. elegans and in the developing vertebrate spinal cord. We have identified two Drosophila homologs of this protein family (Netrin-A and Netrin-B). Both Netrins are dynamically expressed throughout embryogenesis, including CNS midline expression at the time of commissure formation. Both Netrin genes map close to each other on the X chromosome, and embryos deficient for this region exhibit defects in commissure formation. This CNS phenotype can be rescued by expression of either Netrin at the CNS midline, confirming an important role for Drosophila Netrins in commissural growth cone guidance. A localized source of Netrin protein at the midline is apparently important for function, since ectopic expression of either Netrin throughout the CNS results in phenotypic defects similar to the loss-of-function phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2031214064,"The mammalian splicing factor U2AF65 binds to the polypyrimidine tract adjacent to the 3' splice site and promotes assembly of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein on the upstream branch point, an interaction that involves base pairing with U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). U2AF65 contains an RNA binding domain, required for interaction with the polypyrimidine tract, and an arginine-serine-rich (RS) region, required for U2 snRNP recruitment and splicing. Here it is reported that binding of U2AF65 to the polypyrimidine tract directed the RS domain to contact the branch point and promoted U2 snRNA-branch point base pairing even in the absence of other splicing factors. Analysis of RS domain mutants indicated that the ability of U2AF65 to contact the branch point, to promote the U2 snRNA-branch point interaction, and to support splicing are related activities, requiring only a few basic amino acids. Thus, the U2AF65 RS domain plays a direct role in modulating spliceosomal RNA-RNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2130410346,"Memory distortions and illusions have been thoroughly documented in psychological studies, but little is known about the neuroanatomical correlates of true and false memories. Vivid but illusory memories can be induced by asking people whether they recall or recognize words that were not previously presented, but are semantically related to other previously presented words. We used positron emission tomography to compare brain regions involved in veridical recognition of printed words that were heard several minutes earlier and illusory recognition of printed words that had not been heard earlier. Veridical and illusory recognition were each associated with blood flow increases in a left medial temporal region previously implicated in episodic memory; veridical recognition was distinguished by additional blood flow increases in a left temporoparietal region previously implicated in the retention of auditory/phonological information. This study reveals similarities and differences in the way the brain processes accurate and illusory memories."

https://openalex.org/W1984528002,"The structure of the NMDA receptor channel M2 segment was investigated by probing the extracellular and cytoplasmic faces of cysteine-substituted NR1-NR2C channels with charged sulfhydryl-specific reagents. The pattern of accessible positions suggests that the M2 segment forms a channel-lining loop originating and ending on the cytoplasmic side of the channel, with the ascending limb in an alpha-helical structure and the descending limb in an extended structure. A functionally critical asparagine (N-site) is positioned at the tip of the loop, and a cluster of hydrophilic residues of the descending limb, adjacent to the tip, forms the narrow constriction of the channel. An apparent asymmetric positioning of the NR1- and NR2-subunit N-site asparagines may account for their unequal role in Ca2+ permeability and Mg2+ block."
https://openalex.org/W2067699039,"Slow-wave sleep as well as generalized absence seizures are characterized by the occurrence of synchronized oscillations in thalamocortical systems that spontaneously appear and disappear. The spontaneous appearance of synchronized oscillations results from the initiation by one or a small number of cells followed by the progressive recruitment of large numbers of neighboring neurons into the synchronized network activity. Synchronized network oscillations representative of slow-wave sleep, as well as absence seizures, were demonstrated to cease spontaneously at least in part through the persistent activation of a hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance. Block of this conductance resulted in oscillations that, once generalized, occur continuously. These results indicate that the persistent activation of a hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance is a key mechanism through which synchronized oscillations in thalamocortical networks normally terminate."
https://openalex.org/W1988877517,"Peripheral nerve injury results in axonal degeneration and in phenotypic changes of the surrounding Schwann cells, whose presence is critical for nerve regeneration. Using differential screening strategies, we identified a novel protein, termed ninjurin (for nerve injury–induced protein), that is up-regulated after axotomy in neurons and in Schwann cells surrounding the distal nerve segment. Ninjurin is located on the cell surface, is capable of mediating homophilic adhesion, and promotes neurite extension of dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro. Ninjurin is also expressed in a number of other tissues, predominantly in epithelial cells. These results suggest that ninjurin plays a role in nerve regeneration and in the formation and function of other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2047131896,"Anandamide is an endogenous ligand for central cannabinoid receptors and is released after neuronal depolarization. Anandamide increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in rat hippocampal slices and neurons in culture. The action of anandamide resulted from the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. One of the proteins phosphorylated in response to anandamide was an isoform of pp125-focal adhesion kinase (FAK+) expressed preferentially in neurons. Focal adhesion kinase is a tyrosine kinase involved in the interactions between the integrins and actin-based cytoskeleton. Thus, anandamide may exert neurotrophic effects and play a role in synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1994478080,"Progress through the cell cycle is governed by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), the activation of which requires phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In vertebrates, CAK is a trimeric enzyme containing CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1. CAK from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was identified as an unusual 44-kilodalton protein kinase, Cak1, that is only distantly related to CDKs. Cak1 accounted for most CAK activity in yeast cell lysates, and its activity was constant throughout the cell cycle. The CAK1 gene was essential for cell viability. Thus, the major CAK in S. cerevisiae is distinct from the vertebrate enzyme, suggesting that budding yeast and vertebrates may have evolved different mechanisms of CDK activation."

https://openalex.org/W1995433356,"Protein import into nuclei is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and by cellular factors. To structurally characterize this process, nuclear import of gold-labeled nucleoplasmin was followed by electron microscopy to identify NPC components interacting with the import ligand complex in vivo. Before translocation into the nucleus, nucleoplasmin sequentially bound to two distinct regions: first to the distal part of the cytoplasmic filaments and then at the cytoplasmic entry to the central gated channel. Evidence that the delivery of the import ligand from the first to the second binding region occurred by bending of the cytoplasmic filaments is presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2097955186,"Native fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) function was inhibited in developing Xenopus retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by in vivo transfection of a dominant negative FGFR. Axons expressing the dominant negative protein advanced at 60% of the normal speed, but nevertheless navigated appropriately in the embryonic optic pathway. When they neared the optic tectum, however, many axons made erroneous turns, causing them to bypass rather than enter their target. By contrast, RGC axons expressing nonfunctional FGFR mutants entered the tectum correctly. These findings demonstrate a role for FGFR signaling in the extension and targeting of RGC axons and suggest that receptor tyrosine kinase/growth factor interactions play a critical function in establishing initial connectivity in the vertebrate visual system."

https://openalex.org/W2041538618,"The transition from sleep to waking is associated with the abolition of spindle waves in thalamocortical neurons and the GABAergic cells of the thalamic reticular/perigeniculate nuclei. We tested the possibility that norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) may abolish spindle wave generation through an enhancement of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih in thalamocortical neurons. Local application of agents known to enhance Ih, including 5-HT, NE, the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, and the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, to lamina A1 of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus resulted in an abolition of local spindle wave generation in thalamocortical neurons. The abolition of spindle waves was reversed by the local application of the Ih channel blocker, cesium. These results suggest that NE and 5-HT may abolish the generation of spindle waves through the modulation of Ih in thalamocortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2006874662,"The cortical F-actin cytoskeleton represents a negative control for secretion, and it must be locally disassembled to allow chromaffin vesicle exocytosis. Recombinant scinderin (a Ca2+-dependent F-actin-severing protein) potentiated Ca2+-evoked F-actin disassembly and exocytosis in permeabilized chromaffin cells, an effect blocked by peptides Sc-ABP1 and Sc-ABP2 (with sequences corresponding to two actin-binding sites of scinderin), exogenous γ-actin, or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP2 effect was blocked by peptide Sc-PIP2BP (with sequence corresponding to a PIP2-binding site of scinderin). Truncated scinderin254–715 (lacking actin-severing domains) did not potentiate exocytosis. Sc-ABP1, Sc-ABP2, and γ-actin also inhibited exocytosis in the absence of recombinant scinderin, suggesting an inhibition of endogenous scinderin. Results suggest that scinderin-evoked cortical F-actin disassembly is required for secretion and that scinderin is an important component of the exocytotic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1978069267,"Nucleic acid triplexes are formed by sequence-specific interactions between single-stranded polynucleotides and the double helix. These triplexes are implicated in genetic recombination in vivo and have application to areas that include genome analysis and antigene therapy. Despite the importance of the triple helix, only limited high-resolution structural information is available. The x-ray crystal structure of the oligonucleotide d(GGCCAATTGG) is described; it was designed to contain the d(G middle dotGC)2 fragment and thus provide the basic repeat unit of a DNA triple helix. Parameters derived from this crystal structure have made it possible to construct models of both parallel and antiparallel triple helices."
https://openalex.org/W2047213268,"Light adaptation is thought to be orchestrated by a Ca2+ feedback signal that desensitizes the response by speeding recovery. To evaluate the role of Ca2+ in adaptation, we compared the effect of lowered Ca2+ on response properties in darkness and during adaptation. Internal Ca2+ was reduced from its normal resting dark level (535 nM) by either background illumination or exposure to Ringer's solution containing low Ca2+ and/or cyclic GMP-gated channel blockers in darkness. Ca2+ reductions in light decreased the activation gain of the transduction process and speeded recovery kinetics, while equivalent Ca2+ reductions in darkness caused similar gain reduction without accelerating recovery. This indicates that adaptational changes in the response are not due purely to feedback effects on recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2078284878,"In cerebellar long-term depression (LTD), conjunctive stimulation of parallel and climbing fiber inputs to a Purkinje neuron (PN) results in a selective depression of parallel fiber–PN synaptic strength. A similar phenomenon may be induced in the cultured PN when glutamate pulses and PN depolarization, which mimic the effects of parallel and climbing fibers, respectively, are coapplied. Here, we show that LTD can be induced in two very reduced preparations of the postsynaptic neuron; an acutely dissociated preparation and a perforated outside-out macropatch of dendritic membrane. LTD in these preparations retains properties of that seen in an intact cultured PN in that it is not induced by either glutamate pulses or depolarization alone and requires calcium influx, mGluR activation, and PKC activation for induction. As both of these preparations lack dendritic spine compartments, these findings suggest that the associative nature of LTD induction does not require this level of morphological organization."
