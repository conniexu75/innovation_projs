https://openalex.org/W2099381753,"We report the three-dimensional structure of human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) bound concurrently to its two known ligands. More particularly, we solved the crystal structure of the complex between human FcRn, wild-type human serum albumin (HSA), and a human Fc engineered for improved pharmacokinetics properties (Fc-YTE). The crystal structure of human FcRn bound to wild-type HSA alone is also presented. HSA domain III exhibits an extensive interface of contact with FcRn, whereas domain I plays a lesser role. A molecular explanation for the HSA recycling mechanism is provided with the identification of FcRn His(161) as the only potential direct contributor to the corresponding pH-dependent process. At last, this study also allows an accurate structural definition of residues considered for decades as important to the human IgG/FcRn interaction and reveals Fc His(310) as a significant contributor to pH-dependent binding. Finally, we explain various structural mechanisms by which several Fc mutations (including YTE) result in increased human IgG binding to FcRn. Our study provides an unprecedented relevant understanding of the molecular basis of human Fc interaction with human FcRn."
https://openalex.org/W1983616310,"Bacterially derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates naive B lymphocytes to differentiate into immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting plasma cells. Differentiation of B lymphocytes is characterized by a proliferative phase followed by expansion of the intracellular membrane secretory network to support Ig production. A key question in lymphocyte biology is how naive B cells reprogram metabolism to support de novo lipogenesis necessary for proliferation and expansion of the endomembrane network in response to LPS. We report that extracellularly acquired glucose is metabolized, in part, to support de novo lipogenesis in response to LPS stimulation of splenic B lymphocytes. LPS stimulation leads to increased levels of endogenous ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), and this is accompanied by increased ACLY enzymatic activity. ACLY produces cytosolic acetyl-CoA from mitochondrially derived citrate. Inhibition of ACLY activity in LPS-stimulated B cells with the selective inhibitor 2-hydroxy-N-arylbenzenesulfonamide (compound-9; C-9) blocks glucose incorporation into de novo lipid biosynthesis, including cholesterol, free fatty acids, and neutral and acidic phospholipids. Moreover, inhibition of ACLY activity in splenic B cells results in inhibition of proliferation and defective endomembrane expansion and reduced expression of CD138 and Blimp-1, markers for plasma-like B cell differentiation. ACLY activity is also required for LPS-induced IgM production in CH12 B lymphoma cells. These data demonstrate that ACLY mediates glucose-dependent de novo lipogenesis in response to LPS signaling and identify a role for ACLY in several phenotypic changes that define plasma cell differentiation."

Here we establish an S100A4-dependent link between inflammation and metastatic tumor progression. We found that the acute-phase response proteins serum amyloid A (SAA) 1 and SAA3 are transcriptional targets of S100A4 via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-κB signaling. SAA proteins stimulated the transcription of RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted), G-CSF (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor) and MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase 2), MMP3, MMP9 and MMP13. We have also shown for the first time that SAA stimulate their own transcription as well as that of proinflammatory S100A8 and S100A9 proteins. Moreover, they strongly enhanced tumor cell adhesion to fibronectin, and stimulated migration and invasion of human and mouse tumor cells. Intravenously injected S100A4 protein induced expression of SAA proteins and cytokines in an organ-specific manner. In a breast cancer animal model, ectopic expression of SAA1 or SAA3 in tumor cells potently promoted widespread metastasis formation accompanied by a massive infiltration of immune cells. Furthermore, coordinate expression of S100A4 and SAA in tumor samples from colorectal carcinoma patients significantly correlated with reduced overall survival. These data show that SAA proteins are effectors for the metastasis-promoting functions of S100A4, and serve as a link between inflammation and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2018995978,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulate cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)]c) signaling, but the exact role of the IP3 receptors (IP3R) in this process remains unclear. IP3Rs serve as a potential target of ROS produced by both ER and mitochondrial enzymes, which might locally expose IP3Rs at the ER-mitochondrial associations. Also, IP3Rs contain multiple reactive thiols, common molecular targets of ROS. Therefore, we have examined the effect of superoxide anion (O2) on IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) signaling. In human HepG2, rat RBL-2H3, and chicken DT40 cells, we observed [Ca(2+)]c spikes and frequency-modulated oscillations evoked by a O2 donor, xanthine (X) + xanthine oxidase (XO), dose-dependently. The [Ca(2+)]c signal was mediated by ER Ca(2+) mobilization. X+XO added to permeabilized cells promoted the [Ca(2+)]c rise evoked by submaximal doses of IP3, indicating that O2 directly sensitizes IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) release. In response to X+XO, DT40 cells lacking two of three IP3R isoforms (DKO) expressing either type 1 (DKO1) or type 2 IP3Rs (DKO2) showed a [Ca(2+)]c signal, whereas DKO expressing type 3 IP3R (DKO3) did not. By contrast, IgM that stimulates IP3 formation, elicited a [Ca(2+)]c signal in every DKO. X+XO also facilitated the Ca(2+) release evoked by submaximal IP3 in permeabilized DKO1 and DKO2 but was ineffective in DKO3 or in DT40 lacking every IP3R (TKO). However, X+XO could also facilitate the effect of suboptimal IP3 in TKO transfected with rat IP3R3. Although in silico studies failed to identify a thiol missing in the chicken IP3R3, an X+XO-induced redox change was documented only in the rat IP3R3. Thus, ROS seem to specifically sensitize IP3Rs through a thiol group(s) within the IP3R, which is probably inaccessible in the chicken IP3R3."

https://openalex.org/W1968162784,"Progesterone and estrogen are important drivers of breast cancer proliferation. Herein, we probed estrogen receptor-α (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) cross-talk in breast cancer models. Stable expression of PR-B in PR-low/ER+ MCF7 cells increased cellular sensitivity to estradiol and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), as measured in growth assays performed in the absence of exogenous progestin; similar results were obtained in PR-null/ER+ T47D cells stably expressing PR-B. Genome-wide microarray analyses revealed that unliganded PR-B induced robust expression of a subset of estradiol-responsive ER target genes, including cathepsin-D (CTSD). Estradiol-treated MCF7 cells stably expressing PR-B exhibited enhanced ER Ser167 phosphorylation and recruitment of ER, PR and the proline-, glutamate- and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) to an estrogen response element in the CTSD distal promoter; this complex co-immunoprecipitated with IGF1 receptor (IGFR1) in whole-cell lysates. Importantly, ER/PR/PELP1 complexes were also detected in human breast cancer samples. Inhibition of IGF1R or phosphoinositide 3-kinase blocked PR-B-dependent CTSD mRNA upregulation in response to estradiol. Similarly, inhibition of IGF1R or PR significantly reduced ER recruitment to the CTSD promoter. Stable knockdown of endogenous PR or onapristone treatment of multiple unmodified breast cancer cell lines blocked estradiol-mediated CTSD induction, inhibited growth in soft agar and partially restored tamoxifen sensitivity of resistant cells. Further, combination treatment of breast cancer cells with both onapristone and IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor AEW541 was more effective than either agent alone. In summary, unliganded PR-B enhanced proliferative responses to estradiol and IGF1 via scaffolding of ER-α/PELP1/IGF1R-containing complexes. Our data provide a strong rationale for targeting PR in combination with ER and IGF1R in patients with luminal breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1981089896,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential step for tumor progression, although the mechanisms driving EMT are still not fully understood. In an effort to investigate these mechanisms, we observed that heregulin (HRG)-mediated activation of HER2, or HER2 overexpression, resulted in EMT, which is accompanied with increased expression of a known EMT regulator Slug, but not TWIST or Snail. We then investigated how HER2 induced Slug expression and found, for the first time, that there are four consensus HSF sequence-binding elements (HSEs), the binding sites for heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), located in the Slug promoter. HSF-1 bound to and transactivated the Slug promoter independent of heat shock, leading to Slug expression in breast cancer cells. Mutation of the putative HSEs ablated Slug transcriptional activation induced by HRG or HSF-1 overexpression. Knockdown of HSF-1 expression by siRNA reduced Slug expression and HRG-induced EMT. The positive association between HSF-1 and Slug was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of a cohort of 100 invasive breast carcinoma specimens. While investigating how HER2 activated HSF-1 independent of heat shock, we observed that HER2 activation resulted in concurrent phosphorylation of Akt and HSF-1. We then observed, also for the first time, that Akt directly interacted with HSF-1 and phosphorylated HSF-1 at S326. Inhibition of Akt using siRNA, dominant-negative Akt mutant, or small molecule inhibitors prevented HRG-induced HSF-1 activation and Slug expression. Conversely, constitutively active Akt induced HSF-1 phosphorylation and Slug expression. HSF-1 knockdown reduced the ability of Akt to induce Slug expression, indicating an essential role that HSF-1 plays in Akt-induced Slug upregulation. Altogether, our study uncovered the existence of a novel Akt-HSF-1 signaling axis that leads to Slug upregulation and EMT, and potentially contributes to progression of HER2-positive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1969250771,"The tumor suppressor p53, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have crucial roles in tumorigenesis, although the mechanisms of cross talk between these factors remain largely unknown. Here we report that miR-506 upregulation occurs in 83% of lung cancer patients (156 cases), and its expression highly correlates with ROS. Ectopic expression of miR-506 inhibits NF-κB p65 expression, induces ROS accumulation and then activates p53 to suppress lung cancer cell viability, but not in normal cells. Interestingly, p53 promotes miR-506 expression level, indicating that miR-506 mediates cross talk between p53, NF-κB p65 and ROS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-506 mimics inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo, implicating that miR-506 might be a potential therapeutic molecule for selective killing of lung cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036043627,"We studied the role of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the signaling that promotes atrial fibrosis. Left atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) exhibited 4-fold increased hydroxyproline content compared with patients in sinus rhythm. Expression of MR was similar, as was 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2), which also increased. 11β-HSD2 converts cortisol to receptor-inactive metabolites allowing aldosterone occupancy of MR. 11β-HSD2 was up-regulated by arrhythmic pacing in cultured cardiomyocytes and in a mouse model of spontaneous AF (RacET). In cardiomyocytes, aldosterone induced connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the absence but not in the presence of cortisol. Hydroxyproline expression was increased in cardiac fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium from aldosterone-treated cardiomyocytes but not from cardiomyocytes treated with both cortisol and aldosterone. Aldosterone increased connective tissue growth factor and hydroxyproline expression in cardiac fibroblasts, which were prevented by BR-4628, a dihydropyridine-derived selective MR antagonist, and by spironolactone. Aldosterone activated RhoA GTPase. Rho kinase inhibition by Y-27632 prevented CTGF and hydroxyproline, whereas the RhoA activator CN03 increased CTGF expression. Aldosterone and CTGF increased lysyl oxidase, and aldosterone enhanced miR-21 expression. MR antagonists reduced the aldosterone but not the CTGF effect. In conclusion, MR signaling promoted fibrotic remodeling. Increased expression of 11β-HSD2 during AF leads to up-regulation of collagen and pro-fibrotic mediators by aldosterone, specifically RhoA activity as well as CTGF, lysyl oxidase, and microRNA-21 expression. The MR antagonists BR-4628 and spironolactone prevent these alterations.

https://openalex.org/W2051147675,"Collagen content in atherosclerotic plaque is a hallmark of plaque stability. Our earlier studies showed that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) increases collagen content in atherosclerotic plaques of Apoe(-/-) mice. To identify mechanisms we investigated the effect of IGF-1 on the la ribonucleoprotein domain family member 6 (LARP6). LARP6 binds a stem-loop motif in the 5'-UTR of the mRNAs encoding the collagen type I α-subunits (α1(I) and α2(I)), and coordinates their translation into the heterotrimeric collagen type I molecule. In human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs), IGF-1 rapidly increased LARP6 expression and the rate of collagen synthesis and extracellular accumulation. IGF-1 increased both LARP6 and collagen type I expression via a post-transcriptional and translation-dependent mechanism involving PI3K/Akt/p70S6k-signaling. Immunoprecipitation of LARP6, followed by qPCR indicated that IGF-1 increased the level of COL1a1 and COL1a2 mRNA bound to LARP6. Mutation of the 5' stem-loop of Col1a1 mRNA, which inhibits binding of LARP6, abolished the ability of IGF-1 to increase synthesis of collagen type I. Furthermore, overexpression of a 5' stem-loop RNA molecular decoy that sequesters LARP6, prevented the ability of IGF-1 to increase pro-α1(I) and mature α1(I) expression in cultured medium. IGF-1 infusion in Apoe(-/-) mice increased expression of LARP6 and pro-α1(I) in aortic lysates, and SMC-specific IGF-1-overexpression robustly increased collagen fibrillogenesis in atherosclerotic plaque. In conclusion, we identify LARP6 as a critical mediator by which IGF-1 augments synthesis of collagen type I in vascular smooth muscle, which may play an important role in promoting atherosclerotic plaque stability."
https://openalex.org/W2005841680,"Lung adenocarcinoma is comprised of distinct mutational subtypes characterized by mutually exclusive oncogenic mutations in RTK/RAS pathway members KRAS, EGFR, BRAF and ERBB2, and translocations involving ALK, RET and ROS1. Identification of these oncogenic events has transformed the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma via application of therapies targeted toward specific genetic lesions in stratified patient populations. However, such mutations have been reported in only ∼55% of lung adenocarcinoma cases in the United States, suggesting other mechanisms of malignancy are involved in the remaining cases. Here we report somatic mutations in the small GTPase gene RIT1 in ∼2% of lung adenocarcinoma cases that cluster in a hotspot near the switch II domain of the protein. RIT1 switch II domain mutations are mutually exclusive with all other known lung adenocarcinoma driver mutations. Ectopic expression of mutated RIT1 induces cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo, which can be reversed by combined PI3K and MEK inhibition. These data identify RIT1 as a driver oncogene in a specific subset of lung adenocarcinomas and suggest PI3K and MEK inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy in RIT1-mutated tumors."

In the present study, we investigated the global 5-hmC content, the effects of IL-1β and TNF-α on 5-hmC content, and the expression and activity of TETs and isocitrate dehydrogenases in primary human chondrocytes. The global 5-hmC content was found to be ∼0.1% of the total genome. There was a significant decrease in the levels of 5-hmC and the TET enzyme activity upon treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1β alone or in combination with TNF-α. We observed a dramatic (10–20-fold) decrease in the levels of TET1 mRNA expression and a small increase (2–3-fold) in TET3 expression in chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β and TNF-α. IL-1β and TNF-α significantly suppressed the activity and expression of IDHs, which correlated with the reduced α-ketoglutarate levels. Whole genome profiling showed an erasure effect of IL-1β and TNF-α, resulting in a significant decrease in hydroxymethylation in a myriad of genes including many genes that are important in chondrocyte physiology. Our data demonstrate that DNA hydroxymethylation is modulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines via suppression of the cytosine hydroxymethylation machinery.

The second challenge for regulation of Arp2/3 is to ensure that these ensembles of molecules are co-localized with subcellular spatial fidelity. Potentially, actin nucleation at the ZA entails a form of coincident regulation (12Carlton J.G. Cullen P.J.

However, these interactions do not appear to be constitutive, as they are lost when cadherins are not engaged in homophilic adhesion (14Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S.

This implies that other mechanisms may exist to coordinate the elements of the actin nucleation apparatus with E-cadherin at the ZA. In this study, we examine the potential role for the scaffolding protein, cortactin, to support coincident regulation of Arp2/3 at the ZA. Cortactin is a multidomain protein whose acidic N terminus can directly bind to, and activate, Arp2/3 (1Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T.

Cortactin also contributes to other steps associated with Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly (16Ammer A.G. Weed S.A. Cortactin branches out: roles in regulating protrusive actin dynamics.Cell Motil.

Previously, we reported that cortactin can form a complex with cadherin and contribute to cadherin-based actin regulation (15Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Paterson A.D. Verma S. Ali R.G. Fanning A.S.

We now demonstrate that cortactin integrates inputs from E-cadherin and N-WASP to localize selectively to the ZA, where it promotes actin nucleation by scaffolding both Arp2/3 and WAVE2 to the ZA cortex, through distinct binding interactions. Caco-2 cells were cultured in RPMI complete growth media and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (both from Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for plasmids or siRNAs, respectively. N-WASP KD cells were generated using lentiviral transduction and have been previously described (10Kovacs E.M. Verma S. Ali R.G. Ratheesh A. Hamilton N.A. Akhmanova A. Yap A.S.

Briefly, shRNA against human cortactin (5′-GAGAAGCACGAGTCACAGA-3′) and human cortactin containing four silent mutations within the target sequence were cloned into a pLL5.0 vector carrying an enhanced GFP reporter gene. The shRNA was cloned downstream of a U6 promoter, whereas the RNAi-resistant cortactin sequence was cloned downstream of an LTR promoter and upstream of the enhanced GFP gene. This resulted in simultaneous knockdown of endogenous cortactin and expression of RNAi-resistant cortactin-GFP at levels suitable for imaging. Cortactin mutant constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene kit or by cloning of truncated cortactin sequences into the vector. WAVE2-GFP was described previously (6Verma S. Han S.P. Michael M. Gomez G.A. Yang Z. Teasdale R.D. Ratheesh A. Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. Yap A.S.

Arp3-GFP was a kind gift from Matt Welch. mRFP-PAGFP-Arp3 was made from the Arp3-GFP plasmid by replacing GFP with the mRFP-PAGFP fragment from mRFP-PAGFP-actin. Plasmids for mammalian expression of human β-catenin-GFP and human cortactin-GFP were obtained by cloning the corresponding cDNA into pEGFP-N1 vectors (Clontech). Similarly, murine E-cadherin-Cherry was obtained by cloning the murine Ecad cDNA (20Smutny M. Wu S.K. Gomez G.A. Mangold S. Yap A.S. Hamilton N.A.

Primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: mouse monoclonal against cortactin (4F11, a kind gift from S. Weed, West Virginia University; 1:1000 for immunofluorescence (IF) and 1:1000 for Western blot (WB)); rabbit polyclonal raised against E-cadherin (1:1000 IF and 1:2000 WB); mouse monoclonal HECD-1 against E-cadherin (1:50 IF and 1:100 WB, a kind gift from P. Wheelock, University of Nebraska, with permission of M. Takeichi); mouse monoclonal against Arp3 subunit of Arp2/3 complex (Sigma, 1:50 IF and 1:400 WB); rabbit polyclonal raised against p34 subunit of Arp2/3 complex (1:1000 IF); rabbit polyclonal against GAPDH (R&D Systems, 1:2000 WB); rabbit polyclonal against GFP (Molecular Probes, 1:1000 WB); rabbit polyclonal against WAVE2 (Cell Signaling, 1:50 IF and 1:2000 WB); rabbit polyclonal against N-WASP (Cell Signaling, 1:50 IF and 1:1000 WB); rabbit polyclonal against dsRED/mCherry (Clontech, 1:1000 WB); rabbit polyclonal against Nap1 (Sigma, 1:50 IF and 1:1000 WB); and mouse monoclonal against Abi1 (Abcam, 1:100 IF, 1:1000 WB). Secondary antibodies were species-specific antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor 488, 594, or 647 (Invitrogen) for immunofluorescence or with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) for immunoblotting. F-actin was stained using Alexa488- or 594-phalloidin (Invitrogen, 1:500). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Immunoprecipitations were performed using ∼1 μg of total protein, to which 2 μg of antibody and 20 μl of packed slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) or 15 μl of GFP-Trap coupled to agarose beads (Chromotek) were added. Protein complexes were dissociated from beads, and samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in cytoskeletal stabilization buffer (10 mm PIPES at pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2) on ice for 10 min. Fixed coverslips were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Confocal images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM710 microscope and processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), Imaris (Bitplane), or Photoshop (Adobe). Quantitative analysis of staining intensity at contacts was performed in ImageJ with the line scan function (7Smutny M. Cox H.L. Leerberg J.M. Kovacs E.M. Conti M.A. Ferguson C. Hamilton N.A.

Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, a line of 40 pixels in length was selected centered on and perpendicular to a contact. The PlotProfile feature was used to record the pixel intensities along the selected line, which were corrected for background and used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the maximum pixel intensity. Barbed ends were labeled by G-actin incorporation (10Kovacs E.M. Verma S. Ali R.G. Ratheesh A. Hamilton N.A. Akhmanova A. Yap A.S.

Confluent monolayers of Caco-2 cells were permeabilized with saponin for 7 min in the presence of 0.45 μm Alexa594-tagged G-actin to favor barbed end incorporation. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in cytoskeletal stabilization buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 and Alexa488-phalloidin (1:500). In vitro translation was performed as described previously (21Kovtun O. Mureev S. Jung W. Kubala M.H. Johnston W. Alexandrov K. Leishmania cell-free protein expression system.Methods. 2011; 55: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Proteins of interest were cloned into a derivative of the pLTE vector carrying T7 promoter and species-independent translation initiation sequences as well as His or fluorescent protein tags (22Mureev S. Kovtun O. Nguyen U.T. Alexandrov K. Species-independent translational leaders facilitate cell-free expression.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The vectors included recombination sites compatible with Gateway cloning system (Clontech). 3D. Gagoski, S. Mureev, Y. Gambin, N. Giles, J. Johnston, M. Dahmer-Heath, D. Škalamera, T. J. Gonda, and K. Alexandrov, manuscript in preparation. This allowed rapid cloning of genes of interest and in vitro synthesis of tagged gene products used for subsequent single molecule coincidence analysis, AlphaScreen, or pulldown experiments. Expressed proteins were fluorescently labeled during synthesis by random incorporation of BODIPY-Lys (1:250, Promega), then resolved on a 4–25% Tris/glycine gel, and visualized using a fluorescent scanner (Typhoon, GE Healthcare). Single molecule fluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (23Gambin Y. Schug A. Lemke E.A. Lavinder J.J. Ferreon A.C. Magliery T.J. Onuchic J.N. Deniz A.A.

Methods. 2011; 8: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, GFP- and mCherry-tagged proteins were co-expressed in vitro for 3 h and diluted to a single molecule concentration (∼100 pm) immediately before measurement. For each experiment, 20 μl of sample were placed into a custom-made silicone 192-well plate equipped with a 70 × 80-mm glass coverslip (ProSciTech). Plates were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM710 microscope with a Confocor3 module at room temperature. For coincidence experiments, two lasers (488 and 561 nm) were focused in solution using a 40 × 1.2 NA water immersion objective. Fluorescence was collected and separated using a 565-nm dichroic mirror; the signal from GFP was filtered by a 505–540 bandpass filter, and fluorescence from mCherry was filtered by a 580-nm long pass filter. The fluorescence of the two channels was recorded simultaneously and separately, adding the number of photons collected in 1-ms time bins. A single molecule event was detected when the total intensity of the two channels was above a threshold of 80 photons. For each event, the intensities of the GFP and mCherry bursts were corrected for background and GFP fluorescence bleed through (10% of the GFP signal into the mCherry channel). The coincidence ratio C was then measured ratiometrically as the corrected mCherry signal, divided by the total intensity of the burst. In the absence of mCherry fluorescence, C is close to zero, and in the absence of GFP, C tends toward 1. Events with 0.25 < C < 0.75 are considered coincident events. Single molecule coincidence histograms were plotted by measuring >1000 events per interaction and were fitted by gaussian peaks for GFP-only, coincidence, and mCherry-only contributions. The bound fraction was calculated as the proportion of coincidence to total events. FCS was performed using the Zeiss710 microscope and the Confocor3 software. The 488-nm laser was used at low power to reduce bleaching and triplet contributions. The FCS measurements were calibrated using Alexa488 dye, and the setup was aligned until the structural parameter S was strictly less than 10. This ensured accurate fitting of the FCS curves by purely diffusive components. The calibration was further performed with GFP and GFP-mCherry tandem proteins, and the increases in diffusion times were consistent with the increase of physical size of the diffusing object. To perform these measurements, the individually expressed proteins were diluted to 10 nm concentration in cell-free lysate to take into account possible viscosity effects. We found that the diffusions of individually expressed GFP-EcadTail, GFP-β-catenin, and GFP-cortactin were consistent with the calibration of diffusion times, with GFP-Ecadtail diffusing faster than the tandem but slower than GFP. To measure the potential effect of binding, GFP-EcadTail was co-expressed with unlabeled β-catenin or cortactin, and the co-expression was diluted in lysate expressing unlabeled β-catenin or cortactin. This ensures that the proteins have undiluted binding partners to maximize association. We estimate that the cell-free system produces low micromolar concentrations of the proteins. AlphaScreen was performed using a c-Myc detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mixtures of GFP- and mCherry-Myc-tagged in vitro translated proteins were serially diluted in 0.5 m PBS containing 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. 1.5 μl of sample was incubated with 8.5 μl of water, 2 μl of acceptor beads, and 1.5 μl of biotinylated GFP-nanotrap for 30 min, after which 2 μl of donor beads was added. After another 30-min incubation, samples were analyzed on an EnVision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the signal was corrected for background noise. For competition assays, a 10-fold excess of His-tagged in vitro translated proteins was added prior to dilution. We used Caco-2 cells, which assemble prominent zonulae adherentes within their cell-cell contacts (25Meng W. Mushika Y. Ichii T. Takeichi M.

Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), as a model in which to analyze how cortactin might influence Arp2/3 at junctions. In this system, Arp2/3 is found at cell-cell junctions where it supports actin filament nucleation for the junctional actin cytoskeleton (6Verma S. Han S.P. Michael M. Gomez G.A. Yang Z.

Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the molecular intermediates responsible are not well understood. We first used immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation analysis to assess whether cortactin was a junctional protein in Caco-2 cells, as it is in other cell lines (15Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Paterson A.D. Verma S. Ali R.G. Fanning A.S. Weed S.A. Yap A.S. Cortactin is necessary for E-cadherin-mediated contact formation and actin reorganization.J.

Indeed, we found that cortactin co-localized with Arp2/3 at cadherin junctions in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1, A and B) and co-immunoprecipitated with E-cadherin in these cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, junctional cortactin was reduced when E-cadherin was depleted by RNAi (Fig. 1D); the remaining cortactin staining persisted principally where residual E-cadherin was found, although we cannot exclude a contribution from a nonjunctional cortical pool. Because cortactin can interact directly with Arp2/3 (1Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T.

Cytoskeleton. 2008; 65: 687-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), it therefore appeared an attractive candidate to mediate the recruitment of Arp2/3 to E-cadherin. To test this hypothesis, we infected Caco-2 cells with lentiviral shRNA that reduced cortactin levels by 70–90% (Fig. 2A). Junctional Arp3 staining, used as a marker of the Arp2/3 complex, was substantially reduced in cortactin shRNA (KD) cells (Fig. 2B), without any change in its overall cellular expression (Fig. 2A). This was restored by expression of an shRNA-resistant cortactin transgene (Fig. 2B), confirming that the effects were attributable to cortactin depletion. However, junctional Arp3 was not restored when cortactin KD cells were transfected with a cortactin mutant (W22A) that bears a point mutation in the N-terminal DDW motif (28Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P.

https://openalex.org/W2123453804,"The FERM domain containing protein Kindlin-3 has been recognized as a major regulator of integrin function in hematopoietic cells, but its role in neoplasia is totally unknown. We have examined the relationship between Kindlin-3 and breast cancer in mouse models and human tissues. Human breast tumors showed a ~7-fold elevation in Kindlin-3 mRNA compared with nonneoplastic tissue by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Kindlin-3 overexpression in a breast cancer cell line increased primary tumor growth and lung metastasis by 2.5- and 3-fold, respectively, when implanted into mice compared with cells expressing vector alone. Mechanistically, the Kindlin-3-overexpressing cells displayed a 2.2-fold increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and enhanced β1 integrin activation. Increased VEGF secretion resulted from enhanced production of Twist, a transcription factor that promotes tumor angiogenesis. Knockdown of Twist diminished VEGF production, and knockdown of β1 integrins diminished Twist and VEGF production by Kindlin-3-overexpressing cells, while nontargeting small interfering RNA had no effect on expression of these gene products. Thus, Kindlin-3 influences breast cancer progression by influencing the crosstalk between β1 integrins and Twist to increase VEGF production. This signaling cascade enhances breast cancer cell invasion and tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.—Sossey-Alaoui, K., Pluskota, E., Davuluri, G., Bialkowska, K., Das, M., Szpak, D., Lindner, D.

https://openalex.org/W2010503849,"Molecular subtypes of breast cancer are characterized by distinct patterns of gene expression that are predictive of outcome and response to therapy. The luminal breast cancer subtypes are defined by the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα)-associated genes, many of which are directly responsive to the transcription factor activator protein 2C (TFAP2C). TFAP2C participates in a gene regulatory network controlling cell growth and differentiation during ectodermal development and regulating ESR1/ERα and other luminal cell-associated genes in breast cancer. TFAP2C has been established as a prognostic factor in human breast cancer, however, its role in the establishment and maintenance of the luminal cell phenotype during carcinogenesis and mammary gland development have remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate a critical role for TFAP2C in maintaining the luminal phenotype in human breast cancer and in influencing the luminal cell phenotype during normal mammary development. Knockdown of TFAP2C in luminal breast carcinoma cells induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition with morphological and phenotypic changes characterized by a loss of luminal-associated gene expression and a concomitant gain of basal-associated gene expression. Conditional knockout of the mouse homolog of TFAP2C, Tcfap2c, in mouse mammary epithelium driven by MMTV-Cre promoted aberrant growth of the mammary tree leading to a reduction in the CD24hi/CD49fmid luminal cell population and concomitant gain of the CD24mid/CD49fhi basal cell population at maturity. Our results establish TFAP2C as a key transcriptional regulator for maintaining the luminal phenotype in human breast carcinoma. Furthermore, Tcfap2c influences development of the luminal cell type during mammary development. The data suggest that TFAP2C has an important role in regulated luminal-specific genes and may be a viable therapeutic target in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2113558240,"The membrane-anchored serine protease, matriptase, is consistently dysregulated in a range of human carcinomas, and high matriptase activity correlates with poor prognosis. Furthermore, matriptase is unique among tumor-associated proteases in that epithelial stem cell expression of the protease suffices to induce malignant transformation. Here, we use genetic epistasis analysis to identify proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-2-dependent inflammatory signaling as an essential component of matriptase-mediated oncogenesis. In cell-based assays, matriptase was a potent activator of PAR-2, and PAR-2 activation by matriptase caused robust induction of nuclear factor (NF)κB through Gαi. Importantly, genetic elimination of PAR-2 from mice completely prevented matriptase-induced pre-malignant progression, including inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory cell recruitment, epidermal hyperplasia and dermal fibrosis. Selective ablation of PAR-2 from bone marrow-derived cells did not prevent matriptase-driven pre-malignant progression, indicating that matriptase activates keratinocyte stem cell PAR-2 to elicit its pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic effects. When combined with previous studies, our data suggest that dual induction of PAR-2-NFκB inflammatory signaling and PI3K-Akt-mTor survival/proliferative signaling underlies the transforming potential of matriptase and may contribute to pro-tumorigenic signaling in human epithelial carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2024673806,"Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is abnormally expressed in pancreatic cancer and is associated with disease onset and progression. Inhibition of Shh signaling is thus an attractive clinical target for therapeutic intervention. Most efforts to block Shh signaling have focused on inhibitors of Smoothened, which target the canonical Shh signaling pathway. These approaches have met with limited success, in part due to development of resistance-conferring mutations and contributions from non-canonical signaling pathways. Here, we show that Hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat), the enzyme responsible for the attachment of palmitate onto Shh, is a novel target for inhibition of Shh signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. Depletion of Hhat with lentivirally delivered small hairpin RNA decreased both anchorage-dependent and independent proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells. In vivo, Hhat knockdown led to reduction of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of pancreatic cancer. RU-SKI 43, a small molecule inhibitor of Hhat recently developed by our group, reduced pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and Gli-1 activation through Smoothened-independent non-canonical signaling. In addition, RU-SKI 43 treatment inhibited two key proliferative pathways regulated by Akt and mTOR. This work demonstrates that Hhat has a critical role in pancreatic cancer and that a small molecule inhibitor of Hhat can successfully block pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. It also highlights the importance of developing optimized Hhat inhibitors to be used as therapeutics in pancreatic cancer, as well as in other malignancies characterized by Shh overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2034547555,"Wig-1, also known as ZMAT3, is a p53 target gene that encodes an RNA-binding zinc-finger protein involved in the regulation of mRNA stability through binding to AU-rich elements (AREs). We have used microarray analysis to identify novel Wig-1 target mRNAs. We identified 2447 transcripts with >fourfold differential expression between Wig-1 and control small interfering (si)RNA-treated HCT116 cells. Several p53 target genes were among the deregulated transcripts. We found that Wig-1 regulates FAS and 14-3-3σ mRNA independently of p53. We show that Wig-1 binds to FAS mRNA 3'-UTR and decreases its stability through an ARE in the 3'-UTR. Depletion of Wig-1 was associated with increased cell death and reduced cell cycle arrest upon DNA damage. Our results suggest a role of Wig-1 as a survival factor that directs the p53 stress response toward cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis through the regulation of FAS and 14-3-3σ mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W2048121524,"Periostin (PN), a novel fasciclin-related matricellular protein, has been implicated in cardiac development and postnatal remodeling, but the mechanism remains unknown. We examined the role of PN in mediating intracellular kinase activation for atrioventricular valve morphogenesis using well defined explant cultures, gene transfection systems, and Western blotting. The results show that valve progenitor (cushion) cells secrete PN into the extracellular matrix, where it can bind to INTEGRINs and activate INTEGRIN/focal adhesion kinase signaling pathways and downstream kinases, PI3K/AKT and ERK. Functional assays with prevalvular progenitor cells showed that activating these signaling pathways promoted adhesion, migration, and anti-apoptosis. Through activation of PI3K/ERK, PN directly enhanced collagen expression. Comparing PN-null to WT mice also revealed that expression of hyaluronan (HA) and activation of hyaluronan synthase-2 (Has2) are also enhanced upon PN/INTEGRIN/focal adhesion kinase-mediated activation of PI3K and/or ERK, an effect confirmed by the reduction of HA synthase-2 in PN-null mice. We also identified in valve progenitor cells a potential autocrine signaling feedback loop between PN and HA through PI3K and/or ERK. Finally, in a three-dimensional assay to simulate normal valve maturation in vitro, PN promoted collagen compaction in a kinase-dependent fashion. In summary, this study provides the first direct evidence that PN can act to stimulate a valvulogenic signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2038808798,"Genetic alterations in human cancers and murine models indicate that retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 have critical tumor suppressive functions in retinoblastoma, a tumor of neural origin, and neuroendocrine tumors including small cell lung cancer and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Rb inactivation is the initiating lesion in retinoblastoma and current models propose that induction of apoptosis is a key p53 tumor suppressive function. Genetic studies in mice, however, indicate that other undefined p53 tumor suppressive functions are operative in vivo. How p53 loss cooperates with Rb inactivation to promote carcinogenesis is also not fully understood. In the current study, genetically engineered mice were generated to determine the role of Rb and p53 in MTC pathogenesis and test the hypothesis that p53 suppresses carcinogenesis by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Conditional Rb ablation resulted in thyroid tumors mimicking human MTC, and additional p53 loss led to rapid tumor progression. p53 suppressed tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell cycle progression, but did not induce apoptosis. On the contrary, p53 loss led to increased apoptosis that had to be overcome for tumor progression. The mTOR activity was markedly increased in p53-deficient tumors and rapamycin treatment suppressed tumor cell growth, identifying mTOR inhibition as a critical p53 tumor suppressive function. Rapamycin treatment did not result in AKT/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, providing evidence that this feedback mechanism operative in other cancers is not a general response to mTORC1 inhibition. Together, these studies provide mechanistic links between genetic alterations and aberrant signaling pathways critical in carcinogenesis, and identify essential Rb and p53 tumor suppressive functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2034605371,"Constitutional dominant loss-of-function mutations in the SPRED1 gene cause a rare phenotype referred as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-like syndrome or Legius syndrome, consisted of multiple café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, learning disabilities and macrocephaly. SPRED1 is a negative regulator of the RAS MAPK pathway and can interact with neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product. Individuals with NF1 have a higher risk of haematological malignancies. SPRED1 is highly expressed in haematopoietic cells and negatively regulates haematopoiesis. SPRED1 seemed to be a good candidate for leukaemia predisposition or transformation. We performed SPRED1 mutation screening and expression status in 230 paediatric lymphoblastic and acute myeloblastic leukaemias (AMLs). We found a loss-of-function frameshift SPRED1 mutation in a patient with Legius syndrome. In this patient, the leukaemia blasts karyotype showed a SPRED1 loss of heterozygosity, confirming SPRED1 as a tumour suppressor. Our observation confirmed that acute leukaemias are rare complications of the Legius syndrome. Moreover, SPRED1 was significantly decreased at RNA and protein levels in the majority of AMLs at diagnosis compared with normal or paired complete remission bone marrows. SPRED1 decreased expression correlated with genetic features of AML. Our study reveals a new mechanism which contributes to deregulate RAS MAPK pathway in the vast majority of paediatric AMLs."

Aβ is a 38–43-amino acid-long peptide (Αβ38–43) contained within the C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type I transmembrane (TM) glycoprotein. Aβ is produced by the sequential cleavage of APP by β- and γ-secretases. The β-secretase first cleaves the extracellular domain of APP, producing a 99-amino acid-long TM protein, referred to as APP-C99. Then the proteolytic cleavage of APP-C99 by the γ-secretase occurs within the TM domain, releasing the Aβ peptides. amyloid-β amyloid precursor protein transmembrane APP intracellular domain electron paramagnetic resonance double electron-electron resonance molecular dynamics lysomyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol methanethiosulfonate palmitoyloleoly phosphatidylcholine cysteine bound to MTSL residual dipolar coupling 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid electron paramagnetic resonance immunoprecipitation combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The neurotoxicity of Aβ depends on the peptide length and therefore on the position within APP-C99 of the γ-secretase cleavage site. Moreover, in Alzheimer patients, the ratio of Aβ42 versus Aβ40 is significantly higher. Effort has therefore been invested into characterizing the structure and dynamics of APP-C99 and how this substrate would interact with γ-secretase. Mutations in or adjacent to the TM region have a drastic effect on cleavage at the γ-site. More than half of the mutations in APP causing early onset familial Alzheimer disease are found in its TM domain (1Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer's disease. genes, proteins, and therapy.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interaction of the APP with the membrane environment, in particular with cholesterol, Cu2+, and Zn2+ metal ions, alters the structural and dynamical properties of the protein (2Barnham K.J.

Miyashita et al. (4Miyashita N. Straub J.E. Thirumalai D.

They observed that Gly708 and Gly709 play an important role in the flexibility of the helix. This mechanism can stabilize the TM domain in the membrane, allowing it to adapt to the fluctuations of the membrane thickness. These residues are close to the γ-site and may directly influence substrate cleavage. The APP-TM contains two GXXXG motifs (i.e., 700GXXXGXXXG708 in Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1), which are believed to mediate dimerization in transmembrane proteins (5Russ W.P.

MD simulations in implicit solvent showed that these mutations shifted the position of the γ-site in the membrane (9Miyashita N. Sugita Y. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations of amyloid precursor protein dimer in membrane.Qtm. Prob. Wht. Noi. 2010; 26: 361-368Google Scholar). Recently, however, two NMR structural ensembles have been solved. Nadezhdin et al. (10Nadezhdin K.D. Bocharova O.V. Bocharov E.V. Arseniev A.S.

The structures feature a short N terminus juxtamembrane helix (Lys687–Asp694) and a 24-amino acid TM helix (Gly700–Leu723). A minor bend (∼16°) was observed at residues Gly708-Gly709. These residues, located in the middle of the TM domain, can act as a hinge to compensate for the fluctuation of the membrane thickness. Barrett et al. (11Barrett P.J. Song Y. Van Horn W.D. Hustedt E.J. Schafer J.M. Hadziselimovic A. Beel A.J. Sanders C.R. The amyloid precursor protein has a flexible transmembrane domain and binds cholesterol.Science. 2012; 336: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) more recently solved the NMR structure for the helical domain of APP-C99 (Val683–Tyr728) in lysomyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol (LMPG) detergent micelles (Protein Data Bank code 2LP1; see Fig. 1A). The N and C termini are mainly unstructured, except for a short C terminus helix, whereas the TM domain is characterized by a highly curved α-helix (∼115° at Gly708-Gly709). To validate the biological relevance of this kink, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to estimate the distance between the ends of the TM domain in lipid bilayers. Methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) spin labels were attached to residues Gly700 and Leu723, mutated beforehand to cysteines. The distances measured in the micelles and lipid vesicles were nearly identical, thus providing indirect evidence that APP will also be curved in lipid bilayers. Later, Pester et al. (12Pester O. Barrett P.J. Hornburg D. Hornburg P. Pröbstle R. Widmaier S. Kutzner C. Dürrbaum M. Kapurniotu A. Sanders C.R. Scharnagl C. Langosch D.

Soc. 2013; 135: 1317-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) investigated the backbone dynamics at APP-TM and the effect of dimerization using NMR and MD simulations. They observed a bending motion at the GXXXG motif and a decrease of the dynamics of the binding site upon dimerization. The MD simulations were, however, carried out starting from an ideal α-helix model and did not consider the juxtamembrane helix or NMR model structures. Here we used all-atom MD simulations to explain the existence of these divergent structures (see Fig. 1A), to understand the effect of the different experimental conditions on the APP conformations, and to obtain detailed insights into the dynamic properties of APP. We found that the conformational space of APP is strongly influenced by the size of enclosing micelles used in NMR experiments and by perturbations introduced by specific mutations and spin labels used during EPR experiments. Our results support a conformation for the APP-TM domain that is mainly populated by straight α-helical structures when embedded in a biological membrane bilayer. This conformation shows flexibility at the Gly708-Gly709 region, which can explain the multiple conformations that have been observed under different experimental conditions. Importantly, this flexibility probably has functional implications for γ-secretase presentation during proteolytic processing. We show in fact by in silico and in vitro functional analyses that position 700 is crucial for modulating such flexibility, producing a remarkable increase of hydration and production of Aβ38 in a series of Gly700 mutants. The fact that the same position is targeted by γ-secretase modulators can have functional implications to understand their therapeutic mode of action. MD simulations were used to characterize the structure of APP in micelles and membrane bilayers, under the effect of different experimental conditions.

The periodic electrostatic interactions were computed using particle mesh Ewald summation with a grid spacing smaller than 1 Å. Constant temperature (300 or 318 K) was imposed by using Langevin dynamics (18Brunger A. Brooks C.L. Stochastic boundary conditions for molecular dynamics simulations of ST2 water.Chem. Phys.

Free molecular dynamics were performed up to hundreds of ns with a 2-fs integration time step using the RATTLE algorithm applied to all bonds. All MD simulations, listed in supplemental Table S1, sum up to a cumulative simulation time of ∼2 μs. Metadynamics is used to enhance the sampling of the conformational space and to retrieve the associated free energy landscape (20Laio A. Parrinello M. Escaping free-energy minima.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12562-12566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3851) Google Scholar). Gaussians are added to the energy surface and force the system to escape from local minima. This technique requires a priori knowledge of the degrees of freedom relevant to a conformational change. In the current systems, the observed conformational change was described by means of two collective variables representing the dihedral angles ϕ and ψ, which connect the nitrogen atoms of Gly708-Gly709 and Gly709-Val710. These angles allow sampling the different kinked conformations observed for the TM domain in the NMR structures. A set of metadynamics simulations (supplemental Table S1) was performed using the collective variable module of NAMD (21Henin J. Fiorin G. Chipot C. Klein M.L.

Gaussians of width 0.3 and weight 0.01 were inserted every 300 fs. The conformational space was sampled from −75 to 10° for dihedral angles ϕ and ψ (see Figs. 1D, 2C, and 3D).FIGURE 3.Effects of EPR spin labels on APP structure and dynamics in the membrane.

Singular value decomposition was used to compute the alignment tensor that would best map the experimental RDCs. First, the N–H vector was extracted from the APP2LP1 ensemble, and then RDCs were back-computed. A set of structures was then extracted from the MD trajectories performed for the micelle systems. The structures that would best fit the experimental RDCs were selected with a genetic algorithm. We finally clustered them using the Jarvis-Patrick clustering algorithm (22Jarvis R.A. Patrick E.A.

Three different EPR DEER prediction algorithms were considered to estimate the distance distribution profile for the tagged APP-TM domain, namely MMM (Multiscale Modeling of Macromolecules; ETH Zurich), mtsslWizzard (24Hagelueken G.

The DEER signal was computed for the straight structure equilibrated in a POPC bilayer and the curved NMR structure. A modified version of MMM was used to estimate the distance distribution based on the MTSL coordinates extracted from the MD and metadynamics simulations (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S6). The pET21b vector encoding the cDNAs of human APP-C99-His was used as a template for the generation by PCR amplification of APP-C100-His substrates described in this study (recombinant APP CTF substrates expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, amino acids 597–695 of the 695-amino acid isoform of APP, and the His6 tag sequence). The constructs were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at optic density at 600 nm of 0.8. For the purification of APP-C100 substrates (i.e., wt, G700A, G700L, and G700W), harvested bacteria were lysed with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and passed through a high pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5; Avestin, Inc., Mannheim, Germany). The obtained lysates were spun down at 5000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were incubated overnight with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Invitrogen) at 4 °C.

The resulting products, APP intracellular domain (AICD-His) and Aβ, were detected with C-terminal APP antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for AICDs and anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 (Covance, Berkeley, CA). Aβ and AICD generated in γ-secretase in vitro assays with purified substrates were analyzed as previously described (28Alattia J.R. Kuraishi T. Dimitrov M. Chang I. Lemaitre B. Fraering P.C. Mercury is a direct and potent γ-secretase inhibitor affecting Notch processing and development in Drosophila.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 2287-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ peptides were immunoprecipitated overnight using anti-Aβ antibody 4G8 (Covance) and protein G-coupled to agarose resin (Roche Applied Science). For AICD detection, 1% Triton X-100 solution was added after the enzymatic reaction and incubated for 20 min at 55 °C on a shaker prior to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with protein A (Roche Applied Science), coupled with anti-C-terminal AICD antibody. Aβs and AICDs were eluted with 1:20:20 (v/v/v) 1% (v/v) trifluroacetic acid:acetonitrile:H2O, equally mixed with saturated α-cyano 4-hydroxy cinnaminic acid for detection of Aβs and synapic acid for AICD, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in reflectron mode on an ABI 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Molecular masses were accurately measured and searched against amino acid sequences of human APP-C99 with the addition of a methionine residue at the N terminus and a His6 tag sequence at the C terminus (C100His). These experiments for each species were performed in duplicate with comparable observed peak height values (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S8b). Aβ38 and Aβ40 peptides were quantified using human Aβ38 and Aβ40 commercially available ELISA kits from Invitrogen or IBL International (Hamburg, Germany), respectively. ELISA measurements (in triplicate for each APP species, see supplemental Fig. S8c) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. We carried out an extensive set of MD simulations of APP-TM structures considering the effect of a POPC lipid bilayer and LMPG micelles. We compared and validated our results with the available experimental data (namely, NMR and EPR (11Barrett P.J. Song Y. Van Horn W.D. Hustedt E.J. Schafer J.M. Hadziselimovic A. Beel A.J. Sanders C.R. The amyloid precursor protein has a flexible transmembrane domain and binds cholesterol.Science. 2012; 336: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar)). We also tested the effects of the experimental protocols, for example those produced by spin labeling of APP.

In this study, we used metadynamics, as successfully done for other membrane-spanning proteins (31Lemmin T. Soto C.S. Clinthorne G. DeGrado W.F. Dal Peraro M.

Finally, these results were used to rationally design and investigate a series of mutations affecting the key region found to modulate the flexibility of APP-TM, and their effect on the proteolytic processing by γ-secretase was tested in vitro. We considered the two available NMR structural ensembles (Protein Data Bank codes 2LLM and 2LP1), referred to hereinafter as APP2LP1 and APP2LLM, respectively. APP2LLM is solved as a mostly straight α-helix with a small concavity near Gly708-Gly709, whereas the APP2LP1 structure is characterized by an important kink at this region (Fig. 1A). To characterize these structures in a physiological-like environment, we inserted them into a membrane bilayer formed by POPC, which is a major lipid constituent of the synaptic plasma membrane (32Cotman C. Blank M.L. Moehl A. Snyder F. Lipid composition of synaptic plasma membranes isolated from rat brain by zonal centrifugation.Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4606-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The MD simulations were carried out under physiological-like conditions (e.g., pH ∼7, 1 atm and 300 K; Fig. 1B). When inserted into the POPC bilayer, the secondary structure of both APP NMR structures fluctuates only marginally and preserves an α-helical conformation. The TM domain of APP2LLM remains close to the initial NMR structure (root mean square deviation, 1.9 ± 0.2 Å). The important bend observed in the APP2LP1 initial structure straightens within the first 20 ns of simulation and remains straight throughout the rest of the simulation (>300 ns; supplemental Table S1).

We recently reported that Elafin is overexpressed by HGSOC and is associated with poor overall survival. Here, we confirm that Elafin overexpression is associated with shorter survival in 1000 HGSOC patients. Elafin confers a proliferative advantage to tumor cells through the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. This mitogenic effect can be neutralized by RNA interference, specific antibodies and a MEK inhibitor. Elafin expression in patient-derived samples was also associated with chemoresistance and strongly correlates with bcl-xL expression. We extended these findings into the examination of 1100 primary breast tumors and six breast cancer cell lines. We observed that Elafin is overexpressed and secreted specifically by BLBC tumors and cell lines, leading to a similar mitogenic effect through activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Here too, Elafin overexpression is associated with poor overall survival, suggesting that it may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2027189297,"Resistance to targeted therapies is a major problem in cancer treatment. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody drugs are effective in a subset of colorectal cancers, but the molecular mechanisms of resistance are understood poorly. Genes involved in epigenetic regulation are frequently deregulated in cancer, raising the possibility that such genes also contribute to drug resistance. Using a focused RNA interference library for genes involved in epigenetic regulation, we identify sirtuin2 (SIRT2), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, as a modulator of the response to EGFR inhibitors in colon and lung cancer. SIRT2 loss also conferred resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma and KRAS mutant colon cancers, respectively. These results warrant further investigation into the potential role of SIRT2 in resistance to drugs that act in the receptor tyrosine kinase-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2089980986,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an integral membrane glycoprotein whose cleavage products, particularly amyloid-β, accumulate in Alzheimer disease (AD). APP is present at synapses and is thought to play a role in both the formation and plasticity of these critical neuronal structures. Despite the central role suggested for APP in AD pathogenesis, the mechanisms regulating APP in neurons and its processing into cleavage products remain incompletely understood. F-box only protein 2 (Fbxo2), a neuron-enriched ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor that preferentially binds high-mannose glycans on glycoproteins, was previously implicated in APP processing by facilitating the degradation of the APP-cleaving β-secretase, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme. Here, we sought to determine whether Fbxo2 plays a similar role for other glycoproteins in the amyloid processing pathway. We present in vitro and in vivo evidence that APP is itself a substrate for Fbxo2. APP levels were decreased in the presence of Fbxo2 in non-neuronal cells, and increased in both cultured hippocampal neurons and brain tissue from Fbxo2 knock-out mice. The processing of APP into its cleavage products was also increased in hippocampi and cultured hippocampal neurons lacking Fbxo2. In hippocampal slices, this increase in cleavage products was accompanied by a significant reduction in APP at the cell surface. Taken together, these results suggest that Fbxo2 regulates APP levels and processing in the brain and may play a role in modulating AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2103291638,"Using a novel cysteine thiol labeling strategy coupled with mass spectrometric analysis, we identified and quantified the changes in global reversible cysteine oxidation of proteins in the left ventricle of hearts from mice with metabolic syndrome-associated diastolic dysfunction. This phenotype was induced by feeding a high-fat, high-sucrose, type-2 diabetogenic diet to C57BL/6J mice for 8 mo. The extent of reversible thiol oxidation in relationship to the total available (free and reducible) level of each cysteine could be confidently determined for 173 proteins, of which 98 contained cysteines differentially modified ≥1.5-fold by the diet. Our findings suggest that the metabolic syndrome leads to potentially deleterious changes in the oxidative modification of metabolically active proteins. These alterations may adversely regulate energy substrate flux through glycolysis, β-oxidation, citric acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos), thereby contributing to maladaptive tissue remodeling that is associated with, and possibly contributing to, diastolic left ventricular dysfunction."

Previous studies have shown that tyrosine nitration attenuates PKG-1α activity. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in this event. Utilizing mass spectrometry, we found that PKG-1α is susceptible to nitration at tyrosine 247 and 425. Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants, Y247F- and Y425F-PKG-1α, were both less susceptible to nitration than WT PKG-1α, but only Y247F-PKG-1α exhibited preserved activity, suggesting that the nitration of Tyr247 is critical in attenuating PKG-1α activity. The overexpression of WT- or Y247F-PKG-1α decreased the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC), increased the expression of SMC contractile markers, and decreased the expression of proliferative markers.

PKG is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is activated upon the intracellular generation of 3′,5′-cGMP by two main types of guanylyl cyclases: soluble and membrane-associated (4Garbers D.L. Guanylyl cyclase receptors and their endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine ligands.Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Soluble guanylyl cyclase acts downstream of NO, whereas the membrane-associated guanylyl cyclase is activated through the extracellular binding of natriuretic peptides. The mammalian genome encodes a type 1 PKG (5Feil S. Zimmermann P. Knorn A. Brummer S. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Feil R.

Both types 1 and 2 PKG are homodimeric proteins containing two identical polypeptide chains of ∼76 and 85 kDa, respectively. Alternative mRNA splicing of PKG-1 produces a type 1α PKG (75 kDa) and a type 1β PKG (78 kDa), which only share 36% identity in their first 70–100 amino-terminal residues (8Wolfe L. Corbin J.D.

PKG-1 has been detected at high concentrations in all types of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (5Feil S. Zimmermann P. Knorn A. Brummer S. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Feil R. Distribution of cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I and its isoforms in the mouse brain and retina.Neuroscience. 2005; 135: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PKG-2 has been detected in renal, adrenal, intestinal, pancreatic, and brain cells but not in cardiac and vascular cells. The primary sequence of PKG-1α is divided into two separate domains: a regulatory domain (aa 1–343) containing an amino-terminal region (aa 1–110) and two cGMP-binding sites A (aa 111–227) and B (aa 228–343) and a catalytic domain (aa 344–671) containing an ATP-binding site (aa 344–474) and the substrate-binding site (aa 475–671) (10Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Guanosine cyclic 3′,5′-phosphate dependent protein kinase, a chimeric protein homologous with two separate protein families.Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of the regulatory domain of PKG-1α contains a dimerization site, an autoinhibitory motif, and several autophosphorylation sites. The leucine zipper motif in the dimerization domain (aa 1–39) ensures substrate specificity of PKG-1α (11Atkinson R.A. Saudek V. Huggins J.P.

A leucine/isoleucine zipper.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The autoinhibitory region of PKG-1α (aa 58–72) binds to the catalytic domain and maintains the enzyme in an inhibited state. This autoinhibition can be relieved by both cGMP binding and autophosphorylation, which cause a conformational change (12Zhao J. Trewhella J. Corbin J. Francis S. Mitchell R. Brushia R. Walsh D.

Cyclic GMP increases both the heterophosphorylation and the autophosphorylation activity of PKG (14Hofmann F. Gensheimer H.P. Göbel C. Autophosphorylation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase is stimulated only by occupancy of one of the two cGMP binding sites.FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation of PKG-1α increases kinase activity but decreases its cGMP-binding affinity (15Hofmann F. Gensheimer H.P. Göbel C. cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Autophosphorylation changes the characteristics of binding site 1.Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A hinge region connects the amino-terminal dimerization site with the two tandem cGMP-binding sites A and B. These sites preferentially bind cGMP over cAMP with more than a 100-fold selectivity. The two cGMP-binding sites of PKG have different binding characteristics (16Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Fast and slow cyclic nucleotide-dissociation sites in cAMP-dependent protein kinase are transposed in type Ibeta cGMP-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); the amino-terminal high affinity site A and the succeeding low affinity site B display slow and fast cGMP exchange characteristics, respectively (15Hofmann F. Gensheimer H.P. Göbel C. cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Autophosphorylation changes the characteristics of binding site 1.Eur. J.

Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of cGMP to these sites activates the enzyme. The occupation of site B decreases the dissociation of cGMP from site A, and therefore, site A shows positive cooperativity (15Hofmann F. Gensheimer H.P. Göbel C. cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Autophosphorylation changes the characteristics of binding site 1.Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A maximally active enzyme is obtained when all four cGMP-binding sites of the dimeric kinase are occupied. In this study, we found that the nitration of PKG-1α at the tyrosine residue 247 prevents the binding of cGMP to the cGMP-binding site B and attenuates the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

The 3-NT Tyr247 PKG-1α specific antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide antigen ENGE(Y-NO2)IIRQGARGDC, where Y-NO2 represent 3-nitrotyrosine. The peptide was used to immunize rabbits. Tyrosine nitration-reactive rabbit antiserum was first purified by affinity chromatography. Further purification was carried out using immunodepletion by non-nitrated peptide ENGEYIIRQGARGDC resin chromatography, after which the resulting eluate was tested for antibody specificity by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry with fluorescent staining. The surgical preparation to introduce fetal aorta-pulmonary shunt was carried out as previously described (18Reddy V.M. Meyrick B. Wong J. Khoor A. Liddicoat J.R. Hanley F.L. Fineman J.R.

We selected four bilateral lung explants from human patients who underwent lung transplantation because of Eisenmenger syndrome (“associated pulmonary arterial hypertension”, NYHA IV). All lung specimens showed prominent plexiform vasculopathy (age at transplantation, 36.5 ± 11.04 years; female:male ratio, 4:1). All the specimens were inflated with formalin via the main bronchi and were formalin-fixed overnight before being extensively sampled and paraffin-embedded. Subsequently, they were histologically evaluated, graded according to the Heath-Edwards classification (all grade 5), and correlated with clinical data to confirm the (histopathologic) diagnosis. The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples were retrieved from the archives of the Institute of Pathology of Hannover Medical School and were handled anonymously, following the requirements of the local ethics committee (19Jonigk D.

The controls were five downsized specimens of lung allografts without delimitable pathologic changes, which were sampled immediately prior to transplantation (one male and four female donors). Primary cultures of pulmonary artery SMC (PASMC) from 4-week-old lambs were isolated by the explant technique, as we have previously described (20Wedgwood S. McMullan D.M. Bekker J.M. Fineman J.R.

All culture for subsequent experiments was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotics, and antimycotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and 95% air. All experiments were conducted between passages 5 and 15. HEK-293T cells were a kind gift from Dr. John. D. Catravas. Cells were transiently transfected with either the WT-PKG-1α or the Y247F-PKG-1α cDNA using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Reactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (Pierce) on a Kodak 440CF image station. The band intensity was quantified using Kodak one-dimensional image processing software. Loading was normalized by reprobing with anti β-actin (1:2000). This was carried out as recently described (1Aggarwal S. Gross C.M. Kumar S. Datar S. Oishi P. Kalkan G. Schreiber C. Fratz S.

Briefly, protein samples were diluted in kinase reaction buffer containing Mg2+ and ATP (125 μm) in the presence or absence of cGMP (10 μm) and incubated in a 96-well plate precoated with a PKG substrate containing threonine residues known to be phosphorylated by PKG. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C to allow the phosphorylation of the bound substrate, an HRP -conjugated anti-phosphothreonine specific antibody was added to convert a chromogenic substrate to a colorimetric substrate that was then read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The change in absorbance reflects the relative activity of PKG in the sample. The results were reported as pmol of phosphate incorporated into the substrate by active PKG in the sample in the presence or absence of cGMP (10 μm) per minute at 30 °C per μg of protein (pmol/min/μg). These results were extrapolated by comparing the spectrophotometrical values of the samples to the known activity (pmol/min) of a positive control. Kinetic constants were then determined using nonlinear regression (curve fit) analysis (GraphPad Prism Software Inc.). To determine the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for cGMP, the kinase assay was performed with varying cGMP concentrations (0–10 μm), whereas the ATP concentration remained constant (125 μm). PASMC were grown on a coverslip, and at the end of the treatment protocol, the cells were washed with PBS, then fixed with 100% methanol (5 min), and then permeabilized in 0.1% PBS-Tween (20 min). The cells were then washed three times with PBS and blocked for nonspecific protein-protein interactions using 1% BSA in PBS (1 h). The antibodies, SM22-α (5 μg/ml) and PCNA (1 μg/ml), were diluted in 1% BSA in PBS, added, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cells were again washed three times with PBS and incubated in secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1/1000 dilution) for PCNA or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) (1/1000 dilution) for SM22-α for 1 h in the dark. DAPI was used to stain the cell nuclei (blue) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml for 3 min. The cells were rinsed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on the slides with ProLong Gold Antifade and analyzed with the use of a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted fluorescent microscope with a 60× oil objective and a Hamamatsu digital camera. SM22-α levels were quantified as the number of filamentous cells with granular green staining (SM22-α) divided by total number of cells and presented as the percentage of SM22-α positive cells. PCNA levels were quantified using ImageJ software as mean intensity of green staining inside the nucleus and presented as the nuclear PCNA intensity. Downsized lungs and pulmonary hypertensive human lung tissue paraffin sections (5 μm) were mounted on slides and placed in a 55 °C oven for 10 min, deparaffinized in xylene (three times for 5 min), and then hydrated using an alcohol series: 100, 95, and 70% alcohol (each three times for 5 min) and finally rinsed in water. The sections were processed for antigen retrieval by boiling the slides in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0). The slides were then cooled at room temperature for 20 min, washed in PBS, and blocked in 10% normal serum overnight at 4 °C. Immunofluorescence was then performed on serial sections from each group using goat anti-PKG-1α, rabbit anti-3-NT-Y247-PKG-1α, and mouse anti-caldesmon antibodies (Sigma). The sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and washed (three times for 5 min) with PBS. Subsequently, sections were double-stained either with Alexa Fluor® 546 anti-goat or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Sections were washed several times in PBS and mounted on the coverslip in anti-fading aqueous mounting medium. The fluorescently stained sections were then analyzed using the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths by performing confocal microscopy using a computer-based DeltaVision imaging system (Applied Precision Inc.). At the end of the experimental protocol, PKG-1α was immunoprecipitated, as described above. The protein was resolved using 4–20% Tris-SDS-Hepes PAGE and visualized by imperial protein stain (Thermo-Fisher). The band corresponding to PKG-1α (75 kDa) was excised, destained, and subjected to overnight in-gel digestion with trypsin (25 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8). The peptides were extracted with 0.1% TFA, 75% acetonitrile and evaporated to near dryness. Mass spectrometry analysis of PKG-1α was then performed as described (1Aggarwal S. Gross C.M. Kumar S. Datar S. Oishi P. Kalkan G. Schreiber C. Fratz S. Fineman J.R. Black S.M. Attenuated vasodilatation in lambs with endogenous and exogenous activation of cGMP signaling.

All spectra were taken on an ABSciex 5800 MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in positive reflector mode (10 kV) with a matrix of CHCA. At least 1000 laser shots were averaged to get each spectrum. The masses were calibrated to known peptide standards. Aliquots (5 μl) of the PKG-1α tryptic digest were taken up into a C18 ZipTip (Millipore) that had been prepared, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The bound peptides were desalted with two 5-μl washes of 0.1% TFA and then eluted with 2.5 μl of aqueous, acidic acetonitrile (75% CH3CN, 0.1% TFA). The eluate was mixed with 2.5 μl of freshly prepared CHCA stock solution (20 mg/ml CHCA in aqueous acetonitrile, as above), and 1.5-μl portions of this mixture were spotted onto a MALDI sample plate for air drying. Crude peptides (1.5 μl) were additionally mixed with CHCA (1.5 μl) and were spotted. The MS/MS of the 2209.04 m/z peak was done in positive reflector mode without CID. The MS and MS/MS spectra were analyzed in the Mascot Distiller software package. Because a complete x-ray structure for PKG-1α is unavailable in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we used the homology modeling module of YASARA (23Venselaar H. Joosten R.P. Vroling B. Baakman C.A. Hekkelman M.L. Krieger E. Vriend G. Homology modelling and spectroscopy, a never-ending love story.Eur. Biophys. J. 2010; 39: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to build a high resolution model of PKG-1α from its amino acid sequence. The PKG-1α homology model was developed using the following protocol: a PSI-BLAST (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST. A new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59847) Google Scholar) integrated in YASARA was used to identify the closest templates in the PDB. As a template for the three-dimensional structure for the PKG-1α homology model, we used the regulatory (PDB code 1NE4) and catalytic (PDB code 2CPK) domains of PKA because PKA shares significant structural and functional similarities to PKG-1α. We used BLAST to retrieve homologous sequences, create a multiple sequence alignment, and enter the sequences into a “discrimination of secondary structure class” prediction algorithm (25King R.D. Sternberg M.J. Identification and application of the concepts important for accurate and reliable protein secondary structure prediction.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2298-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The side chains were added and optimized in the next step, and all of the newly modeled parts were subjected to a combined steepest descent and underwent simulated annealing minimization. The backbone atoms of the aligned residues were kept fixed. Finally, an unrestrained, simulated, annealing minimization with water was performed on the entire model. The resultant individual homology models of the PKG-1α regulatory domain and the catalytic domain were combined together to form a single PDB sequence. This new sequence was used as a template sequence for generating a complete homology model of PKG-1α resulting in a structure containing two cGMP-binding sites: A and B as well as an ATP-binding site. Subsequently, a simulation cell was placed around each ligand-binding site on the PKG-1α homology model to focus the docking of two cGMP molecules and one ATP molecule to their respective binding sites using the AutoDock program developed at the Scripps Research Institute. To simulate nitration, an NO2 group was introduced into the protein model on the ortho carbon of the phenolic ring of the Tyr247 residue. The structure was minimized, and the hydrogen bonding energy (kJ/mol) and distance (Å) between the cGMP molecule and the cGMP-binding site B of PKG-1α were analyzed in the presence or absence of the NO2 group again using YASARA. At the end of the experimental protocol WT- and Y247F-PKG-1α were immunopurified, as described above, quantified using Bradford reagent, and stored at −80 °C until used. To assay the binding of cGMP to WT- and Y247F-PKG-1α, the enzymes were saturated with cGMP by incubating 50-μl aliquots of the diluted PKG constructs for 60 min at room temperature with 50 μl of [3H]cGMP and 150 μl of cGMP binding assay mixture (25 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, 2 m NaCl, 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine). The final cGMP concentration varied from 0 to 200 nm, and the final concentration of enzyme was 100 ng. After incubation, 2 ml of cold aqueous saturated (NH4)2SO4 was added to each sample. The samples were then filtered onto"

Over the past decade, several small molecule modulators of chromatin-modifying enzymes have been discovered (1Cole P.A. Chemical probes for histone-modifying enzymes.Nat. Chem.

Our laboratory previously reported that one of the 1,4-naphthoquinones, plumbagin, is a potent inhibitor of the KAT p300. Plumbagin specifically inhibits p300-mediated p53 acetylation but not the p53 acetylation by the lysine acetyltransferase KAT2B (p300/CBP-associated factor) (4Ravindra K.C. Selvi B.R. Arif M.

This study described for the first time that a structural entity (a hydroxyl group at the 5th position of plumbagin) is required for the inhibition of acetyltransferase activity. However, naphthoquinone derivatives are relatively toxic molecules, and their efficacy and utility in vivo has been limited due to this characteristic (5Inbaraj J.J. Chignell C.F.

Among the different small molecule KAT inhibitors known to date, Lys-CoA was the first to be discovered as a p300 acetyltransferase-specific inhibitor (9Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S.

The catalytic mechanisms of the enzyme have been investigated from the co-crystal structural analysis of the p300 KAT domain and Lys-CoA (10Liu X. Wang L. Zhao K. Thompson P.R. Hwang Y.

Lys-CoA interacts extensively with the acetyltransferase domain, particularly in the hydrophobic tunnel. Lys-CoA-mediated inhibition supports a Theorell-Chance model rather than a standard ordered binding, ternary complex, or ping-pong mechanism. Based on the residues that Lys-CoA binds within the hydrophobic tunnel, a new enzyme-inhibitory scaffold, C646, has been synthesized by the same group (11Bowers E.M. Yan G. Mukherjee C. Orry A.

Our investigations have revealed that there are pockets in the p300 acetyltransferase KAT domain, other than the hydrophobic tunnel, where these small molecules may bind and cause enzyme inhibition (4Ravindra K.C.

These p300 inhibitors, such as garcinol, plumbagin, and the p300-specific garcinol derivative LTK14, have at least one binding site within the KAT domain (17Arif M. Pradhan S.K. Thanuja G.R.

Chem. 2009; 52: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A docking analysis with plumbagin has shown that binding may not occur in the hydrophobic tunnel of the KAT domain, suggesting that other binding pockets might exist (4Ravindra K.C. Selvi B.R.

Although the mechanisms of action for these small molecule inhibitors have been investigated in terms of enzyme binding and kinetics, the chemical nature of these small molecules has received much less attention. Notably, most KAT inhibitors consist of hydroxyl groups, leading to speculation that the -OH groups could facilitate enzyme-small molecule interactions and thereby KAT inhibition (4Ravindra K.C.

Chem. 2009; 284: 24453-24464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this respect, we have previously reported that the activity of plumbagin can be ascribed to the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group and Lys-1358 in the KAT domain (4Ravindra K.C.

However, plumbagin is known to react with free -SH (thiol) groups available in the intracellular milieu, including glutathione, and is also involved in redox cycling. These chemical properties of 1,4-naphthoquinones, such as plumbagin, may be the cause of their cytotoxicity and may influence their KAT-inhibitory activity. The toxicity also hampers their utility (5Inbaraj J.J. Chignell C.F. Cytotoxic action of juglone and plumbagin. A mechanistic study using HaCaT keratinocytes.Chem. Res.

Therefore, we are interested in investigating the role of the chemical nature of plumbagin and other related 1,4-naphthoquinone analogs in KAT inhibition and cytotoxicity with the ultimate goal of synthesizing a non-toxic, reversible inhibitor. Our results suggest that the major mechanism of plumbagin-mediated KAT inhibition is through irreversible protein interactions. However, the cytotoxicity of plumbagin analogs is due to their ability to generate reactive oxygen species as well as their reactivity to thiols. The structure-function relationships of these 1,4-naphthaquinones lead us to the conclusion that the structural moieties responsible for KAT inhibition and those responsible for toxicity do not overlap and can be delineated. Based on these observations, we have synthesized a new molecule that does not have free thiol reactivity and has less redox cycling potential but retains KAT inhibitory activity. Thus, this molecule could potently reduce histone acetylation in cell-based assays with greatly decreased toxicity. SHSY-5Y (human neuroblastoma) and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubator. HeLa S3 cells were cultured in F-12K (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells (3 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were seeded and then treated 12 h later with plumbagin and other compounds at the desired concentrations for 6 h. In the case of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment, the cells were pretreated with 2 mm NAC for 2 h prior to the addition of plumbagin. After collecting cells at the indicated time points, cell lysates were prepared using Laemmli sample buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The proteins were separated on acrylamide gels, and immunoblotting analysis was performed. Briefly, the proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes containing the transferred proteins were blocked using 5% skim milk solution. The membranes were probed using polyclonal antibodies against histone H3K9 acetylation (Abcam, ab16635), H2AXγ (Abcam, 11174), and H3 (laboratory reagent) for 3 h at 4 °C. These membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (Bangalore Genei). After the addition of an HRP substrate (PICO West, Thermo Scientific) to the membrane, luminescent bands were captured using x-ray films. For quantitation of cell viability, we performed a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. SHSY-5Y cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5000 cells/well). After 12 h, naphthoquinone derivatives were resuspended in the culture medium and added to the wells at the desired concentrations. After 24 h, the compound-containing medium was removed, and equal volumes of fresh medium were added to each well along with 20 μl of MTT (Sigma; 5 mg/ml in PBS). As expected, MTT was reduced to purple-colored formazan only in viable cells. After incubation for 4 h, DMEM was removed by syringe, and the formazan crystals were redissolved in 200 μl of DMSO. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The color was quantified with an ELISA plate reader (Versa Max ELISA plate reader, Molecular Devices, 595-nm wavelength). HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown in their respective media to 75% confluence. For fluorescence-based images, cells were grown on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. Cells were washed with PBS and treated with 5 μm CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of compounds for the indicated times. Later, the cells were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS, and the fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. The sample was excited at 485 nm, and fluorescence was measured at 530 nm. For imaging, coverslips containing cells were washed with PBS and were mounted onto a glass slide using 70% glycerol as a mountant. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus fluorescence microscope. Lysine acetyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (9Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S.

In brief, 800 ng of highly purified HeLa core histones was incubated in HAT assay buffer at 30 °C for 10 min with baculovirus-expressed recombinant p300 or CBP in the presence or absence of select compounds. This procedure was followed by the addition of 1.0 μl of 3.6 Ci/mm [3H]acetyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). This mixture was further incubated for 10 min. The reaction mixture was then kept on ice for 5 min to stop the reaction, spotted onto P81 (Whatman) filter paper, and dried. Scintillation counts were recorded on a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter. All assays were performed in replicates, and the average was plotted, with error bars indicating the S.D. DTNB solution (3 mg/ml) was prepared in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 6.8). NAC, DTT, and 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives were dissolved in 100 mm DMSO. Initially, increasing concentrations of NAC and DTT (25–150 μm) were added to 100 μl of phosphate buffer. 1,4-Naphthoquinone derivatives were subsequently added to make a final concentration of 50 μm. An incubation time of 5 min at room temperature was followed by the addition of 100 μl of DTNB solution, maintaining the total reaction volume as 200 μl in all cases. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at room temperature, and the absorbance of the solution was analyzed at 412 nm using a Versa Max ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices). For performing UV-visible absorption spectrometry, 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives (1 mm in DMSO) were diluted in 1 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) or 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) and were scanned for UV-visible absorption from 200 to 600 nm. Subsequently, NAC (1 mm in DMSO) was added, wherever necessary, to the buffer containing the derivatives, and scanning was repeated. The absorption spectrum was read using a spectrophotometer (U-2010, Hitachi). The same sets of solutions were also used for measuring the excitation wavelength and emission spectra using FluoroMax-3 (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Lysine acetyltransferase assays were carried out with an ectopically expressed baculoviral construct encoding full-length p300, in the absence or presence of different concentrations of the inhibitor PTK1 (0, 15, 20, 25, 35, and 45 μm). The enzyme is known to catalyze a bisubstrate reaction comprising two substrates, namely core histone and [3H]acetyl-CoA. Therefore, a kinetic analysis was performed on two different combinations. The enzyme activity was determined at increasing concentrations (1–8 μm) of [3H]acetyl-CoA while keeping the concentration of core histones constant at 1.7 μm. In the second combination, the [3H]acetyl-CoA concentration was kept constant at 1.6 μm while the core histone concentrations were varied from 5 to 70 nm. The reaction velocity was determined as a function of the incorporation of radioactivity and was expressed as counts/min (cpm). All of the experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the values were within 15% of the error range. The Michaelis-Menten plot was generated using the model, y = Vmax × [S]/(Km + [S]). The Ki was determined by fitting to a straight line by the least square method in a Lineweaver-Burk plot using GraphPad prism version 5.0 software. The reversibility of the inhibitors was established by the time-dependent dilution and “drop dialysis” methods. For dialysis, the enzyme p300 was incubated with inhibitors for 30 min, and the mixture was dialyzed at 4 °C against 2× HAT assay buffer using 0.05-μm Millipore “V series membrane” to remove the inhibitors. The residual activity was assayed and compared with the predialysis activity. For time-dependent dilution-based experiments, full-length p300 was preincubated in 1× HAT assay buffer at pH 8.0 with either enzyme alone or with increasing concentrations (25–100 μm) of inhibitors with varying preincubation times (1–15 min). Aliquots of an appropriate volume were taken from each reaction mixture to make it final 1:25 dilution in every case. From each reaction mixture, the residual activity was measured as a percentage of the control and plotted against the preincubation time. Semilogarithmic plots were constructed, and the data were fit using the semilog line module of GraphPad prism version 5.0. The rate of inactivation was measured by fitting to the equation, y = y intercept + slope × log(x), where x is logarithmic, y is linear, and the rate is equivalent to the slope equal to the apparent inactivation constant (kobs per min) at each inhibitor concentration. The measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Nano S particle analyzer (Malvern Instruments) with a helium-neon laser (632.8 nm) light source that utilizes 4-milliwatt power at the same wavelength. Scattered light from the samples was collected at an angle of 173°. The built-in software generates a correlation curve from the intensity autocorrelation function. The intensity-weighted mean hydrodynamic diameter, or Zav diameter, of the sample was obtained from the cumulants analysis of the correlation curve. To study the effect of plumbagin, PTK1, and juglone on p300 oligomerization and compare their adduct-forming abilities, 5 μm p300 in 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl was treated with increasing concentrations (25–100 μm) of the three compounds, and the Zav diameters of treated and untreated p300 were monitored by dynamic light scattering. Ten measurements (10 runs for each measurement) were recorded for each sample at 25 °C. Because the compounds are dissolved in DMSO, in control experiments, p300 was treated with an equal volume of DMSO without the compound(s), and the hydrodynamic parameters mentioned above were checked to confirm the absence of any alteration. SERS spectra were recorded in a Raman system using 180° back-scattering geometry and a 632.8-nm helium-neon laser (model 30995, Research Electro Optics, Inc.) as a Raman excitation source (18Pavan Kumar G.V.

A holographic 1800 grooves mm−1 grating was used along with the 200-μm spectrograph entrance slit setting, providing ∼3 cm−1 resolution. For SERS studies of protein, a 60× infinity-corrected objective (Nikon Plan Apo; numerical aperture 0.9) was used. The laser power used at the sample was 5 milliwatts. Samples were prepared by concentrating the silver nanoparticles to 10 times, and a concentrated nanoparticle solution/analyte ratio of 4:1 was maintained. The typical accumulation time of 30 s was used. The SERS spectrum was smoothened using a standard five-point fast Fourier transform filtering technique, as shown in Fig. 9D. The silver solution was prepared as reported previously (20Lee P.C. Meisel D. Adsorption and surface-enhanced Raman of dyes on silver and gold sols.J. Phys. Chem. 1982; 86: 3391-3395Crossref Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). Initially, 45 mg of AgNO3 was dissolved in 250 ml of water, and the solution was brought to a boil. A solution of 1% sodium citrate (5 ml) was then added to the AgNO3 solution under vigorous stirring, and boiling was continued for ∼60 min. The plasmon absorption maximum was located at 420 nm. The crystal structure of p300 KAT domain was extracted from the Protein Data Bank using the code 3BIY. The structure of the inhibitor PTK1 was optimized using the GAUSSIAN 03 program (21Frisch M.J.

A 5-grid spacing of 0.375 was used, and docking was performed with a flexible ligand with 100 Genetic Algorithm runs, a population size of 300, 25 × 105 evaluations, and a maximum of 27,000 generations (22Morris G.M.

PTK1 was synthesized by mixing plumbagin (1 mm), acetic acid (12 mm) as a radical source, and benzene (80 ml) as the solvent. The reaction mixture was cooled over dry ice and methanol until the solvent was frozen. The flask was degassed in vacuo for 15 min and filled with nitrogen. This degassing process was repeated three times. After adding lead tetra-acetate (3 mm), the flask was placed in an oil bath, and the mixture was refluxed under a nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h. Upon completion, the reaction was quenched with water to decompose the excess lead tetra-acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated. The obtained crude product was purified by column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate (8.5:1.5). 1H NMR and HRMS characterization of PTK1 were performed as described previously (15Mantelingu K.

https://openalex.org/W2082367265,"Several common biological properties between cancer cells and embryonic stem (ES) cells suggest the possibility that some genes expressed in ES cells might have important roles in cancer cell growth. The transcription factor ZFP57 is expressed in self-renewing ES cells and its expression level decreases during ES cell differentiation. This study showed that ZFP57 is involved in the anchorage-independent growth of human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells in soft agar. ZFP57 overexpression enhanced, whereas knockdown suppressed, HT1080 tumor formation in nude mice. Furthermore, ZFP57 regulates the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), which has a critical role in ZFP57-induced anchorage-independent growth. ZFP57 also promotes anchorage-independent growth in ES cells and immortal fibroblasts. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ZFP57 is overexpressed in human cancer clinical specimens. Taken together, these results suggest that the ES-specific transcription factor ZFP57 is a novel oncogene."

https://openalex.org/W2068214145,"Many oncogenic viruses activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as a part of their replicative cycles. We have shown recently that persistent and potentially oncogenic activation of NF-κB by the human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax immediately triggers a host senescence response mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors: p21CIP1/WAF1 (p21) and p27Kip1 (p27) Here we demonstrate that RelA/NF-κB activation by Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) latency protein vFLIP also leads to p21/p27 upregulation and G1 cell cycle arrest. Remarkably, KSHV vCyclin, another latency protein coexpressed with vFLIP from a bicistronic latency-specific mRNA, was found to prevent the senescence and G1 arrest induced by HTLV-1 Tax and vFLIP, respectively. This is because of the known ability of vCyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase 6 complex to resist p21 and p27 inhibition and cause p27 degradation. In KSHV-transformed BCBL-1 cells, sustained vFLIP expression with small hairpin RNAs-mediated vCyclin depletion resulted in G1 arrest. The functional interdependence of vFLIP and vCyclin explains why they are cotranslated from the same viral mRNA. Importantly, deregulation of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase can facilitate chronic I-κB kinases/NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2019131389,"Sprouty2 (SPRY2) is a potent negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and is implicated as a tumor suppressor. SPRY2 inhibits FGF-RAS-ERK signaling by binding to growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) during fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) activation, disrupting the GRB2-SOS (son of sevenless) complex that transduces signals from FGFR to RAS. SPRY2 binding to GRB2 is modulated by phosphorylation but the key regulatory kinase(s) are not known. Prior studies identified the frequent presence of CK1 phosphorylation motifs on SPRY2. We therefore tested if CK1 has a role in SPRY2 phosphorylation and function. Loss of CK1 binding and inhibition of CK1 activity by two structurally distinct small molecules abrogated SPRY2 inhibition of FGF-ERK signaling, leading to decreased SPRY2 interaction with GRB2. Moreover, CK1 activity and binding are necessary for SPRY2 inhibition of FGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Consistent with its proposed role as an inhibitor of FGF signaling, we find that CSNK1E transcript abundance negatively correlates with FGF1/FGF7 message in human gastric cancer samples. Modulation of CK1 activity may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of FGF/SPRY2-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2143238268,"Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) is expressed in many organs, including female reproductive organs, and is a stem cell marker in the stomach and intestinal epithelium, hair follicles, and ovarian surface epithelium. Despite ongoing studies, the definitive physiological functions of Lgr5 remain unclear. We utilized mice with conditional deletion of Lgr5 (Lgr5(d/d)) in the female reproductive organs by progesterone receptor-Cre (Pgr(Cre)) to determine Lgr5's functions during pregnancy. Only 30% of plugged Lgr5(d/d) females delivered live pups, and their litter sizes were lower. We found that pregnancy failure in Lgr5(d/d) females was due to insufficient ovarian progesterone (P4) secretion that compromised decidualization, terminating pregnancy. The drop in P4 levels was reflected in elevated levels of P4-metabolizing enzyme 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in corpora lutea (CL) inactivated of Lgr5. Of interest, P4 supplementation rescued decidualization failure and supported pregnancy to full term in Lgr5(d/d) females. These results provide strong evidence that Lgr5 is critical to normal CL function, unveiling a new role of LGR5 in the ovary."
https://openalex.org/W2050420820,"Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including trastuzumab has revolutionized the management of HER2-positive breast cancer. Recent evaluation of clinical trial data suggests that a subset of HER2/ER double-positive cancers may not receive significant benefit from the TKI therapy. Here we investigate the cross talk between HER2 and ER in breast cancer and monitor the effect of trastuzumab on the tyrosine kinase effector transcription factor Myc. In HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab, steroid receptor-negative status (ER and PR negative) of pre-treatment biopsies predicted pathological complete response (pCR) (n=31 patients, P=0.0486), whereas elevated Myc protein inversely associated with pCR (P=0.0446). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry identified the corepressor SMRT as a novel Myc-interacting protein. Trastuzumab treatment enhanced Myc-SMRT interactions in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (LCC1) and inhibited expression of the Myc target gene survivin. In HER2-low, ER-positive steroid-dominant cells (MCF7), trastuzumab therapy repressed Myc-SMRT interactions and upregulated survivin expression. Trastuzumab treatment induced ER-CBP interactions, enhanced ER transcriptional activity and upregulated expression of the ER target gene pS2. The absence of pS2 expression in pre-treatment biopsies predicted pCR to neoadjuvant trastuzumab in breast cancer patients (n=25, P=0.0089) and pS2 expression associated with residual cancer burden (P=0.0196). Furthermore, metastatic tissues from patients who had failed trastuzumab therapy were pS2 positive. In HER2-overexpressing cells, trastuzumab treatment can repress Myc transcriptional activity and clinical response is favorable. However, with co-expression of the steroid pathway, this inhibition is lost and response to treatment is often poor."

These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the α-1,5-linked l-arabinofuranoside backbone of plant cell wall arabinans releasing arabino-oligosaccharides and arabinose, the second most abundant pentose in nature. In this work, new findings about the molecular mechanisms governing activation, functional differentiation, and catalysis of GH43 ABNs are presented. Biophysical, mutational, and biochemical studies with the hyperthermostable two-domain endo-acting ABN from Thermotoga petrophila (TpABN) revealed how some GH43 ABNs are activated by calcium ions via hyperpolarization of the catalytically relevant histidine and the importance of the ancillary domain for catalysis and conformational stability. On the other hand, the two GH43 ABNs from rumen metagenome, ARN2 and ARN3, presented a calcium-independent mechanism in which sodium is the most likely substituent for calcium ions. The crystal structure of the two-domain endo-acting ARN2 showed that its ability to efficiently degrade branched substrates is due to a larger catalytic interface with higher accessibility than that observed in other ABNs with preference for linear arabinan. Moreover, crystallographic characterization of the single-domain exo-acting ARN3 indicated that its cleavage pattern producing arabinose is associated with the chemical recognition of the reducing end of the substrate imposed by steric impediments at the aglycone-binding site. By structure-guided rational design, ARN3 was converted into a classical endo enzyme, confirming the role of the extended Arg203–Ala230 loop in determining its action mode.

https://openalex.org/W1981683479,"Functional loss of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), which is part of an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex, initiates most inherited and sporadic clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Genetic inactivation of the TP53 gene in ccRCC is rare, suggesting that an alternate mechanism alleviates the selective pressure for TP53 mutations in ccRCC. Here we use a zebrafish model to describe the functional consequences of pVHL loss on the p53/Mdm2 pathway. We show that p53 is stabilized in the absence of pVHL and becomes hyperstabilized upon DNA damage, which we propose is because of a novel in vivo interaction revealed between human pVHL and a negative regulator of Mdm2, the programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) protein. PDCD5 is normally localized at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. However, upon hypoxia or loss of pVHL, PDCD5 relocalizes to the nucleus, an event that is coupled to the degradation of Mdm2. Despite the subsequent hyperstabilization and normal transcriptional activity of p53, we find that zebrafish vhl−/− cells are still as highly resistant to DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as human ccRCC cells. We suggest this is because of a marked increase in expression of birc5a, the zebrafish homolog of Survivin. Accordingly, when we knock down Survivin in human ccRCC cells we are able to restore caspase activity in response to DNA damage. Taken together, our study describes a new mechanism for p53 stabilization through PDCD5 upon hypoxia or pVHL loss, and reveals new clinical potential for the treatment of pathobiological disorders linked to hypoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2005709666,"Most of the squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin and head and neck contain p53 mutations. The presence of p53 mutations in premalignant lesions suggests that they represent early events during tumor progression and additional alterations may be required for SCC development. Here we show that codeletion of the p53 and αv integrin genes in mouse stratified epithelia induced SCCs in 100% of the mice, more frequently and with much shorter latency than deletion of either gene alone. The SCCs that lacked p53 and αv in the epithelial tumor cells exhibited high Akt activity, lacked multiple types of infiltrating immune cells, contained a defective vasculature and grew slower than tumors that expressed p53 or αv. These results reveal that loss of αv in epithelial cells that lack p53 promotes SCC development, but also prevents remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and delays tumor growth. We observed that Akt inactivation in SCC cells that lack p53 and αv promoted anoikis. Thus, tumors may arise in these mice as a result of the increased cell survival induced by Akt activation triggered by loss of αv and p53, and by the defective recruitment of immune cells to these tumors, which may allow immune evasion. However, the defective vasculature and lack of a supportive stroma create a restrictive microenvironment in these SCCs that slows their growth. These mechanisms may underlie the rapid onset and slow growth of SCCs that lack p53 and αv."

Our studies demonstrate that in cells with targeted disruption of the Rictor gene, there is a reduction in IFN-inducible STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation and ISGF3-DNA complex formation, as well as diminished phosphorylation of STAT1 on serine 727, an event required for the full transcriptional activity of STAT1 (4Stark G.R.

The quality of RNA was analyzed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cRNA synthesis, MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip hybridization (Illumina), washing, and staining were performed as per the manufacturer instructions. Arrays were scanned on Illumina BeadStation 500. All array data were deposited in the GEO database (GEO identifier GSE47896). Probe average intensity signal was calculated with BeadStudio without background correction. Raw data were analyzed with Bioconductor using the one ChannelGUI package (30Sanges R. Cordero F.

In previous work we provided evidence that targeted knock-out of Rictor or mLST8 genes results in defective ISG expression and diminished antiviral responses (25Kaur S. Sassano A. Majchrzak-Kita B. Baker D.P. Su B. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Regulatory effects of mTORC2 complexes in type I IFN signaling and in the generation of IFN responses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 7723-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because our findings demonstrated that IFNα-inducible ISRE promoter activity requires Rictor and mLST8 expression (25Kaur S. Sassano A. Majchrzak-Kita B. Baker D.P. Su B. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Regulatory effects of mTORC2 complexes in type I IFN signaling and in the generation of IFN responses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 7723-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we performed studies to define potential mechanisms by which mTORC2 complexes may modulate IFN-dependent transcriptional activation of ISGs. At the outset we examined the effects of targeted disruption of the Rictor gene on phosphorylation of STAT1. Extensive previous work has established that phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine 701 is required for STAT dimerization (15Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. The JAK-STAT pathway at twenty.Immunity. 2012; 36: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 35Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Jak-STAT pathways and transcriptional activation in response to IFNs and other extracellular signaling proteins.Science. 1994; 264: 1415-14121Crossref PubMed Scopus (5009) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation on serine 727 is required for full transcriptional activation of the protein (4Stark G.R. How cells respond to interferons revisited. From early history to current complexity.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2007; 18: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Platanias L.C.

The JAK-STAT pathway at twenty.Immunity. 2012; 36: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). As expected, treatment of wild-type MEFs with IFNα resulted in phosphorylation of STAT1 on serine 727 (Fig. 1A). This phosphorylation was decreased in Rictor−/− MEFs (Fig. 1A), suggesting a defect in STAT1 serine kinase activity in the absence of the Rictor gene. It should be noted that some decrease in the protein levels of STAT1 was noticeable in Rictor−/− cells, but this relatively modest decrease does not account for the substantial reduction in Ser727 STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Notably, phosphorylation of STAT1 on Tyr701 was intact in the absence of Rictor (Fig. 1B). Similarly, IFNα inducible phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727 was diminished in Sin1−/− MEFs (Fig. 1C), whereas phosphorylation of STAT1 on Tyr701 was IFN-inducible (Fig. 1D). In subsequent studies we sought to determine whether shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rictor in malignant hematopoietic cells also results in diminished STAT1-Ser727 phosphorylation. U937 myelomonocytic leukemia cells were stably infected with either control shRNA or Rictor shRNA, using lentiviral infection. IFN induction of Ser727 STAT1 phosphorylation was found to be selectively impaired in Rictor shRNA-expressing, but not control shRNA-expressing, cells (Fig. 1E). Similarly, Sin1 knockdown also resulted in decreased IFN-inducible STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation (Fig. 1F). In contrast, IFN-inducible tyrosine 701 STAT1 phosphorylation was unaffected by Sin1 knockdown in U937 cells (Fig. 1G). We also assessed the effect of Rictor or Sin1 knock-out on IFN-induced STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of STAT2 on tyrosine 689 plays a role in formation of the ISGF3 transcription complex and IFN-induced transcription of genes (36Qureshi S.A. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2091985078,"The tumor suppressor p53 is a central regulatory molecule of apoptosis and is commonly mutated in tumors. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-related malignancies express wild-type p53. Accordingly, KSHV encodes proteins that counteract the cell death-inducing effects of p53. Here, the effects of all KSHV genes on the p53 signaling pathway were systematically analyzed using the reversely transfected cell microarray technology. With this approach we detected eight KSHV-encoded genes with potent p53 inhibiting activity in addition to the previously described inhibitory effects of KSHV genes ORF50, K10 and K10.5. Interestingly, the three most potent newly identified inhibitors were KSHV structural proteins, namely ORF22 (glycoprotein H), ORF25 (major capsid protein) and ORF64 (tegument protein). Validation of these results with a classical transfection approach showed that these proteins inhibited p53 signaling in a dose-dependent manner and that this effect could be reversed by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the respective viral gene. All three genes inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis in response to Nutlin-3 treatment in non-infected and KSHV-infected cells. Addressing putative mechanisms, we could show that these proteins could also inhibit the transactivation of the promoters of apoptotic mediators of p53 such as BAX and PIG3. Altogether, we demonstrate for the first time that structural proteins of KSHV can counteract p53-induced apoptosis. These proteins are expressed in the late lytic phase of the viral life cycle and are incorporated into the KSHV virion. Accordingly, these genes may inhibit cell death in the productive and in the early entrance phase of KSHV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2019078052,"Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains are a widely expanded superfamily that act as interaction motifs or as structural spacers in multidomain proteins. Vertebrate filamins (FLNs), which are multifunctional actin-binding proteins, consist of 24 Ig domains. We have recently discovered that in the C-terminal rod 2 region of FLN, Ig domains interact with each other forming functional domain pairs, where the interaction with signaling and transmembrane proteins is mechanically regulated by weak actomyosin contraction forces. Here, we investigated if there are similar inter-domain interactions around domain 4 in the N-terminal rod 1 region of FLN. Protein crystal structures revealed a new type of domain organization between domains 3, 4, and 5. In this module, domains 4 and 5 interact rather tightly, whereas domain 3 has a partially flexible interface with domain 4. NMR peptide titration experiments showed that within the three-domain module, domain 4 is capable for interaction with a peptide derived from platelet glycoprotein Ib. Crystal structures of FLN domains 4 and 5 in complex with the peptide revealed a typical β sheet augmentation interaction observed for many FLN ligands. Domain 5 was found to stabilize domain 4, and this could provide a mechanism for the regulation of domain 4 interactions.

Filamins (FLNs) 3The abbreviations used are: FLNfilaminGPIbglycoprotein IbEOMensemble optimization methodMDmolecular dynamicsSAXSsmall angle x-ray scatteringHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherencePDBProtein Data Bank. are homodimeric actin cross-linking proteins that are required for multicellular tissue differentiation. All three FLN genes (FLNA, FLNB, and FLNC) are essential in mouse and truncation or substitution mutations cause developmental defects in humans (1.Fürst D.O. Goldfarb L.G. Kley R.A. Vorgerd M.

The diversity of phenotypes caused by FLN mutations can be explained by at least 90 proteins that interact with FLNs (3.Nakamura F. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. The filamins. Organizers of cell structure and function.Cell Adh. Migr. 2011; 5: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The interaction partners can be classified to at least three different categories: transmembrane proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and intracellular signaling proteins. Thus, FLNs are involved in stabilization and regulation of plasma membrane, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and intracellular signaling (3.Nakamura F. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. The filamins.

Structurally, vertebrate FLNs consist of an N-terminal actin-binding domain and 24 immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains (the dimer is shown in Fig. 1). Domains 1–15 are referred to as rod 1 and 16–24 as rod 2. The structure of the actin-binding domain is similar to that of α-actinin and is composed of two calponin homology domains (9.Gorlin J.B.

They often interact with other proteins by a β sheet augmentation mechanism. In this mechanism, the interaction partner forms an additional β-strand next to the strand C of the FLN domain and simultaneously interacts with the hydrophobic groove between the strands C and D, called the CD face (11.Nakamura F.

To find out if similar structural mechanisms could regulate the interactions of FLN domain 4, we solved the crystal structures of FLNa domains 3–5, FLNc domains 4–5, and FLNc domains 4–5 in complex with GPIb peptide. These structures disclosed a completely new type of interaction between three Ig domains. Fragments of the human FLNC and FLNA cDNA (GenBankTM AJ012737 and AB593010.1) were PCR amplified according to the predicted domain boundaries (7.van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Structural and functional aspects of filamins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and cloned to the GST fusion protein vector pGTVL1 (Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Oxford) according to the ligation-independent cloning method (28.Gileadi O.

The final products were verified by DNA sequencing. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Gold cells (Agilent Technologies) at 37 °C for 4 h with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial pellets were lysed using French press. The proteins were captured with glutathione-agarose column (Protino glutathione-agarose 4B, Macherey-Nagel), released with Tobacco Etch virus protease (Invitrogen), and further purified by size exclusion chromatography with a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (FLNc fragments), and 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (FLNa fragments). Finally, the proteins were concentrated using Centriprep YM-10000 (Millipore). Mutants were generated using the QuikChange Multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). 13C/15N-Labeled FLNc4–5, FLNc5, and FLNa3–5 were expressed in E. coli in standard d-glucose/M9 minimal medium. These proteins were purified in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT using the same protocol as described above for the unlabeled fragments. Crystallization trials with hanging drop vapor diffusion method were set up for the purified recombinant proteins at room temperature. First crystals for FLNc4–5 were obtained in 1.4 m sodium potassium phosphate. The condition was optimized using a gradient of salt concentration and the final crystals were mounted from 1.6 m sodium potassium phosphate. These were first cryo-protected by adding 30% glycerol (final concentration) to the mother liquor and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The crystals for FLNa3–5 were obtained in 0.1 m sodium malonate, pH 4, 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3,350, and frozen in liquid nitrogen using 0.1 m sodium malonate, pH 4, 35% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3,350. Equimolar mixture (1 mm each) of FLNc4–5 with GPIb peptide (residues 573–596, RGSLPTFRSSLFLWVRPNGRVGPL, numbering according to Uniprot ID P07359) was used to obtain co-crystals in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 8,000 using a 1:2 ratio of protein to mother liquor. The crystals were cryo-protected with 6.6% ethylene glycol and 16.6% glycerol. The diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the ESRF beamline ID23-1 (wavelength = 1.07227 Å) (FLNc4–5) and ID29 (wavelength = 0.976250 Å) (FLNa3–5 and FLNc4–5/GPIb). The data were processed with XDS (29.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Phys. 1939; 12: 161-237Crossref Google Scholar), where at very small angles (s × Rg < 1.3), the scattering intensity is the following. l(s)=l(0)exp(-1/3(Rgs)2)(Eq. 1) The distance distribution functions p(r) and the maximum particle dimensions Dmax were calculated for all fragments using the program GNOM (44.Svergun D.I. Determination of the regularization parameter in indirect-transform methods using perceptual criteria.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2945) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the constructs were evaluated by comparing the forward scattering with that from reference solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with molecular mass 66 kDa using Equation 2. Mwsample=l(0)sample×Mwref/l(0)ref(Eq. 2) Assuming the samples are monodisperse, Porod's law was applied to find out the excluded volume of the hydrated particle as, V=2π2l(0)/∫0∞s2 lexp(s)ds(Eq. 3) and to check the S−4 decay in scattering intensity at higher angles (45.Rambo R.P.

Kratky plot (46.Kratky O. Glatter O. Small angle x-ray scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar) (I(s) × s2 versus s) was evaluated to check for the flexibility of the protein at higher scattering angles. The scattering patterns were further used to generate low resolution ab initio models of FLNc4–5 and FLNa3–5 by the programs DAMMIF (47.Franke D. Svergun D.I. DAMMIF, a program for rapid ab-initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2009; 42: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar) or GASBOR (48.Svergun D.I.

J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Ten rounds of DAMMIF or GASBOR were done to generate models that were averaged using the program DAMAVER (49.Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. Uniqueness of ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) to find the best model with common structural features. The scattering intensities of the crystal structures of FLNc4–5 (Protein Data Bank code 3V8O) and FLNa3–5 (PDB code 4M9P) were calculated using CRYSOL (50.Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. CRYSOL. A program to evaluate x-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) and the superposition of the DAMAVER generated envelope with the respective crystal structures are done with the SUPCOMB program of the ATSAS package and the figures are made using PyMOL. To assess the flexibility of domain 3 in the FLNa and FLNc3–5 fragments, the ensemble optimization method (EOM) (51.Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. Structural characterization of flexible proteins using small-angle x-ray scattering.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) was used. Similar analysis was performed for FLNc4–5 as an internal control. First, 10,000 randomized models (pool) were generated for each fragment using the native chain option in the RanCH program of the EOM package. The scattering profiles of each of these models were compared with the experimental scattering of the respective fragments (FLNa3–5, FLNc3–5, and FLNc4–5). A genetic algorithm was used to select a set of representative models (FLNa3–5 = 24; FLNc3–5 = 18, and FLNc4–5 = 12) from the pool such that the average scattering from the selected models fits the experimental scattering. The results were represented as Rg and Dmax distribution profiles using GraphPad Prism version 4 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Pull-down assays were performed using GST-tagged FLNc4 bound to glutathione-agarose resin. 1–20 μm FLNc5 and FLNc5R755D was allowed to interact for 1 h at 23 °C after which the resin was washed three times with 500 μl of PBS, 1 mm DTT and eluted with 10 μl of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie stain. Intensities of the protein bands were quantified by ImageJ (52.Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ. 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34883) Google Scholar). Data were plotted using GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows to produce a non-linear regression curve for one site total and nonspecific binding (specific = Bmax × X/(X + Kd); nonspecific = NS × X + background, where X = ligand concentration). Thermal stability of FLNc4, FLNc5, and FLNc4–5 was determined using Bio-Rad C1000 thermal cycler, CFx96 Real-Time system. Unfolding of the proteins was monitored using the fluorescent dye SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen), which binds to the hydrophobic core of the protein as it unfolds. A temperature gradient was set up from 20 to 95 °C with 0.5 °C/30-s increments. Each sample contained 100 μm protein, except FLNc4 (150 μm), and 5× dye in 25 μl total volume. NMR samples were prepared in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT buffer at pH 7.0. D2O was added to obtain ∼8% solutions. Protein concentrations were 0.4–1.2 mm. Measurement temperatures were 28 °C for FLNc5 and FLNc4–5, and 35 °C for FLNa3–5. For the chemical"

Previously, we identified a homolog of the Stil gene in zebrafish mutant (night blindness b, nbb), which showed neural defects in the retina (e.g. dopaminergic cell degeneration and/or lack of regeneration). In this research, we examined the roles of Stil in cell proliferation after degeneration in adult zebrafish retinas. We demonstrated that knockdown of Stil gene expression or inhibition of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling transduction decreases the rate of cell proliferation. In contrast, activation of Shh signal transduction promotes cell proliferation. In nbb(+/-) retinas, inhibition of SUFU (a repressor in the Shh pathway) rescues the defects in cell proliferation due to down-regulation of Stil gene expression. The latter data suggest that Stil play a role in cell proliferation through the Shh signal transduction pathway."

Here, we tested if the drim2 gene also encodes for a deoxynucleotide transporter in the fruit fly. The protein was localized to mitochondria. Drosophila S2R(+) cells, silenced for drim2 expression, contained markedly reduced pools of both purine and pyrimidine dNTPs in mitochondria, whereas cytosolic pools were unaffected. In vivo drim2 homozygous knock-out was lethal at the larval stage, preceded by the following: (i) impaired locomotor behavior; (ii) decreased rates of oxygen consumption, and (iii) depletion of mtDNA.

https://openalex.org/W2016912029,"Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) is silenced by promoter methylation in many types of tumors, yet ASC's role in most cancers remains unknown. Here, we show that ASC is highly expressed in a model of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain cancer; ASC is also expressed in human medulloblastomas. Importantly, while ASC deficiency did not affect normal cerebellar development, ASC knockout mice on the Smoothened (ND2:SmoA1) transgenic model of medulloblastoma exhibited a profound reduction in medulloblastoma incidence and a delayed tumor onset. A similar decrease in tumorigenesis with ASC deficiency was also seen in the hGFAP-Cre:SmoM2 mouse model of medulloblastoma. Interestingly, hyperproliferation of the external granule layer (EGL) was comparable at P20 in both wild-type and ASC-deficient SmoA1 mice. However, while the apoptosis and differentiation markers remained unchanged at this age, proliferation makers were decreased, and the EGL was reduced in thickness and area by P60. This reduction in proliferation with ASC deficiency was also seen in isolated SmoA1 cerebellar granule precursor cells in vitro, indicating that the effect of ASC deletion on proliferation was cell autonomous. Interestingly, ASC-deficient SmoA1 cerebella exhibited disrupted expression of genes in the transforming growth factor-β pathway and increased level of nuclear Smad3. Taken together, these results demonstrate an unexpected role for ASC in Sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma tumorigenesis, thus identifying ASC as a promising novel target for antitumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2034315691,"The silencing of large chromosomal regions by epigenetic mechanisms has been reported to occur frequently in cancer. Epigenetic marks, such as histone methylation and acetylation, are altered at these loci. However, the mechanisms of formation of such aberrant gene clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled by changes in higher-order chromatin structures. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that regional epigenetic silencing corresponds to the establishment of compact chromatin domains. We show that gene repression is tightly correlated to the state of chromatin compaction and not to the levels of H3K27me3-its removal through the knockdown of EZH2 does not induce significant gene expression nor chromatin decompaction. Moreover, transcription can occur with intact high-H3K27me3 levels; treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors can relieve chromatin compaction and gene repression, without altering H3K27me3 levels. Our findings imply that compaction and subsequent repression of large chromatin domains are not direct consequences of PRC2 deregulation in cancer cells. By challenging the role of EZH2 in aberrant gene silencing in cancer, these findings have therapeutical implications, notably for the choice of epigenetic drugs for tumors with multiple regional epigenetic alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2090809712,"Background The antifungal compound ketoconazole has, in addition to its ability to interfere with fungal ergosterol synthesis, effects upon other enzymes including human CYP3A4, CYP17, lipoxygenase and thromboxane synthetase. In the present study, we have investigated whether ketoconazole affects the cellular uptake and hydrolysis of the endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand anandamide (AEA). Methodology/Principal Findings The effects of ketoconazole upon endocannabinoid uptake were investigated using HepG2, CaCo2, PC-3 and C6 cell lines. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity was measured in HepG2 cell lysates and in intact C6 cells. Ketoconazole inhibited the uptake of AEA by HepG2 cells and CaCo2 cells with IC50 values of 17 and 18 µM, respectively. In contrast, it had modest effects upon AEA uptake in PC-3 cells, which have a low expression of FAAH. In cell-free HepG2 lysates, ketoconazole inhibited FAAH activity with an IC50 value (for the inhibitable component) of 34 µM. Conclusions/Significance The present study indicates that ketoconazole can inhibit the cellular uptake of AEA at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, primarily due to its effects upon FAAH. Ketoconazole may be useful as a template for the design of dual-action FAAH/CYP17 inhibitors as a novel strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer."

Extracytosolic environments, in contrast with the cell interior, are particularly harsh and oxidizing. A large number of proteins in these environments contain disulfide bonds. These covalent linkages increase protein stability (3.Waschütza G. Li V. Schäfer T. Schomburg D. Villmann C. Zakaria H. Otto B.

The Trx fold (Fig. 1A), the main structural element of the Trx superfamily, is abundant in these environments and is involved in oxidative protein folding and electron transfer pathways. This fold is a minimal version of the Trx structure (Fig. 1B) (6.Martin J.L. Thioredoxin–a fold for all reasons.Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) that is found in glutaredoxins, protein-disulfide isomerases, oxidases and reductases, glutathione transferases and peroxidases, chloride intracellular channels, and cytochrome c maturation proteins (7.Collet J.F. Messens J. Structure, function, and mechanism of thioredoxin proteins.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The Trx fold is so often present beyond the cytosol because it has proven to be a stable protein scaffold that can carry out oxidation, reduction, or isomerization of disulfide bonds and has the potential to adapt depending on the environment in which it functions. Proteins with a Trx fold function by participating in thiol-disulfide exchange reactions via their catalytic active-site -CXXC- motif (the location of the two cysteines of this motif is indicated in Fig. 1, A and B). The mechanism of this type of reaction is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (Fig. 1C). The net result is the oxidation of the original thiol-containing protein (reduced species) and the concomitant reduction of the disulfide-bearing protein (oxidized species). Depending on whether the Trx-fold protein is an oxidase or a reductase/isomerase, it could be either of the two species. The exchange reaction is driven by the reduction potential of the protein initiating the nucleophilic attack (reduced species). However, the rate at which it occurs largely depends on the pKa value of the nucleophilic cysteine (8.Shaked Z. Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M.

Numerous studies have focused either on specific characteristics of proteins with a Trx fold that explain their biophysical properties and function or on the comparison of the amino acid sequence of the active-site -CXXC- motif that has been proposed to play a significant role in determining the reduction potential and pKa value of the N-terminal cysteine (16.Chivers P.T.

However, it is still not clear how the same protein fold can accommodate such a variety of functions making it difficult to predict the function of new Trx-fold proteins. The transmembrane thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase DsbD is a three-domain protein responsible for shuttling electrons from the cytoplasm to the oxidizing periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. Its central domain (tmDsbD) is located in the inner bacterial membrane and is flanked by two periplasmic globular domains (nDsbD, the N-terminal domain, and cDsbD, the C-terminal domain). The transfer of reductive power occurs via sequential thiol-disulfide exchange reactions involving conserved cysteine residues, starting from cytoplasmic Trx and ending with reduced nDsbD (19.Katzen F.

Thus, it acts as a mediator between two non-Trx folds. The reduction of nDsbD by cDsbD has been extensively studied. The x-ray structure of the nDsbD-cDsbD mixed disulfide species has been determined (30.Rozhkova A. Stirnimann C.U. Frei P. Grauschopf U. Brunisholz R. Grütter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R.

A schematic representation of the three-dimensional structure of cDsbD is shown in Fig. 2A; important residues in the active site are highlighted. We have demonstrated that the pKa value of the N-terminal cysteine residue (C461) of the cDsbD -CXXC- motif is exceptionally high, 10.6, protecting the reduced domain from unwanted side reactions. Upon binding to nDsbD, this pKa value is lowered in order for reduction of nDsbD to take place. More recently, we have found that the relatively weak affinities of cDsbD for nDsbD are oxidation state-dependent (33.Mavridou D.A. Saridakis E. Kritsiligkou P. Goddard A.D. Stevens J.M.

The system is finely tuned to ensure that cDsbDred will form a complex with nDsbDox so that reductant transfer can occur and that the resulting cDsbDox and nDsbDred will then dissociate so that they are free to interact with tmDsbDred and DsbC or CcmG, respectively. The pKa value of 10.6 found for Cys-461 in cDsbD is the highest reported pKa for the N-terminal cysteine of the -CXXC- motif in thioredoxin family members (18.Roos G. Foloppe N. Messens J. Understanding the pKa of redox cysteines: the key role of hydrogen bonding.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 94-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have shown by mutagenesis that this high pKa value results from the close proximity of two conserved acidic residues (Asp-455 and Glu-468) to Cys-461 (31.Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. Active-site properties of the oxidized and reduced C-terminal domain of DsbD obtained by NMR spectroscopy.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 643-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The chemical shifts of the side chain amide of a glutamine (Gln-488) in the active site also reflect the titration of the carboxyl side chains of Asp-455 and Glu-468 (31.Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. Active-site properties of the oxidized and reduced C-terminal domain of DsbD obtained by NMR spectroscopy.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 643-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The side chain of Gln-488 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp-455 and is in close proximity to the side chain of Glu-468 (Fig. 2A) (29.Stirnimann C.U. Rozhkova A. Grauschopf U. Böckmann R.A. Glockshuber R. Capitani G. Grütter M.G. High-resolution structures of Escherichia coli cDsbD in different redox states: A combined crystallographic, biochemical and computational study.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 829-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The role of Gln-488 in fine-tuning the reactivity of the active-site cysteines of cDsbD is investigated here using a combination of NMR-based pKa determination and in vivo measurements of the activity of the full-length protein. These are complemented with detailed structural information obtained using x-ray crystallography. The DsbD-specific data along with a comparative sequence analysis of Trx-fold proteins lead us to propose that an extended active-site motif plays an important role in the function of proteins with a Trx fold. Plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. The plasmid pDzc1a, described in previous work (31.Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. Active-site properties of the oxidized and reduced C-terminal domain of DsbD obtained by NMR spectroscopy.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 643-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), encodes isolated wild-type cDsbD bearing a thrombin-cleavable C-terminal polyhistidine tag. This construct was used as a template to produce a Q488A and a Q488K variant of isolated cDsbD; site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Qiagen) was performed using oligonucleotides DM1/DM2 and DM3/DM4, respectively. The resulting plasmids were named pDzc10 (Q488A-cDsbD) and pDzc12 (Q488K-cDsbD). pDzc10 was subsequently used as a template to produce a D455N/Q488A variant of cDsbD using oligonucleotides DM5/DM6; the resulting plasmid was named pDzc13. The plasmid pDsbd1, described in previous work (33.Mavridou D.A. Saridakis E. Kritsiligkou P. Goddard A.D. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. Oxidation state-dependent protein-protein interactions in disulfide cascades.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24943-24956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), encodes full-length wild-type DsbD bearing a C-terminal streptavidin II tag. This construct was used as a template to produce a Q488A and a Q488K variant of full-length DsbD using oligonucleotides DM1/DM2 and DM3/DM4, respectively. The resulting plasmids were named pDsbd7 (Q488A-DsbD) and pDsbd10 (Q488K-DsbD). DNA manipulations were conducted using standard methods. KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) was used for all PCRs, and all constructs were sequenced and confirmed to be correct before use. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. Isolated wild-type cDsbD, Q488A-cDsbD, Q488K-cDsbD, D455N/Q488A-cDsbD, and wild-type nDsbD were expressed using BL21(DE3) cells (supplemental Tables S1 and S3) and were purified from periplasmic extracts of Escherichia coli using a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. Production and purification of all proteins were carried out as described in previous work (31.Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C.

Thrombin cleavage of the affinity tag, when necessary, was performed using the Thrombin CleanCleave kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Oxidation and reduction of the single disulfide bond in each protein were carried out as follows. 5,5′-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was used to oxidize the Cys-103–Cys-109 and Cys-461–Cys-464 disulfide bonds in nDsbD and cDsbD, respectively. 10 mm DTNB was added, and the mixture was incubated at 27 °C for 30 min. Excess DTNB could not be removed completely by simple concentration and re-dilution using a concentration device; proteins were therefore re-purified using their C-terminal polyhistidine or streptavidin II tag, as described previously (33.Mavridou D.A. Saridakis E. Kritsiligkou P. Goddard A.D. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. Oxidation state-dependent protein-protein interactions in disulfide cascades.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24943-24956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds in nDsbD and cDsbD samples were reduced using 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The presence or absence of the Cys-103–Cys-109 and Cys-461–Cys-464 disulfide bonds was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy using the published NMR resonance assignments for nDsbD and cDsbD, respectively (27.Bushell K.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. 1H, 15N, and 13C assignments of the carboxy-terminal domain of the transmembrane electron transfer protein DsbD.J. Biomol.

NMR Assign. 2012; 6: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). All proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to confirm that they were pure and of the expected masses. SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out on 10% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) using MES/SDS running buffer prepared according to Invitrogen specifications and including pre-stained protein markers (Invitrogen, SeeBlue Plus 2). ESI-MS was performed using a Micromass Bio-Q II-ZS triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (10-μl protein samples in 1:1 water/acetonitrile, 1% formic acid at a concentration of 20 pmol μl−1 were injected into the electrospray source at a flow rate of 10 μl min−1). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit-reducing agent compatible (Thermo Scientific), following the manufacturer's instructions. The effect of the single amino acid substitutions (Q488A and Q488K) on the standard reduction potential of cDsbD was examined by exploiting the direct relationship of this value to the equilibrium constant for the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction of cDsbD with nDsbD. The equilibrium constant for the reaction of nDsbD with wild-type, Q488A-, or Q488K-cDsbD was compared by analysis of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels for the forward thiol-disulfide exchange reaction (starting with nDsbDox and wild-type, Q488A-, or Q488K-cDsbDred) after AMS labeling. Protein concentrations of 0.4 μm were used, and the oxidation state of the protein partners at the start of the reactions was strictly controlled. Each reaction proceeded for 60 min at 25 °C. AMS alkylation of the reaction mixtures was performed by vortexing the protein solutions in 15 mm AMS (Invitrogen), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 3% w/v SDS, and 3 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out using 12% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). The activity of Q488A- and Q488K-DsbD in vivo was compared with that of wild-type DsbD. The E. coli MC1000 (ΔDsbD) strain (supplemental Table S3) was complemented by plasmids pDsbd1, pDsbd3, pDsbd7, or pDsbd10 (supplemental Table S1) expressing full-length wild-type, C464A-, Q488A-, or Q488K-DsbD, respectively. Cells were also transformed with plasmid pRZ001 (supplemental Table S1), expressing Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome cd1, the cytochrome c chosen to assess the activity of DsbD. The MC1000 parental strain, transformed with pRZ001, served as a positive control. Cell growth and fractionation were performed as described in Ref. 33.Mavridou D.A. Saridakis E. Kritsiligkou P. Goddard A.D. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. Oxidation state-dependent protein-protein interactions in disulfide cascades.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24943-24956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. Autoinduction was used for expression of all DsbD constructs and of cytochrome cd1. SDS-PAGE analysis of the periplasmic fractions was carried out as described above, and gels were stained for covalently bound heme according to the method of Goodhew et al. (35.Goodhew C.F. Brown K.R. Pettigrew G.W. Haem staining in gels, a useful tool in the study of bacterial c-type cytochromes.BBA-Bioenergetics. 1986; 852: 288-294Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Gel loadings were normalized according to wet cell pellet weights. Densitometry was used to quantify cytochrome cd1 production using GeneSnap (SYNGENE). The linear relationship between the amount of mature cd1 present on the gel and the amount detected by densitometry was ensured by using subsaturated loading on the gels (36.Goddard A.D. Stevens J.M. Rao F. Mavridou D.A. Chan W. Richardson D.J. Allen J.W. Ferguson S.J. c-Type cytochrome biogenesis can occur via a natural Ccm system lacking CcmH, CcmG, and the heme-binding histidine of CcmE.J.

The activity of Q488A- or Q488K-DsbD is expressed as a percentage of the activity of wild-type DsbD, as measured by densitometry. In each experiment, three growths of the variant (Q488A- or Q488K-DsbD) and three growths of wild-type DsbD were carried out, and covalently bound heme was quantified for each growth. Three separate experiments, for bacterial cultures grown on different days, were collected to assess the activity of Q488A-DsbD (Datasets 1–3) and two separate experiments for Q488K-DsbD (Datasets 1 and 2). The individual densitometry readings and the average values for each dataset are reported in Table 1 for the variant and wild-type DsbD. These replicates allow the errors in the reported activity of Q488A- and Q488K-DsbD to be quantified (Table 1).TABLE 1In vivo activity measurements for wild-type, Q488A- and Q488K-DsbDConstructDataset 1Dataset 2Dataset 3Raw dataMean and S.D.Raw dataMean and S.D.Raw dataMean and S.D.Wild-type DsbD17,65620,301 ± 2581 (7%)19,31319,792 ± 887 (3%)19,62918,781 ± 1271 (4%)22,81220,81517,31920,43419,24819,394Q488A-DsbD15,21815,714 ± 964 (4%)14,50715,565 ± 1238 (5%)13,21014,223 ± 925 (4%)16,82515,26115,02415,09816,92714,434% Relative activity77 ± 1179 ± 776 ± 7Average % relative activity77 ± 5Wild-type DsbD25,81725,015 ± 2049 (5%)18,85618,362 ± 589 (2%)26,54218,51922,68717,710Q488K-DsbD25,61025,579 ± 534 (1%)22,41122,422 ± 387 (1%)26,09722,81425,03022,041% Relative activity102 ± 9122 ± 4Average % relative activity112 ± 5 Open table in a new tab The expression of C464A-, Q488A-, and Q488K-DsbD at comparable levels to that of wild-type DsbD was confirmed by Western blotting of normalized whole cell extracts.

The oxidation state of samples for NMR spectroscopy was controlled as described above. Spectra were collected using home-built 500, 600, and 750 MHz NMR spectrometers, controlled with GE/Omega software and equipped with home-built triple-resonance pulsed-field gradient probe heads. The 1HN and 15N resonances of oxidized and reduced Q488A- and Q488K-cDsbD were assigned using uniformly 15N-labeled samples of 1 mm protein in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 6.5. Assignments were obtained by comparison of three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra for oxidized and reduced Q488A- and Q488K-cDsbD with the spectra of oxidized and reduced wild-type cDsbD (27.Bushell K.M.
