https://openalex.org/W2145763822,"Normal epithelial cells regulate the secretion of autocrine and paracrine factors that prevent aberrant growth of neighboring cells, leading to healthy development and normal metabolism. One reason for tumor initiation is considered to be a failure of this homeostatic cell competitive system. Here we identify tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs) secreted by normal cells as anti-proliferative signal entities. Culture supernatant of normal epithelial prostate PNT-2 cells attenuated proliferation of PC-3M-luc cells, prostate cancer cells. Global analysis of miRNA expression signature revealed that a variety of tumor-suppressive miRNAs are released from PNT-2 cells. Of these miRNAs, secretory miR-143 could induce growth inhibition exclusively in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that secretory tumor-suppressive miRNAs can act as a death signal in a cell competitive process. This study provides a novel insight into a tumor initiation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2013687599,"Analyzing the effects on cell growth inhibition and/or cell death has been an important component of biological research. The MTS assay and LDH-based cytotoxicity assays are two of the most commonly used methods for this purpose. However, data here showed that MTS cell proliferation assay could not distinguish the effects of cell death or cell growth inhibition. In addition, the original LDH-based cytotoxicity protocol grossly underestimated the proportion of dead cells in conditions with growth inhibition. To overcome the limitation, we present here a simple modified LDH-based cytotoxicity protocol by adding additional condition-specific controls. This modified protocol thus can provide more accurate measurement of killing effects in addition to the measurement of overall effects, especially in conditions with growth inhibition. In summary, we present here a simple, modified cytotoxicity assay, which can determine the overall effects, percentage of cell killing and growth inhibition in one 96-well based assay. This is a viable option for primary screening for many laboratories, and could be adapted for high throughput screening."
https://openalex.org/W2052196162,"The intestinal crypt-niche interaction is thought to be essential to the function, maintenance, and proliferation of progenitor stem cells found at the bases of intestinal crypts. These stem cells are constantly renewing the intestinal epithelium by sending differentiated cells from the base of the crypts of Lieberkühn to the villus tips where they slough off into the intestinal lumen. The intestinal niche consists of various cell types, extracellular matrix, and growth factors and surrounds the intestinal progenitor cells. There have recently been advances in the understanding of the interactions that regulate the behavior of the intestinal epithelium and there is great interest in methods for isolating and expanding viable intestinal epithelium. However, there is no method to maintain primary human small intestinal epithelium in culture over a prolonged period of time. Similarly no method has been published that describes isolation and support of human intestinal epithelium in an in vivo model. We describe a technique to isolate and maintain human small intestinal epithelium in vitro from surgical specimens. We also describe a novel method to maintain human intestinal epithelium subcutaneously in a mouse model for a prolonged period of time. Our methods require various growth factors and the intimate interaction between intestinal sub-epithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) and the intestinal epithelial cells to support the epithelial in vitro and in vivo growth. Absence of these myofibroblasts precluded successful maintenance of epithelial cell formation and proliferation beyond just a few days, even in the presence of supportive growth factors. We believe that the methods described here can be used to explore the molecular basis of human intestinal stem cell support, maintenance, and growth."
https://openalex.org/W1994995334,"Brain energy deficit has been a suggested cause of Huntington disease (HD), but ATP depletion has not reliably been shown in preclinical models, possibly because of the immediate post-mortem changes in cellular energy metabolism. To examine a potential role of a low energy state in HD, we measured, for the first time in a neurodegenerative model, brain levels of high energy phosphates using microwave fixation, which instantaneously inactivates brain enzymatic activities and preserves in vivo levels of analytes. We studied HD transgenic R6/2 mice at ages 4, 8, and 12 weeks. We found significantly increased creatine and phosphocreatine, present as early as 4 weeks for phosphocreatine, preceding motor system deficits and decreased ATP levels in striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex of R6/2 mice. ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations were inversely correlated with the number of CAG repeats. Conversely, in mice injected with 3-nitroproprionic acid, an acute model of brain energy deficit, both ATP and phosphocreatine were significantly reduced. Increased creatine and phosphocreatine in R6/2 mice was associated with decreased guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase and creatine kinase, both at the protein and RNA levels, and increased phosphorylated AMP-dependent protein kinase (pAMPK) over AMPK ratio. In addition, in 4-month-old knock-in Hdh(Q111/+) mice, the earliest metabolic alterations consisted of increased phosphocreatine in the frontal cortex and increased the pAMPK/AMPK ratio. Altogether, this study provides the first direct evidence of chronic alteration in homeostasis of high energy phosphates in HD models in the earliest stages of the disease, indicating possible reduced utilization of the brain phosphocreatine pool."
https://openalex.org/W2114089657,"It is widely accepted that biodiversity is lower in more extreme environments. In this study, we sought to determine whether this trend, well documented for macroorganisms, also holds at the microbial level for bacteria. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with phylum-specific primers to quantify the taxon richness (i.e., the DGGE band numbers) of the bacterioplankton communities of 32 pristine Tibetan lakes that represent a broad salinity range (freshwater to hypersaline). For the lakes investigated, salinity was found to be the environmental variable with the strongest influence on the bacterial community composition. We found that the bacterial taxon richness in freshwater habitats increased with increasing salinity up to a value of 1‰. In saline systems (systems with >1‰ salinity), the expected decrease of taxon richness along a gradient of further increasing salinity was not observed. These patterns were consistently observed for two sets of samples taken in two different years. A comparison of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed that the bacterial community of the lake with the highest salinity was characterized by a higher recent accelerated diversification than the community of a freshwater lake, whereas the phylogenetic diversity in the hypersaline lake was lower than that in the freshwater lake. These results suggest that different evolutionary forces may act on bacterial populations in freshwater and hypersaline lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, potentially resulting in different community structures and diversity patterns."

Beyond secondhand smoke exposure and socio-economic status, the effect of specific environmental factors on CF lung function is largely unknown.Multivariate regression was used to assess correlation between specific environmental factors, the presence of pulmonary pathogens, and variation in lung function using subjects enrolled in the U.S. CF Twin and Sibling Study (CFTSS: n = 1378). Significant associations were tested for replication in the U.S. CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFF: n = 16439), the Australian CF Data Registry (ACFDR: n = 1801), and prospectively ascertained subjects from Australia/New Zealand (ACFBAL: n = 167).In CFTSS subjects, the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR = 1.06 per °F; p<0.001) was associated with warmer annual ambient temperatures. This finding was independently replicated in the CFF (1.02; p<0.001), ACFDR (1.05; p = 0.002), and ACFBAL (1.09; p = 0.003) subjects. Warmer temperatures (-0.34 points per °F; p = 0.005) and public insurance (-6.43 points; p<0.001) were associated with lower lung function in the CFTSS subjects. These findings were replicated in the CFF subjects (temperature: -0.31; p<0.001; insurance: -9.11; p<0.001) and similar in the ACFDR subjects (temperature: -0.23; p = 0.057). The association between temperature and lung function was minimally influenced by P. aeruginosa. Similarly, the association between temperature and P. aeruginosa was largely independent of lung function.Ambient temperature is associated with prevalence of P. aeruginosa and lung function in four independent samples of CF patients from two continents."
https://openalex.org/W2004779023,"Cancer therapy selects for cancer cells resistant to treatment, a process that is fundamentally evolutionary. To what extent, however, is the evolutionary perspective employed in research on therapeutic resistance and relapse? We analyzed 6,228 papers on therapeutic resistance and/or relapse in cancers and found that the use of evolution terms in abstracts has remained at about 1% since the 1980s. However, detailed coding of 22 recent papers revealed a higher proportion of papers using evolutionary methods or evolutionary theory, although this number is still less than 10%. Despite the fact that relapse and therapeutic resistance is essentially an evolutionary process, it appears that this framework has not permeated research. This represents an unrealized opportunity for advances in research on therapeutic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2042137111,"Nature is organized into complex, dynamical networks of species and their interactions, which may influence diversity and stability. However, network research is, generally, short-term and depict ecological networks as static structures only, devoid of any dynamics. This hampers our understanding of how nature responds to larger disturbances such as changes in climate. In order to remedy this we studied the long-term (12-yrs) dynamics of a flower-visitation network, consisting of flower-visiting butterflies and their nectar plants. Global network properties, i.e. numbers of species and links, as well as connectance, were temporally stable, whereas most species and links showed a strong temporal dynamics. However, species of butterflies and plants varied bimodally in their temporal persistance: Sporadic species, being present only 1-2(-5) years, and stable species, being present (9-)11-12 years, dominated the networks. Temporal persistence and linkage level of species, i.e. number of links to other species, made up two groups of species: Specialists with a highly variable temporal persistence, and temporally stable species with a highly variable linkage level. Turnover of links of specialists was driven by species turnover, whereas turnover of links among generalists took place through rewiring, i.e. by reshuffling existing interactions. However, in spite of this strong internal dynamics of species and links the network appeared overall stable. If this global stability-local instability phenomenon is general, it is a most astonishing feature of ecological networks."
https://openalex.org/W2076360553,"Mechanisms to reduce the cellular levels of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) provide promising strategies for treating Huntington disease (HD). To identify compounds enhancing the degradation of mHtt, we performed a high throughput screen using a hippocampal HN10 cell line expressing a 573-amino acid mHtt fragment. Several hit structures were identified as heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors. Cell treatment with these compounds reduced levels of mHtt without overt toxic effects as measured by time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer assays and Western blots. To characterize the mechanism of mHtt degradation, we used the potent and selective Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922. In HdhQ150 embryonic stem (ES) cells and in ES cell-derived neurons, NVP-AUY922 treatment substantially reduced soluble full-length mHtt levels. In HN10 cells, Hsp90 inhibition by NVP-AUY922 enhanced mHtt clearance in the absence of any detectable Hsp70 induction. Furthermore, inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or overexpression of dominant negative heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in HdhQ150 ES cells attenuated Hsp70 induction but did not affect NVP-AUY922-mediated mHtt clearance. Together, these data provided evidence that direct inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function was crucial for mHtt degradation rather than heat shock response induction and Hsp70 up-regulation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical interaction of mutant and wild-type Htt with the Hsp90 chaperone. Hsp90 inhibition disrupted the interaction and induced clearance of Htt through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our data suggest that Htt is an Hsp90 client protein and that Hsp90 inhibition may provide a means to reduce mHtt in HD."
https://openalex.org/W2033710359,"Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest types of cancer and there is requirement for the identification of prognostic biomarkers. In this study protein expression profiles have been established for colorectal cancer and normal colonic mucosa by proteomics using a combination of two dimensional gel electrophoresis with fresh frozen sections of paired Dukes B colorectal cancer and normal colorectal mucosa (n = 28), gel image analysis and high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal components analysis showed that the protein expression profiles of colorectal cancer and normal colonic mucosa clustered into distinct patterns of protein expression. Forty-five proteins were identified as showing at least 1.5 times increased expression in colorectal cancer and the identity of these proteins was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Fifteen proteins that showed increased expression were validated by immunohistochemistry using a well characterised colorectal cancer tissue microarray containing 515 primary colorectal cancer, 224 lymph node metastasis and 50 normal colonic mucosal samples. The proteins that showed the greatest degree of overexpression in primary colorectal cancer compared with normal colonic mucosa were heat shock protein 60 (p<0.001), S100A9 (p<0.001) and translationally controlled tumour protein (p<0.001). Analysis of proteins individually identified 14-3-3β as a prognostic biomarker (χ² = 6.218, p = 0.013, HR = 0.639, 95%CI 0.448-0.913). Hierarchical cluster analysis identified distinct phenotypes associated with survival and a two-protein signature consisting of 14-3-3β and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 was identified as showing prognostic significance (χ² = 7.306, p = 0.007, HR = 0.504, 95%CI 0.303-0.838) and that remained independently prognostic (p = 0.01, HR = 0.416, 95%CI 0.208-0.829) in a multivariate model."

The soluble His-tagged protein EAW08391 was purified to near homogeneity and used for biochemical investigation with diverse aromatic substrates in the presence of different prenyl diphosphates. It has shown that in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the recombinant enzyme accepted very well simple indole derivatives with l-tryptophan as the best substrate. Product formation was also observed for tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides but with much lower conversion yields. In contrast, no product formation was detected in the reaction mixtures of l-tryptophan with geranyl or farnesyl diphosphate. Structure elucidation of the enzyme products by NMR and MS analyses proved unequivocally the highly regiospecific regular prenylation at C-5 of the indole nucleus of the simple indole derivatives. EAW08391 was therefore termed 5-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase, and it filled the last gap in the toolbox of indole prenyltransferases regarding their prenylation positions. Km values of 5-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase were determined for l-tryptophan and DMAPP at 34 and 76 μm, respectively. Average turnover number (kcat) at 1.1 s−1 was calculated from kinetic data of l-tryptophan and DMAPP. Catalytic efficiencies of 5-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase for l-tryptophan at 25,588 s−1·m−1 and for other 11 simple indole derivatives up to 1538 s−1·m−1 provided evidence for its potential usage as a catalyst for chemoenzymatic synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2086079196,"Autophagy plays a pivotal role by allowing cells to recycle cellular components under conditions of stress, starvation, development and cancer. In this work, we have demonstrated that programmed autophagy in the mosquito fat body plays a critical role in maintaining of developmental switches required for normal progression of gonadotrophic cycles. Mosquitoes must feed on vertebrate blood for their egg development, with each gonadotrophic cycle being tightly coupled to a separate blood meal. As a consequence, some mosquito species are vectors of pathogens that cause devastating diseases in humans and domestic animals, most importantly malaria and Dengue fever. Hence, deciphering mechanisms to control egg developmental cycles is of paramount importance for devising novel approaches for mosquito control. Central to egg development is vitellogenesis, the production of yolk protein precursors in the fat body, the tissue analogous to a vertebrate liver, and their subsequent specific accumulation in developing oocytes. During each egg developmental cycle, the fat body undergoes a developmental program that includes previtellogenic build-up of biosynthetic machinery, intense production of yolk protein precursors, and termination of vitellogenesis. The importance of autophagy for termination of vitellogenesis was confirmed by RNA interference (RNAi) depletions of several autophagic genes (ATGs), which inhibited autophagy and resulted in untimely hyper activation of TOR and prolonged production of the major yolk protein precursor, vitellogenin (Vg). RNAi depletion of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) demonstrated its activating role of autophagy. Depletion of the autophagic genes and of EcR led to inhibition of the competence factor, betaFTZ-F1, which is required for ecdysone-mediated developmental transitions. Moreover, autophagy-incompetent female mosquitoes were unable to complete the second reproductive cycle and exhibited retardation and abnormalities in egg maturation. Thus, our study has revealed a novel function of programmed autophagy in maintaining egg maturation cycles in mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W1964069859,"Relief from painful diabetic neuropathy is an important clinical issue. We have previously shown that the transplantation of cultured endothelial progenitor cells or mesenchymal stem cells ameliorated diabetic neuropathy in rats. In this study, we investigated whether transplantation of freshly isolated bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) alleviates neuropathic pain in the early stage of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Two weeks after STZ injection, BM-MNCs or vehicle saline were injected into the unilateral hind limb muscles. Mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia in SD rats were measured as the number of foot withdrawals to von Frey hair stimulation and acetone application, respectively. Two weeks after the BM-MNC transplantation, sciatic motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), sciatic nerve blood flow (SNBF), mRNA expressions and histology were assessed. The BM-MNC transplantation significantly ameliorated mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia in the BM-MNC-injected side. Furthermore, the slowed MNCV/SNCV and decreased SNBF in diabetic rats were improved in the BM-MNC-injected side. BM-MNC transplantation improved the decreased mRNA expression of NT-3 and number of microvessels in the hind limb muscles. There was no distinct effect of BM-MNC transplantation on the intraepidermal nerve fiber density. These results suggest that autologous transplantation of BM-MNCs could be a novel strategy for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W1995545154,"The omnipresent group of pesticide adjuvants are often referred to as “inert” ingredients, a rather misleading term since consumers associate this term with “safe”. The upcoming new EU regulation concerning the introduction of plant protection products on the market (EC1107/2009) includes for the first time the demand for information on the possible negative effects of not only the active ingredients but also the used adjuvants. This new regulation requires basic toxicological information that allows decisions on the use/ban or preference of use of available adjuvants. In this study we obtained toxicological relevant information through a multiple endpoint reporter assay for a broad selection of commonly used adjuvants including several solvents (e.g. isophorone) and non-ionic surfactants (e.g. ethoxylated alcohols). The used assay allows the toxicity screening in a mechanistic way, with direct measurement of specific toxicological responses (e.g. oxidative stress, DNA damage, membrane damage and general cell lesions). The results show that the selected solvents are less toxic than the surfactants, suggesting that solvents may have a preference of use, but further research on more compounds is needed to confirm this observation. The gene expression profiles of the selected surfactants reveal that a phenol (ethoxylated tristyrylphenol) and an organosilicone surfactant (ethoxylated trisiloxane) show little or no inductions at EC20 concentrations, making them preferred surfactants for use in different applications. The organosilicone surfactant shows little or no toxicity and good adjuvant properties. However, this study also illustrates possible genotoxicity (induction of the bacterial SOS response) for several surfactants (POEA, AE, tri-EO, EO FA and EO NP) and one solvent (gamma-butyrolactone). Although the number of compounds that were evaluated is rather limited (13), the results show that the used reporter assay is a promising tool to rank commonly used agricultural adjuvants based on toxicity and toxic mode of action data."
https://openalex.org/W2004193381,"Cleft palate represents one of the most common congenital birth defects. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling plays crucial functions in regulating craniofacial development, and loss of TGFβ receptor type II in cranial neural crest cells leads to craniofacial malformations, including cleft palate in mice (Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice). Here we have identified candidate target genes of TGFβ signaling during palatal formation. These target genes were selected based on combining results from gene expression profiles of embryonic day 14.5 palates from Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice and previously identified cleft palate phenotypes in genetically engineered mouse models. We found that fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9) and transcription factor pituitary homeobox 2 (Pitx2) expressions are significantly down-regulated in the palate of Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice, and Fgf9 and Pitx2 loss of function mutations result in cleft palate in mice. Pitx2 expression is down-regulated by siRNA knockdown of Fgf9, suggesting that Fgf9 is upstream of Pitx2. We detected decreased expression of both cyclins D1 and D3 in the palates of Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice, consistent with the defect in cell proliferation. Significantly, exogenous FGF9 restores expression of cyclins D1 and D3 in a Pitx2-dependent manner and rescues the cell proliferation defect in the palatal mesenchyme of Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice.

Our previous study showed that conditional gene ablation of Tgfbr2 in CNCC (Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice) results in cleft palate with 100% phenotype penetrance, down-regulated cyclin D1 expression, and decreased CNCC proliferation in the palatal mesenchyme at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) (13Ito Y.

TGFβ signaling interacts with other growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (19Massagué J. How cells read TGF-β signals.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Although this interplay of pathways appears to be critical for the regulation of palate formation, little is known regarding the developmental molecular pathways that regulate cell proliferation during palatogenesis. Here we show that TGFβ regulates cell proliferation via the FGF9-PITX2 signaling cascade during palate formation.

As described in a different analysis of these same samples, 3J. Iwata, J. G. Hacia, A. Suzuki, P. A. Sanchez-Lara, M. Urata, and Y. Chai, submitted for publication. total RNA was isolated from mouse embryonic palate dissected at the indicated developmental stage or from primary mouse embryonic palatal mesenchymal (MEPM) cells. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using an oligo(dT)20 primer and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RNA was quantified and tested for quality by photometric measurement. Quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate by SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) in an iCycler (Bio-Rad) as previously described (17Iwata J.

A melting curve was obtained for each PCR product after each run to confirm that the SYBR Green signal corresponded to a unique and specific amplicon. The relative abundance of each transcript was calculated based on PCR efficiency and cycle number at which the fluorescence crosses a threshold for the GAPDH internal reference, and the gene was tested using iCycler iQ optical system software (Bio-Rad). PCR primers are available upon request. As described for these same samples,3 total RNA samples (1 μg/sample) were converted into biotin-labeled cRNA using the GeneChip® IVT labeling kit and standard protocols recommended by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Fragmented cDNA was applied to GeneChip® mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) that contain probe sets designed to detect over 39,000 transcripts. Microarrays were hybridized, processed, and scanned, as described previously using the manufacturer's recommended conditions (22Karaman M.W. Houck M.L. Chemnick L.G. Nagpal S. Chawannakul D.

All scaled gene expression scores, and .cel files are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) repository under series accession number GSE22989. We used the University of California Santa Cruz genome browser (available on the University of California Santa Cruz Web site) to obtain the genomic sequences of the human FGF9 (RefSeq accession NM_002010.2) and PITX2, transcript variant 1 (RefSeq accession NM_153427.2) genes, including 5 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream of the respective transcription start sites, based on human genome Build 19. These sequences were then mapped to seven additional mammalian genomes (chimpanzee (Build 2.1.3), orangutan (Build 2.0.2), rhesus macaque (Build 1.0), mouse (Build 37), rat (Build 3.4), dog (Build 2), and horse (Build equCab2)) through the Blat tool (available on the University of Santa Cruz Web site). We obtained multiple alignments for these sequences using the ClustalW2 tool (available on the EMBL-EBI Web site) with default parameters and settings (25Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P.

To account for uncertainty in the quality of the horse and dog draft genome sequences, we performed sequence alignments with and without information from these species. We searched for transcription factor binding motifs relevant to SMAD and p38 MAPK pathway elements within or proximal to these genes (i.e. 5 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream of the human transcription start site for each gene) that are conserved across diverse mammals. We focused our analysis of canonical TGFβ signaling on the 5′-GTCT-3′, 5′-AGAC-3′, and 5′-GTCTAGAC-3′ SMAD recognition sites (26Denissova N.G. Pouponnot C. Long J. He D. Liu F.

Cryosections were pretreated with proteinase K (Sigma), refixed in fresh 4% PFA, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then prehybridized for 5 h at 55 °C in a hybridization buffer including 50% formamide. After hybridization, tissues were washed in high stringency conditions and preblocked in antibody blocking solution and then incubated with preabsorbed antibody. Color development was performed in nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolylphosphate color development solution (Sigma). Following visualization, the tissues were postfixed and cleared in 50% glycerol before photography. MEPM cells (2 × 106 cells) were plated in a 6-well cell culture plate until the cells reached 60–80% confluence. siRNA duplex and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The siRNA mixture in transfection medium was incubated with cells for 6 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Timed pregnant mice were sacrificed at E13.5. Genotyping was carried out as described above. The palatal shelves were microdissected and cultured in serum-free chemically defined medium as described previously (13Ito Y. Yeo J.Y. Chytil A. Han J. Bringas Jr., P. Nakajima A. Shuler C.F. Moses H.L. Chai Y. Conditional inactivation of Tgfbr2 in cranial neural crest causes cleft palate and calvaria defects.Development. 2003; 130: 5269-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To remove the epithelium, palatal shelves were treated with 0.05% trypsin, EDTA for 10 min prior to careful dissection. After 24 h in culture with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 (100 μm), palates were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and processed. Heparin beads (Sigma) were used for delivery of FGF9 protein. The beads were washed in PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 100 μg/ml FGF9 (R&D Systems). The FGF9-containing beads were delivered into palatal explants. Control beads were incubated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). FGF9- or BSA-containing beads were placed into palatal explants. Primary MEPM cells were obtained from 13.5-day-old embryos. Palates were dissected at E13.5 and trypsinized for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After pipetting thoroughly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamate, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. MEPM cells were treated with or without p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 at 10 μm for 24 h. Two-tailed Student's t test was applied for statistical analysis. For all graphs, data are represented as mean ± S.D. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate the cause of cleft palate resulting from TGFBR2 mutations in humans, we examined mice with CNCC-specific conditional inactivation of Tgfbr2 (Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre). As will be described in detail, 4J. Iwata, R. Pelikan, Y. Chai, and J. G. Hacia, manuscript in preparation. we obtained gene expression profiles of E14.5 palate from Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre and Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice using Affymetrix U430 2.0 GeneChips (during palatal fusion, n = 5 per genotype). We chose this stage because it is the time at which normal mouse palatal fusion takes place. Overall, we found that a total of 293 transcripts were differentially expressed (149 were up-regulated, and 144 were down-regulated; ≥1.5-fold, <5% FDR) in Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice relative to the controls (Fig. 1A). Although TGFβ signaling interacts with other growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt, and FGF family members, Fgf9 was the only member of these growth factor families that was differentially expressed in E14.5 Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre palates relative to controls (1.52-fold down-regulated, FDR = 0.011). Next, we created a list of various genetically engineered mouse models known to exhibit the cleft palate phenotype during embryogenesis, as originally compiled by Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) and modified by us based on the literature. Currently, this includes 277 different genetically engineered mice with cleft palate (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 1). To screen for candidate genes related to cleft palate and TGFβ signaling, we compared the list of known mutant mouse models exhibiting cleft palate and the microarray analysis performed on E14.5 Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre palates. We identified two overlapping genes (Fgf9 and Pitx2) in these lists (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 1), which were both predicted to be less highly expressed in the palates of Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice relative to those of controls (Fgf9, 1.52-fold reduced, FDR = 0.011; Pitx2, 1.74-fold reduced, FDR = 0.006). Fgf9-null and Pitx2-null mice have been reported to show cleft palate (34Colvin J.S. White A.C. Pratt S.J. Ornitz D.M.

Function of Rieger syndrome gene in left-right asymmetry and craniofacial development.Nature. 1999; 401: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We confirmed the reduction of Fgf9 and Pitx2 gene expression in Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice by quantitative RT-PCR using palates of Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre and Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice. Gene expression of both Fgf9 and Pitx2 was significantly down-regulated in Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice relative to control mice (Fig. 1B). We performed in situ hybridization to investigate the expression patterns of Fgf9 and Pitx2 during palate formation. The expression of Fgf9 was localized in the palatal epithelium in both Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre and Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice at E13.5 (Fig. 1C). At E14.5, Fgf9 gene expression was detectable in both the palatal epithelium and mesenchyme in Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice; however, Fgf9 gene expression was not detectable in the palatal mesenchyme of E14.5 Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice, although it remained detectable in the palatal epithelium (Fig. 1, C and E, and supplemental Fig. 1). Pitx2 gene expression was detectable in the palatal epithelium of both Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre and Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice at E13.5 and E14.5. In Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice, Pitx2 expression was also detectable in the palatal mesenchyme at E14.5 (Fig. 1, D and F, and supplemental Fig. 1). In E14.5 Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice, Pitx2 expression was not detectable in the palatal mesenchyme (Fig. 1, D and F, and supplemental Fig. 1). The expression patterns were essentially the same for both Fgf9 and Pitx2. We also analyzed FGF9 and PITX2 protein expression in the palates of Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre and Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice at E14.5 and found that they were both reduced in Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre palates (Fig. 1G and supplemental Fig. 2). Here, we investigated the means by which TGFβ regulated Fgf9 and Pitx2 expressions. There are at least two possibilities; one is through the non-canonical TGFβ signaling (such as p38 MAPK activation), and another is through the canonical SMAD-dependent pathway. Our recent study showed that loss of Tgfbr2 in CNCC resulted in an activation of an alternative TGFβ signaling cascade that involved the activation of p38 MAPK.3 We hypothesized that blocking p38 MAPK activation will restore the gene expression of Fgf9 and Pitx2 in the palatal mesenchyme of Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice. To test this, we analyzed Fgf9 and Pitx2 gene expression after treatment with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 using primary MEPM cells derived from the palates of Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre and Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice. We found that Fgf9 and Pitx2 expression increased in Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre MEPM cells treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor to a level comparable with that of Tgfbr2fl/fl control MEPM cells, consistent with Fgf9 and Pitx2 down-regulation by p38 MAPK activation in the absence of Tgfbr2 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we added p38 MAPK inhibitor to an ex vivo palate organ culture system and confirmed that gene expression of Fgf9 and Pitx2 in Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre palates increased after treatment (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2026032590,"Muscle force is typically proportional to muscle size, resulting in constant force normalized to muscle fiber cross-sectional area (specific force). Mice overexpressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) exhibit a proportional gain in muscle force and size, but not the myostatin-deficient mice. In an attempt to explore the role of the cytoplasmic volume supported by individual myonuclei [myonuclear domain (MND) size] on functional capacity of skeletal muscle, we have investigated specific force in relation to MND and the content of the molecular motor protein, myosin, at the single muscle fiber level from myostatin-knockout (Mstn(-/-)) and IGF-1-overexpressing (mIgf1(+/+)) mice. We hypothesize that the addition of extra myonuclei is a prerequisite for maintenance of specific force during muscle hypertrophy. A novel algorithm was used to measure individual MNDs in 3 dimensions along the length of single muscle fibers from the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus and the slow-twitch soleus muscle. A significant effect of the size of individual MNDs in hypertrophic muscle fibers on both specific force and myosin content was observed. This effect was muscle cell type specific and suggested there is a critical volume individual myonuclei can support efficiently. The large MNDs found in fast muscles of Mstn(-/-) mice were correlated with the decrement in specific force and myosin content in Mstn(-/-) muscles. Thus, myostatin inhibition may not be able to maintain the appropriate MND for optimal function."

https://openalex.org/W2056594014,"Background Plant allelochemicals released into the soil can significantly impact the performance of associated plant species thereby affecting their competitive ability. Soil microbes can potentially affect the interaction between plant and plant chemicals by degrading the allelochemicals. However, most often plant-plant chemical interactions are studied using filter paper bioassays examining the pair-wise interaction between a plant and a plant chemical, not taking into account the potential role of soil microorganisms. Methodology/Principal findings To explore if the allelopathic effects on a grass by the common thyme monoterpene “carvacrol” are affected by soil microorganisms. Seedlings of the grass Agrostis capillaris originating from 3 different thyme sites were raised in the greenhouse. Seedlings were grown under four different soil treatments in a 2*2 fully factorial experiment. The monoterpene carvacrol was either added to standard greenhouse soil or left out, and soil was either sterilized (no soil microorganisms) or not (soil microorganisms present in soil). The presence of carvacrol in the soil strongly increased mortality of Agrostis plants, and this increase was highest on sterile soil. Plant biomass was reduced on soil amended with carvacrol, but only when the soil was also sterilized. Plants originating from sites where thyme produces essential oils containing mostly carvacrol had higher survival on soil treated with that monoterpene than plants originating from a site where thyme produced different types of terpenes, suggesting an adaptive response to the locally occurring terpene. Conclusions/Significance The study shows that presence of soil microorganisms can alleviate the negative effect of a common thyme monoterpene on the performance of an associated plant species, emphasizing the role of soil microbes in modulating plant-plant chemical interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2063905960,"Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) can be activated following global ischemia. In addition, other laboratories have reported that the activation of MLK3 may be linked to the accumulation of free radicals. However, the mechanism of MLK3 activation remains incompletely understood. We report here that MLK3, overexpressed in HEK293 cells, is S-nitrosylated (forming SNO-MLK3) via a reaction with S-nitrosoglutathione, an exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor, at one critical cysteine residue (Cys-688). We further show that the S-nitrosylation of MLK3 contributes to its dimerization and activation. We also investigated whether the activation of MLK3 is associated with S-nitrosylation following rat brain ischemia/reperfusion. Our results show that the administration of 7-nitroindazole, an inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), or nNOS antisense oligodeoxynucleotides diminished the S-nitrosylation of MLK3 and inhibited its activation induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. In contrast, 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine (an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase) or nNOS missense oligodeoxynucleotides did not affect the S-nitrosylation of MLK3. In addition, treatment with sodium nitroprusside (an exogenous NO donor) and S-nitrosoglutathione or MK801, an antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, also diminished the S-nitrosylation and activation of MLK3 induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The activation of MLK3 facilitated its downstream protein kinase kinase 4/7 (MKK4/7)-JNK signaling module and both nuclear and non-nuclear apoptosis pathways. These data suggest that the activation of MLK3 during the early stages of ischemia/reperfusion is modulated by S-nitrosylation and provides a potential new approach for stroke therapy whereby the post-translational modification machinery is targeted. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) can be activated following global ischemia. In addition, other laboratories have reported that the activation of MLK3 may be linked to the accumulation of free radicals. However, the mechanism of MLK3 activation remains incompletely understood. We report here that MLK3, overexpressed in HEK293 cells, is S-nitrosylated (forming SNO-MLK3) via a reaction with S-nitrosoglutathione, an exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor, at one critical cysteine residue (Cys-688). We further show that the S-nitrosylation of MLK3 contributes to its dimerization and activation. We also investigated whether the activation of MLK3 is associated with S-nitrosylation following rat brain ischemia/reperfusion. Our results show that the administration of 7-nitroindazole, an inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), or nNOS antisense oligodeoxynucleotides diminished the S-nitrosylation of MLK3 and inhibited its activation induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. In contrast, 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine (an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase) or nNOS missense oligodeoxynucleotides did not affect the S-nitrosylation of MLK3. In addition, treatment with sodium nitroprusside (an exogenous NO donor) and S-nitrosoglutathione or MK801, an antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, also diminished the S-nitrosylation and activation of MLK3 induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The activation of MLK3 facilitated its downstream protein kinase kinase 4/7 (MKK4/7)-JNK signaling module and both nuclear and non-nuclear apoptosis pathways. These data suggest that the activation of MLK3 during the early stages of ischemia/reperfusion is modulated by S-nitrosylation and provides a potential new approach for stroke therapy whereby the post-translational modification machinery is targeted."
https://openalex.org/W1991069219,"Neuroendocrine activation and local mediators such as transforming growth factor-β₁ (TGF-β₁) contribute to the pathobiology of cardiac hypertrophy and failure, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We aimed to characterize the functional network involving TGF-β₁, the renin-angiotensin system, and the β-adrenergic system in the heart.Transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-β₁ (TGF-β₁-Tg) were treated with a β-blocker, an AT₁-receptor antagonist, or a TGF-β-antagonist (sTGFβR-Fc), were morphologically characterized. Contractile function was assessed by dobutamine stress echocardiography in vivo and isolated myocytes in vitro. Functional alterations were related to regulators of cardiac energy metabolism.Compared to wild-type controls, TGF-β₁-Tg mice displayed an increased heart-to-body-weight ratio involving both fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy. TGF-β₁ overexpression increased the hypertrophic responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, the inotropic response to β-adrenergic stimulation was diminished in TGF-β₁-Tg mice, albeit unchanged basal contractility. Treatment with sTGF-βR-Fc completely prevented the cardiac phenotype in transgenic mice. Chronic β-blocker treatment also prevented hypertrophy and ANF induction by isoprenaline, and restored the inotropic response to β-adrenergic stimulation without affecting TGF-β₁ levels, whereas AT₁-receptor blockade had no effect. The impaired contractile reserve in TGF-β₁-Tg mice was accompanied by an upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) which was reversed by β-adrenoceptor blockade. UCP-inhibition restored the contractile response to β-adrenoceptor stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Finally, cardiac TGF-β₁ and UCP expression were elevated in heart failure in humans, and UCP--but not TGF-β₁--was downregulated by β-blocker treatment.Our data support the concept that TGF-β₁ acts downstream of angiotensin II in cardiomyocytes, and furthermore, highlight the critical role of the β-adrenergic system in TGF-β₁-induced cardiac phenotype. Our data indicate for the first time, that TGF-β₁ directly influences mitochondrial energy metabolism by regulating UCP3 expression. β-blockers may act beneficially by normalizing regulatory mechanisms of cellular hypertrophy and energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2007062398,"Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with genetic components of both immune system and the epidermis. PSOR1 locus (6q21) has been strongly associated with psoriasis; however, it is difficult to identify additional independent association due to strong linkage disequilibrium in the MHC region. We performed stepwise regression analyses of more than 3,000 SNPs in the MHC region genotyped using Human 610-Quad (Illumina) in 1,139 cases with psoriasis and 1,132 controls of Han Chinese population to search for additional independent association. With four regression models obtained, two SNPs rs9468925 in HLA-C/HLA-B and rs2858881 in HLA-DQA2 were repeatedly selected in all models, suggesting that multiple loci outside PSOR1 locus were associated with psoriasis. More importantly we find that rs9468925 in HLA-C/HLA-B is associated with both psoriasis and vitiligo, providing first important evidence that two major skin diseases share a common genetic locus in the MHC, and a basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of skin disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2094387085,"Suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) protein family are key regulators of cellular responses to cytokines and play an important role in the nervous system. The SOCS6 protein, a less extensively studied SOCS family member, has been shown to induce insulin resistance in the retina and promote survival of the retinal neurons. But no reports are available about the role of SOCS6 in neuritogenesis. In this study, we examined the role of SOCS6 in neurite outgrowth and neuronal cell signalling.The effect of SOCS6 in neural stem cells differentiation was studied in neural stem cells and PC12 cell line. Highly elevated levels of SOCS6 were found upon neural cell differentiation both at the mRNA and protein level. Furthermore, SOCS6 over-expression lead to increase in neurite outgrowth and degree of branching, whereas SOCS6 knockdown with specific siRNAs, lead to a significant decrease in neurite initiation and extension. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulation which enhanced neurite outgrowth of neural cells resulted in further enhancement of SOCS6 expression. Jak/Stat (Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription) pathway was found to be involved in the SOCS6 mediated neurite outgrowth. Bioinformatics study revealed presence of putative Stat binding sites in the SOCS6 promoter region. Transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b were involved in SOCS6 gene upregulation leading to neuronal differentiation. Following differentiation, SOCS6 was found to form a ternary complex with IGFR (Insulin Like Growth Factor-1 Receptor) and JAK2 which acted in a negative feedback loop to inhibit pStat5 activation.The current paradigm for the first time states that SOCS6, a SOCS family member, plays an important role in the process of neuronal differentiation. These findings define a novel molecular mechanism for Jak2/Stat5 mediated SOCS6 signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2074944922,"The Karyopherin superfamily comprises nuclear transport proteins, involved in the shuttling of certain cargo proteins into and out of the nucleus. Karyopherin β1 (Kpnβ1) and Karyopherin α2 (Kpnα2) are importin proteins, which work in concert to transport their cargo into the nucleus. We previously identified increased expression of Kpnβ1 and Kpnα2 in cervical tumours compared to normal epithelium and in transformed cells compared to their normal counterparts. This study therefore aimed to identify the transcription regulatory mechanisms associated with high Kpnβ1 and Kpnα2 levels in cancer cells. Kpnβ1 (-2013 to +100) and Kpnα2 (-1900 to +69) promoter fragments were separately cloned into the reporter vector, pGL3-basic, and luciferase assays revealed both as significantly more active in cancer and transformed cells compared to normal. A series of deletion constructs identified the -637 to -271 Kpnβ1 and -180 to -24 Kpnα2 promoter regions as responsible for the differential promoter activity, and a number of highly conserved E2F binding sites were identified within these regions. Mutation analysis confirmed the requirement of E2F sites for promoter activity, and ChIP analysis confirmed E2F2/Dp1 binding to the Kpnβ1 and Kpnα2 promoters in vivo. Dp1 inhibition resulted in decreased levels of the respective proteins, confirming the role of E2F in the overexpression of Kpnβ1 and Kpnα2 proteins in cancer. E2F activity is known to be deregulated in cervical cancer cells due to the inhibition of its repressor, Rb, by HPV E7. The inhibition of E7 using siRNA resulted in decreased Kpnβ1 and Kpnα2 promoter activities, as did the overexpression of Rb. In conclusion, this study is a first to show that elevated Kpnβ1 and Kpnα2 expression in cancer cells correlates with altered transcriptional regulation associated with deregulated E2F/Rb activities."
https://openalex.org/W2158438071,"Dbf4/Cdc7 (Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)) is activated at the onset of S-phase, and its kinase activity is required for DNA replication initiation from each origin. We showed that DDK is an important target for the S-phase checkpoint in mammalian cells to suppress replication initiation and to protect replication forks. We demonstrated that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) proteins directly phosphorylate Dbf4 in response to ionizing radiation and replication stress. We identified novel ATM/ATR phosphorylation sites on Dbf4 and showed that ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Dbf4 is critical for the intra-S-phase checkpoint to inhibit DNA replication. The kinase activity of DDK, which is not suppressed upon DNA damage, is required for fork protection under replication stress. We further demonstrated that ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Dbf4 is important for preventing DNA rereplication upon loss of replication licensing through the activation of the S-phase checkpoint. These studies indicate that DDK is a direct substrate of ATM and ATR to mediate the intra-S-phase checkpoint in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2132901096,"Objectives Tinnitus is the perception of a sound in the absence of any physical source of it. About 5–15% of the population report hearing such a tinnitus and about 1–2% suffer from their tinnitus leading to anxiety, sleep disorders or depression. It is currently not completely understood why some people feel distressed by their tinnitus, while others don't. Several studies indicate that the amount of tinnitus distress is associated with many factors including comorbid anxiety, comorbid depression, personality, the psychosocial situation, the amount of the related hearing loss and the loudness of the tinnitus. Furthermore, theoretical considerations suggest an impact of the age at tinnitus onset influencing tinnitus distress. Methods Based on a sample of 755 normal hearing tinnitus patients we tested this assumption. All participants answered a questionnaire on the amount of tinnitus distress together with a large variety of clinical and demographic data. Results Patients with an earlier onset of tinnitus suffer significantly less than patients with an onset later in life. Furthermore, patients with a later onset of tinnitus describe their course of tinnitus distress as more abrupt and distressing right from the beginning. Conclusion We argue that a decline of compensatory brain plasticity in older age accounts for this age-dependent tinnitus decompensation."
https://openalex.org/W2151351760,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are abundant in cells and have central roles in protein-protein interaction networks. Interactions between the IDP Prothymosin alpha (ProTα) and the Neh2 domain of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), with a common binding partner, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(Keap1), are essential for regulating cellular response to oxidative stress. Misregulation of this pathway can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, premature aging and cancer. In order to understand the mechanisms these two disordered proteins employ to bind to Keap1, we performed extensive 0.5-1.0 microsecond atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments to investigate the structure/dynamics of free-state ProTα and Neh2 and their thermodynamics of bindings. The results show that in their free states, both ProTα and Neh2 have propensities to form bound-state-like β-turn structures but to different extents. We also found that, for both proteins, residues outside the Keap1-binding motifs may play important roles in stabilizing the bound-state-like structures. Based on our findings, we propose that the binding of disordered ProTα and Neh2 to Keap1 occurs synergistically via preformed structural elements (PSEs) and coupled folding and binding, with a heavy bias towards PSEs, particularly for Neh2. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms Neh2 and ProTα bind to Keap1, information that is useful for developing therapeutics to enhance the oxidative stress response."
https://openalex.org/W1965551480,"The trafficking of effector cells to sites of infection is crucial for antiviral responses. However, the mechanisms of recruitment of the interferon-γ-producing and cytotoxic CD56(+) T cells are poorly understood. Human mast cells are sentinel cells found in the skin and airway and produce selected proinflammatory mediators in response to multiple pathogen-associated signals. The role of human mast cell-derived chemokines in T-cell recruitment to virus infection was examined. Supernatants from primary human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs) infected with mammalian reovirus were examined for chemokine production and utilized in chemotaxis assays. Virus-infected CBMCs produced several chemokines, including CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. Supernatants from reovirus-infected CBMCs selectively induced the chemotaxis of CD8(+) T cells (10±1%) and CD3(+)CD56(+) T cells (19±5%). CD56(+) T-cell migration was inhibited by pertussis toxin (65±9%) and met-RANTES (56±7%), a CCR1/CCR5 antagonist. CD56(+) T cells expressed CCR5, but little CCR1. The depletion of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 from reovirus-infected CBMC supernatants significantly (41±10%) inhibited CD56(+) T-cell chemotaxis. This study demonstrates a novel role for mast cells and CCR5 in CD56(+) T-cell trafficking and suggests that human mast cells enhance immunity to viruses through the selective recruitment of cytotoxic effector cells to virus infection sites. These findings could be exploited to enhance local T-cell responses in chronic viral infection and malignancies at mast cell-rich sites."
https://openalex.org/W1990620210,"Obesity and osteoporosis are closely correlated genetically. FTO gene has been consistently identified to be associated with obesity phenotypes. A recent study reported that the mice lacking Fto could result in lower bone mineral density (BMD). Thus, we hypothesize that the FTO gene might be also important for osteoporosis phenotypes. To test for such a hypothesis, we performed an association analyses to investigate the relationship between SNPs in FTO and BMD at both hip and spine. A total of 141 SNPs were tested in two independent Chinese populations (818 and 809 unrelated Han subjects, respectively) and a Caucasian population (2,286 unrelated subjects). Combining the two Chinese samples, we identified 6 SNPs in FTO to be significantly associated with hip BMD after multiple testing adjustments, with the combined P values ranged from 4.99×10−4–1.47×10−4. These 6 SNPs are all located at the intron 8 of FTO and in high linkage disequilibrium. Each copy of the minor allele of each SNP was associated with increased hip BMD values with the effect size (beta) of ∼0.025 and ∼0.015 in the Chinese sample 1 and 2, respectively. However, none of these 6 SNPs showed significant association signal in the Caucasian sample, by presenting some extent of ethnic difference. Our findings, together with the prior biological evidence, suggest that the FTO gene might be a new candidate for BMD variation and osteoporosis in Chinese populations."
https://openalex.org/W2018358261,"A unilateral injection of botulinum toxin A (BTxA) in the calf induces paralysis and profound loss of ipsalateral trabecular bone within days. However, the cellular mechanism underlying acute muscle paralysis-induced bone loss (MPIBL) is poorly understood. We hypothesized that MPIBL arises via rapid and extensive osteoclastogenesis. We performed a series of in vivo experiments to explore this thesis. First, we observed elevated levels of the proosteoclastogenic cytokine receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) within the proximal tibia metaphysis at 7 d after muscle paralysis (+113%, P<0.02). Accordingly, osteoclast numbers were increased 122% compared with the contralateral limb at 5 d after paralysis (P=0.04) and MPIBL was completely blocked by treatment with human recombinant osteoprotegerin (hrOPG). Further, conditional deletion of nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1), the master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, completely inhibited trabecular bone loss (-2.2±11.9%, P<0.01). All experiments included negative control assessments of contralateral limbs and/or within-animal pre- and postintervention imaging. In summary, transient muscle paralysis induced acute RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis resulting in profound local bone resorption. Elucidation of the pathways that initiate osteoclastogenesis after paralysis may identify novel targets to inhibit bone loss and prevent fractures.—Aliprantis, A. O., Stolina, M., Kostenuik, P.

https://openalex.org/W2037856283,"Unveiling the origin and forms of cooperation in nature poses profound challenges in evolutionary ecology. The prisoner's dilemma game is an important metaphor for studying the evolution of cooperation. We here classified potential mechanisms for cooperation evolution into schemes of frequency- and density-dependent selection, and focused on the density-dependent selection in the ecological prisoner's dilemma games. We found that, although assortative encounter is still the necessary condition in ecological games for cooperation evolution, a harsh environment, indicated by a high mortality, can foster the invasion of cooperation. The Hamilton rule provides a fundamental condition for the evolution of cooperation by ensuring an enhanced relatedness between players in low-density populations. Incorporating ecological dynamics into evolutionary games opens up a much wider window for the evolution of cooperation, and exhibits a variety of complex behaviors of dynamics, such as limit and heteroclinic cycles. An alternative evolutionary, or rather succession, sequence was proposed that cooperation first appears in harsh environments, followed by the invasion of defection, which leads to a common catastrophe. The rise of cooperation (and altruism), thus, could be much easier in the density-dependent ecological games than in the classic frequency-dependent evolutionary games."
https://openalex.org/W1982003900,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by accumulation of triglycerides (TG) in hepatocytes, which may also trigger cirrhosis. The mechanisms of NAFLD are not fully understood, but insulin resistance has been proposed as a key determinant.To determine the TG content and long chain fatty acyl CoA composition profile in liver from obese non-diabetic insulin resistant (IR) and lean insulin sensitive (IS) baboons in relation with hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity.Twenty baboons with varying grades of adiposity were studied. Hepatic (liver) and peripheral (mainly muscle) insulin sensitivity was measured with a euglycemic clamp and QUICKI. Liver biopsies were performed at baseline for TG content and LCFA profile by mass spectrometry, and histological analysis. Findings were correlated with clinical and biochemical markers of adiposity and insulin resistance.Obese IR baboons had elevated liver TG content compared to IS. Furthermore, the concentration of unsaturated (LC-UFA) was greater than saturated (LC-SFA) fatty acyl CoA in the liver. Interestingly, LC-FA UFA and SFA correlated with waist, BMI, insulin, NEFA, TG, QUICKI, but not M/I. Histological findings of NAFLD ranging from focal to diffuse hepatic steatosis were found in obese IR baboons.Liver TG content is closely related with both hepatic and peripheral IR, whereas liver LC-UFA and LC-SFA are closely related only with hepatic IR in non-human primates. Mechanisms leading to the accumulation of TG, LC-UFA and an altered UFA: LC-SFA ratio may play an important role in the pathophysiology of fatty liver disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2051780587,"In spite of the significant mortality associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection, the mechanisms underlying severe disease remain poorly understood. We have previously shown evidence of endothelial activation in Ghanaian children with malaria, indicated by elevated plasma levels of both von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its propeptide. In the current prospective study of children in Malawi with retinopathy confirmed cerebral malaria, we compared these markers with uncomplicated malaria, non malarial febrile illness and controls.Children with cerebral malaria, mild malaria and controls without malaria were recruited into the study. All comatose patients were examined by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Plasma VWF and propeptide levels were measured by ELISA. Median VWF and propeptide levels were significantly higher in patients with uncomplicated malaria than in children with non-malarial febrile illness of comparable severity, in whom levels were higher than in non-febrile controls. Median concentrations of both markers were higher in cerebral malaria than in uncomplicated malaria, and were similar in patients with and without retinopathy. Levels of both VWF and propeptide fell significantly 48 hours after commencing therapy and were normal one month later.In children with malaria plasma VWF and propeptide levels are markedly elevated in both cerebral and mild paediatric malaria, with levels matching disease severity, and these normalize upon recovery. High levels of both markers also occur in retinopathy-negative 'cerebral malaria' cases, many of whom are thought to be suffering from diseases other than malaria, indicating that further studies of these markers will be required to determine their sensitivity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2011420522,"Background N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are endogenous compounds that regulate inflammation and pain. These include the cannabinoid ligand anandamide (AEA) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α ligand palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). Little is known as to the levels of NAEs in pain states in human, particularly in the skeletal muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of these lipid mediators in muscle dialysate from women with chronic neck-/shoulder pain compared to healthy controls. Methods Eleven women with chronic neck-/shoulder pain and eleven healthy women participated in this study. All participants went through microdialysis procedures in the trapezius muscle. Muscle dialysate samples were collected during four hours and analysed by nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). Results We were able to detect AEA, PEA, N-stearoylethanolamine (SEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in a single chromatographic run. Of the NAEs studied, PEA and SEA were clearly detectable in the muscle microdialysate samples. The muscle dialysate levels of PEA and SEA were significantly higher in myalgic subjects compared to healthy controls. Conclusion This study demonstrates that microdialysis in combination with mass spectrometry can be used for analysing NAE's in human muscle tissue regularly over time. Furthermore the significant group differences in the concentration of PEA and SEA in this study might fill an important gap in our knowledge of mechanisms in chronic myalgia in humans. In the long run this expanded understanding of nociceptive and anitinociceptive processes in the muscle may provide a base for ameliorating treatment and rehabilitation of pain."
https://openalex.org/W1997834482,"The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) inhibits anaphase until microtubule-to-kinetochore attachments are formed, thus securing correct chromosome separation and preventing aneuploidy. Whereas in mitosis even a single unattached chromosome keeps the SAC active, the high incidence of aneuploidy related to maternal meiotic errors raises a concern about the lower efficiency of SAC in oocytes. Recently it was suggested that in mouse oocytes, contrary to somatic cells, not a single chromosome but a critical mass of chromosomes triggers efficient SAC pointing to the necessity of evaluating the robustness of SAC in oocytes. Two types of errors in chromosome segregation upon meiosis I related to SAC were envisaged: (1) SAC escape, when kinetochores emit SAC-activating signal unable to stop anaphase I; and (2) SAC deceive, when kinetochores do not emit the signal. Using micromanipulations and live imaging of the first polar body extrusion, as well as the dynamics of cyclin B1 degradation, here we show that in mouse oocytes a single bivalent keeps the SAC active. This is the first direct evaluation of SAC efficiency in mouse oocytes, which provides strong evidence that the robustness of SAC in mammalian oocytes is comparable to other cell types. Our data do not contradict the hypothesis of the critical mass of chromosomes necessary for SAC activation, but suggest that the same rule may govern SAC activity also in other cell types. We postulate that the innate susceptibility of oocytes to errors in chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division may not be caused by lower efficiency of SAC itself, but could be linked to high critical chromosome mass necessary to keep SAC active in oocyte of large size."

However, no direct evidence of CSQ depolymerization in vivo with physiological relevance has been obtained. In the present study, live cell imaging analysis facilitated characterization of the in vivo dynamics of the macromolecular CSQ structure. CSQ2 appeared as speckles in the presence of normal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) that were decondensed upon Ca(2+) depletion. Moreover, CSQ2 decondensation occurred only in the stoichiometric presence of junctin (JNT). When expressed alone, CSQ2 speckles remained unchanged, even after Ca(2+) depletion. FRET analysis revealed constant interactions between CSQ2 and JNT, regardless of the SR Ca(2+) concentration, implying that JNT is an essential component of the CSQ scaffold. In vitro solubility assay, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy studies using purified recombinant proteins confirmed Ca(2+) and JNT-dependent disassembly of the CSQ2 polymer. Accordingly, we conclude that reversible polymerization and depolymerization of CSQ are critical in SR Ca(2+) homeostasis."

Results show a significant reduction in EBR in chronic users as compared to non-users, suggesting an indirect detrimental effect of chronic cannabis use on striatal dopaminergic functioning.

UGDH folds into oligomers with each protein subunit composed of two α/β domains that are connected by a large central α-helix. The N-terminal domain is responsible for binding of NAD+, UDP-Glc is bound by interactions from both domains, and the active site is located in the interdomain cleft. Sequence analysis has shown that elementary features of UGDH structure and function have been conserved across the three superkingdoms of life (1Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U.

In this mechanism the active-site Cys has the role of a catalytic nucleophile that intercepts the C6 aldehyde produced in the first step of substrate oxidation, resulting in formation of a covalent thiohemiacetal enzyme intermediate. After replacement of NADH by NAD+, the reaction proceeds by converting the thiohemiacetal into a thioester. Hydrolysis of the thioester enzyme intermediate yields the UDP-GlcUA product.FIGURE 4pH profile analysis for wild-type hUGDH and E161Q mutant.

Coenzyme exchange at the stage of thiohemiacetal enzyme intermediate, therefore, necessitates a full cycle of domain opening (release of NADH) and closing (binding of NAD+), and this overall step was shown to be rate-determining for the human enzyme reaction in the presence of physiological concentrations of NAD+. Useful evidence in support of covalent catalysis by UGDH was obtained from the characterization of site-directed mutants in which the candidate nucleophile (SpUGDH:Cys260; hUGDH:Cys276) had been replaced by a serine (4Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol.

Soc. 1998; 120: 6613-6614Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Cys-to-Ser mutants were almost inactive under standard assay conditions. However, their incubation in the presence of NAD+ and UDP-Glc led to accumulation of a stable enzyme adduct that was shown by mass spectrometry (MS) to be derived from covalent attachment of the oxidized substrate. It was further demonstrated for SpUGDH (17Ge X. Campbell R.E. van de Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Covalent adduct formation with a mutated enzyme: evidence for a thioester intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6613-6614Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that the introduced Ser260 had become acylated with UDP-GlcUA. Hydrolysis of the unnatural ester linkage in the C260S mutant was thought to proceed at a very slow rate, thus allowing accumulation of the intermediate. Crystal structures of an unreactive ternary complex of wild-type SpUGDH (UDP-xylose/NAD+) and the C260S mutant (UDP-GlcUA/NADH) showed that Cys260 and Ser260 were both brought into positions suitable for participation in covalent catalysis (3Campbell R.E. Mosimann S.C. van De Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. The first structure of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase reveals the catalytic residues necessary for the 2-fold oxidation.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In hUGDH ternary complex structures (UDP-Glc/NADH; UDP-GlcUA/NAD+), Cys276 was likewise placed appropriately to function as a catalytic nucleophile (4Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23877-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the proposed covalent intermediates (enzyme bound thiohemiacetal and thioester species) in the catalytic mechanism of UGDH (Scheme 1) are subject to the caveat of missing direct affirmation for their formation in the course of the enzymatic reaction. Observation of acylenzyme development on Ser260 in the SpUGDH mutant (17Ge X. Campbell R.E. van de Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Covalent adduct formation with a mutated enzyme: evidence for a thioester intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6613-6614Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) may not be directly applicable to the situation of the wild-type enzyme where the native Cys260 offers a substantially different chemical reactivity as nucleophile or otherwise. A C260A mutant of SpUGDH readily oxidized the chemically synthesized aldehyde (UDP-gluco-hexodialdose; hydrated form) to UDP-GlcUA, whereas the same enzyme was inactive when offered UDP-Glc as substrate. The analogous C276A mutant of hUGDH was capable of catalyzing the oxidation of UDP-Glc to UDP-GlcUA, however, at a very low rate (4Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23877-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings could be interpreted to mean that the second oxidation step of the UGDH reaction might occur even in the absence of a catalytic nucleophile. In contrast, Ridley et al. (11Ridley W.P. Houchins J.P. Kirkwood Mechanism of action of uridine diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase. Evidence for a second reversible dehydrogenation step involving an essential thiol group.J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8761-8767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a cyanide-derivatized form of bovine liver UGDH was even more active than the unmodified enzyme in reduction of UDP-gluco-hexodialdose, whereas only the unmodified enzyme was reactive in the oxidation of the same substrate. It becomes apparent, therefore, that covalent catalysis by cysteine is not fundamentally well understood in its molecular basis, and despite the significant research efforts in different groups, the catalytic mechanism of UGDH remains elusive. We wish to communicate herein a study of hUGDH that provides clarification. Using site-directed replacement of the presumed catalytic base for hydrolysis of thioester (Glu161) by an incompetent analog (Gln), we found that the rate of the hydrolysis step had become selectively reduced in the E161Q mutant, thus allowing buildup of a thioester enzyme intermediate at steady state. By crystallizing the E161Q mutant under conditions of a limiting concentration of NAD+ while UDP-glucose was present in saturating amounts, we succeeded in intercepting a thiohemiacetal enzyme intermediate in the crystal and determined its structure at 2.3 Å resolution. With this structure the mechanism of covalent catalysis by Cys276 can be settled. However, the structure of the E161Q intermediate has two additional aspects of relevance. First, it shows that the protein subunit adopts an apoenzyme-like “open domain” conformation and does not contain a NAD(H) ligand at the coenzyme binding site, indicating that the mutant has actually undergone intermittent domain opening to allow for the release of NADH from the thiohemiacetal enzyme intermediate, as proposed recently (4Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23877-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Second, there is appreciable interest in the development of antagonists of hUGDH (23Clarkin C.E. Allen S. Kuiper N.J. Wheeler B.T. Wheeler-Jones C.P. Pitsillides A.A. Regulation of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase is sufficient to modulate hyaluronan production and release, control sulfated GAG synthesis, and promote chondrogenesis.J. Cell.

The relevant form of the enzyme to be targeted with reversible inhibitors is the thiohemiacetal intermediate, which accumulates at the steady state (4Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23877-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By studying mutants of two other prominent residues in the active site of hUGDH (Lys220 and Asp280; Refs. 1Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23590-23596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we have also delineated the steps in catalysis that lead up to the thiohemiacetal intermediate. Finally, comparison of wild-type enzyme and E161Q in pH studies gave clear evidence in support of a general base catalytic function of Glu161 in the hydrolysis step of the reaction. For the first time, therefore, a comprehensive catalytic mechanism for hUGDH is proposed. Unless stated otherwise, all materials were of the highest purity available from Sigma. NAD+ was obtained from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) in a purity of >98%. The enzyme referred to as native or wild-type hUGDH is a truncated version of the natural enzyme that lacks 27 amino acids from the C terminus. It was previously shown that the truncation neither affects the enzyme activity nor the homohexameric oligomerization of hUGDH in solution (4Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23877-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Variants of hUGDH likewise contain the C-terminal truncation. Mutagenesis leading to site-directed substitution of Glu161 by Gln (E161Q), Lys220 by Ala (K220A), Asp280 by Ala (D280A), Thr131 by Ser (T131S), and Asn224 by Ala (N224A) was performed employing the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to standard protocols and using the wild-type gene as template. The oligonucleotide primers used are listed in the supplemental procedures. The mutants were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-R3 using a pBEN-derived plasmid vector, encoding the target protein fused to an N-terminal extension that harbors a solubility enhancement tag, a streptavidin tag, and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. Enzymes were purified using a previously described three-step procedure consisting of affinity chromatography, gel filtration (Superdex 200 16/60 HiLoad, GE Healthcare), and anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap-Q HP, GE Healthcare) (4Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23877-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension was removed before gel filtration using tobacco etch virus protease. Details of the procedures are given elsewhere (4Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol.

The E161Q protein solution containing 2 mm NAD+ and 5 mm UDP-Glc was concentrated to 15 mg/ml (∼0.3 mm). Crystals were grown at 4 °C in 150-nl sitting drops, equilibrated against mother liquor containing 18% PEG “smears” (a mixture of ten PEG polymers with molecular masses ranging from 400 to 10000 Da), 5% ethylene glycol, and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5).

https://openalex.org/W2007660485,"In group-living animals, such as primates, the average spatial group structure often reflects the dominance hierarchy, with central dominants and peripheral subordinates. This central-peripheral group structure can arise by self-organization as a result of subordinates fleeing from dominants after losing a fight. However, in real primates, subordinates often avoid interactions with potentially aggressive group members, thereby preventing aggression and subsequent fleeing. Using agent-based modeling, we investigated which spatial and encounter structures emerge when subordinates also avoid known potential aggressors at a distance as compared with the model which only included fleeing after losing a fight (fleeing model). A central-peripheral group structure emerged in most conditions. When avoidance was employed at small or intermediate distances, centrality of dominants emerged similar to the fleeing model, but in a more pronounced way. This result was also found when fleeing after a fight was made independent of dominance rank, i.e. occurred randomly. Employing avoidance at larger distances yielded more spread out groups. This provides a possible explanation of larger group spread in more aggressive species. With avoidance at very large distances, spatially and socially distinct subgroups emerged. We also investigated how encounters were distributed amongst group members. In the fleeing model all individuals encountered all group members equally often, whereas in the avoidance model encounters occurred mostly among similar-ranking individuals. Finally, we also identified a very general and simple mechanism causing a central-peripheral group structure: when individuals merely differed in velocity, faster individuals automatically ended up at the periphery. In summary, a central-peripheral group pattern can easily emerge from individual variation in different movement properties in general, such as fleeing, avoidance or velocity. Moreover, avoidance behavior also affects the encounter structure and can lead to subgroup formation."
https://openalex.org/W2169499431,"Misfolded protein aggregation causes disease and aging; autophagy counteracts this by eliminating damaged components, enabling cells to survive starvation. The cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway in yeast encompasses the aggregation of the premature form of aminopeptidase 1 (prApe1) in cytosol and its sequestration by autophagic proteins into a vesicle for vacuolar transport. We show that the propeptide of Ape1 is important for aggregation and vesicle formation and that it is sufficient for binding to prApe1 and Atg19. Defective aggregation disrupts vacuolar transport, suggesting that aggregate shape is important in vesicle formation, whereas Atg19 binding is not sufficient for vacuolar transport. Aggregation involves hydrophobicity, whereas Atg19 binding requires additional electrostatic interactions. Ape1 dodecamerization may cluster propeptides into trimeric structures, with sufficient affinity to form propeptide hexamers by binding to other dodecamers, causing aggregation. We show that Ape1 aggregates bind Atg19 and Atg8 in vitro; this could be used as a scaffold for an in vitro assay of autophagosome formation to elucidate the mechanisms of autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2122837549,"Much work has been performed on understanding the effects of additives on protein thermodynamics and degradation kinetics, in particular addressing the Hofmeister series and other broad empirical phenomena. Little attention, however, has been paid to the effect of additive-additive interactions on proteins. Our group and others have recently shown that such interactions can actually govern protein events, such as aggregation. Here we use dendrimers, which have the advantage that both size and surface chemical groups can be changed and therein studied independently. Dendrimers are a relatively new and broad class of materials which have been demonstrated useful in biological and therapeutic applications, such as drug delivery, perturbing amyloid formation, etc. Guanidinium modified dendrimers pose an interesting case given that guanidinium can form multiple attractive hydrogen bonds with either a protein surface or other components in solution, such as hydrogen bond accepting counterions. Here we present a study which shows that the behavior of such macromolecule species (modified PAMAM dendrimers) is governed by intra-solvent interactions. Attractive guanidinium-anion interactions seem to cause clustering in solution, which inhibits cooperative binding to the protein surface but at the same time, significantly suppresses nonnative aggregation."

Here we sought to investigate the time course of the selective aspect of attention, using a cuing task that did not require spatial shifting. In several experiments, targets were always presented at central fixation, and were preceded by a cue at different cue-target intervals. The selection component of attention was investigated by manipulating the presence of distractors. Regardless of the presence of distractors, an initial rapid performance enhancement was found that reached its maximum at around 100 ms post cue onset. Subsequently, when the target was the only item in the display, performance was sustained, but when the target was accompanied by irrelevant distractor items, performance declined. This temporal pattern matches closely with the transient attention response that has been found in spatial cuing studies, and shows that the selectivity aspect of attention is transient."
https://openalex.org/W2041663115,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors. AD is characterized by the local infiltration of T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. Recent clinical studies have shown important roles of the Th2 chemokines, CCL22 and CCL17 in the pathogenesis of AD. To investigate whether polymorphisms of the CCL22 gene affect the susceptibility to AD, we conducted association studies and functional studies of the related variants. We first resequenced the CCL22 gene and found a total of 39 SNPs. We selected seven tag SNPs in the CCL22 gene, and conducted association studies using two independent Japanese populations (1st population, 916 cases and 1,032 controls; 2nd population 1,034 cases and 1,004 controls). After the association results were combined by inverse variance method, we observed a significant association at rs4359426 (meta-analysis, combined P = 9.6×10−6; OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.85). Functional analysis revealed that the risk allele of rs4359426 contributed to higher expression levels of CCL22 mRNA. We further examined the allelic differences in the binding of nuclear proteins by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The signal intensity of the DNA-protein complex derived from the G allele of rs223821, which was in absolute LD with rs4359426, was higher than that from the A allele. Although further functional analyses are needed, it is likely that related variants play a role in susceptibility to AD in a gain-of-function manner. Our findings provide a new insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2046335251,"It is indicated that there are important molecules interacting with brain nervous systems to regulate feeding and energy balance by influencing the signaling pathways of these systems, but relatively few of the critical players have been identified. In the present study, we provide the evidence for the role of Abelson helper integration site 1 (Ahi1) protein as a mediator of feeding behavior through interaction with serotonin receptor 2C (5-HT2CR), known for its critical role in feeding and appetite control. First, we demonstrated the co-localization and interaction between hypothalamic Ahi1 and 5-HT2CR. Ahi1 promoted the degradation of 5-HT2CR through the lysosomal pathway. Then, we investigated the effects of fasting on the expression of hypothalamic Ahi1 and 5-HT2CR. Fasting resulted in an increased Ahi1 expression and a concomitant decreased expression of 5-HT2CR. Knockdown of hypothalamic Ahi1 led to a concomitant increased expression of 5-HT2CR and a decrease of food intake and body weight. Last, we found that Ahi1 could regulate the expression of neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin. Taken together, our results indicate that Ahi1 mediates feeding behavior by interacting with 5-HT2CR to modulate the serotonin signaling pathway.

Obesity and its associated ailments such as diabetes have become a worldwide epidemic carrying with them a heavy toll of morbidity and mortality. Over the past decades, it has become evident that neural circuits in the central nervous system play a direct and crucial role in controlling feeding and energy homeostasis (1Morton G.J.

Disruptions in the mechanisms of central nervous system energy sensing are able to alter the standard homeostatic responses and are factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity and diabetes. The brain serotonin system has long been implicated in the neural regulation of food intake and energy metabolism, as highlighted by the clinical use of serotonin releasers and reuptake inhibitors as appetite suppressant and weight loss medication (3Jespersen S.

Depletion of central serotonin using selective neurotoxins has been shown to result in hyperphagia and obesity, whereas the release of serotonin and the inhibition of reuptake by d-fenfluramine potently reduce feeding and body weight (6Pinder R.M.

A number of groups have identified Ahi1 mutations as a frequent cause of disease in patients with specific forms of Joubert syndrome, an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder, and its related disorders (JSRD) (18Dixon-Salazar T.

Both protein and mRNA studies have shown that Ahi1 is distributed in several brain areas implicated in feeding and metabolic regulation such as the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, the arcuate nucleus (ARC), the lateral hypothalamic area, and the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brain stem (21Doering J.E.

Genetic studies also indicate that Ahi1 may be related to energy metabolism. One group has reported a significant association between variants in the Ahi1 gene and type 2 diabetes in a Dutch population (24Salonen J.T. Uimari P. Aalto J.M. Pirskanen M. Kaikkonen J. Todorova B.

We noticed that Ahi1 and 5-HT2CR have similar distribution in the hypothalamus. This prompted us to investigate the relationship between Ahi1 and 5-HT2CR and their probable roles in feeding control. The findings in the present study provide evidence that Ahi1 interacts with 5-HT2CR to mediate feeding behavior. Our study reveals the normal neural function of Ahi1 in feeding control and offers insight into the understanding of how hypothalamic key molecules regulate the feeding behavior. Male C57BL/6J mice, 6–10 weeks old, were purchased from Southern Medical University, Guangdong Province, China. The animals were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum. Animals were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for a week before all tests. Animal care and all procedures for animal experiments conformed to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Guangzhou Biomedical and Health Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The antibody against Ahi1 is described in our previous study (23Sheng G. Xu X. Lin Y.F. Wang C.E. Rong J. Cheng D. Peng J. Jiang X. Li S.H. Li X.J.

For immunofluorescent staining, sections of brain tissue and coverslips plated with hypothalamic neurons or HEK293 cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.02 m PBS at room temperature for 1 h and followed by incubating with rabbit anti-Ahi1 antibody (1:300) and goat anti-5-HT2CR (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. Then the sections were incubated successively with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (both from Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min. Tissue sections and coverslips were mounted onto glass slides. Labeled samples were imaged using a ×100 objective Leica SP2 confocal microscope. Lysates from mouse hypothalami or from co-transfected HEK293 cells were extracted using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. 500 μl of supernatant (adjusted to 1 mg/ml) was first clarified by incubation with 40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding. After pelleting the beads, the supernatant was then incubated with antibody to mouse Ahi1 (1: 50), anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (Sigma, clone HA-7, diluted 1:4000), anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab290, diluted 1:1000), or immunoglobulin G as control overnight at 4 °C followed by brief centrifugation. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with low detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.2% Tween 20) and subjected to Western blotting. A total of 15–20 mg of whole hypothalami from fasted mice or Ahi1 knockdown mice were adequately blended in 1 ml of pre-cold membrane purification buffer (MPB: 250 mm sucrose, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.3% Triton X-114, and protease inhibitor mixture) on ice. The suspensions were ultracentrifuged at 59,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and then the pellets (P1) were re-extracted as mentioned above in 1 ml of MPB with 0.8% Triton X-114. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the soluble materials were removed by ultracentrifugation (as above). The pellets (P2, purified membrane fraction) were washed twice with MPB and finally resuspended in MPB. Hypothalami were mechanically homogenized and sonicated in homogenization buffer on ice. 20 μg of tissue protein was size-fractionated using 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Cell lysates (50 μg) from treated N18TG2 cells were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted. After blotting with the antibodies, anti-mouse Ahi1 or anti-5-HT2CR and anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma), anti-β-actin (ACTB, GenScript), and anti-LAMP1 detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitations of gray density were performed using ImageQuant 5.2 software. Total RNA was isolated from tissue samples or cell samples using TRIzol reagent (Ambion). cDNA was synthesized by using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). Primers for mouse Ahi1 (forward primer, 5′-GAC AGG AGA ACA AGT GGC AAT G-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ATC AGT GGT CAG CAC GAA CGA-3′), mouse NPY (forward primer, 5′-TAC TAC TCC GCT CTG CGA CAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCA CAT GGA AGG GTC TTC AAG-3′), mouse proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (forward primer, 5′-CGA GCG GCC ATT AGG CTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTT GTC CTT GGG CGG GTT-3′), and reference gene GAPDH (forward primer, 5′-CTG CAC CAC CAA CTG CTT AGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGA AGG CCA TGC CAG TGA-3′) were optimized to an equal annealing temperature of 60 °C. Expression of Ahi1, NPY, POMC, and GAPDH was determined by real-time PCR using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq (Takara) on an MJ four-color real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression ratio of target genes among the experimental groups was calculated and statistically analyzed as reported previously (28Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar, 29Yuan J.S. Reed A. Chen F. Stewart Jr., C.N. Statistical analysis of real-time PCR data.BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). For the knockdown of Ahi1, C57BL/6J mice (8-week-old males) were injected bilaterally with recombinant adenovirus vector encoding Ahi1-specific siRNA (Ad-siAhi1) or scramble-siRNA (Ad-scRNA) as control. A total of 1 × 1011 plaque-forming units in 1 μl of PBS were injected bilaterally intrahypothalamus at the stereotaxic positions (anteroposterior −1.1 mm, mediolateral −0.5 mm, dorsalventral −5.5 mm; anteroposterior −1.1 mm, mediolateral +0.5 mm, dorsalventral −5.5 mm). The adenoviral vector also independently expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP), which enabled us to trace the vector. Injection at the above coordinates allowed the adenovirus to mainly infect the ventromedial hypothalamus, ARC, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and other nuclei in the hypothalamus (Fig. 4A). The mice were single-housed in regular plastic cages before and after the surgical procedure. Food intake and body weight were recorded daily for 4 weeks. After a period of 3–5 days post-surgical recovery, the mice were tested for glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests performed as described previously (30Sutton G.M. Trevaskis J.L. Hulver M.W. McMillan R.P. Markward N.J. Babin M.J. Meyer E.A. Butler A.A.

Glycemia was assessed using a blood glucose test meter. Co-localization of Ahi1 and 5-HT2CR was observed on the networks of cultured mice hypothalamic neurons. The details of culture preparations have been described previously (31Swandulla D. Misgeld U. Development and properties of synaptic mechanisms in a network of rat hypothalamic neurons grown in culture.J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 64: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, hypothalamic tissue was dissected from newborn mice. Hypothalamic neural cells were planted on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips at a density of ∼2000 cells/cm2. Cultures were kept in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen) for 14 days in vitro. N18TG2 cells, the mouse neuroblastoma cell line with endogenous Ahi1 expression, were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories), 1 mm non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). DNA constructs for expression of Ahi1 cDNA plasmids encoding full-length mouse Ahi1-(1–1047) were generated as in a previous study (32Jiang X. Hanna Z. Kaouass M. Girard L. Jolicoeur P. Ahi-1, a novel gene encoding a modular protein with WD40-repeat and SH3 domains, is targeted by the Ahi-1 and Mis-2 provirus integrations.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9046-9059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We used PCR to generate C-terminally truncated mouse Ahi1-(1–820). These Ahi1 cDNAs were sequenced and cloned to the PRK vector that links the influenza HA epitope on the upstream of the Ahi1 coding region. For transfection of foreign DNAs into N18TG2, plasmid-polyethylenimine (Polysciences, Inc.) complexes incubated with cultures for 1 h. After 36 h of transfection, N18TG2 cells were stimulated under 5 μm meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP; Sigma) with or without 100 μm chloroquine (Chlq; Sigma) for the indicated time and then immediately collected for the following quantitative assays. For virus infection, the cells were infected by Ad-siAhi1 (1 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml medium) for 8 h and sampled at 24 h post-infection. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. When 50% confluence had been achieved, the HEK293 cells were co-transfected with constructs encoding DsRed-tagged Ahi1 and GFP-tagged 5-HT2CR as described above. N18TG2 cells, co-transfected with PRK-mAhi1-DsRed/PRK-DsRed and GFP-5-HT2CR, were washed once, fixed for 10 min at −20 °C in 50% (v/v) acetone/methanol, and air-dried. Cells were blocked by incubating them for 1 h in 5% BSA and then with anti-LAMP1 primary antibody (4 μg/ml, Abcam) at 4 °C for 24 h. Then coveslips were washed several times and incubated with Cy5-labeled anti-mouse IgG for 45 min at room temperature. After DAPI staining, four-color slides were visualized with a Leica SP2 confocal scanning microscope set up as follows: 403 nm laser (25% of power) window, 410–483 nm; 488 laser (25% of power) window, 493–538 nm; 543 nm laser (90% of power) window, 548–628 nm; and 633 nm laser (25% of power), window 638–700 nm. Images were collected using the microscope in sequential mode with a frame average and a format of 1024 × 1024 pixels and were analyzed using NIH ImageJ 1.40g software. For statistical analyses, images for all conditions were analyzed using identical acquisition parameters, and untreated and treated cells from the same culture preparation were always compared with one another. The images were also collected blind to experimental condition. The total thresholded area of fluorescently labeled overlay regions was automatically measured and divided by the total cell area, which was determined by setting a lower threshold level to measure the background fluorescence produced by the fixed cells. For each experiment, the fluorescence of all cells was normalized by dividing the average fluorescence of the untreated control cells. All cells that expressed 5-HT2CR with less than the average at 30% were excluded from analysis because of the variation in transfection efficiency. GraphPad Prism was utilized for data analysis. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were carried out by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. First, we cultured hypothalamic neurons in vitro. In double-labeled immunofluorescence staining assays of cultured hypothalamic neurons, Ahi1 was observed to co-localize significantly with 5-HT2CR (Fig. 1A, top and middle rows). Staining of mouse brain sections also revealed an extensive overlap of the two proteins in hypothalamus nucleus such as ARC (Fig. 1A, bottom row). A co-immunoprecipitation study was performed in mice hypothalamus homogenates. As shown in Fig. 1B, 5-HT2CR selectively bound to endogenous Ahi1, whereas no signal was detected in immunoprecipitates from non-immune rabbit serum control. To confirm this physical interaction, we subsequently expressed them in transfected HEK293 cells; GFP-5-HT2CR showed an extensive distribution throughout the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of the cell, whereas Ahi1 showed a unique distribution pattern characterized as dot-like structures. Co-expression of 5-HT2CR and Ahi1 displayed apparent co-localization in punctate aggregates in the cytoplasm of HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). Their interaction was further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Ahi1 antibody (supplemental Fig. 1B). Then, we constructed the C terminal-truncated Ahi1. In the immunofluorescence experiments, we found that the co-localization of Ahi1 and 5-HT2CR was lost in the cells transfected with C terminal-truncated Ahi1 (Fig. 1D). Similarly the combination of Ahi1 and 5-HT2CR was abolished in the C terminal-truncated Ahi1 (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that the C terminus of Ahi1 is the region where it interacts with 5-HT2CR. Given the WD40 repeat domains and the SH3 domain found in the Ahi1 protein (32Jiang X. Hanna Z. Kaouass M. Girard L. Jolicoeur P. Ahi-1, a novel gene encoding a modular protein with WD40-repeat and SH3 domains, is targeted by the Ahi-1 and Mis-2 provirus integrations.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9046-9059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Ahi1 may play a role in neurotransmitter receptor trafficking as an adaptor between cytoskeleton and membrane protein. It has been reported that Ahi1 participates in the process of intracellular vesicle trafficking and is co-localized with microtubules and the microtubule-organizing center (33Keller L.C. Geimer S.

Genet. 2010; 42: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We postulated that Ahi1 could participate in 5-HT2CR vesicles sorting to degradation after endocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with mCPP, an agonist of 5-HT2CR (13Vickers S.P. Easton N. Webster L.J. Wyatt A. Bickerdike M.J. Dourish C.T. Kennett G.A. Oral adnmnistration of the 5-HT2C receptor agonist, mCPP, reduces body weight gain in rats over 28 days as a result of maintained hypophagia.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2003; 167: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the 5-HT2CR decreased in a time-dependent way in the cells transfected with full-length Ahi1, whereas in the cells transfected with truncated Ahi1 this decrease was inhibited. Then we addressed the pathway of 5-HT2CR degradation. We first investigated the possible involvement of the lysosomal pathway by treatment with Chlq, a lysosomal enzyme inhibitor. Analysis by Western blot revealed that treatment with Chlq increased the level of 5-HT2CR in mCPP treated N18TG2 cells (Fig. 2B, lane 3 versus lane 2), thereby indicating that the lysosomal pathway mediates internalized 5-HT2CR degradation. To address the possible function of Ahi1 in lysosomal sorting, we investigated whether the expression of"

The use of antimicrobials in agriculture is often cited as a major source of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria of humans, suggesting that DT104 in animals and humans should demonstrate similar prevalences of resistance determinants. Until very recently, only the application of molecular methods would allow such a comparison and our understanding has been hindered by the fact that surveillance data are primarily phenotypic in nature. Here, using large scale surveillance datasets and a novel Bayesian approach, we infer and compare the prevalence of Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1), SGI1 variants, and resistance determinants independent of SGI1 in animal and human DT104 isolates from such phenotypic data. We demonstrate differences in the prevalences of SGI1, SGI1-B, SGI1-C, absence of SGI1, and tetracycline resistance determinants independent of SGI1 between these human and animal populations, a finding that challenges established tenets that DT104 in domestic animals and humans are from the same well-mixed microbial population."
https://openalex.org/W1993561666,"Human holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) catalyzes linkage of the vitamin biotin to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain of five biotin-dependent carboxylases. In the two-step reaction, the activated intermediate, bio-5'-AMP, is first synthesized from biotin and ATP, followed by covalent linkage of the biotin moiety to a specific lysine residue of each carboxylase BCCP domain. Selectivity in HCS-catalyzed biotinylation to the carboxylases was investigated in single turnover stopped flow and quench flow measurements of biotin transfer to the minimal biotin acceptor BCCP fragments of the carboxylases. The results demonstrate that biotinylation of the BCCP fragments of the mitochondrial carboxylases propionyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase is fast and limited by the bimolecular association rate of the enzyme with substrate. By contrast, biotinylation of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2 (ACC1 and ACC2) fragments, both of which are accessible to HCS in the cytoplasm, is slow and displays a hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration. The correlation between HCS accessibility to biotin acceptor substrates and the kinetics of biotinylation suggests that mitochondrial carboxylase sequences evolved to produce fast association rates with HCS in order to ensure biotinylation prior to mitochondrial import. In addition, the results are consistent with a role for HCS specificity in dictating biotin distribution among carboxylases."
https://openalex.org/W2106156385,"Experimental observations and numerical studies with dissipative metabolic networks have shown that cellular enzymatic activity self-organizes spontaneously leading to the emergence of a metabolic core formed by a set of enzymatic reactions which are always active under all environmental conditions, while the rest of catalytic processes are only intermittently active. The reactions of the metabolic core are essential for biomass formation and to assure optimal metabolic performance. The on-off catalytic reactions and the metabolic core are essential elements of a Systemic Metabolic Structure which seems to be a key feature common to all cellular organisms.In order to investigate the functional importance of the metabolic core we have studied different catalytic patterns of a dissipative metabolic network under different external conditions. The emerging biochemical data have been analysed using information-based dynamic tools, such as Pearson's correlation and Transfer Entropy (which measures effective functionality). Our results show that a functional structure of effective connectivity emerges which is dynamical and characterized by significant variations of bio-molecular information flows.We have quantified essential aspects of the metabolic core functionality. The always active enzymatic reactions form a hub--with a high degree of effective connectivity--exhibiting a wide range of functional information values being able to act either as a source or as a sink of bio-molecular causal interactions. Likewise, we have found that the metabolic core is an essential part of an emergent functional structure characterized by catalytic modules and metabolic switches which allow critical transitions in enzymatic activity. Both, the metabolic core and the catalytic switches in which also intermittently-active enzymes are involved seem to be fundamental elements in the self-regulation of the Systemic Metabolic Structure."

https://openalex.org/W2009690530,"The ability to predict the consequences of one's behavior in a particular environment is a mechanism for adaptation. In the absence of any cost to this activity, we might expect agents to choose behaviors that maximize their fitness, an example of directed innovation. This is in contrast to blind mutation, where the probability of becoming a new genotype is independent of the fitness of the new genotypes. Here, we show that under environments punctuated by rapid reversals, a system with both genetic and cultural inheritance should not always maximize fitness through directed innovation. This is because populations highly accurate at selecting the fittest innovations tend to over-fit the environment during its stable phase, to the point that a rapid environmental reversal can cause extinction. A less accurate population, on the other hand, can track long term trends in environmental change, keeping closer to the time-average of the environment. We use both analytical and agent-based models to explore when this mechanism is expected to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2008402841,"Phenotypic plasticity is common in many taxa, and it may increase an organism's fitness in heterogeneous environments. However, in some cases, the frequency of environmental changes can be faster than the ability of the individual to produce new adaptive phenotypes. The importance of such a time delay in terms of individual fitness and species adaptability has not been well studied. Here, we studied gender plasticity of Alternanthera philoxeroides to address this issue through a reciprocal transplant experiment. We observed that the genders of A. philoxeroides were plastic and reversible between monoclinous and pistillody depending on habitats, the offspring maintained the maternal genders in the first year but changed from year 2 to 5, and there was a cubic relationship between the rate of population gender changes and environmental variations. This relationship indicates that the species must overcome a threshold of environmental variations to switch its developmental path ways between the two genders. This threshold and the maternal gender stability cause a significant delay of gender changes in new environments. At the same time, they result in and maintain the two distinct habitat dependent gender phenotypes. We also observed that there was a significant and adaptive life-history differentiation between monoclinous and pistillody individuals and the gender phenotypes were developmentally linked with the life-history traits. Therefore, the gender phenotypes are adaptive. Low seed production, seed germination failure and matching phenotypes to habitats by gender plasticity indicate that the adaptive phenotypic diversity in A. philoxeroides may not be the result of ecological selection, but of gender plasticity. The delay of the adaptive gender phenotype realization in changing environments can maintain the differentiation between gender systems and their associated life-history traits, which may be an important component in evolution of novel traits and taxonomic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2014441170,"Cell-based image analysis of time-lapse imaging is mainly challenged by faint fluorescence and dim boundaries of cellular structures of interest. To resolve these bottlenecks, a novel method was developed based on “retrospective” analysis for cells undergoing minor morphological changes during time-lapse imaging. We fixed and stained the cells with a nuclear dye at the end of the experiment, and processed the time-lapse images using the binary masks obtained by segmenting the nuclear-stained image. This automated method also identifies cells that move during the time-lapse imaging, which is a factor that could influence the kinetics measured for target proteins that are present mostly in the cytoplasm. We then validated the method by measuring interferon gamma (IFNγ) induced signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) nuclear translocation in living HeLa cells. For the first time, automated large-scale analysis of nuclear translocation in living cells was achieved by our novel method. The responses of the cells to IFNγ exhibited a significant drift across the population, but common features of the responses led us to propose a three-stage model of STAT1 import. The simplicity and automation of this method should enable its application in a broad spectrum of time-lapse studies of nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation."
