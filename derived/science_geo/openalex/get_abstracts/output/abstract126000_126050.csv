Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that oxidized arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids present in mildly oxidized low density lipoproteins (MM-LDL) can activate endothelial cells to bind monocytes. In this study, biologically active oxidized arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids were produced by autoxidation of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Ox-PAPC) and analyzed by liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in conjuction with biochemical derivatization techniques. We have now determined the molecular structure of two of three molecules present in MM-LDL and Ox-PAPC that induce monocyte-endothelial interactions. These lipids were identified as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleryl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (m/z 594.3) and 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (m/z 610.2). These two molecules were produced by unambiguous total synthesis and found to be identical by analytical techniques and bioactivity assays to those present in MM-LDL and Ox-PAPC. Evidence for the importance of all three oxidized phospholipids in vivo was suggested by their presence in fatty streak lesions from cholesterol-fed rabbits and by their immunoreactivity with natural antibodies present in ApoE null mice. Overall, these studies suggest that specific oxidized derivatives of arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids may be important initiators of atherogenesis.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease responsible for profound human morbidity and mortality (1Working Group of Arteriosclerosis (1981) Report of the Working Group of Arteriosclerosis of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Vol. 2, DHEW publication (NIH) 82-2035, Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar). The atherosclerotic lesion typically develops from a clinically silent fatty streak lesion, characterized by the presence of lipid-laden monocyte-macrophages in the subendothelial space, to an advanced fibro-fatty lesion that can rupture, resulting in acute thrombosis and vascular occlusion (2Fuster V.

Minimally modified LDL (MM-LDL) is LDL that has undergone antioxidant depletion and oxidation of arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids, much less linoleic acid oxidation, with little or no protein modification (14Berliner J.A.

MM-LDL has unique biological properties that are not associated with native LDL or highly oxidized LDL, which may be involved in the recruitment and entry of monocytes into the vessel wall and their subsequent maturation into macrophages (14Berliner J.A.

We have previously shown that oxidized phospholipids isolated from MM-LDL, as well as a mixture of products formed from the autooxidation of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Ox-PAPC), mimic the biological activity of MM-LDL (19Watson A.D. Berliner J.A. Hama S.Y. La Du B.N. Faull K.F. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2882-2891Google Scholar). There is also evidence that high density lipoproteins may inhibit monocyte-endothelial interactions induced by MM-LDL by altering the molecular structure of these biologically active oxidized phospholipids (15Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Sevanian A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 774-782Google Scholar, 19Watson A.D. Berliner J.A.

In this report we combine liquid chromatography with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to elucidate the structural identification of biologically active phospholipids in Ox-PAPC and confirm their presence in MM-LDL. In addition, we present evidence for the presence of these oxidized phospholipids in animal models susceptible to fatty streak formation and atherosclerosis. Tissue culture media, serum, and supplements were obtained from sources previously reported (14Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin.

Gelatin (endotoxin-free, tissue culture grade), methoxyamine hydrochloride, sodium borohydride, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, pentafluorobenzyl bromide, and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were obtained from Sigma. Authenticl-α-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) or Sigma, andl-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was purchased from DuPont NEN. Aminopropyl solid phase extraction columns were obtained from J. T. Baker Inc. Human aortic endothelial cells at passages 4–7 were cultured as described (14Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin.

Rabbits were fed for 24 weeks with a semipurified atherogenic diet containing 20% protein (casein), 46% carbohydrate (sucrose), and 11% fat (butter). The diets also contained 0.09% cholesterol, 1% corn oil to provide essential fatty acids, 14% cellulose, and levels of vitamins and minerals similar to those used previously in similar diets (21Wilson R.B. Newberne P.M. Conner M.W. Arch. Pathol. 1973; 96: 355-359Google Scholar). For some rabbits the diet was supplemented with the antioxidants vitamin E (147 IU α-tocopherol acetate/day/rabbit) or probucol (0.41 g/day/rabbit). After completion of the dietary regimen the rabbits were euthanized and the aortae were removed for the assessment of the extent of atherosclerosis. Immediately after sacrifice, the entire aorta from the aortic arch to just distal of the iliac bifurcation was removed and washed free of blood with 0.15 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The aortae were freed from adventitial debris, opened longitudinally, pinned flat, and photographed. The aortic arch was separated from the descending thoracic aorta 1–2 mm distal to the ductus scar, and the descending thoracic aorta was separated from the abdominal aorta 1–2 mm proximal to the celiac artery. Aortic specimens were weighed, placed in a test tube, covered with argon or nitrogen, and frozen at −70 °C protected from light prior to analysis. LDL (1.019–1.069 g/ml) was isolated from the sera of normal blood donors by density gradient ultracentrifugation as described (22Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 43: 1345-1353Google Scholar) and stored at 4 °C until use within 1–2 weeks of isolation. Lipoprotein concentration is expressed in terms of protein content throughout this report. MM-LDL was produced by dialysis at 5 mg protein/ml in 5 μmFeSO4·7H2O in phosphate-buffered saline (diluted 1:9 with sterile water) + 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.8, for ∼48 h at room temperature. Oxidation was terminated by the addition of EDTA and BHT (100 and 0.3 μm, respectively). The concentration of bacterial endotoxin in medium containing each agonist was <20 pg/ml (determined by chromogenic assay), which is approximately 100-fold less than that required to induce monocyte binding to endothelial cells (data not shown). PAPC was oxidized by transferring 1 mg in 100 μl of chloroform to a clean 16 × 125 mm glass test tube and evaporating the solvent under a stream of nitrogen. The lipid residue was allowed to autoxidize while being exposed to air for 24–48 h. The extent of oxidation was monitored by positive ion flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry. Lipids were extracted from rabbit aortic tissue with chloroform/methanol (2:2, v/v) (23Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar, 24Schwenke D.C. Ziversmit D.B. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 7: 367-377Google Scholar). An aliquot of this extract was supplemented with 20 μmol BHT/ml, covered with argon, sealed, and stored protected from light. These extracts were supplemented with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (50 ng/mg tissue) as an internal standard for the quantitative analysis of phospholipids (25Han X. Gubitosi-Klug R.A. Collins B.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5822-5832Google Scholar). Phospholipids, free fatty acids, and neutral lipids were separated by the method of Kaluzny using aminopropyl solid phase extraction chromatography (26Kaluzny M.A. Duncan L.A. Merritt M.V. Epps D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 135-140Google Scholar). Phospholipid recovery typically ranged between 95 and 98% as determined by including 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as an internal standard in the lipid-purification procedure. Lipid fractions not used immediately were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform containing 0.01% BHT, covered with argon, and stored at −44 °C. Oxidized phospholipids of interest were semipurified by preparative normal phase HPLC and treated with either methoxyamine hydrochloride, pentafluorobenzyl bromide, or sodium borohydride, and then lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Methoxyamine derivatives were produced by resuspending 250 μg of Ox-PAPC in a solution of 0.921 mm methoxyamine hydrochloride in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 4.0). The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, after which 3.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 0.5 ml of water was added. The solution was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2,000 ×g for 15 min. The chloroform phase was transferred to a clean glass test tube and 0.5 ml of methanol, 0.5 ml of water, and 40 μl of formic acid was added. The solution was again mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min. The chloroform phase was then collected for analysis. The second extraction step, which included formic acid, was necessary to displace salts (mostly sodium) that associated with phospholipids during incubation with phosphate-buffered saline. Without this step both the free phospholipids and phospholipid salts were detected by positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives of carboxylic acids were produced by resuspending 250 μg of Ox-PAPC in 50 μl of a 10% solution of pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile and 50 μl of a 20% solution ofN,N-diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile. The solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The solvent was dried under argon, and the lipids were re-extracted by addition of 3.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 0.5 ml of water. The solution was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min. The chloroform phase was transferred to a clean glass test tube and dried under nitrogen prior to lipid analysis. Ox-PAPC was reduced by resuspending 250 μg of lipid residue in 0.5 ml of a 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 8.0) and adding ∼10 μg of sodium borohydride. The lipids were reduced instantaneously and then extracted by addition of 3.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Salts were displaced by re-extraction in the presence of formic acid as described above. Normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) was performed by injecting isolated phospholipids (resuspended in chloroform) onto a silica column and eluting isocratically with a mobile solvent of acetonitrile/methanol/water (77:8:15, v/v/v). NP-HPLC analysis was performed using an analytical column (Spherisorb, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Alltech Associates, Inc.) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min or a preparative column (Adsorbosphere, 250 mm × 10 mm, 5 μm; Alltech Associates, Inc.) at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min. UV absorbance was detected with a diode array detector (L-3000, Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) scanning from 200 to 350 nm. In some cases, fractions were collected from the column under sterile conditions, dried to a residue under nitrogen at 37 °C, and either resuspended in tissue culture medium for monocyte adhesion assays or used as a semipure preparation for further modification and/or analysis by mass spectrometry. Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) was performed using an ODS column (Adsorbosphere HS, C18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Alltech Associates, Inc.). Phospholipids were eluted with a mobile phase of 90% methanol, which was changed linearly over a period of 30 min to 100% methanol, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. For a near homogeneous preparation of an oxidized phospholipid of interest, fractions obtained from preparative NP-HPLC were further purified by analytical RP-HPLC. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with a API III triple-quadrupole biomolecular mass analyzer (Perkin-Elmer) fitted with an articulated, pneumatically assisted nebulization probe and an atmospheric pressure ionization source. The tuning and calibration solution consisted of a mixture of polypropylene glycol 425, 1000, and 2000 (3.3 × 10−5, 1 × 10−4, and 2 × 10−4m, respectively) in H2O/methanol (50:50, v/v) containing 2 mmammonium formate and 0.1% acetonitrile. Calibration across them/z range 10–2400 was effected by multiple ion monitoring of eight polypropylene glycol positive ion solution signals (typically the singly charged ions at m/z 58.99, 326.25, 334.30, 906.67, 1254.92, 1545.13, 1863.34, 2010.47, and the doubly charged ion at m/z 520.4). The ion spray voltage was typically operated at 4.5 kV in positive mode and 3.5 kV in negative mode with 40 p.s.i. “zero”-grade air produced by a Zero Air Generator (Peak Scientific, Chicago, IL) at 0.6 liter/min. A curtain gas of N2 produced from the vapors of liquid N2 was used at a flow rate of 0.8 liter/min. Normal and precursor ion mass spectra were acquired by scanning quadrupole Q1. Daughter ion spectra were obtained in the negative ion mode by colliding the quadrupole Q1-selected pseudo-parent ion of interest produced at an orifice voltage of −105 with a mixture of 5.2% nitrogen in argon in quadrupole Q2 and scanning quadrupole Q3 to analyze the fragment ion products. Normal scan spectra were recorded at instrument conditions sufficient to resolve the isotopes of the polypropylene glycol/NH4+ singly charged ion atm/z 906 (40% valley definition). For precursor ion tandem MS/MS the analyzing quadrupole (Q3) and the mass selecting quadrupole (Q1) were operated at a resolution of about unitm/z (using a 35% peak valley definition at lowm/z and a 60% peak valley definition at highm/z). Reconstructed selected ion chromatograms were produced by software supplied by Perkin-Elmer. Phospholipids were introduced into the electrospray mass spectrometer by flow injection analysis or liquid chromatography (LC). For flow injection analysis (FIA), 20 μg of phospholipid was resuspended in 20 μl of FIA solvent consisting of acetonitrile/water/formic acid (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) and injected into FIA solvent flowing at a rate of 25 μl/min into the ion source of the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was set to scan from m/z 450–950 with an orifice voltage of +65, a step size of 0.3, a dwell time of 3 ms, and a scan speed of ∼4 s. For negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (step size = 1.0) a solvent of 100% methanol with 1 mmammonium acetate was used. Quantitative analysis of phospholipids was performed essentially as described by Han et al. (25Han X. Gubitosi-Klug R.A. Collins B.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5822-5832Google Scholar) using dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine as an internal standard. Phospholipids were quantitated based on their ion intensity relative to the internal standard using positive ion FIA-ESI-MS. The equimolar ion intensities of different species of phosphatidylcholines typically varied by less than 5% (25Han X. Gubitosi-Klug R.A. Collins B.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5822-5832Google Scholar). The procedure of Huckstep (28Huckstep M. Taylor R.J.K. Synthesis. 1982; 9: 881-882Google Scholar) was modified. Amberlyst-15 resin (4 g) was added to a magnetically stirred solution of 5-pentanolide (2.16 g, 21.6 mmol) in dry methanol (40 ml). The reaction mixture was boiled under reflux under dry nitrogen for 18 h, then filtered through florisil. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to produce methyl 5-hydroxypentanoate (2.8 g, 99%), which, without further purification, was oxidized with pyridinium chlorochromate as described previously (28Huckstep M. Taylor R.J.K. Synthesis. 1982; 9: 881-882Google Scholar). Flash chromatography on silica gel with ethyl acetate/hexane (1:3, v/v) delivered 5-oxopentanoate (1.94 g, 69%). The 1H NMR spectra of methyl 5-hydroxypentanoate and methyl 5-oxopentanoate were identical with those reported previously (28Huckstep M. Taylor R.J.K. Synthesis. 1982; 9: 881-882Google Scholar). To a magnetically stirred solution containing ammonium nitrate (80 mg, 1 mmol) in dry methanol (11 ml) was added freshly distilled trimethyl orthoformate (2.96 g, 28 mmol, 4 eq) and methyl 5-oxopentanoate (907 mg, 7 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen and monitored by TLC. The reaction was stopped at 24 h, and solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was titrated with ether (30 ml), and the ether solution was filtered to remove ammonium nitrate. Solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography on a column (50 mm × 180 mm) of silica gel (40 μm, J. T. Baker Inc.) with ethyl acetate/hexane (1:3, v/v) yielded methyl 5,5-dimethoxypentanoate (883 mg, 78.6%). The 1H NMR spectrum of methyl 5,5-dimethoxypentanoate was identical with that reported previously (29Nakamura Y. Ito A. Shin C. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1994; 67: 2151-2161Google Scholar). The methyl ester (142 mg, 0.81 mmol) was stirred with a solution of sodium hydroxide (161.4 mg, 4 mmol, 5 eq) in 4 ml of water/methanol/tetrahydrofuran (2:5:3, v/v/v) at room temperature. After 1.5 h, the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3 with ice-cold 0.1 n HCl and then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 15 ml). The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4 and filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to provide 5-dimethoxypentanoic acid (129 mg, 99%). The 1H NMR spectrum of 5-dimethoxypentanoic acid was identical with that reported previously (29Nakamura Y. Ito A. Shin C. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1994; 67: 2151-2161Google Scholar). Esterification of lysophosphatidylcholine with 5-dimethoxypentanoic acid was accomplished by the general method of Hebertt et al. (30Hebertt N. Beck A. Lennox R.B. Just G. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 1777-1783Google Scholar). Traces of moisture were removed from a mixture of acid (86.5 mg, 0.53 mmol, 3.1 eq) and 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (82.2 mg, 0.17 mmol) by azeotropic distillation with toluene (3 × 5 ml) under reduced pressure at 20 °C. Freshly distilled dry CHCl3 (10 ml), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (105 mg, 0.51 mmol, 3 eq), andp-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine (62 mg, 0.51 mmol, 3 eq) were added, and then the flask was flushed with nitrogen and protected from light. The reaction was monitored by TLC and was stopped at 26 h, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was flash chromatographed on a column (20 mm × 180 mm) of silica gel (40 μm, J. T. Baker Inc.) with CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (40:50:10, v/v/v) to produce 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-dimethoxypentanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (199 mg, 93%). 1H NMR: d 5.21 (dd, 1H, J = 4 Hz, 4 Hz), 4.4–4.3 (4H), 4.1 (dd, 1H, J = 4 Hz, 7 Hz), 3.97 (t, 2H, J = 7 Hz), 3.79 (m, 2H), 3.35 (s, 9H), 3.28 (s, 6H), 2.32 (t, 2H, J = 8 Hz), 2.25 (t, 2H, J = 9 Hz), 1.62 (m, 2H), 1.24 (24H), 0.86 (t, 3H, J = 8 Hz). Acetal hydrolysis was catalyzed by an acidic resin (31Coppola G.M. Synthesis. 1984; 11: 1021-1023Google Scholar). Thus, 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-dimethoxypentanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (30 mg) was dissolved in 6 ml of acetone/water (6:1, v/v) and stirred magnetically with Amberlyst-15 resin (15 mg). The reaction was monitored by TLC and was stopped at 6.5 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the crude product was flash chromatographed on a column (10 mm × 150 mm) of silica gel (40 μm, J. T. Baker Inc.) with CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (40:50:10, v/v/v) to yield 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleryl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC, 21 mg, 76%). 1H NMR: d 9.78 (s, 1H), 5.23 (m, 1H), 3.85–4.45 (8H), 3.37 (s, 9H), 2.57 (t, 2H, J = 7 Hz), 2.39 (m, 2H), 2.28 (t, 2H, J = 7 Hz), 1.92 (t, 2H, J = 7 Hz), 1.58 (m, 2H), 1.26 (24H), 0.88(t, 3H, J = 7 Hz). This spectrum agrees closely with that reported previously (32Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Google Scholar). For synthesis of 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (50 mg, 0.1 mmol) in a 15-ml flask was dried by azeotropic distillation with toluene (3 × 5 ml) under reduced pressure and then was connected to high vacuum (0.25 mm Hg) for 3 h. After adding glutaric anhydride (33.7 mg, 0.3 mmol),p-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine (18.5 mg, 0.15 mmol), and 3.5 ml of freshly distilled chloroform, the above flask was flushed with argon and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O, 70:26:4, v/v/v). After 21 h the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3.0 with cold 0.1n HCl, extracted with CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v, 3 × 30 ml), and washed with MeOH/H2O (pH 3.0, 1:1, v/v, 30 ml). The combined organic phase was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the resulting mixture was applied to a silica gel column (15 mm inner diameter × 200 mm), which was eluted with CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (40:50:10, v/v/v) to produce PGPC. 1-Palmitoyl-2-glutaryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:1H NMR (in CHCl3): δ 5.25 (m, 1H), 3.75–4.35 (m, 8H), 3.32 (s, 9H), 2.38 (m, 2H), 2.27 (t, 4H, J = 8 Hz), 1.87 (m, 2H), 1.58 (m, 2H), 1.26 (m, 24H), 0.87 (t, 3H) J = 8 Hz). These studies were performed essentially as described previously (14Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1260-1266Google Scholar). Briefly, for monocyte adhesion assays human aortic endothelial cells were incubated with test medium for 4 h at 37 °C. A suspension of human monocytes was added for 12–15 min, and nonadherent monocytes were removed. Bound monocytes were counted and expressed as monocytes/microscopic field. Data were analyzed using model 1 analysis of variance. Monoclonal autoantibodies that recognized oxidation-specific epitopes of oxidized LDL were cloned from hybridomas generated from apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoEØ) mice that had not been immunized exogenously as described (33Palinski W. Hörkkö S. Miller E. Steinbrecher U.P. Powell H.C. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 800-814Google Scholar). The supernatants from hybridomas produced by fusing B-lymphocytes obtained from the spleens of two ApoEØ mice with a myeloma cell line were screened for binding to either highly oxidized LDL, 4-hydroxynonenal-LDL, or malondialdehyde-modified LDL. Fractions obtained from LC-MS analysis of Ox-PAPC were dried under nitrogen at 37 °C and resuspended in 500 μl of absolute ethanol, and 25 μl of a 1:100 dilution in ethanol was added to each well of a 96-well white round bottomed MicroFluor (Dynatech) microtitration plate. Absolute ethanol was added to blank wells. The ethanol was evaporated to dryness over 10–15 min under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Purified murine monoclonal autoantibodies were diluted into Tris-buffered saline buffer with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.27 mm EDTA, and 20 μm BHT (dilution buffer). After adding 50 μl of solutions containing the primary antibody per well (10 μg/ml), the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed four times with washing buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.27 mmEDTA, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.001% aprotinin), and the amount of antibody bound was measured with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (Sigma) by incubating for 1 h at room temperature.

These proteins are believed to be membrane-associated and have been proposed to regulate apoptosis through both homodimerization and heterodimerization. We have found that whereas Bcl-2 is predominantly membrane-associated as previously reported, significant amounts of Bcl-XL and most of the Bax proteins are not membrane-associated and thus appear in the cytosolic fraction of thymocyte and splenocyte extracts. This finding allows the study of the dimerization properties and conformation of these proteins in the absence of detergent perturbation. For this analysis, we have produced monoclonal antibodies that are specific for known epitopes of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL. An antibody to an N-terminal epitope (α uBax 6A7) between amino acids 12 and 24 fails to bind the soluble cytosolic form of Bax, indicating that this epitope is normally buried. Nonionic detergents alter the Bax conformation to expose this epitope. In the presence of nonionic detergent, the 6A7 antibody avidly binds the monomeric form of Bax, but not Bax complexed with either Bcl-XL or Bcl-2. In contrast, a monoclonal antibody to an adjacent epitope of Bax (α mBax 5B7) within amino acids 3–16 binds the soluble and detergent-altered forms of Bax and also binds the Bax·Bcl-XL or the Bax·Bcl-2 complex. Surprisingly, in the absence of detergent Bax fails to form homodimers or heterodimers with Bcl-XL. These results demonstrate a novel conformational state of members of the Bcl-2 family under a physiological condition that is distinct from the detergent-altered state that forms dimers and is currently believed to regulate apoptosis.

Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL are members of a family of proteins that regulate apoptosis. The gene encoding Bcl-2 was first identified at the chromosomal translocation point t(14;18) in human B cell follicular lymphoma (1Tsujimoto Y. Finger L.R. Yunis J. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M.

Sklar J. Cell. 1986; 47: 19-28Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-2 enhanced cell survival by suppressing apoptosis in a number of cells subjected to a wide range of apoptosis-inducing stimuli, including nerve growth factor withdrawal, radiation, and chemotherapeutic agents (for reviews, see Refs. 4Boise L.H. Gottschalk A.R. Quintáns J. Thompson C.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 200: 107-121Google Scholar, 5Reed J.C. Hematol. Oncol. 1995; 9: 451-473Google Scholar, 6White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Google Scholar, 7Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Google Scholar). The gene encoding Bcl-XL was first identified by homology cloning using the bcl-2 gene as a probe (8Boise L.H. González-Garcı́a M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Google Scholar). Like Bcl-2, overexpression of Bcl-XL inhibited apoptosis that was induced by a variety of agents (9Chao D.T. Linette G.P. Boise L.H. White L.S. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 821-828Google Scholar). Finally, Bax was identified as a protein that co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-2 (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar). In contrast to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, overexpression of Bax accelerated cell death (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar).By immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid select studies, it appears that Bax may form homodimers or heterodimers with either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 11Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H-G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Formation of Bax homodimers has been proposed to promote cell death, and this could be blocked by Bax heterodimerization with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Based on Bax overexpression and dimerization studies, it has been postulated that the relative ratio of Bax homodimers to heterodimers may serve as a key sensory switch that dictates the initiation of apoptosis (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Google Scholar).Dimerizations between Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL are believed to be mediated through three highly conserved regions within each protein known as the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains (14Yin X-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Google Scholar, 15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar). BH1 and BH2 domains are required for Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to heterodimerize with Bax. Mutations within these domains disrupt their heterodimerizations with Bax and abrogate their abilities to prevent apoptosis (12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar, 14Yin X-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Google Scholar). Furthermore, the BH3 domain of Bax has been shown to be essential for both its homodimerization and heterodimerization with either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar).Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL have a hydrophobic segment at their respective C-terminal ends (8Boise L.H. González-Garcı́a M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Google Scholar, 10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 16Tsujimoto Y. Ikegaki N. Croce C.M. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 3-7Google Scholar). Hydropathy plots predict that these segments may serve as membrane anchors. Subcellular fractionation studies have shown Bcl-2 to be localized to the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and outer mitochondrial membranes (17Hockenbery D.M. Nuñez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Google Scholar, 18Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714Google Scholar). Recently, immunocytochemical studies have localized Bcl-XLto outer membranes of mitochondria (19González-Garcı́a M. Pérez-Ballestero R. Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nuñez G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042Google Scholar). Bax has been suggested to co-localize within the same subcellular compartments as Bcl-2 (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar) through its ability to dimerize with Bcl-2.In this paper, we describe the generation of several epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies against Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL. Using these antibodies, we probed the subcellular localization of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL in normal murine thymocytes and splenocytes and studied the conformational dependence of dimerization among members of the Bcl-2 family.DISCUSSIONBcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL are believed to be a group of membrane proteins that regulate apoptosis through in vivodimerizations (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar, 13Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Google Scholar). In healthy cells, the formation of pro-apoptotic Bax homodimers is thought to be countermanded by Bax heterodimerization with pro-survival factors Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Our finding that both Bax and Bcl-XLare soluble (30Hsu Y-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Google Scholar) allowed us to explore the dimerization process without perturbing the protein structures with detergent. Surprisingly, in the absence of detergent Bcl-XL failed to co-immunoprecipitate with Bax by the α mBax 5B7 antibody, whereas these two proteins readily co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of detergent. In addition, Bax homodimerization also was found to be dependent upon the presence of detergent. The differential localization of Bax and Bcl-2 suggests that these two proteins do not tightly associate in healthy thymocytes and splenocytes.The above observations raised questions as to the extent to which Bax heterodimer and homodimer formation occur under physiological conditions. Fig. 6 proposes a model of the detergent-induced dimerization of Bax. The observations that Bax did not homodimerize or heterodimerize with Bcl-XL in the absence of detergent indicate that the BH3 domain of Bax, which is crucial for Bax homodimerization and heterodimerization (15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar), may be inaccessible under physiological conditions. Immunoprecipitation studies with α uBax 6A7 antibody also indicate that the amino acid residues 12–24 of Bax are not exposed in the cytosol in the absence of detergent. The addition of detergent may thus cause a conformational change of Bax and reveal both the BH3 domain for Bax homo- and heterodimerization and the 6A7 epitope for antibody binding. Detergent is generally known to disrupt protein-protein interactions. However, in the case of Bax, it seems to promote heterodimeric and homodimeric complexes. At present, without the equivalent conformation-sensitive antibodies to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, it is not yet known whether such detergent-induced conformational changes also occur in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to allow for the exposure of BH1 and BH2 dimerization domains.In addition to immunoprecipitation analyses, dimerization of Bax also has been observed in both the yeast two-hybrid select systems and the recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein binding studies (11Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H-G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Google Scholar, 12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar, 15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar, 26Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Google Scholar). In both cases, Bax was present as a fusion protein. It is possible that Bax, as part of a fusion protein, displayed an alternate conformation that is similar to the detergent state of this protein with the BH3 domain readily accessible for dimerization. Moreover, by site-directed mutagenesis analyses of Bcl-XL and Bax, it was reported that heterodimerization of Bcl-XL with Bax is not necessary for death-repressing activity (27Cheng E.H-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Google Scholar, 28Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Google Scholar). Those results can be explained by our findings that soluble Bax and Bcl-XL do not form dimers in the cytoplasm in the first place. Mutations described in these two studies appeared to have eliminated the “detergent-induced” Bax heterodimer formation.The α uBax 6A7 antibody, which recognizes the detergent-induced exposure of the amino acid 12–24 epitope, also appears to compete with the heterodimeric partners of Bax. The α uBax 6A7 antibody-immunoprecipitated Bax was not associated with either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. This suggests that the dimerization of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 to Bax may cover up the 6A7 antibody epitope on Bax. Alternatively, the binding of α uBax 6A7 antibody to Bax may block the heterodimerization of Bax to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL by steric hindrance. Thus, under detergent-solubilized conditions the epitope for the 6A7 antibody may be in close proximity to the BH3 dimerization domain of Bax (15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar) at the tertiary structural level. Recently, the N-terminal region of the Bax homolog Bcl-XL has been also shown to be in proximity to its BH3 domain by x-ray crystallography (29Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S-L. Ng S-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Google Scholar).Bax homodimers have been proposed to accelerate cell death, and this can be blocked by Bax heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar). In our studies, we detected no Bax dimers in the cytosol. It is possible, however, that the Bax molecules that migrate into membranes during apoptosis (30Hsu Y-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Google Scholar) may acquire the detergent-induced dimer-promoting state of Bax. Alternatively, it is possible that Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, which induce opposite effects, may be involved in novel binding with and regulation of other cellular proteins that may function in opposing biochemical pathways. Overexpression of either Bax or Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL may then shift the equilibrium that favors either cell death or survival. If dimerizations of these proteins do not occur in vivo, then it would be crucial to determine whether these proteins compete for the binding of a common partner. Binding to a common partner could explain why mutations in BH1 and BH2 domains of Bcl-2 destroy its function. Resolving these issues will undoubtedly bring us closer to understanding the biochemical functions of members of the Bcl-2 family. Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL are members of a family of proteins that regulate apoptosis. The gene encoding Bcl-2 was first identified at the chromosomal translocation point t(14;18) in human B cell follicular lymphoma (1Tsujimoto Y. Finger L.R. Yunis J. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M.

Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Google Scholar, 15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar). BH1 and BH2 domains are required for Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to heterodimerize with Bax. Mutations within these domains disrupt their heterodimerizations with Bax and abrogate their abilities to prevent apoptosis (12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar, 14Yin X-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Google Scholar). Furthermore, the BH3 domain of Bax has been shown to be essential for both its homodimerization and heterodimerization with either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar). Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL have a hydrophobic segment at their respective C-terminal ends (8Boise L.H. González-Garcı́a M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Google Scholar, 10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 16Tsujimoto Y. Ikegaki N. Croce C.M. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 3-7Google Scholar). Hydropathy plots predict that these segments may serve as membrane anchors. Subcellular fractionation studies have shown Bcl-2 to be localized to the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and outer mitochondrial membranes (17Hockenbery D.M. Nuñez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Google Scholar, 18Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714Google Scholar). Recently, immunocytochemical studies have localized Bcl-XLto outer membranes of mitochondria (19González-Garcı́a M. Pérez-Ballestero R. Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nuñez G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042Google Scholar). Bax has been suggested to co-localize within the same subcellular compartments as Bcl-2 (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar) through its ability to dimerize with Bcl-2. In this paper, we describe the generation of several epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies against Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL. Using these antibodies, we probed the subcellular localization of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL in normal murine thymocytes and splenocytes and studied the conformational dependence of dimerization among members of the Bcl-2 family. DISCUSSIONBcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL are believed to be a group of membrane proteins that regulate apoptosis through in vivodimerizations (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar, 13Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Google Scholar). In healthy cells, the formation of pro-apoptotic Bax homodimers is thought to be countermanded by Bax heterodimerization with pro-survival factors Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Our finding that both Bax and Bcl-XLare soluble (30Hsu Y-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Google Scholar) allowed us to explore the dimerization process without perturbing the protein structures with detergent. Surprisingly, in the absence of detergent Bcl-XL failed to co-immunoprecipitate with Bax by the α mBax 5B7 antibody, whereas these two proteins readily co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of detergent. In addition, Bax homodimerization also was found to be dependent upon the presence of detergent. The differential localization of Bax and Bcl-2 suggests that these two proteins do not tightly associate in healthy thymocytes and splenocytes.The above observations raised questions as to the extent to which Bax heterodimer and homodimer formation occur under physiological conditions. Fig. 6 proposes a model of the detergent-induced dimerization of Bax. The observations that Bax did not homodimerize or heterodimerize with Bcl-XL in the absence of detergent indicate that the BH3 domain of Bax, which is crucial for Bax homodimerization and heterodimerization (15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar), may be inaccessible under physiological conditions. Immunoprecipitation studies with α uBax 6A7 antibody also indicate that the amino acid residues 12–24 of Bax are not exposed in the cytosol in the absence of detergent. The addition of detergent may thus cause a conformational change of Bax and reveal both the BH3 domain for Bax homo- and heterodimerization and the 6A7 epitope for antibody binding. Detergent is generally known to disrupt protein-protein interactions. However, in the case of Bax, it seems to promote heterodimeric and homodimeric complexes. At present, without the equivalent conformation-sensitive antibodies to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, it is not yet known whether such detergent-induced conformational changes also occur in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to allow for the exposure of BH1 and BH2 dimerization domains.In addition to immunoprecipitation analyses, dimerization of Bax also has been observed in both the yeast two-hybrid select systems and the recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein binding studies (11Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H-G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Google Scholar, 12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar, 26Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Google Scholar). In both cases, Bax was present as a fusion protein. It is possible that Bax, as part of a fusion protein, displayed an alternate conformation that is similar to the detergent state of this protein with the BH3 domain readily accessible for dimerization. Moreover, by site-directed mutagenesis analyses of Bcl-XL and Bax, it was reported that heterodimerization of Bcl-XL with Bax is not necessary for death-repressing activity (27Cheng E.H-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Google Scholar, 28Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Google Scholar). Those results can be explained by our findings that soluble Bax and Bcl-XL do not form dimers in the cytoplasm in the first place. Mutations described in these two studies appeared to have eliminated the “detergent-induced” Bax heterodimer formation.The α uBax 6A7 antibody, which recognizes the detergent-induced exposure of the amino acid 12–24 epitope, also appears to compete with the heterodimeric partners of Bax. The α uBax 6A7 antibody-immunoprecipitated Bax was not associated with either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. This suggests that the dimerization of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 to Bax may cover up the 6A7 antibody epitope on Bax. Alternatively, the binding of α uBax 6A7 antibody to Bax may block the heterodimerization of Bax to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL by steric hindrance. Thus, under detergent-solubilized conditions the epitope for the 6A7 antibody may be in close proximity to the BH3 dimerization domain of Bax (15Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar) at the tertiary structural level. Recently, the N-terminal region of the Bax homolog Bcl-XL has been also shown to be in proximity to its BH3 domain by x-ray crystallography (29Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S-L. Ng S-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Google Scholar).Bax homodimers have been proposed to accelerate cell death, and this can be blocked by Bax heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 12Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar). In our studies, we detected no Bax dimers in the cytosol. It is possible, however, that the Bax molecules that migrate into membranes during apoptosis (30Hsu Y-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Google Scholar) may acquire the detergent-induced dimer-promoting state of Bax. Alternatively, it is possible that Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, which induce opposite effects, may be involved in novel binding with and regulation of other cellular proteins that may function in opposing biochemical pathways. Overexpression of either Bax or Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL may then shift the equilibrium that favors either cell death or survival. If dimerizations of these proteins do not occur in vivo, then it would be crucial to determine whether these proteins compete for the binding of a common partner. Binding to a common partner could explain why mutations in BH1 and BH2 domains of Bcl-2 destroy its function. Resolving these issues will undoubtedly bring us closer to understanding the biochemical functions of members of the Bcl-2 family.

Furthermore, we have identified epidermal surface antigen both as a flotillin homologue and as a resident caveolar protein.

https://openalex.org/W2092280881,"By searching the expressedsequence tag (EST) data base, we identified partial cDNA sequences encoding a novel human CC chemokine. We determined the complete cDNA sequence that encodes a highly basic polypeptide of a total 98 amino acids with 20 to 30% identity to other human CC chemokines. We termed this novel chemokine fromEBI1-Ligand Chemokine as ELC (see below). The ELC mRNA was most strongly expressed in the thymus and lymph nodes. Recombinant ELC protein was expressed as a fusion protein with the Flag tag (ELC-Flag). For receptor-binding assays, recombinant ELC protein fused with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was used. By stably expressing five CC chemokine receptors (CCR1 to 5) and five orphan receptors, ELC-SEAP was found to bind specifically to an orphan receptor EBI1. Only ELC-Flag, but not MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, eotaxin, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), or liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC), competed with ELC-SEAP for EBI1. ELC-Flag-induced transient calcium mobilization and chemotactic responses in EBI1-transfected cells. ELC-Flag also induced chemotaxis in HUT78 cells expressing endogenous EBI1 at high levels. By somatic hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, the gene for ELC (SCYA19) was mapped to chromosome 9p13 instead of chromosome 17q11.2 where the genes for CC chemokines are clustered. Taken together, ELC is a highly specific ligand for EBI1, which is known to be expressed in activated B and T lymphocytes and strongly up-regulated in B cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus and T cells infected with herpesvirus 6 or 7. ELC and EBI1 may thus play roles in migration and homing of normal lymphocytes, as well as in pathophysiology of lymphocytes infected with these herpesviruses.

The chemokines are a group of approximately 70–90 amino acid structurally related polypeptides that play important roles in inflammatory and immunological responses primarily by virtue of their ability to recruit selective leukocyte subsets (1Baggiolini M.

Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol.

(1997) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar). Among the known orphan receptors, EBI1, being designated from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced gene 1 (40Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Google Scholar), is expressed in various lymphoid tissues and activate B and T lymphocytes (40Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G.

EBI1 is notable because it is strongly up-regulated in B cells upon infection with EBV (40Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Google Scholar, 42Burgstahler R. Kempkes B. Steube K. Lipp M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 737-743Google Scholar), is transactivated by EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) (42Burgstahler R. Kempkes B. Steube K. Lipp M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 737-743Google Scholar) and is also up-regulated in CD4+ T cells upon infection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and HHV-7 (43Hasegawa H. Utsunomiya Y. Yasukawa M. Yanagisawa K. Fujita S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5326-5329Google Scholar). The expressed sequence tags (ESTs) consist of partial “single pass” cDNA sequences from various tissues (44Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Med. 1993; 4: 332-333Google Scholar). Analysis of the EST data bases is becoming a powerful approach to look for new members of gene families. Recently, we have identified a number of novel human CC chemokines by initially searching the EST data bases for homology with known CC chemokine members (38Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar, 45Naruse K. Ueno M. Satoh T. Nomiyama H. Tei H. Takeda M. Ledbetter D.H. Van Coillie E. Opdenakker G. Gunge N. Sakaki Y. Iio M. Miura R. Genomics. 1996; 34: 236-240Google Scholar). Here we report a novel human CC chemokine that is expressed in various lymphoid tissues and turns out to be a specific high-affinity functional ligand for EBI1 (40Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Google Scholar). Thus, we have designated this novel CC chemokine ELC from EBI1-ligand chemokine. The ELC gene is mapped to chromosome 9p13 instead of 17q11.2 where the genes for most other CC chemokines are clustered. We now propose EBI1 to be designated as CCR7. Human hematopoietic cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 293/EBNA-1 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

The dbEST (44Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Med. 1993; 4: 332-333Google Scholar) was searched with various CC chemokine nucleotide sequences or amino acid sequences as queries using the data base search and analysis service Search Launcher (50Smith R.F. Wiese B.A. Wojzynski M.K. Davison D.B. Worley K.C. Genomic Res. 1996; 6: 454-462Google Scholar) available on the World Wide Web. The program used was Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (51Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA sequence was obtained by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method (52Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Google Scholar). In brief, 5′ and 3′ RACE polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out using human fetal lung cDNA commercially available for RACE-PCR (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA was amplified by PCR with one of the gene-specific primers based on an EST sequence (GenBankTMaccession number N71167) (5′ RACE-primer, CTCTGACCACACTCACCCTCTCGCT; 3′ RACE-primer, GAGCCCGGAGTCCGAGTCAAGCATT) and an AP1 primer (CLONTECH), which is complementary to part of the cDNA adaptor ligated at both ends of the cDNA. PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.2 mmeach of dNTPs, 10 pmol of each of the primers, 2.5 units of TAKARA LATaq (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), 1 × buffer supplied with the polymerase, and 0.55 μg of TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH). The PCR conditions were 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 4 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 4 min, and then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 4 min. The amplification products were cloned into pCR-II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by T-A ligation and sequenced on both strands using gene-specific and commercial primers. This was carried out as described previously (53Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Google Scholar). In brief, multiple tissue blots, and immune blots were purchased from CLONTECH. Filters were hybridized with the 32P-labeled ELC cDNA probe at 65 °C for 1 h in QuikHyb Hybridization Solution (Stratagene) containing denatured 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After washing at 65 °C for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, filters were exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. ELC was expressed as a fusion protein with the Flag tag (54Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Libby R.T. March C.J. Ceretti D.T. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Google Scholar). We originally constructed the pBluescriptKS-MCP1-Flag, encoding MCP-1 fused with the Flag tag, as follows. The SalI-MCP1-XbaI-Flag fragment was amplified from pCRScript-MCP1 by PCR using the LacZα-B primer (5′AAAGGGGGATGTGCTGCAAGGCG) and the MCP1-XbaI-GG-Flag primer (5′-GTCCTTGTAGTCGCCGCCTCTAGAAGTCTTCGGAGTTTGGGT). Then, theSalI-MCP1-XbaI-Flag-NotI fragment was amplified from the first PCR products by using the LacZα-B primer and the GG-Flag-NotI primer (5′-CGCGCGGCCGCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCCGCC). After digestion with SalI and NotI, the fragment was ligated into the SalI and NotI site of pBluescript KS vector. The MCP-1 coding sequence was removed from this vector by SalI and XbaI, and the ELC cDNA was subcloned in place of the MCP-1 cDNA. Then the DNA fragment encoding ELC-Flag was liberated by SalI and NotI, and inserted into pDREF-Hyg (53Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Google Scholar) to prepare the expression vector pDREF-ELC-Flag that expressed ELC fused at the COOH terminus with a 5 amino acid-linker (Ser-Arg-Ser-Ser-Gly) and the Flag tag (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) (54Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Libby R.T. March C.J. Ceretti D.T. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Google Scholar). To produce the ELC-Flag protein, 293/EBNA-1 cells were transfected with pDREF-ELC-Flag using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and cultured for 3–4 days. The culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation, filtered (0.22 μm), and applied to Anti-FLAG® M2 Affinity gel (Eastman Kodak Company, New Haven, CT) 2 times. After washing with 5 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. Eluted fractions were immediately neutralized by adding 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and silver staining. The fractions containing the ELC-Flag protein were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and injected into a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography column (4.6 × 250 mm Cosmocil 5C4-AR-300)(Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Proteins were eluted with a 0–60% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing ELC-Flag were pooled and lyophilized. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA kit (Pierce, Rodkford, IL). NH2-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a protein sequencer (Shimazu, Tokyo, Japan). ELC was expressed as a fusion protein with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) with a COOH terminus tag of 6 histidine residue, the (His)6tag, as described previously (38Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). In brief, the ELC cDNA was subcloned into pDREF-SEAP(His)6-Hyg (38Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar) so that ELC was fused through a 5 amino acid linker (Ser-Arg-Ser-Ser-Gly) to SEAP with the (His)6 tag. To produce the ELC-SEAP fusion protein, 293/EBNA-1 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with pDREF-ELC-SEAP(His)6-Hyg by using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 3–4 days, the culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation, filtered (0.22 μm), and added to 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.02% sodium azide. For the NH2-terminal sequence analysis, the fusion protein was affinity purified by nickel-agarose chromatography (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The concentration of ELC-SEAP was determined by a sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (38Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Maxsorb, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 2 μg/ml of monoclonal anti-placental alkaline phosphatase antibody (Medix Biotech, Foster City, CA) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, the samples were titrated in PBS with 0.02% Tween-20. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed, incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-placental alkaline phosphatase antibody diluted 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature, washed again, and incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingam, CA). After washing, bound peroxidase was detected by 3,3′-5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction was stopped by adding H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was read. The enzymatic activity of SEAP and ELC-SEAP were determined by a chemiluminescence assay using the Great EscApe Detection kit (CLONTECH). Purified placental alkaline phosphatase (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) was used to generate the standard curve. Alkaline phosphatase activity was expressed as relative light units, and 1 pmol of SEAP and ELC-SEAP employed in the present study corresponded to 1.45 × 108 and 1.99 × 108 relative light units, respectively. This was carried out as described previously (38Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). In brief, 2 × 105 cells were incubated for 1 h at 16 °C with 1 μm of SEAP or ELC-SEAP without or with increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokines in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide. MCP-1, eotaxin, LARC, and TARC were prepared as described previously (30Kitaura M. Nakajima T. Imai T. Harada S. Combadiere C. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. Yoshie O. J. Biol.

MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES were purchased from Pepro Tech (Rocky Hill, NJ). After that, cells were washed 5 times and lysed in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1% Triton X-100. Samples were heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate cellular phosphatases and centrifuged to remove cell debris. AP activity in 10 μl of lysate was determined by the chemiluminescence assay as described above. All samples were determined in duplicate. The binding data were analyzed by the LIGAND program (55Munson P. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar). K562 cells stably expressing cloned chemokine receptors were suspended at 3 × 106cells/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and loaded with 1 μm Fura-PE3-AM (Texas Fluorescence Labs) by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Loaded cells were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution-BSA and resuspended in the same buffer at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. To measure intracellular calcium, 2 ml of the cell suspension was placed in a quartz cuvette in a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B spectrofluorimeter and stimulated with chemokines at 37 °C. Fluorescence was monitored at 340 nm (λex1), 380 nm (λex2), and 510 nm (λem) every 200 ms. To determine EC50 for calcium mobilization, a dose-response curve was generated in each experiment by plotting percent maximum responses. The cell migration assay was performed using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber as described previously (53Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Google Scholar). In brief, chemokines were diluted in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% BSA and placed in lower wells (30 μl/well). Cells suspended in RPMI 1640, 1% BSA at 2 × 106/ml (293/EBNA-1 cells) or at 8 × 106/ml (HUT78) were added to upper wells (50 μl/well) that were separated from lower wells by a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with 5- or 8-μm pores precoated with type IV collagen. The chamber was incubated for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Filters were removed and stained with Diff-Quik (Harleco, Gibbstown, NJ). Migrated cell were counted in five randomly selected high-power fields (× 400) per well. All assays were done in triplicate. DNAs of the human × rodent somatic cell hybrids containing human monochromosomes (National Institute of General Medical Science Mapping Panel No. 2, Version 2, Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) and of 93 radiation hybrids (56Gyapay G.

The PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min in a 25-μl reactio"
https://openalex.org/W2073966706,"Convulxin, a powerful platelet activator, was isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom, and 20 amino acid N-terminal sequences of both subunits were determined. These indicated that convulxin belongs to the heterodimeric C-type lectin family. Neither antibodies against GPIb nor echicetin had any effect on convulxin-induced platelet aggregation showing that, in contrast to other venom C-type lectins acting on platelets, GPIb is not involved in convulxin-induced platelet activation. In addition, partially reduced/denatured convulxin only affects collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The mechanism of convulxin-induced platelet activation was examined by platelet aggregation, detection of time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins, and binding studies with 125I-convulxin. Convulxin induces signal transduction in part like collagen, involving the time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc receptor γ chain, phospholipase Cγ2, p72SYK, c-Cbl, and p36–38. However, unlike collagen, pp125FAK and some other bands are not tyrosine-phosphorylated. Convulxin binds to a glycosylated 62-kDa membrane component in platelet lysate and to p62/GPVI immunoprecipitated by human anti-p62/GPVI antibodies. Convulxin subunits inhibit both aggregation and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to collagen. Piceatannol, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with some specificity for p72SYK, showed differential effects on collagen and convulxin-stimulated signaling. These results suggest that convulxin uses the p62/GPVI but not the α2β1 part of the collagen signaling pathways to activate platelets. Occupation and clustering of p62/GPVI may activate Src family kinases phosphorylating Fc receptor γ chain and, by a mechanism previously described in T- and B-cells, activate p72SYK that is critical for downstream activation of platelets.

A large number of C-type lectins from snake venoms have been described over the last few years with effects on hemostasis. While most of these inhibit the function of the coagulation factors and platelet components that they bind to, a few activate platelets by direct or indirect effects. So far all of these have been shown to affect the von Willebrand factor (vWf) 1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; PLCγ2, phospholipase Cγ2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Grb2, growth factor receptor binding protein 2; SH2, Src homology region 2; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; Fcγ, Fc receptor γ chain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. -platelet GPIb-V-IX axis. They include botrocetin (1Usami Y. Fujimura Y. Suzuki M. Ozeki Y. Nishio K. Fukui H. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 928-932Google Scholar) and bitiscetin (2Hamako J. Matsui T. Suzuki M. Ito M. Makita K. Fujimura Y. Ozeki Y. Titani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 273-279Google Scholar) that bind to and change the conformation of vWf so that it can bind to GPIb and thus activate platelets and alboaggregin B (3Peng M. Lu W. Kirby E.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11529-11536Google Scholar) that activates platelets directly by binding to, and presumably clustering, GPIb. A further snake peptide from the venom of some Crotalus species has subunits with a molecular mass similar to the C-type lectins, is a strong activator of platelet phospholipase C, and has been termed convulxin (4Prado-Franceschi J. Vital-Brasil O. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 875-887Google Scholar, 5Vargaftig B.B. Joseph D. Wal F. Marlas G. Chignard M. Chevance L.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 92: 57-68Google Scholar, 6Marlas G. Joseph D.

Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 87-91Google Scholar). We have isolated a similar, possibly identical, molecule from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom and show that it belongs to the heterodimeric, C-type lectin family. It activates platelets not via GPIb but through the p62/GPVI component of the platelet collagen receptor, probably by a clustering effect, and induces signals similar to a set of those induced by collagen in platelets. Several platelet membrane glycoproteins have been implicated as collagen receptors, in particular GPIa-IIa (the α2β1 integrin) (9Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkermann J.W.N. Houdijk W.P.M. Sixma J.J.

Haematol. 1995; 89: 124-130Google Scholar). Since patients platelets lacking α2β1 do not adhere to or aggregate to collagen (9Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkermann J.W.N. Houdijk W.P.M. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Google Scholar, 10Kehrel B. Balleisen L. Kokott R. Mesters R. Stenzinger W. Clemetson K.J. van de Loo J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1074-1078Google Scholar), and antibodies against α2β1 block platelet adhesion to immobilized collagen (17Kunicki T.J. Nugent D.J. Staats S.J. Orchekowski R.P. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4516-4519Google Scholar, 18Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Google Scholar, 19Saelman E.U.M. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Hese K.M. de Groot P.G. Heijnen H.F.G. Sage E.H. Williams S. McKeown L. Gralnick H.R. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1244-1250Google Scholar), there is general agreement about the pivotal role of α2β1 in the adhesion of platelets to collagen fibers. Furthermore, it was suggested that platelet adhesion to collagen through the α2β1 integrin induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK; thus, the α2β1 integrin plays a more direct role in early events of collagen-induced platelet activation, other than mediating the initial adhesion to collagen (20Polanowska-Grabowska R. Geanacopoulos M. Gear A.R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 543-547Google Scholar, 21Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Google Scholar). Many of the platelet responses, induced by collagen, can be induced by synthetic, triple helical, collagen-like peptides based upon typical collagen sequences incorporating multiple glycine-proline-hydroxyproline repeats (22Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Google Scholar, 23Achison M. Joel C. Hargreaves P.G. Sage S.O. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W.

These responses are independent of the α2β1 receptor, which shows that receptor(s) other than α2β1 are also involved in the collagen-induced events. A platelet-activating antibody, anti-p62 IgG, found in a patient with autoimmune thrombocytopenia with a selective deficiency in collagen-induced platelet aggregation (25Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Google Scholar), immunoprecipitated a 62-kDa protein from normal platelets that was later described as GPVI (14Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Google Scholar). All four p62/GPVI-deficient patients, reported so far (14Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Google Scholar, 15Ryo R. Yoshida A. Sugano W. Yasunaga M. Nakayama K. Saigo K. Adachi M. Yamaguchi N. Okuma M. Am. J. Hematol. 1992; 39: 25-31Google Scholar, 16Arai M.

Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Google Scholar), showed defective platelet responses only to collagen despite the normal expression of α2β1. Although CD36, which has been found to be associated with Src family kinases (26Huang M.-M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7844-7848Google Scholar), also may play some role, the fact that patients lacking CD36 adhere normally and aggregate to collagen (27Zamamoto N. Ikeda H. Tandon N.N. Herman J. Tomiyama Y. Mitani T. Sekiguchi S. Lipsky R. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1990; 76: 1698-1703Google Scholar, 28Kehrel B. Kronenberg A. Rauterberg J. Niesing-Bresch D. Niehues U. Kardoeus J. Schwippert B.

Blood. 1994; 83: 2866-2871Google Scholar) shows that CD36 is less critical in collagen-induced platelet activation than α2β1 and p62/GPVI. A characteristic of platelet activation by collagen compared via G-protein-linked receptors, such as that for thrombin, is the early engagement of a wide range of tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, and their substrates. Collagen stimulation of platelets results in the phosphorylation of numerous proteins (reviewed in Ref. 31Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Google Scholar). Recent reports include collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) providing a mechanism for further platelet activation by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ and activating protein kinase C (32Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 617-622Google Scholar, 33Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Google Scholar) and of the Fc receptor γ chain (Fcγ) providing a mechanism for activation of the major tyrosine kinase p72SYK (24Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Google Scholar). Because there are at least two collagen receptors on platelets, but the relative contribution of each to collagen-induced platelet activation has not yet been determined, it is of interest to find platelet agonists that mimic the effect of collagen by acting through only one of the collagen receptors. Here we show that convulxin, a powerful platelet agonist purified fromC. durissus terrificus venom, belongs to the C-type lectin family, induces platelet activation/aggregation predominantly through one of the collagen receptors, p62/GPVI, and identify some of the signaling molecules involved. Lyophilized C. durissus terrificusvenom, Protein A-Sepharose, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies, bovine serum albumin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and Triton X-114 were from Sigma. Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Iloprost was a kind gift from Schering AG (Zürich, Switzerland). Na125I was from Amersham Corp. (Zürich, Switzerland), IODO-GEN and the SuperSignal chemiluminescence detection systems were from Pierce. Autoradiography (Fuji RX) films were from Fujifilm (Dielsdorf AG, Switzerland). Methylated type I calf skin collagen was a kind gift from Dr. J. Rauterberg. Piceatannol was from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-p72SYK (4D10) mAb, anti-c-Cbl (C-15), and anti-pp125FAK (A-17) polyclonal antibodies and Grb2-(54–164)-AC were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-FcγRII (IV.3) mAb was from Medarex Inc. (Annandale, NJ); AP-1 anti-GPIb mAb was a kind gift from Dr. T. J. Kunicki; SZ-2 anti-GPIb mAb was a kind gift from Dr. C. Ruan; Ib-23 anti-GPIb mAb and Ro44–9883, a GPIIb-IIIa inhibitor, were kind gifts from Dr. B. Steiner; PTA-1 mAb was a kind gift from Prof. G. Burns; human anti-GPVI polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Prof. M. Okuma; anti-GP60 (a putative laminin receptor) mAb was a kind gift from Dr. S. Sentoso; mAb 6F1 against α2β1 was a kind gift from Prof. B. Coller; polyclonal antibody against FcεRIγ was a kind gift from Prof. J.-P. Kinet. Echicetin was purified from lyophilized Echis carinatus sochureki venom (Latoxan, Rosans, France) as described previously (34Peng M. Lu W. Beviglia L. Niewiarowski S. Kirby E.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 2128-2321Google Scholar). PVDF membranes were PolyScreen from DuPont NEN. Octyl-N-methylglucamide was from Oxyl Chemie (Bobingen, Germany). Lyophilized C. durissus terrificus venom was dissolved at 250 mg/8 ml in 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.5 (buffer A). Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded on a Fractogel EMD BioSEC 650 (S) column (16 × 1200 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A. At 0.5 ml/min flow rate, 5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/silver staining under nonreducing and reducing conditions and assayed for their ability to induce platelet aggregation. The pH of 100-μl aliquots was adjusted to 7.4 by adding 10 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.5, before the aggregation studies. Fractions that induced platelet aggregation and showed strong 85-kDa (nonreduced) and 14- and 16-kDa (reduced) bands on analysis by SDS-PAGE/silver staining were pooled (15 ml), dialyzed against diluted HCl, pH 3.5, dissolved in 3 ml of buffer A, and rechromatographed under the same conditions as above. Fractions corresponding to the main peak, high purity convulxin, were concentrated to about 20% of their original volume on a Speed-Vac. If a sample became opalescent during this step, a small volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to redissolve the protein. After dialysis against first, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmphosphate, pH 5.0, second, the same buffer at pH 6.5, and finally, the same buffer or 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, the convulxin was stored at 4 °C until used. To 1 volume of 300 μg/ml convulxin in 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0, was added to 1/20 volume 440 mmDTT followed by incubation at 45 °C for 30 min. 1/20 volume of 1m 4-vinylpyridine was added, and after 1 h incubation at room temperature the sample was diluted with 2 volumes of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. Modified convulxin subunits were isolated by reverse phase HPLC on a wide pore C4 column (4.6 × 250 mm; J. T. Baker Inc.) using an acetonitrile gradient (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). N-terminal sequencing of S-pyridylethylated α and β subunits of convulxin was performed on an Applied Biosystem model 477 A pulsed-liquid-phase protein sequencer with model 120 A on-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer. Partially reduced/denatured convulxin was prepared in the same way as S-pyridylethylated α and β subunits of convulxin, omitting 4-vinylpyridine so that the free ⎻SH groups were not chemically modified in these samples. The protein was isolated, free from denaturing and reducing agents, by reverse phase HPLC, freeze-dried, and dissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. This treatment resulted in three main fractions corresponding to the two subunits and a fraction that contained both subunits. The ratio of these three fractions varied between preparations. Convulxin was labeled by the IODO-GEN procedure (35Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Google Scholar). Convulxin, 80 μg, and 800 μCi of Na125I were added to a glass tube that had been coated with 150 μg of IODO-GEN. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The reaction was stopped by adding 30 mg/ml (final) KI and labeled convulxin was separated from free Na125I on a Bio Gel P-6 DG column (0.9 × 16 cm, Bio-Rad) using 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. The specific activity of labeled convulxin was between 0.5 and 1.2 × 109 cpm/mg. Computer analysis of the sequence data was performed on a VAX/VMS system using the suite of programs from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group. Protein determination was performed by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and the gels were silver-stained by the method of Morrissey (37Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Google Scholar). Human platelets were isolated from buffy coats, less than 20 h after blood collection, obtained from the Central Laboratory of the Swiss Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. To one buffy coat was added 30 ml of 100 mm citrate, pH 6.5. Platelet-rich plasma and the platelet pellet was isolated by successive centrifugation steps. Platelets were resuspended in 113 mmNaCl, 4.3 mm K2HPO4, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 24.4 mmNaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 6.5 (buffer B) and centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min. The platelet-rich supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 10 min, and platelets were washed with buffer B once more. Washed platelets were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (buffer C), and the platelet count was adjusted to 5 × 108 platelets/ml by dilution with buffer C. Samples were kept at room temperature until used for aggregation studies. Platelet aggregation was monitored by light transmission in an aggregometer (Lumitec, France) with continuous stirring at 1100 rpm at 37 °C. Platelets were preincubated in buffer containing 2 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C for 2 min before starting the measurement by adding the samples for analysis. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots (700 μl, 5 × 108 platelets/ml) of control, resting as well as activated platelets were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.2% Triton X-100 with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 2 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. After centrifugation, platelet lysates, precleared with Protein A-Sepharose, were stirred for 2 h with specific antibodies before adding 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose followed by 6–8 h incubation. Human platelets were isolated from 10 buffy coats as described previously (38Wicki A.N. Clemetson J.M. Steiner B. Schnippering W. Clemetson K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 276-288Google Scholar). The platelet count was adjusted to 1 × 109 platelets/ml with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 154 mm NaCl (TENA buffer), and Triton X-114 phase separation was performed as described previously (39Clemetson K.J. Bienz D. Zahno M.-L. Lüscher E.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 463-469Google Scholar). The Triton phase was diluted 10 times with 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 2 mm NEM, 4 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 (buffer D), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a column of WGA-Sepharose 4B (2.6 × 15 cm, 1 mg of WGA/ml of Sepharose 4B) equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed intensively with buffer D containing 0.1% octyl-N-methylglucamide. The bound material was eluted with 2.5% N-acetylglucosamine in buffer D containing 0.5% octyl-N-methylglucamide. Fractions containing glycoproteins were pooled, concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against water, and freeze-dried. The sample was dissolved in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm NEM, 4 mm EDTA. 750-μl aliquots of this preparation were used for immunoprecipitations. Aliquots (750 μl) of platelet glycoprotein samples (see above) were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with 5 μl of anti-PTA1, anti-p62/GPVI, and anti-GP60 antibodies followed by incubation with 5 mg of Protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. The Protein A-Sepharose samples were washed four times by centrifugation in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 2 mm NEM, and 4 mm EDTA. The samples were boiled in 40 μl of 2% SDS, 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min and centrifuged, and the supernatants were electrophoresed on a 7–17% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membrane, and convulxin-binding proteins were detected using 125I-labeled convulxin. The membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml labeled convulxin in 2% bovine serum albumin, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, for 3 h followed by washing 7 times with the same buffer for 30 min. The membranes were rinsed with water, dried, and radioactive labeling detected by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Convulxin was purified from lyophilized C. durissus terrificus venom by a two-step gel filtration method (Fig. 1). The final product showed an 85-kDa broad band under nonreducing conditions and two bands, 14 and 16-kDa, under reducing conditions when analyzed by SDS-PAGE/silver staining (see inset in Fig. 1 B). Treatment with DTT alone under nondenaturing conditions was not sufficient to separate the subunits by reverse phase HPLC. However,S-pyridylethylation allowed a separation of the subunits by reverse phase HPLC. Fractionation of reducedS-pyridylethylated convulxin subunits is shown in Fig.2. Peaks in the 3–10-min interval represent non-protein peaks originated from the reagents used for reduction andS-pyridylethylation. Fractions 1 and 2 contained homogenous single chain proteins with apparent Mr of 16 and 14, respectively, on analysis by SDS-PAGE/silver staining (seeinset of Fig. 2). Following the nomenclature of Marlas (7Marlas G. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1985; 67: 1231-1239Google Scholar), we called the 14-kDa protein (fraction 2) the α subunit and the 16-kDa protein (fraction 1) the β subunit. N-terminal sequence analysis gave the 20 amino acid sequence GFCCPSHWSXYDRYCYKVFK for the α subunit and GLHCPSDWYYYDQHCYRIFN for the β subunit. Computer analysis of the sequences showed that convulxin is a heterodimeric C-type lectin with strong sequence similarity to other venom C-type lectins (Fig.3).Figure 2Fractionation of reduced andS-pyridylethylated convulxin on reverse phase HPLC column. 1, convulxin α subunit; 2, convulxin β subunit; 3, probably a differently glycosylated form of the convulxin β subunit (not sequenced).

Venom C-type lectins that act on platelets through GPIb are grouped separately in this sequence comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Convulxin is a powerful platelet agonist and, at concentrations as low as 3–10 ng/ml, induced maximal aggregation of isolated human platelets (data not shown). The strong sequence similarity to C-type lectins that bind to GPIb suggested that GPIb might be involved in platelet activation induced by convulxin. However, neither antibodies against GPIb (Ib-23, SZ-2, and AP-2) nor echicetin, a snake venom C-type lectin that binds to GPIb and inhibits platelet agonists acting through GPIb (34Peng M. Lu W. Beviglia L. Niewiarowski S. Kirby E.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 2128-2321Google Scholar), had any effect on convulxin-induced platelet aggregation (data not shown). In addition, partially reduced/denatured convulxin had no effect on ristocetin-vWf-induced platelet agglutination (see below). These data show that GPIb is not involved in convulxin-induced platelet activation. A mAb against α2β1 (6F1), which inhibits collagen-induced platelet activation, had little effect on convulxin-induced platelet aggregation (data not shown). Neither of the reduced,S-pyridylethylated convulxin subunits activated platelets (data not shown), suggesting that the platelet activation effect of convulxin requires its native conformation rather than a linear sequence in its subunits. Neither incubation of convulxin with up to 50 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min nor freezing and thawing the convulxin sample in the presence of 50 mm DTT decreased the ability of convulxin to aggregate platelets. After reduction of convulxin under denaturing conditions, in the presence of 6m guanidine HCl, reverse phase HPLC gave three main peaks corresponding to the two subunits and a fraction that contained both subunits. The ratio of these peaks varied between preparations (n = 10, data not shown). None of these partially reduced/denatured convulxin subunits induced platelet aggregation or signal transduction. Seven out of ten preparations, containing either α, β, or both subunits, had no effect on platelet aggregation induced by various agonists. However, the others inhibited convulxin-induced aggregation as well as collagen-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas they had no effect on platelet aggregation induced by thrombin or ristocetin-vWf. These data show that convulxin and its two subunits bind to a common receptor that is involved in collagen activation of platelets. The fact that the N-terminal sequences of convulxin are rich in tyrosine suggested that it might be readily labeled by 125I without affecting its biological activity, and this proved to be the case. The platelet membrane protein binding 125I-labeled convulxin was identified. It is a 62-kDa hydrophobic, platelet membrane glycoprotein (Fig.4, lane 1) present in the Triton phase after Triton X-114 phase separation of platelet membrane proteins that binds to WGA (Fig. 4, lane 2). 125I-Labeled convulxin binds strongly only to the 62-kDa protein immunoprecipitated with anti-p62/GPVI antiserum (Fig. 4, lane 6) and not to other platelet membrane glycoproteins with similar molecular masses and physicochemical properties immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies (Fig. 4, lane 4, anti-PTA-1 mAb and lane 5, anti-GP60 laminin receptor mAb). This argues convincingly that the p62/GPVI collagen receptor is the binding site for convulxin on platelets. Fig. 5 shows a time range of tyrosine phosphorylation for platelets activated by 5 mg/ml collagen compared with that with 30 ng/ml convulxin. These relative amounts were chosen because they gave comparable rates of platelet aggregation as esti"
https://openalex.org/W2128154787,"Calyculin-A (CA), okadaic acid (OA), and tautomycin (TAU) are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) and are widely used on cells in culture. Despite their well characterized selectivity in vitro, their exact intracellular effects on PP1 and PP2A cannot be directly deduced from their extracellular concentration because their cell permeation properties are not known. Here we demonstrate that, due to the tight binding of the inhibitors to PP1 and/or PP2A, their cell penetration could be monitored by measuring PP1 and PP2A activities in cell-free extracts. Treatment of MCF7 cells with 10 nm CA for 2 h simultaneously inhibited PP1 and PP2A activities by more than 50%. A concentration of 1 μm OA was required to obtain a similar time course of PP2A inhibition in MCF7 cells to that observed with 10 nm CA, whereas PP1 activity was unaffected. PP1 was predominantly inhibited in MCF7 cells treated with TAU but even at 10 μm TAU PP1 inhibition was much slower than that observed with 10 nm CA. Furthermore, binding of inhibitors to PP2Ac and/or PP1c in MCF7 cells led to differential posttranslational modifications of the carboxyl termini of the proteins as demonstrated by Western blotting. OA and CA, in contrast to TAU, induced demethylation of the carboxyl-terminal Leu309 residue of PP2Ac. On the other hand, CA and TAU, in contrast to OA, elicited a marked decrease in immunoreactivity of the carboxyl terminus of the α-isoform of PP1c, probably reflecting proteolysis of the protein. These results suggest that in MCF7 cells OA selectively inhibits PP2A and TAU predominantly affects PP1, a conclusion supported by their differential effects on cytokeratins in this cell line.

The serine/threonine protein phosphatase family was initially restricted to four biochemically distinct entities, protein phosphatases-1 (PP1), 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, PP2A, PP2B and PP2C, protein phosphatase of type 1, 2A, 2B and 2C; PP1c and PP2Ac, catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A; Abα317/330, antibodies to residues 317–330 of the α-isoform of PP1c; Ab33k, antibodies to the 33-kDa proteolytic fragment of PP1c; Ab299/309, Ab169/182, antibodies to residues 169–182 and 299–309, respectively, of PP2Ac; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CA, calyculin-A; OA, okadaic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TAU, tautomycin. -2A (PP2A), -2B (also called calcineurin) (PP2B), a Ca2+-dependent enzyme, and -2C (PP2C), a Mg2+-dependent enzyme (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar). This class of enzymes has now been considerably extended by molecular approaches (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar,2Cohen P.T.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 884-888Google Scholar). Nevertheless, among its numerous members, PP1 and PP2A can still be considered as the two principal enzymes because of their ubiquitous abundance and broad specificity (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar). PP1 consists of a catalytic subunit (PP1c) associated with various regulatory subunits, forming numerous oligomeric enzymes (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar, 3Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Google Scholar). For instance, in muscles PP1c interacts with the G and M subunits that target it to glycogen and myosin, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar and4Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Google Scholar). PP1c is a monomeric protein of about 37 kDa. It has a compact, ellipsoidal structure containing in the amino-terminal domain a β-α-β-α-β metal-coordinating unit typical for metal-dependent hydrolases (5Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Google Scholar). Four isoforms, α, β (or δ), γ1, and γ2, encoded by three genes (γ1 and γ2 resulting from alternative splicing) (6Sasaki K. Shima H. Kitagawa Y. Irino S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 1272-1280Google Scholar) are differently expressed in mammalian tissues (7Takizawa N. Mizuno Y. Ito Y. Kikuchi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 411-415Google Scholar). Protein sequence variations among these isoforms are mainly confined to their carboxyl termini (6Sasaki K. Shima H. Kitagawa Y. Irino S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 1272-1280Google Scholar), which play a regulatory role in the catalytic activity, as demonstrated by proteolysis (8Martin B.L. Shriner C.L. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 6-10Google Scholar) and phosphorylation studies (9Dohadwala M. Silva E.F.D.E. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonarohall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6408-6412Google Scholar, 10Yamano H. Ishii K. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5310-5318Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (cdk) phosphorylate a TPPR consensus sequence present in the carboxyl terminus of all PP1c isotypes and inhibit their activity (9Dohadwala M. Silva E.F.D.E. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonarohall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6408-6412Google Scholar,10Yamano H. Ishii K. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5310-5318Google Scholar). PP1c is also specifically inhibited by small acidic thermostable proteins, such as inhibitor-1, inhibitor-2, NIPPs (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar), and IP (11Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Google Scholar). In contrast to PP1c, the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) is always associated with a constant regulatory subunit of 65 kDa (PR65 or A subunit). To this dimeric core, various third or variable regulatory subunits can bind and modulate the enzymatic activity of PP2Ac (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar,12McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Google Scholar, 13Tanabe O. Nagase T. Murakami T. Nozaki H. Usui H. Nishito Y.

Merlevede W. Goris J. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 187-194Google Scholar). PP2A has long been considered as a predominantly cytosolic enzyme, in contrast to PP1 which is distributed among most cellular compartments (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar). However, recent studies have questioned this dogma by demonstrating the presence of PP2Ac in fibroblast nuclei (17Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J.C. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Google Scholar) and its association with microtubules (18Sontag E. Nunbhakdicraig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Google Scholar) and neurofilaments (19Saito T. Shima H. Osawa Y. Nagao M. Hemmings B.A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7376-7384Google Scholar). PP2Ac is a 35.6-kDa protein. Two highly homologous isoforms, α and β, encoded by two genes, are expressed in mammals (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar). Except for their extremities PP2Ac and PP1c are 67% homologous and most of the amino acids crucial for the 3-dimensional structure of PP1c are conserved in PP2Ac (5Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of PP2Ac also plays a regulatory role in the enzymatic activity. PP2Ac is phosphorylated by receptor and Src family tyrosine kinases on Tyr307, two residues upstream of its carboxyl terminus (Leu309), which suppresses its activity (20Chen J. Parsons S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7957-7962Google Scholar). In vitro PP2Ac can also be inhibited by phosphorylation on Thr residue(s) catalyzed by the autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase (21Guo H. Damuni Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2500-2504Google Scholar). Moreover, PP2Ac is methylated on Leu309 by a novel type of carboxyl protein methyltransferase (22Lee J. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19192-19195Google Scholar, 23Xie H. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1981-1984Google Scholar, 24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Demethylation is catalyzed by a specific protein carboxylmethylesterase (26Lee J. Chen Y. Tolstykh T. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6043-6047Google Scholar). Interestingly, PP2Ac methylation is regulated during the cell cycle (17Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J.C. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Google Scholar). Potent protein inhibitors of PP2A, different from those of PP1c, have been recently identified (27Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Google Scholar, 28Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Kohara H. Hashimoto E. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 1004-1013Google Scholar). The identification of serine/threonine protein phosphatases as the target of okadaic acid (OA), a polyketal fatty acid, provided novel insights into their essential functions (30Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Google Scholar). OA is a potent tumor promoter (31Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 143-194Google Scholar) that binds to and inhibits PP1c and PP2Ac with dissociation constants (Ki) of 147 and 0.032 nm, respectively (32Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Google Scholar). Other polycarbon inhibitors of serine/threonine protein phosphatases include calyculin-A (CA) and tautomycin (TAU) (31Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 143-194Google Scholar). CA has a higher affinity for PP2A than PP1,Ki ≈0.12 and 1 nm, respectively, whereas TAU has the opposite preference, Ki ≈30 and 0.5 nm, respectively (32Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Google Scholar). OA, CA, and TAU appear to bind to the same site on PP1c or PP2Ac (32Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Google Scholar). The two other major protein Ser/Thr phosphatases, PP2B and PP2C, are either weakly sensitive (in the μm range) or completely insensitive, respectively, to these inhibitors. Other classes of Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors have been identified (31Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 143-194Google Scholar, 33Li Y.M. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CA and OA are often used to demonstrate the involvement of PP1 or PP2A in a biological process. These conclusions are usually based on thein vitro selectivity of CA and OA and extracellular concentration of the inhibitors required to observe an effect on cells. However, such conclusions can be biased by differential cell penetration rates of CA and OA. Here we show that CA, OA, and TAU have very distinct cell permeation properties and induce specific posttranslational modifications of PP1c and/or PP2Ac in accordance to their in vitro selectivity, suggesting that the systematic use of these three inhibitors should facilitate the assignment of the cellular functions of PP1 and PP2A. MCF7 cells were cultured as described previously (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar). Where stated, the medium from a 6-cm dish containing approximately 80% confluent cells (time “0”) was replaced by 5 ml of fresh medium supplemented with protein phosphatase inhibitor or the same volume of solvent,N,N-dimethylformamide for OA (Diagnostic Chemicals Limited) and CA (LC Services Corp.), and dimethyl sulfoxide for TAU (Drs. Kiyoshi Isono and Hiroyuki Nagata, RIKEN, Japan). Protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide and puromycin (Sigma), were added similarly. For 32P labeling MCF7 cells growing on a 6-cm dish were incubated with 5 ml of medium containing 37 MBq of32Pi (Amersham Corp.). After 4 h an appropriate volume of protein phosphatase inhibitor or solvent was added to the medium, and cells were further incubated for 2 h before being collected. All experiments were performed at least twice. Cells were collected, frozen, and homogenized as described previously (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration in the supernatant, henceforth termed the soluble fraction, was determined with the Bradford's reagent from Bio-Rad, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. The pellet obtained from the 10,000 × g centrifugation (henceforth termed the particulate fraction) was washed with 1.5 ml of extraction buffer and dissolved in SDS sample buffer containing 4% (w/v) SDS (150 μl per 6-cm dish). To prepare whole cell extracts, frozen cells were directly lysed in SDS sample buffer containing 4% (w/v) SDS (300 μl per 6-cm dish). Soluble fractions from MCF7 cells were mixed with 4 volumes of absolute ethanol, left on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. Supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol. After 15 min on ice with mixing, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration in the supernatants was measured, and both protein amount and volume were equalized between different samples (the variation of protein concentration between the samples did not exceed 15%) before the next round of ethanol precipitation/solubilization. An aliquot of the protein fraction obtained after each ethanol precipitation and solubilization was used for phosphatase activity determination, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and Western blotting. For PP2A and PP1 assays, the soluble fraction was diluted to a concentration of 120 and 50 μg/ml, respectively, in extraction buffer (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar) containing 1% BSA. PP2A activity was measured, using a heptapeptide substrate (LRRASVA, also termed Kemptide Val6-Ala7) (Bachem), phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A in a final volume of 30 μl containing 60 μm phosphopeptide, 0.4 μg of MCF7 soluble protein, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 30 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.7 mg/ml BSA, and where stated, the appropriate concentration of CA, OA, or TAU (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar). Phosphorylase aphosphatase activity was assayed according to Ref. 38Cohen P. Alemany S.

Foulkes J.G. Holmes C.F.B. Nimmo G.A. Tonks N.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 427-437Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and processed as described (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar, 38Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Stralfors P. Tung H.Y.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Google Scholar). Both phosphatase assays were in the linear range of activities (less than 20% substrate dephosphorylation) and 1 unit corresponds to the release of 1 nmol of phosphate per min at 30 °C. Each determination was performed in duplicate. Protein samples were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred onto Immobilon-P (polyvinylidine difluoride membrane, Millipore). When required, the soluble fraction was concentrated by precipitating 50 μg of protein with 10% (w/v, final) trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer and the pH adjusted to 6.8. The amount of proteins contained in the particulate fraction or whole extracts from cells incubated for various times was normalized to that from cells collected at time 0 by scanning Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Blots were incubated with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the internal peptide Ab169/182 or the carboxyl terminus Ab299/309 of PP2Ac (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar), or the carboxyl terminus of α-PP1 (Abα317/330) (40Olivier A.R. Thomas G. J. Biol.

Shriner C.L. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 6-10Google Scholar), as described previously (17Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J.C. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Google Scholar, 24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against cytokeratins 8 (clone M20) and 18 (clone CY-90) or pan cytokeratin (mixture of clones) (all purchased from Sigma) were diluted 1,000-, 2,000-, and 8,000-fold, respectively, in skimmed milk blocking buffer (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies used were donkey125I-anti-rabbit immunoglobulins-G (Amersham Corp.), rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep immunoglobulins-G (Kirkegaard & Perry, Laboratories) or sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins-G antibodies (Amersham Corp.). Membranes decorated with 125I-secondary antibodies were exposed to preflashed X-OMAT AR films (Kodak) and those with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies developed with enhanced chemiluminescent reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). Where indicated, the same membrane was incubated with a different antibody after having been stripped according to the enhanced chemiluminescent protocol (Amersham Corp.). Quantitative estimation of Western blots was done by scanning preflashed x-ray films exposed in the linear range at 600 nm with a Shimadzu CS-930 scanner. Radiolabeled cells were washed consecutively with phosphate-buffered saline and TBS and directly lysed in TBS containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS (0.4 ml/6 cm dish). Immunoprecipitations were performed exactly as described (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar) with either anti-cytokeratin 8 (50 μg/ml) or anti-cytokeratin 18 (40 μg/ml) monoclonal antibodies purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Northern blot analysis was performed according to Ref. 41Khew-Goodall Y. Hemmings B.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 265-268Google Scholar with total RNA isolated from untreated MCF7 cells (at time 0 or 24 h) or cells treated with 100 nm OA or 10 nm CA, every 6 h until 24 h. The probes used were human PP2Ac or α-PP1c cDNA and, as controls, oligonucleotides complementary to the human β-actin gene (nucleotides 4–30 of the coding region, accession number X00351) and α-tubulin gene (nucleotide 1049–1076 of the coding region, accession numberK00558) (41Khew-Goodall Y. Hemmings B.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 265-268Google Scholar). Since we were interested in the selectivity of CA, OA, and TAU in MCF7 cells, we first analyzed their apparent affinity for PP1 and PP2A in cell extracts. To assay PP2A activity we used a synthetic phosphorylated heptapeptide whose sequence, LRRASVA, corresponds to the protein kinase A phosphorylation site in pyruvate kinase. About 85% of the total soluble phosphopeptide phosphatase activity from MCF7 cell extracts (specific activity without inhibitor: 1.77 ± 0.08 units/mg protein, ± S.E., n = 36) was inhibited by 5 nm OA (Fig. 1 A). The 15% phosphopeptide phosphatase activity insensitive to 5 nm OA was not suppressed by higher concentrations of OA (up to 1 μm), indicating that this activity could not be attributed to PP1. CA exhibited inhibitory properties similar to OA. In contrast, TAU was approximately 10-fold less potent than OA and CA (Fig. 1 A). Henceforth PP2A activity is defined as the phosphopeptide phosphatase activity inhibited by 10 nmOA. Both PP1 and PP2A are active toward phosphorylase a and account for 100% of the cellular activity (42Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Google Scholar). Total phosphorylasea phosphatase activity in the soluble fraction of MCF7 cells (1.57 ± 0.18 units/mg protein, ± S.E., n = 21) was very sensitive to CA, as expected from the similar high affinity of CA for both PP1 and PP2A (32Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). With OA an intermediate plateau of inhibition at about 1 nm was observed, PP2A activity corresponding to the phosphatase activity most sensitive to OA (≤1 nm), 0.54 ± 0.06 units/mg protein (± S.E., n = 21) (32Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Google Scholar), and PP1 activity to the least OA-sensitive (≥1 nm OA), 1.03 ± 0.12 units/mg protein (± S.E., n = 21). When an increasing amount of inhibitor-2 was added, which specifically affects PP1 (1Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Google Scholar, 39Cohen P. Foulkes J.G. Holmes C.F.B. Nimmo G.A. Tonks N.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 427-437Google Scholar), the inhibition reached a plateau, corresponding to a suppressed PP1 activity of 0.85 ± 0.07 units/mg protein (± S.E.,n = 21) (not shown). The exact reason for the difference consistently observed between OA and inhibitor-2 (around 0.2 units/mg protein, see above) is unclear (longer preincubation times with inhibitor-2 did not alter the results) but might be related to the presence of PP1-like activities relatively insensitive to inhibitor-2, as described previously in other systems (43Honkanen R.E. Zwiller J. Daily S.L. Khatra B.S. Dukelow M. Boynton A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6614-6619Google Scholar, 44Tulloch A.G. Pato M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20168-20174Google Scholar, 45Gong M.C. Cohen P. Kitazawa T. Ikebe M. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14662-14668Google Scholar). PP1 activity is defined in all further experiments as the phosphorylase aphosphatase activity that was inhibited by a saturating concentration of inhibitor-2. TAU inhibited phosphorylase a phosphatase activity with a potency slightly weaker than that of CA. Addition of 1 nm OA to 1 nm TAU almost completely suppressed the activity (92% in comparison with 66% inhibition observed in the presence of TAU alone). In contrast, inhibitor-2 negligibly increased caused (4%) the inhibition promoted by 1 nm TAU, demonstrating that the activity more sensitive to TAU was catalyzed by PP1 (32Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Google Scholar). In our experimental conditions to assay PP2A activity from MCF7 cells a concentration of 3 nm OA was required to completely inhibit PP2A activity (Fig. 1 A). This value is much higher than the dissociation constant of OA for PP2Ac (Ki 40 pm) (32Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Google Scholar). Consequently, upon MCF7 cell treatment with OA, the inhibitor bound to PP2Ac should not dissociate during the preparation of MCF7 cell extracts, since the concentration of PP2Ac is always higher than its Kifor OA. Incubation of cells with OA indeed induced a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of PP2A (Fig.2 A). The possibility that OA altered the level of PP2Ac in MCF7 cells was investigated by Western blot analysis of the soluble and particulate fractions with Ab169/182. With these antibodies (as well as with Ab299/309) no signal could be detected in the particulate fraction from untreated or OA-treated cells (see Ref.17Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J.C. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Google Scholar for factors affecting the distribution of PP2A in cell-free extracts), whereas in the soluble fraction from cells treated with 100 nm OA for 24 h the immunoreactivity of PP2Ac was 1.7-fold ± 0.15 (± S.E., n = 7) higher than that from untreated cells (Fig. 2 B). This OA-induced increase was due to an up-regulation of the protein since it could be almost prevented by cotreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 2 C, upper panel) or puromycin (data not shown). The precise mechanism underlying this modest increased expression of PP2Ac upon treatment of MCF7 cells with OA is unknown. Northern blot analysis did not reveal any significant effect of OA treatment on the level of mRNA transcripts encoding PP2Ac (see “Experimental Procedures,” data not shown). PP2Ac is reversibly methylated on its carboxyl terminus Leu309 residue (22Lee J. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19192-19195Google Scholar, 23Xie H. Clarke S. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 6043-6047Google Scholar) and phosphorylated on Tyr307 (20Chen J. Parsons S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7957-7962Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that carboxyl methylation of PP2Ac negatively affects the affinity of Ab299/309 for the protein (17Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J.C. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Google Scholar, 24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar). It is probable that tyrosine phosphorylation has similar consequences. Upon cell treatment with 100 nm OA, the immunoreactivity of the carboxyl terminus of PP2Ac progressively increased with prolonged incubation time to reach 420% ± 115 (± S.E., n = 14) in comparison with that of untreated cells (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to what was previously observed with Ab169/182, cycloheximide (or puromycin) did not affect the large OA-induced increase of the carboxyl terminus immunoreactivity (Fig. 2 C, lower panel). Since PP2Ac is predominantly carboxyl-methylated and dephosphorylated in asynchronously growing MCF7 cells (24Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Google Scholar), results obtained with Ab299/309 indicate that the degree of methylation of PP2Ac was lower in OA-treated cells than in untreated cells. Similar demethylation of PP2Ac in response to OA treatment was observed in COS-1 and BHK-21 cells"
https://openalex.org/W2064337685,"Mutations in Aurora of Drosophila and related Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ipl1 kinase are known to cause abnormal chromosome segregation. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel human protein kinase of 402 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45.9 kDa, which shares high amino acid identities with the Aurora/Ipl1 protein kinase family; hence the cDNA is designated as aik(aurora/IPL1-related kinase). Amino acid sequence of C-terminal kinase domain of Aik shares 86, 86, 72, 59, and 49% identity with those of Xenopus XLP46APK and XLP46BPK, mouse STK-1, Aurora of Drosophila, and yeast Ipl1, respectively, whereas N-terminal domain of Aik shares high homology only with those of XLP46APK and XLP46BPK. Northern and Western blotting analyses revealed that Aik is expressed highly in testis and various proliferating cells including HeLa cells. In HeLa cells, the endogenous levels of aik mRNA and protein contents are tightly regulated during cell cycle progression. Both of these levels are low in G1/S, accumulate during G2/M, and reduce rapidly after mitosis. Its protein kinase activity is also enhanced at mitosis as inferred by exogenous casein phosphorylation. Immunofluorescence studies using a specific antibody have shown that Aik is localized to the spindle pole during mitosis, especially from prophase through anaphase. These results strongly suggest that Aik is a novel member of a protein kinase family possibly involved in a centrosome function(s) such as chromosome segregation or spindle formation.

Immunofluorescence studies using a specific antibody have shown that Aik is localized to the spindle pole during mitosis, especially from prophase through anaphase. These results strongly suggest that Aik is a novel member of a protein kinase family possibly involved in a centrosome function(s) such as chromosome segregation or spindle formation. Accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is an important event in the progression of cell cycle. Chromosome segregation is a highly complex process requiring microtubule assembly and disassembly. Centrosome and pericentriolar materials play important roles in organizing the microtubules at interphase and mitotic phase. At the G1 phase of cell cycle, duplicated centrioles closely associate and function as a single unit, and then separate into two units at mitotic phase. Centrosome separation is initiated either before or after nuclear envelope breakdown, and then microtubules are arranged and the separated centrosome organizes a mitotic spindle. In accordance with chromosome movement toward the spindle pole, the spindle microtubules shorten. However, details of molecular mechanisms by which centrosomal cycle or microtubule nucleation is regulated have not been elucidated.Multiple lines of evidence suggest that protein phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in controlling spindle assembly and its functioning. Several centrosomal components are known to be phosphorylated inDrosophila (1Kellogg D.R. Oegema K. Raff J. Schneider K. Alberts B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1673-1684Google Scholar) and vertebrates (2Vandre D.D. Davis F.M. Rao P.N. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4439-4443Google Scholar, 3Centonze V.E. Borisy G.G. J.

Phosphorylation of centrosomal proteins has been shown to control both the rate of the microtubule nucleation and its dynamic behavior (7Buendia B. Draetta G. Karsenti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1431-1442Google Scholar). The reversible phosphorylation may control the function of microtubule-based motor proteins such as a kinesin-like protein (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar). Several genetic studies on fungi and fruit flies have identified various protein kinases and phosphatases that play intriguing roles in chromosome segregation (9Axton J.M. Dombradi V. Cohen P.T.

Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, centrosomal localization of several protein kinases has been reported on Cdc2 (12Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3985-3995Google Scholar), Plk1 (13Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Google Scholar), Fyn (14Ley S.C. Marsh M. Bebbington C.R. Proudfoot K.

Eppenberger H.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 1039-1051Google Scholar).Among the protein kinases that have been implicated in the control of spindle function, the role of Cdc2/cyclin B complex is pivotal and has been well characterized (17Gallant P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 213-224Google Scholar). This kinase is activated during mitosis and inactivated immediately afterward. The Cdc2 kinase partly localized in the mitotic spindle is known to regulate the dynamics and length of microtubules (12Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3985-3995Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of mutant cyclin B2 in HeLa cells causes cell division arrest with multiple mitotic spindle poles (17Gallant P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 213-224Google Scholar). In a recent study, a kinesin-like motor protein was identified as a substrate for Cdc2 kinase, which regulates the centrosomal localization (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar).Other kinases that control mitotic spindle formation have also been identified: budding yeast CDC5 (18Kitada K. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4445-4457Google Scholar), fission yeast Plo1 (19Ohkura H. Hagan I.M. Glover D.M.

Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Google Scholar). The plo1 andpolo mutants show abnormal formation of monopolar spindle or unequally separated bipolar spindle in which one pole is unusually broad. Plk1 kinase is induced and activated at G2 phase and disappears at the end of mitosis. The subcellular localization of the Plk1 protein is in both centrosome and mitotic spindle at M phase. Plk1 is phosphorylated and activated by Cdc2 kinase (28Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Google Scholar). One of the substrates of Plk1 was identified as CHO1/MKLP-1 kinesin-like protein, and it was suggested that Plk1 is a regulator of the motor protein (26Lee K.S. Yuan Y.L. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7143-7151Google Scholar).Ipl1 (29Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Google Scholar) and Aurora (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar) gene products have conserved serine/threonine kinase domains, which are highly homologous to each other, and are suggested to be profoundly involved in normal chromosome segregation. Embryos derived from aurora mothers inappropriately display closely paired centrosomes at mitotic stages. Loss of function ofaurora leads to a failure of the centrosomes to separate and form a bipolar spindle (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar). Conditional ipl1 tsmutants severely missegregate chromosomes at restrictive temperature (10Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Google Scholar). The substrate and the regulator of these kinases have not been identified, but type 1 protein phosphatase was shown to act in opposition to Ipl1 protein kinase in yeast (29Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Google Scholar). Other members of Aurora/Ipl1 family kinases have been isolated from Xenopus(XLP46APK, XLP46BPK) or mouse (30Niwa H. Abe K. Kunisada T. Yamamura K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 169: 197-201Google Scholar), but the functions of these proteins have not been well studied.We have cloned a cDNA encoding a human novel serine/threonine kinase, Aik, which has a high homology with Aurora/Ipl1 family protein kinases. Accumulation and activation at M phase as well as spindle pole localization of Aik kinase suggest a possible role of the protein in centrosome function.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel human gene encoding a serine/threonine kinase designated as aik. The deduced Aik amino acid sequence contains all of the amino acids conserved in serine/threonine kinases and is most closely related to members of the Aurora/Ipl1 family protein kinases, which are known to be required for normal chromosome segregation in Drosophila (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar) and yeast (29Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutants of IPL1 cause chromosome number alteration (10Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutants ofaurora form monopolar spindle and cannot segregate the chromosomes (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar). The conservation of amino acid sequences through entire sequences between Aik and two kinases in Xenopussuggests that closely related kinases to Aik must exist in vertebrates. The sequence homology strongly suggests that Aik is a member of the Aurora/Ipl1 family protein kinases conserved from yeast to human and that it might play a role in chromosome segregation as do Aurora and Ipl1.The tissue distribution of aik examined by Northern blotting showed that expression was very high in testis (Fig. 3) and weak bands were detected in skeletal muscle, thymus, and spleen. Expression of Aik at protein levels was examined in some cell lines by Western blotting analysis. All of the proliferating cells examined expressed Aik protein with HeLa cells showing the highest level (Fig. 4). A computer search of protein sequence data base (GenBank™) revealed the existence of Aik transcripts in several infant tissues such as brain (accession no.Z43879) or liver spleen (accession no. N64029). These results indicate the expression of Aik in some proliferating cells, suggesting its possible involvement in cell proliferation. The expression of mouse STK-1 is high in the proliferating tissues of testis, spleen, small intestine, and colon (30Niwa H. Abe K. Kunisada T. Yamamura K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 169: 197-201Google Scholar). The difference of the expression pattern between Aik and STK-1 may suggest some functional difference between them.Since the phenotypes of IPL1 and aurora mutants are abnormalities in chromosome segregation, it is conceivable that the homologous kinase Aik may also function at M phase. The present investigation provided evidence supporting this notion. Aik is predominantly expressed in a subset of proliferating tissues or cells. Cell cycle-dependent expression of Aik was observed in HeLa cells by Northern and Western blotting. The levels of both are low in G1/S but high in G2/M (Fig. 5). Since the reduction of Aik was observed after mitosis, a sequence similar to the destruction box was searched on a computer. Several destruction box-like sequences were found in the Aik kinase domain: RTTLCGTLDY, amino acids 285–294; RPMLREVLE, amino acids 370–378; and REVLEHPWI, amino acids 374–382. One or more of these sequences might function as a destruction box of Aik to be degraded after M phase.The kinase activity of Aik also peaked at M phase (Fig. 6). Since this activity appeared to be correlated with the protein levels, it is conceivable that it is at least partly regulated by the changes in protein content. These results suggest that Aik plays a role in cell cycle regulation at M phase in relation to the function of the centrosome/spindle pole region. As the N-terminal portion of Aik has little homology with Aurora, Ipl1, or STK-1, it might also be possible that the N-terminal region acts to regulate the kinase activity.Aik is localized to centrosome and spindle pole from prophase to anaphase (Fig. 7). This subcellular localization as well as the expression profile during cell cycle suggests that Aik has a role(s) in centrosome or spindle organization at M phase. Although the subcellular localization of Aurora and Ipl1 has not been well studied, the phenotypes of these mutants suggest that the localization of these proteins may also be at centrosome or spindle pole body and may be involved in spindle organization. Thus, the localization of Aik suggests that it may function in spindle formation like Aurora.Various centrosomally localized protein kinases have been identified in vertebrate cells, including Cdc2 (12Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3985-3995Google Scholar), Plk1 (13Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Google Scholar), Fyn (14Ley S.C. Marsh M. Bebbington C.R. Proudfoot K. Jordan P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 639-649Google Scholar), Src (15David-Pfeuty T. Bagrodia S. Shalloway D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 613-628Google Scholar), and A kinase (16Nigg E.A. Schafer G. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 1039-1051Google Scholar). Some of the kinases were suggested to function as regulators of microtubule organization and spindle formation. Ectopic expression of mutant cyclin B2 in HeLa cells causes cell division arrest with multiple mitotic spindle poles (17Gallant P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 213-224Google Scholar). In a recent study, one of the substrates of Cdc2 kinase was identified to be a kinesin-like motor protein and to regulate the centrosomal localization (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar). Plk1 is phosphorylated and activated by Cdc2 kinase (28Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Google Scholar). Aik was phosphorylated in M phase (data not shown), suggesting that the protein kinase cascade containing Aik may play a part in centrosomal function.Complementation experiments were performed to examine whether Aik is a functional homolog of Ipl1. Low copy number plasmid harboring Aik coding region was transformed to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ipl1 mutant, but Aik failed to complement the mutant phenotype (data not shown). Although the sequence homology and the subcellular localization of Aik suggested that these two kinases might have similar functions, this was not the case. It is conceivable that because of the difference in amino acid sequence between Aik and Ipl1, a substrate or a regulatory protein cannot interact with Aik in yeast cells. Some human homologs of yeast proteins are known to lack the possibility to complement the yeast mutants, so that we cannot exclude the possibility that Aik is not a functional human homolog of Ipl1. It remains to be elucidated whether Aik plays the same role as Ipl1 in human.Since Aik has protein kinase activity, the question arises what the physiological substrate(s) is for it. Several centrosomal components have been shown to be phosphorylated and to control the rate of microtubule dynamic behavior at the centrosome. Furthermore, phosphorylation regulates the function of a microtubule-based motor protein such as kinesin-like protein (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar). The substrate of Aik has not been identified, nor has that for Aurora or Ipl1. Our experiments showed a high molecular weight phosphorylated band in the in vitro kinase assay, suggesting that a putative Aik substrate was co-immunoprecipitated and phosphorylated with the enzyme. The candidate substrate protein was co-immunoprecipitated only when it was extracted from M phase-blocked cells (data not shown). The substrate of Aik kinase may be a protein that participates in centrosome function.We are now investigating the kinetics of Aik kinase and identifying substrates to elucidate the function of the protein. Accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is an important event in the progression of cell cycle. Chromosome segregation is a highly complex process requiring microtubule assembly and disassembly. Centrosome and pericentriolar materials play important roles in organizing the microtubules at interphase and mitotic phase. At the G1 phase of cell cycle, duplicated centrioles closely associate and function as a single unit, and then separate into two units at mitotic phase. Centrosome separation is initiated either before or after nuclear envelope breakdown, and then microtubules are arranged and the separated centrosome organizes a mitotic spindle. In accordance with chromosome movement toward the spindle pole, the spindle microtubules shorten. However, details of molecular mechanisms by which centrosomal cycle or microtubule nucleation is regulated have not been elucidated. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that protein phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in controlling spindle assembly and its functioning. Several centrosomal components are known to be phosphorylated inDrosophila (1Kellogg D.R. Oegema K. Raff J. Schneider K. Alberts B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1673-1684Google Scholar) and vertebrates (2Vandre D.D. Davis F.M. Rao P.N. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4439-4443Google Scholar, 3Centonze V.E. Borisy G.G. J.

Phosphorylation of centrosomal proteins has been shown to control both the rate of the microtubule nucleation and its dynamic behavior (7Buendia B. Draetta G. Karsenti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1431-1442Google Scholar). The reversible phosphorylation may control the function of microtubule-based motor proteins such as a kinesin-like protein (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar). Several genetic studies on fungi and fruit flies have identified various protein kinases and phosphatases that play intriguing roles in chromosome segregation (9Axton J.M. Dombradi V. Cohen P.T. Glover D.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Google Scholar, 10Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Google Scholar, 11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, centrosomal localization of several protein kinases has been reported on Cdc2 (12Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3985-3995Google Scholar), Plk1 (13Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Google Scholar), Fyn (14Ley S.C. Marsh M. Bebbington C.R. Proudfoot K.

Eppenberger H.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 1039-1051Google Scholar). Among the protein kinases that have been implicated in the control of spindle function, the role of Cdc2/cyclin B complex is pivotal and has been well characterized (17Gallant P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 213-224Google Scholar). This kinase is activated during mitosis and inactivated immediately afterward. The Cdc2 kinase partly localized in the mitotic spindle is known to regulate the dynamics and length of microtubules (12Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3985-3995Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of mutant cyclin B2 in HeLa cells causes cell division arrest with multiple mitotic spindle poles (17Gallant P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 213-224Google Scholar). In a recent study, a kinesin-like motor protein was identified as a substrate for Cdc2 kinase, which regulates the centrosomal localization (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar). Other kinases that control mitotic spindle formation have also been identified: budding yeast CDC5 (18Kitada K. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4445-4457Google Scholar), fission yeast Plo1 (19Ohkura H. Hagan I.M. Glover D.M.

Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Google Scholar). The plo1 andpolo mutants show abnormal formation of monopolar spindle or unequally separated bipolar spindle in which one pole is unusually broad. Plk1 kinase is induced and activated at G2 phase and disappears at the end of mitosis. The subcellular localization of the Plk1 protein is in both centrosome and mitotic spindle at M phase. Plk1 is phosphorylated and activated by Cdc2 kinase (28Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Google Scholar). One of the substrates of Plk1 was identified as CHO1/MKLP-1 kinesin-like protein, and it was suggested that Plk1 is a regulator of the motor protein (26Lee K.S. Yuan Y.L. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7143-7151Google Scholar). Ipl1 (29Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Google Scholar) and Aurora (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar) gene products have conserved serine/threonine kinase domains, which are highly homologous to each other, and are suggested to be profoundly involved in normal chromosome segregation. Embryos derived from aurora mothers inappropriately display closely paired centrosomes at mitotic stages. Loss of function ofaurora leads to a failure of the centrosomes to separate and form a bipolar spindle (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar). Conditional ipl1 tsmutants severely missegregate chromosomes at restrictive temperature (10Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Google Scholar). The substrate and the regulator of these kinases have not been identified, but type 1 protein phosphatase was shown to act in opposition to Ipl1 protein kinase in yeast (29Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Google Scholar). Other members of Aurora/Ipl1 family kinases have been isolated from Xenopus(XLP46APK, XLP46BPK) or mouse (30Niwa H. Abe K. Kunisada T. Yamamura K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 169: 197-201Google Scholar), but the functions of these proteins have not been well studied. We have cloned a cDNA encoding a human novel serine/threonine kinase, Aik, which has a high homology with Aurora/Ipl1 family protein kinases. Accumulation and activation at M phase as well as spindle pole localization of Aik kinase suggest a possible role of the protein in centrosome function. DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel human gene encoding a serine/threonine kinase designated as aik. The deduced Aik amino acid sequence contains all of the amino acids conserved in serine/threonine kinases and is most closely related to members of the Aurora/Ipl1 family protein kinases, which are known to be required for normal chromosome segregation in Drosophila (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar) and yeast (29Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutants of IPL1 cause chromosome number alteration (10Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutants ofaurora form monopolar spindle and cannot segregate the chromosomes (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar). The conservation of amino acid sequences through entire sequences between Aik and two kinases in Xenopussuggests that closely related kinases to Aik must exist in vertebrates. The sequence homology strongly suggests that Aik is a member of the Aurora/Ipl1 family protein kinases conserved from yeast to human and that it might play a role in chromosome segregation as do Aurora and Ipl1.The tissue distribution of aik examined by Northern blotting showed that expression was very high in testis (Fig. 3) and weak bands were detected in skeletal muscle, thymus, and spleen. Expression of Aik at protein levels was examined in some cell lines by Western blotting analysis. All of the proliferating cells examined expressed Aik protein with HeLa cells showing the highest level (Fig. 4). A computer search of protein sequence data base (GenBank™) revealed the existence of Aik transcripts in several infant tissues such as brain (accession no.Z43879) or liver spleen (accession no. N64029). These results indicate the expression of Aik in some proliferating cells, suggesting its possible involvement in cell proliferation. The expression of mouse STK-1 is high in the proliferating tissues of testis, spleen, small intestine, and colon (30Niwa H. Abe K. Kunisada T. Yamamura K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 169: 197-201Google Scholar). The difference of the expression pattern between Aik and STK-1 may suggest some functional difference between them.Since the phenotypes of IPL1 and aurora mutants are abnormalities in chromosome segregation, it is conceivable that the homologous kinase Aik may also function at M phase. The present investigation provided evidence supporting this notion. Aik is predominantly expressed in a subset of proliferating tissues or cells. Cell cycle-dependent expression of Aik was observed in HeLa cells by Northern and Western blotting. The levels of both are low in G1/S but high in G2/M (Fig. 5). Since the reduction of Aik was observed after mitosis, a sequence similar to the destruction box was searched on a computer. Several destruction box-like sequences were found in the Aik kinase domain: RTTLCGTLDY, amino acids 285–294; RPMLREVLE, amino acids 370–378; and REVLEHPWI, amino acids 374–382. One or more of these sequences might function as a destruction box of Aik to be degraded after M phase.The kinase activity of Aik also peaked at M phase (Fig. 6). Since this activity appeared to be correlated with the protein levels, it is conceivable that it is at least partly regulated by the changes in protein content. These results suggest that Aik plays a role in cell cycle regulation at M phase in relation to the function of the centrosome/spindle pole region. As the N-terminal portion of Aik has little homology with Aurora, Ipl1, or STK-1, it might also be possible that the N-terminal region acts to regulate the kinase activity.Aik is localized to centrosome and spindle pole from prophase to anaphase (Fig. 7). This subcellular localization as well as the expression profile during cell cycle suggests that Aik has a role(s) in centrosome or spindle organization at M phase. Although the subcellular localization of Aurora and Ipl1 has not been well studied, the phenotypes of these mutants suggest that the localization of these proteins may also be at centrosome or spindle pole body and may be involved in spindle organization. Thus, the localization of Aik suggests that it may function in spindle formation like Aurora.Various centrosomally localized protein kinases have been identified in vertebrate cells, including Cdc2 (12Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3985-3995Google Scholar), Plk1 (13Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Google Scholar), Fyn (14Ley S.C. Marsh M.

Some of the kinases were suggested to function as regulators of microtubule organization and spindle formation. Ectopic expression of mutant cyclin B2 in HeLa cells causes cell division arrest with multiple mitotic spindle poles (17Gallant P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 213-224Google Scholar). In a recent study, one of the substrates of Cdc2 kinase was identified to be a kinesin-like motor protein and to regulate the centrosomal localization (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar). Plk1 is phosphorylated and activated by Cdc2 kinase (28Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Google Scholar). Aik was phosphorylated in M phase (data not shown), suggesting that the protein kinase cascade containing Aik may play a part in centrosomal function.Complementation experiments were performed to examine whether Aik is a functional homolog of Ipl1. Low copy number plasmid harboring Aik coding region was transformed to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ipl1 mutant, but Aik failed to complement the mutant phenotype (data not shown). Although the sequence homology and the subcellular localization of Aik suggested that these two kinases might have similar functions, this was not the case. It is conceivable that because of the difference in amino acid sequence between Aik and Ipl1, a substrate or a regulatory protein cannot interact with Aik in yeast cells. Some human homologs of yeast proteins are known to lack the possibility to complement the yeast mutants, so that we cannot exclude the possibility that Aik is not a functional human homolog of Ipl1. It remains to be elucidated whether Aik plays the same role as Ipl1 in human.Since Aik has protein kinase activity, the question arises what the physiological substrate(s) is for it. Several centrosomal components have been shown to be phosphorylated and to control the rate of microtubule dynamic behavior at the centrosome. Furthermore, phosphorylation regulates the function of a microtubule-based motor protein such as kinesin-like protein (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar). The substrate of Aik has not been identified, nor has that for Aurora or Ipl1. Our experiments showed a high molecular weight phosphorylated band in the in vitro kinase assay, suggesting that a putative Aik substrate was co-immunoprecipitated and phosphorylated with the enzyme. The candidate substrate protein was co-immunoprecipitated only when it was extracted from M phase-blocked cells (data not shown). The substrate of Aik kinase may be a protein that participates in centrosome function.We are now investigating the kinetics of Aik kinase and identifying substrates to elucidate the function of the protein. We have identified a novel human gene encoding a serine/threonine kinase designated as aik.

Aik was phosphorylated in M phase (data not shown), suggesting that the protein kinase cascade containing Aik may play a part in centrosomal function. Complementation experiments were performed to examine whether Aik is a functional homolog of Ipl1. Low copy number plasmid harboring Aik coding region was transformed to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ipl1 mutant, but Aik failed to complement the mutant phenotype (data not shown). Although the sequence homology and the subcellular localization of Aik suggested that these two kinases might have similar functions, this was not the case. It is conceivable that because of the difference in amino acid sequence between Aik and Ipl1, a substrate or a regulatory protein cannot interact with Aik in yeast cells. Some human homologs of yeast proteins are known to lack the possibility to complement the yeast mutants, so that we cannot exclude the possibility that Aik is not a functional human homolog of Ipl1. It remains to be elucidated whether Aik plays the same role as Ipl1 in human. Since Aik has protein kinase activity, the question arises what the physiological substrate(s) is for it. Several centrosomal components have been shown to be phosphorylated and to control the rate of microtubule dynamic behavior at the centrosome. Furthermore, phosphorylation regulates the function of a microtubule-based motor protein such as kinesin-like protein (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P.M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Google Scholar). The substrate of Aik has not been identified, nor has that for Aurora or Ipl1. Our experiments showed a high molecular weight phosphorylated band in the in vitro kinase assay, suggesting that a putative Aik substrate was co-immunoprecipitated and phosphorylated with the enzyme. The candidate substrate protein was co-immunoprecipitated only when it was extracted from M phase-blocked cells (data not shown). The substrate of Aik kinase may be a protein that participates in centrosome function. We are now investigating the kinetics of Aik kinase and identifying substrates to elucidate the function of the protein. We are grateful to Dr. M.

https://openalex.org/W2111479061,"Fre1p and Fre2p are ferric reductases which account for the total plasma membrane associated activity, a prerequisite for iron uptake, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The two genes are transcriptionally induced by iron depletion. In this communication, we provide evidence that Fre2p has also cupric reductase activity, as has been previously shown for Fre1p (Hassett, R., and Kosman, D.J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 128–134). Both Fre1p and Fre2p enzymes are functionally significant for copper uptake, as monitored by the accumulation of the copper-regulatedCUP1 and CTR1 mRNAs in fre1Δ,fre2Δ, and fre1Δfre2Δ mutant strains. However, only Fre1p activity is induced by copper depletion, even in the presence of iron. This differential copper-dependent regulation of Fre1p and Fre2p is exerted at the transcriptional level of the two genes. We have shown that Mac1p, known to affect the basal levels of FRE1 gene expression (Jungmann, J., Reins, H.-A., Lee, J., Romeo, A., Hassett, R., Kosman, D., and Jentsch, S. (1993)EMBO J. 12, 5051–5056), accounts for both the copper-dependent induction of FRE1 and down-regulation of FRE2 gene. Finally, Mac1p transcriptional activation function is itself modulated by the availability of copper.

Finally, Mac1p transcriptional activation function is itself modulated by the availability of copper. Iron and copper are elements that have many similar chemical properties. Both are transition metals with several oxidation states, have close atomic and ionic radii numbers, and have very similar electronegativity. They are relatively homogeneously distributed on the planet and have thus been integrated in many biochemical reactions during evolution. Both are essential for life in almost every species (bacteria, fungi, plants, mammals) (1Theil, E., Raymond, N. K., Bioinorganic Chemistry, Bertini, I., Gray, H. B., Cippard, S. I., Valentine, J. S., 1994, University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA.Google Scholar, 2Crichton R.R. Charloteaux-Wauters M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 485-506Google Scholar). Excess quantities of iron and copper exert similar amount-dependent cytotoxicity, both favoring the formation of hydroxyl radicals which are disastrous to the cell (3Halliwell B. Cutteridge M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Google Scholar). Iron presents a particular problem for its uptake, since in the oxygen-containing atmosphere it is practically all in the form of insoluble ferric hydroxides. Organisms have therefore developed complex mechanisms of high fidelity and precision to achieve an appropriate homeostasis of these two metals. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two proteins of the plasma cell membrane, Fre1p and Fre2p, reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) in the proximal vicinity of the cell. The expression of both corresponding genes is regulated by the environmental iron concentration by a negative feedback mechanism which takes place at the transcriptional level (4Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Google Scholar,5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar). The coupled function of the cell surface Fet3p multicopper oxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of Fe(II) to Fe(III) extracellularly (6De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Google Scholar), and the recently reported Ftr1p permease (7Strearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Google Scholar) are also required for high affinity iron uptake. Thus, a link between iron and copper metabolism was first noted by the isolation of the FET3 gene in a scheme aiming to clone the ferrous transporter (8Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar). Fet3p requires copper to function, and therefore high affinity iron uptake requires copper (8Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar, 9Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar). Mutations either in the high affinity copper transporter gene CTR1 or in the CCC2 gene, encoding a member of the family of P-type ATPases proposed to transport cytosolic copper into the lumen of a secretory organelle, results in iron deficiency in the cell (9Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 10Yan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been postulated in mammals for the release of newly absorbed iron from intestine to blood involving the plasma glycoprotein ceruloplasmin, a copper-binding protein with ferrous oxidase activity (11Chang A. Fink G.R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 532-533Google Scholar, 12Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1996; 271: 1510-1512Google Scholar). Finally, the iron regulated transcription of the yeast genes FRE1,FRE2, FET3, CCC2, FTR1, andFTH1 (FTR1 homologue of unknown function) is affected by the Aft1p transcriptional activator which recognizes a specific consensus sequence on their promoters (13Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Google Scholar, 14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of FRE1 and CTR1 mRNAs depends on the nuclear protein Mac1p, which is involved in iron and copper utilization (15Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Google Scholar). 1E. Georgatsou, L. A. Mavrogiannis, G. S. Fragiadakis, and D. Alexandraki, unpublished observations. We have previously shown that although Fre1p and Fre2p have seemingly redundant functions in S. cerevisiae, the two genes are up-regulated by the absence of extracellular iron in a kinetically different way, implying that they are subject to distinct regulation (5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar). Since there is evidence that copper reduction might be a component of copper uptake (16Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Google Scholar) and that Fre1p is also a copper-repressible cupric reductase (15Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Google Scholar, 16Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Google Scholar, 17Lesuisse E. Labbe P. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 769-777Google Scholar), in this study we have investigated the participation of FRE1 and FRE2 gene products in copper metabolism. Our data clearly point to a role of both activities in copper uptake, although the two genes are differentially affected by the function of Mac1p under conditions of copper (and iron) depletion. Mac1p transactivating function is itself modulated by the availability of copper, being higher in its absence. The yeast strains used in this study are all derivatives of the S288C strain. The wild type and fre1Δ, fre2Δ, andfre1Δfre2Δ strains have been previously described (5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar). For the MAC1 gene disruption in the yeast genome, a 480-base pair StyI fragment (codons 41–201) was replaced by the 1.1-kilobase HindIII fragment of theURA3 gene on a MAC1 (−100 to 963)/pBluescript recombinant phagemid. The resulted insertion fragment was excised and used to transform the desired ura3–52 strains (18Guthrie C., and Fink, G. (eds) (1991) Methods in Enzymology Vol. 194, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Uracil prototrophy was used for the selection of transformants. Transformants able to grow on glycerol only in the presence of 50 μmcopper (15Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Google Scholar) were further confirmed for the MAC1 gene deletion by DNA blot hybridization. The yeast strain used for transcriptional induction and repression assays of the LexA-Mac1p fusion proteins to lacZ reporters was L9FT5, a derivative of FY105 (MATα,his3Δ::LexAopHIS3 leu2::PET56 ura3–52 trp1Δ63). The growth media used were SD (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base; Difco) or SD supplemented either with 100 μmbathophenanthroline disulfonic acid-Na2 salt (BPS) (Fe(II) and Cu(II) chelator) or with 100 μm bathocuproine disulfonic acid-Na2 salt (BCS) (Cu(I) chelator) (16Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Google Scholar, 19Landers J.W. Zak B. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1958; 29: 590-592Google Scholar,20Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Google Scholar). For all experiments described, cells were grown to saturation in SD medium, subsequently resuspended in the same medium, and grown for 8–10 generations (exponential phase). They were then shifted to the desired medium (SD, SDBCS, or SDBPS) at a concentration of 4–5 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots were removed from each culture every 2 h and assayed for copper and iron reducing activities simultaneously. -The FRE2/lacZ andFRE1/lacZ fusion plasmids were constructed starting from the low copy number URA3- containing YCP50 vector carrying a 6.3-kilobase BamHI-SalI fragment containing theEscherichia coli lacZ gene (except for the 8 amino-terminal codons of β-galactosidase), the lacY gene, and a portion of the lacA gene. The −977/+3 and −930/+3 promoter fragments of FRE1 and FRE2 genes, respectively, produced by polymerase chain reaction were cloned in theBamHI site of the described plasmid in fusion to the β-galactosidase open reading frame. The MAC1 gene was isolated from a YCP50 yeast genomic library by the use of a synthetic oligonucleotide probe. The sequence of the oligonucleotide is 5′-GCCCTCTGATGCACGATGCACACGCA-3′. For the construction of the LexA-Mac1p fusion proteins, the MAC1gene sequence from +4 to +1249 nucleotides was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into theSmaI-KpnI sites of plasmid YCp91, a derivative of pRS314 (TRP1) containing the ADH1 promoter and 5′ untranslated region followed by an ATG codon and sequences encoding the SV40 nuclear localization signal, the HA1 epitope from influenza virus, and the LexA binding domain (21Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequences used for the polymerase chain reaction are 5′-TCCCCGGGATAATATTTAATGGGAACA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTGAAGTGGTGGCATCGCTTA-3′. The reporter plasmids used for the transactivation and repressor assays were correspondingly pJK103, in which four LexA operators upstream of the GAL1TATA element control the lacZ gene transcription (21Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Google Scholar, 22Ausubel, F. M., R. Brent, R. E. Kingston, D. D. Moore, J. G. Seidman, J. A. Smith, and K. Struhl (eds) (1996) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene and Wiley, New YorkGoogle Scholar), and pJK1621, in which four LexA operators, two upstream activation sequences, and TATA element of the CYC1 gene control the lacZ gene transcription (23Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Google Scholar, 24Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Google Scholar). The sequences of the antisense CTR1, CUP1, andEF1α synthetic oligonucleotides used as probes in the RNA blot hybridization analyses are 5′-CCTGCAACTTGGAATTCTCAAGGATGTC-3′, 5′-GTTACCGCAGGGGCATTTGTCGTCGTC-3′, and 5′-CCAGAATCGACATGACCGATAACGAC-3′, respectively. End-labeling of these oligonucleotides with γ-[32P]ATP was performed by DNA kinase (22Ausubel, F. M., R. Brent, R. E. Kingston, D. D. Moore, J. G. Seidman, J. A. Smith, and K. Struhl (eds) (1996) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene and Wiley, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The described oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Microchemistry group (Heraklion, Crete, Greece). Samples of total RNA and yeast DNA were prepared and blot-hybridized according to standard procedures (22Ausubel, F. M., R. Brent, R. E. Kingston, D. D. Moore, J. G. Seidman, J. A. Smith, and K. Struhl (eds) (1996) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene and Wiley, New YorkGoogle Scholar). -For the FRE1gene-specific probe, a PvuII-SacI genomic DNA fragment containing the coding region of the FRE1 gene (−680 to +2280) was subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pBluescript II KS (+/-) phagemid (Stratagene). The recombinant plasmid was linearized by restriction at the SpeI site on theFRE1 gene (+1893) and a 444-base (including polylinker sequences) single-stranded homogeneously radiolabeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized by the T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of α-[32P]UTP (21Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Google Scholar). From the 444-base FRE1probe, a 298-base fragment was protected, which defined the 3′ end of the RNA 135 bases downstream of the translation termination. A protected doublet was observed with this probe due to three consecutive thymidines preceding this point, which created an unstable RNase digestion-prone A/T-rich region. For the FRE2 gene-specific probe, anMluI-AflII genomic DNA fragment containing the coding region of the FRE2 gene (−2041 to +2340) was subcloned into the EcoRV site of the phagemid described for the FRE1-specific probe. The recombinant plasmid was linearized by restriction at the AhaII site on theFRE2 gene (+1682) and a 712-base probe was produced by the same procedure as for the FRE1-specific probe. From the 712-base FRE2 probe, 654 bases were protected,i.e. the size of the whole probe omitting the polylinker sequences (the FRE2 mRNA 3′ is downstream theAflII site used for subcloning). A protected doublet was observed with this probe due to a region of seven consecutive thymidines preceding the AflII site. For the HIS3 gene-specific probe, a HindIII genomic DNA fragment covering the coding region of the HIS3gene from +305 to +591 was subcloned into the HindIII site of the phagemid described for the FRE1-specific probe. The recombinant phagemid was linearized by restriction at theMseI site (+312) and a 260-base probe was produced by transcription with the T7 RNA polymerase. 105 cpm of each antisense RNA probe were simultaneously hybridized with 25 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 75% formamide, 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 7.5, and 1 mmEDTA overnight. The mixture was diluted in 300 μl of a solution containing 0.3 m NaCl and 5 mm EDTA and treated with RNase A (30 μg/ml) at 20 °C for 30 min, followed by treatment with proteinase K (300 μg/ml in 0.1% SDS) at 37 °C for 20 min. The mixture was phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, denatured at 92 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on a 40-cm, 6% polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide (19:1), 8.3 m urea-containing gel. Ferric reduction activity was measured as described previously (5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar). Exactly the same conditions were used for the copper reduction assay, except that BCS and CuCl2 was used instead of BPS and FeCl3. For the Cu(I) quantification, an extinction coefficient of 12.25 mm−1cm−1 was used to measure the Cu(I)BCS complex at 482 nm (A482). The extinction coefficient used for Fe(II)BPS at 520 nm (A520) was 22.39 mm−1 cm−1. β-Galactosidase activity assays (22Ausubel, F. M., R. Brent, R. E. Kingston, D. D. Moore, J. G. Seidman, J. A. Smith, and K. Struhl (eds) (1996) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene and Wiley, New YorkGoogle Scholar) were performed following 7 h of growth in the desired medium. It has been shown previously that Fre1p ferric reductase is also cupric reductase induced by copper depletion (16Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined Fre2p ferric reductase for cupric reducing activity assayed in a fre1Δ strain (5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar). We have first used iron depletion culture conditions known to induce Fre2p (5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar) to obtain measurable amounts of the enzyme. For comparison, we have assayed three additional strains, wild type,fre2Δ (Fre1p activity), andfre1Δfre2Δ, in parallel according to the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results presented in Table I show that Fre2p as well as Fre1p have cupric reductase activity.Table IFre1p and Fre2p induction under copper and iron depletionMediumStrainCupric reductase unitsFerric reductase units4 h10 h4 h10 hSDWT5.3 ± 0.86.3 ± 2.04.5 ± 1.35.5 ± 2.7fre1Δ5.0 ± 1.84.8 ± 0.41.2 ± 1.01.4 ± 0.9fre2Δ4.2 ± 1.04.6 ± 0.56.1 ± 3.54.2 ± 1.9fre1Δfre2Δ4.7 ± 2.03.6 ± 0.30.8 ± 1.41.4 ± 1.1SDBCSWT38.5 ± 4.518.8 ± 1.8102.5 ± 26.148.8 ± 7.1fre1Δ4.2 ± 0.05.3 ± 1.31.9 ± 1.83.4 ± 1.8fre2Δ35.5 ± 5.115.8 ± 1.8104.6 ± 15.945.8 ± 4.8fre1Δfre2Δ4.2 ± 0.44.7 ± 0.62.0 ± 1.73.2 ± 1.0SDBPSWT40.2 ± 3.847.0 ± 2.0120.7 ± 35.091.2 ± 31.8fre1Δ4.4 ± 2.732.0 ± 1.11.4 ± 1.453.6 ± 17.0fre2Δ31.8 ± 7.912.0 ± 4.1103.7 ± 20.933.6 ± 18.2fre1Δfre2Δ5.2 ± 0.73.8 ± 0.11.8 ± 1.61.8 ± 1.3Assays of reductase activities were performed in aliquots of the indicated strain cultures at different time points of growth in minimal (SD), copper-depleted (SDBCS), and iron-depleted (SDBPS) media. The average unit values (multiplied by a factor of 10) from five identical experiments obtained at 4 and 10 h of growth (when peak activities of the two reductases were detected) are shown. Units are defined as Cu(I) or Fe(II) nmol/h/106 cells. Open table in a new tab Assays of reductase activities were performed in aliquots of the indicated strain cultures at different time points of growth in minimal (SD), copper-depleted (SDBCS), and iron-depleted (SDBPS) media. The average unit values (multiplied by a factor of 10) from five identical experiments obtained at 4 and 10 h of growth (when peak activities of the two reductases were detected) are shown. Units are defined as Cu(I) or Fe(II) nmol/h/106 cells. Since we had previously observed that the two enzymes follow kinetically distinct induction by iron deprivation (5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar), we have assayed the same strains under conditions of copper depletion during 12 h of exponential growth. Our results (Table I) show that Fre1p was induced under copper depletion at similar levels as by iron depletion. In contrast, Fre2p was not detectably modulated by copper depletion. Fre2p activity was not induced even in the presence of the reducing agent sodium ascorbate (up to 500 μm), excluding the possibility of inefficient retention of the Cu(II) found in the minimal medium by the Cu(I)-specific chelator BCS (data not shown)). We have obtained the same results (activity observed only in thefre2Δ strain) by using medium reconstituted from its ingredients with the omission of copper (data not shown). Data in Table I show residual copper-reducing activity in thefre1Δfre2Δ strain which was not affected by metal depletion and accounted for about 80% of the activity in noninduction conditions. We have not detected similar residual ferric reducing activity in this fre1Δfre2Δ strain (5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar) (Table I). Although Fre2p did not show induction within 12 h in copper-depleted fre1Δ cultures, this was achieved later between 12 and 15 h in repeatedly diluted copper-depleting medium and remained relatively constant during the exponential growth of the cells (Fig. 1). We suggest that according to the proposed model of iron-copper connection (8Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar, 9Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar) prolonged depletion of copper intracellularly created also iron depletion, which in turn induced Fre2p activity. -While our results showed that both Fre1p and Fre2p are cupric reductases, they do not answer the question of whether copper reduction is necessary for copper uptake. Assuming that Fre1p and Fre2p are indeed important for copper uptake, this process should be impaired in a fre1Δfre2Δ strain. We have monitored copper entrance into the cell and its utilization by following the expression of two different copper responsive genes,CUP1 and CTR1. The regulation of these genes by copper follows distinct pathways. CUP1 transcript encoding a metallothionein is induced by the transcription factor Ace1p when copper concentration increases in the cell (25Karin M. Najarian R. Haslinger A. Valenzuela P. Welch J. Fogel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 337-341Google Scholar, 26Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 421-429Google Scholar), whereasCTR1 transcript encoding the copper transporter is induced by copper depletion and is not affected by the Ace1p factor (27Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, high levels ofCTR1 mRNA were detected infre1Δfre2Δ cells grown in minimal medium (SD), which indicated that the mutant cells had lower copper uptake capacity than the wild type cells. Nonetheless, addition of copper to a concentration of 0.5 μm completely repressedCTR1 mRNA levels in both strains, indicating that the metal could enter also the fre1Δfre2Δ cells. No significant difference was detected in the accumulation ofCUP1 mRNA between the two strains, possibly becauseCTR1 gene responded to lower levels of copper thanCUP1 gene (27Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar). When cultures grew under Fe(II) and Cu(II) retention conditions (SDBPS) when both reductases were induced, prominent differences in the accumulation of both CTR1 and CUP1 mRNAs were obtained between fre1Δfre2Δ and wild type strain. One hundredfold higher CuSO4 concentration was necessary to diminish CTR1 mRNA levels in the mutant cells. This observation demonstrated that the two reductases were clearly required for copper uptake under conditions of strong retention by chelators. As expected, when the two cultures grew under Cu(I) depletion conditions (SDPBCS), the difference between the two strains almost disappeared, since copper chelation was exerted after the step of reduction. The small remaining difference might reflect a higher Cu(I) concentration in the presence of reductases facilitating the Cu(I) transporter to compete with the chelator. To evaluate the contribution of each of the reductases for copper uptake, we have similarly tested the singly disrupted strainsfre1Δ and fre2Δ under conditions at which the double disruptant and wild type cells had shown the most prominent differences (SDBPS) (Fig. 2 B). Comparison of the extent ofCTR1 mRNA repression in the four strains showed clearly that both reductases participated in copper uptake. The similarity ofCTR1 mRNA patterns between fre2Δ and wild type cells implied that Fre1p carried through the process almost as well as both reductases. However, a clear-cut difference between thefre1Δ and fre1Δfre2Δ strains (a 5-fold CuSO4 concentration was required to repressCTR1 mRNA in the doubly disrupted cells) was detected, attributing to the Fre2p minor participation in copper uptake. The detected CUP1 mRNA accumulation could not distinguish in either case between the presence or absence of Fre2p, but clearly pointed to the important contribution of Fre1p. The differential induction profiles of the two reductases in copper depleted cells led us to investigate the levels ofFRE1 and FRE2 mRNAs under these conditions. Using an RNase A protection assay we were able to simultaneously detect and quantitatively compare FRE1, FRE2, andHIS3 (as an internal control) mRNAs in total RNA of a wild type strain. Fig. 3 A (left panels) shows that FRE1 mRNA accumulated under copper depletion and FRE2 mRNA was barely detectable (only at very long film exposures) at all time points, as described for the induction of the corresponding enzymatic activities. In parallel experiments using iron-depleted cultures, FRE1 andFRE2 mRNAs accumulated both following the time-dependent induction observed for the corresponding reductase activities (5Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar) (Table I). Measurements of β-galactosidase activities driven by theFRE1 or FRE2 promoters in wild type cells grown under copper and iron depletion indicated clearly that theFRE1 promoter was able to confer both copper- and iron-regulated expression of β-galactosidase, whereas theFRE2 promoter conferred only iron-regulated expression (Fig.4). The only known nuclear protein implicated in both copper and iron metabolism, affecting basal expression of theFRE1 gene is Mac1p (15Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Google Scholar). mac1 mutant cells suffer from copper and, possibly, iron deficiency, since addition of copper or iron (partly) can complement their phenotypes (15Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Google Scholar). Mac1p contains a region homologous to the copper-dependent transcription factor Ace1p (15Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Google Scholar). We have followed the response of FRE1 andFRE2 genes to copper depletion in a MAC1gene-deleted strain during 12 h of growth. The results shown in Fig. 3 A (right panels) revealed thatFRE2 mRNA was detectable in mac1Δ cells grown in minimal medium (SD) and substantially induced following copper depletion. In contrast, FRE1 mRNA basal levels were significantly lower in the mac1Δ uninduced cells (SD medium) compared with the wild type levels and accumulated at very reduced levels in the copper-depleted cells. Following iron depletion of the mac1Δ strain, both FRE1 andFRE2 mRNAs were induced. However, by comparison to the induction patterns obtained in wild type cells, we found a temporal shift of the FRE1 mRNA induction to later time points in the exponentially growing mac1Δ culture, in contrast to a temporal shift of the FRE2 mRNA accumulation to earlier time points (Fig. 3, A and B). β-Galactosidase activity levels produced by the FRE1/lacZand FRE2/lacZ plasmids in a mac1Δ strain grown under copper or iron depletion conditions showed that the differential accumulation of FRE1 and FRE2 mRNAs resulted from the transcriptional response of the two genes (Fig. 4). Comparing these results to the RNA accumulation profiles, we should note that at 7 h of growth (when the assays were performed) the accumulation of β-galactosidase was less in the mac1Δ strain compared with the wild type strain when driven by the FRE1 promoter and more when driven by the FRE2 promoter. The results of reductase assays on copper- and iron-depletedfre1Δmac1Δ andfre2Δmac1Δ cultures were in agreement with the induction patterns of their transcripts (data not shown). Therefore, under copper limitation, Mac1p function has a negative role on FRE2 gene regulation, while it affects positivelyFRE1 gene. In the absence of Mac1p (in mac1Δ strain) under copper limitation, additional inducing factors might exist for both genes, since FRE2 and FRE1mRNA levels are higher than those detected in the noninducing culture (minimal medium). Furthermore, as presented in the diagrams shown in Fig. 3 B, Mac1p seems to be involved in the temporally differential expression of FRE1/FRE2 genes under iron limitation. These observations are elaborated further under “Discussion.” The observed copper-dependent regulation ofFRE1/FRE2 genes affected by Mac1p function led us to investigate the copper dependence of Mac1p protein function. First we have tested the entire Mac1p coding sequence fused to the LexA binding domain for its ability to activate transcription of a β-galactosidase reporter following binding to the LexA operator (21Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Google Scholar, 22Ausubel, F. M., R. Brent, R. E. Kingston, D. D. Moore, J. G. Seidman, J. A. Smith, and K. Struhl (eds) (1996) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene and Wiley, New YorkGoogle Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, Mac1p protein was capable of transactivating the β-galactosidase reporter in cells grown in minimal medium. This activity was significantly increased when cells were depleted from copper, which suggests th"

W., Armstrong, S. A., Barry, D., and Mueller, C. R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 25879–25884). In this study, we demonstrate that casein kinase II (CKII) is able to phosphorylate the C terminus of Sp1 and results in a decrease in DNA binding activity. This suggests that CKII may be responsible for the observed regulation of Sp1. Mutation of a consensus CKII site at amino acid 579, within the second zinc finger, eliminates phosphorylation of this site and the CKII-mediated inhibition of Sp1 binding. Phosphopeptide analysis confirms the presence of a CKII site at Thr-579 as well as additional sites within the C terminus. No gross changes in CKII subunit levels were seen during de-differentiation associated with liver regeneration. The serine/threonine phosphatase PP1 was identified as the endogenous liver nuclear protein able to dephosphorylate Sp1 but again no gross changes in activity were observed in the regenerating liver. Okadaic acid treatment of K562 cells increases Sp1 phosphorylation and inhibits its DNA binding activity suggesting that steady state levels of Sp1 phosphorylation are established by a balance between kinase and phosphatase activities. We have previously observed that Sp1, a ubiquitous zinc finger transcription factor, is phosphorylated during terminal differentiation in the whole animal, and this results in decreased DNA binding activity (Leggett, R.

Okadaic acid treatment of K562 cells increases Sp1 phosphorylation and inhibits its DNA binding activity suggesting that steady state levels of Sp1 phosphorylation are established by a balance between kinase and phosphatase activities. Sp1 was originally characterized as a GC box binding protein (1Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 46-52Google Scholar) recognizing the consensus sequence GGGCGG. Its DNA binding domain consists of three C2H2 zinc fingers (2Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.C. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Google Scholar), and a series of four domains required for transcriptional activity of Sp1 have been characterized (3Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Google Scholar). Two of these domains, A and B, correspond to glutamine-rich regions (4Buckler A.J. Chang D.D. Graw S.L. Brook J.D. Haber D.A. Sharp P. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4005Google Scholar, 5Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Google Scholar, 6Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Google Scholar) that interact with the transcriptional machinery by binding to TAFII110 (7Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Google Scholar) and are needed for transcriptional synergy to occur (8Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Google Scholar). Domain C contains a region of high charge and functions only weakly as an independent transactivation domain (4Buckler A.J. Chang D.D. Graw S.L. Brook J.D. Haber D.A. Sharp P. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4005Google Scholar). Domain D is required for synergistic activation in conjunction with the A and B domains and may be involved in the formation of higher order homomeric complexes (8Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Google Scholar). The zinc fingers and domain D may also be involved in the interaction of Sp1 with other proteins as they are required for binding to proteins such as YY1 (9Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Google Scholar), GATA-1 (10Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Google Scholar), and adenovirus E1A (11Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Google Scholar). Sp1 is a member of a small multi-gene family, with Sp2 and Sp3 being ubiquitously expressed (12Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar,13Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar), whereas the expression of Sp4 may be limited to the brain (13Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar). Sp3 recognizes the same DNA sequences as Sp1 and may act as a repressor of Sp1-mediated activation (14Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Google Scholar). Sp1 has traditionally been considered to be a constitutive transcription factor and has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of housekeeping genes and genes involved in growth regulation (15Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly clear that Sp1 binding and transactivation is regulated by a variety of stimuli. The retinoblastoma gene product appears to be able to modulate Sp1-mediated transactivation (16Kim S.J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Google Scholar, 17Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D.R. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Google Scholar, 18Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Google Scholar) possibly through the release of Sp1 from a negative regulator of transactivation (19Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Google Scholar). A variety of growth factors may regulate Sp1 activity as this transcription factor has been shown to mediate the epidermal growth factor stimulation of the gastrin promoter (20Merchant J.L. Shiotani A. Mortensen E.R. Shumaker D.K. Abraczinskas D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Google Scholar), the insulin-like growth factor I regulation of the elastin gene (21Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpstra A.J. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6555-6563Google Scholar), and the transforming growth factor-β-mediated activation of both the α2(I) collagen gene (22Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Google Scholar) and p15INK4B(23Li J.-M. Nichols M.A. Chandrasekharan S. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26750-26753Google Scholar). Transactivation of the insulin receptor gene by E1a is thought to be mediated by Sp1 (24Kim H.S. Lee J.K. Tsai S.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 178-186Google Scholar), and increased Sp1 activity may be involved in tumor progression of a carcinoma cell line (25Gunther M. Frebourg T. Laithier M. Fossar N. Bouziane-Ouartini M. Lavialle C. Brison O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2490-2499Google Scholar). Expression of the p21CIP1/WAF1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in response to phorbol ester and okadaic acid treatments is also mediated through Sp1 sites (26Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Google Scholar). These findings suggest that modulation of Sp1 activity plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. The Sp1 protein is subject to two different forms of post-translational modification. It is extensively glycosylated with O-linked sugars, which appear to play some role in transactivation (27Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Google Scholar). It is also phosphorylated by a DNA-dependent protein kinase (28Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Google Scholar), but this phosphorylation has not been shown to alter the activity of Sp1. Sp1 also becomes phosphorylated during the process of terminal differentiation (29Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Google Scholar). This modification results in the down-regulation of the DNA binding activity of Sp1 in rat liver nuclear extracts as well as in extracts from other organs. In this study, we demonstrate that the serine/threonine kinase, casein kinase II (CKII), 1The abbreviations used are: CKII, casein kinase II; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; aa, amino acid(s). 1The abbreviations used are: CKII, casein kinase II; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; aa, amino acid(s). is able to phosphorylate the C terminus of Sp1 and results in decreased Sp1 DNA binding. This suggests that CKII may be responsible for the observed phosphorylation of Sp1 during terminal differentiation in vivo. Increased phosphorylation of Sp1 in response to okadaic acid treatment suggests that phosphatases may also be involved in the regulation of Sp1 phosphorylation levels. Nuclear extracts were prepared at a concentration of 5–10 μg/μl, according to Gorskiet al. (30Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Google Scholar), with the modifications described in Maireet al. (31Maire P. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Google Scholar). The liver regeneration extracts were prepared by treating adult male rats with CCl4 and preparing extracts on day 2 as described in Mueller et al. (32Mueller C.R. Maire P. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 61: 279-291Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of full-length Sp1 produced using a vaccinia virus vector (Promega) or Sp1-maltose fusion proteins (see below) was carried out in a 15- or 20-μl reaction volume of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 34 mm KCl, 50 mmMgCl2 at 30 °C for 45 min in the presence of 1 μl of partially purified CKII, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and ±15 μg of bovine serum albumin. Some reactions contained 100 ng of the indicated, unlabeled oligonucleotides shown below. cSp1:DBP site I:DBP site II:RCE:site C:5′­CTGCGGGGCGGGGCAGACCCCGCCCCGTCTGACG­5′5′­CTCTGGGTGCAGATTGCAAAGCCCACGTCTAACGTTTCGAGA­5′5′­TTTGCTTTGGCCACGCCTCAAGGCTGGAAACCGGTGCGGAGTTCCGACAAAC­5′5′­ACCGTGCCCGCGCGCCACCCCTCTGGCGCCGGGCGCGCGGTGGGGAGACCGCGGTGGCAC­5′5′­GTAGGAACCAATGAAATGCGAGGTAAGTATTTGGTTACTTTACGCTCCATTCATACATCC­5′ The samples were then separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed or stained and subsequently dried and autoradiographed. The Sp1 fusion protein, amino acids 521–696, was 32P-labeled using CKII as described above. The labeled substrate was then exposed to rat liver nuclear extracts in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors for the indicated length of time. Samples were separated on a 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel. The gel was subsequently fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described in Lichsteiner and Schibler (33Lichsteiner S. Schibler U. Cell. 1989; 57: 1179-1187Google Scholar) except that the binding reactions lasted for 15 min on ice before the samples were loaded on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. In the supershift experiments, the antibody was incubated with the sample for 30 min on ice followed by the 15-min binding reaction with the labeled probe before being loaded on a gel. The anti-Sp1 antibody is a rabbit affinity purified polyclonal antibody raised against residues 520–538 of the human Sp1 protein and was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The cSp1 oligonucleotide shown above was used as the probe in all cases. Protein separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and the Sp1 protein was detected using the anti-Sp1 antibody (above) and a peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The complexes were detected using the Renaissance chemiluminescence system according to manufacturer's instructions (DuPont NEN). The anti-α, anti-α′, and anti-β antibodies raised against the respective CKII subunits are rabbit polyclonal antibodies and were a generous gift from David Litchfield. These were detected using a goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate antibody (Sigma). A cDNA fragment spanning nucleotides 1561–2091 of Sp1 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) and pPac Sp1 (generously supplied by R. Tjian) as the template, and the Sp1 521 and Sp1 696 primers, which containEcoRI and HindIII sites, respectively. A mutation at nucleotide 1735 (A → G) was generated via polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis with primers Sp1 521 and 90 used to generate the 5′ portion, and primers Sp1 696 and 89 used to generate the 3′ portion of the mutant Sp1 cDNA. This clone also encodes amino acids 521–696 of Sp1, but it contains a threonine to alanine mutation at codon 579 within the second zinc finger. Standard techniques were used to clone the Sp1 cDNAs into plasmid pBS+ (Stratagene) at the EcoRI and HindIII sites. The derived clones were completely sequenced.

Colonies were screened, and large scale protein preparations were made according to manufacturers' instructions, with the following modifications. Induced bacteria from a 150-ml culture were pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml of protein lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol) containing 100 μm ZnSO4 and protease inhibitors (10 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Trasylol). Protein lysis buffer (1 ml) containing 20 mg/ml lysozyme was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and then 1 ml of 5 m NaCl was added with a further incubation of 15 min on ice, and the mixture was centrifuged at 30,000 rpm in a 55.2Ti rotor (Beckman) for 30 min at 4 °C. Two ml of the supernatant was applied to a 0.5-ml amylose resin column and was then washed with 3 × 2 ml of NDB (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT) containing 100 μm ZnSO4. The fusion protein was eluted with 2 × 1 ml of NDB with 10 mm maltose and 100 μm ZnSO4; the protein containing fractions were pooled, and the protein was denatured by the addition of urea to 5 m and incubation on ice for 1 h. Protein samples were then dialyzed against NDB containing 10 mm DTT and 100 μm ZnSO4 once and 3 × NDB with 1 mm DTT and 100 μm ZnSO4 to refold the protein in the presence of zinc. The Sp1 521–696 wild type and Thr-579 mutant proteins used in Fig. 2 were affinity purified on a calf thymus DNA-cellulose column before use. Sp1-maltose binding protein fusion proteins that had been phosphorylated as described above were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride protein blotting membrane (Corning Costar Corp.). The membrane was re-wet in methanol for 1 min and washed 3 × 2 min in 1 liter of distilled H2O and then the region containing the labeled protein was excised. Membrane pieces were soaked in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mm acetic acid at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed with 5 × 1 ml of distilled H2O followed by freshly made 50 mm NH4HCO3 twice. The membranes were then incubated in 200 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0 (day old), containing 10 μg of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C. Another 10 μg of trypsin was added, and the membrane was incubated for a further 3 h at 37 °C. The sample was diluted with 800 μl of distilled H2O, centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant collected and lyophilized. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of distilled H2O and lyophilized two more times. The dry pellet was then resuspended in 50 μl of performic acid (900 μl of formic acid (98%) + 100 μl of hydrogen peroxide (30%), 60 min at room temperature) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The sample was lyophilized after 1 ml of distilled H2O was added. The pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer, spotted on a thin layer cellulose plate, and run in the first dimension using the pH 1.9 buffer for 1 h at 1000 V on the Hunter thin layer electrophoresis unit (HTLE-7000; CSB Scientific, Inc.) The phosphopeptides were separated in the second dimension by thin layer chromatography with the following buffer: 40/50/10/40 (v/v) n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/acetic acid/water. The plates were dried and autoradiographed. K562 cells, a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, were grown in suspension in 25-ml T flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Induction of Sp1 phosphorylation was achieved by supplementing the media with okadaic acid (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al.(34Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar), either before treatment or 2 h after the addition of okadaic acid. We have previously observed that Sp1 is phosphorylated in nuclear extracts prepared from mature rat liver as well as from a variety of other tissues (29Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Google Scholar). This phosphorylation results in an approximately 10-fold decrease in the affinity of Sp1 for its cognate site. The site or sites phosphorylated in Sp1 as well as the kinase responsible have not been identified. Examination of the primary sequence of Sp1 revealed three potential phosphorylation sites for CKII, one of which is located within the second zinc finger of the DNA binding domain of Sp1. The down-regulation of AP-1 activity by CKII during growth arrest (35Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. Al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Google Scholar) suggested a potential involvement of this kinase in Sp1 phosphorylation during terminal differentiation. To examine the role of CKII in Sp1 regulation, the effect of CKII phosphorylation on Sp1 DNA binding activity was assessed. Full-length affinity purified Sp1 prepared from a vaccinia virus vector was used in a standard bandshift assay with a consensus Sp1 site as the probe. CKII alone, Sp1 alone, Sp1 with CKII and ATP, or Sp1 with CKII but no ATP were tested (Fig.1 A). Only when both CKII and ATP were present was the binding of Sp1 inhibited. An in vitro kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP was also carried out with purified CKII and Sp1 to determine if Sp1 is a substrate for phosphorylation. Specific labeling of Sp1 was observed only in the presence of both proteins (Fig. 1 B). Due to the presence of the putative CKII site within the second zinc finger of Sp1, it seemed possible that binding of a specific DNA to Sp1 might interfere with phosphorylation. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to high affinity Sp1 sites including elements derived from the SV40 21-base pair repeat (Sp1), from site II of the DBP gene promoter (II), and from the retinoblastoma control element (RCE), which has a lower affinity for Sp1 but which is still specific (29Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Google Scholar), were added to the kinase assay before the addition of CKII. The binding of these oligonucleotides resulted in a dramatic decrease in the phosphorylation of Sp1 by CKII (Fig. 2 B). The addition of non-Sp1 binding sites had no effect on CKII phosphorylation (sites I and C). To localize those Sp1 residues necessary for CKII-mediated inhibition, a maltose binding protein fusion was created that encompassed the Sp1 zinc finger domain and the C-terminal D domain, from amino acids 521 to 696 (Fig. 3 A). This region contains only one consensus CKII site. A point mutant of this construct was also generated that changes the theoretical phosphate acceptor in the CKII consensus site (at aa579) from a threonine to an alanine residue which should inactivate the site. These proteins were purified on a calf thymus DNA-cellulose column before being used in the binding and kinase assays. Both proteins bound to a consensus Sp1 site with comparable affinities (Fig. 2 A). Phosphorylation with purified CKII inhibited the binding of the wild type protein, and this effect was dependent on the presence of ATP. This defined the C-terminal 175 amino acids of Sp1 as being sufficient for being inhibited by CKII. In contrast, binding of the protein containing the point mutation at Thr-579 was not inhibited by treatment with CKII and ATP. Phosphorylation of Thr-579 is clearly required for CKII-mediated inhibition of Sp1 DNA binding activity. The effect of this mutation on Sp1 phosphorylation was examined using an in vitro kinase assay with the same two proteins. Both proteins are phosphorylated to a comparable degree, with the Thr-579 mutant being slightly more active (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that Thr-579 is not the only, or even the predominant, CKII phosphorylation site within the region of Sp1 from aa521 to aa696. The maltose binding protein alone was not phosphorylated by CKII (data not shown). Phosphorylation of the mutant protein is also suggested by the shift in mobility of the mutant protein complex in the bandshift reaction upon CKII treatment (Fig.2 A). Overall, these results indicate that Thr-579 is essential for CKII-mediated inhibition of Sp1 DNA binding activity despite it not representing the major phosphorylation site in this protein. However, the almost complete blocking of Sp1 phosphorylation by binding of a specific oligonucleotide suggests that these other CKII sites are in some way also masked upon DNA binding. Phosphotryptic analysis of the wild type and Thr-579 mutant fusion proteins was carried out to confirm the presence of an active CKII phosphorylation site at aa579. Four spots are readily visible with the full-length protein with the most prominent having relatively low mobility in both dimensions (spot 2) (Fig. 3 B). Examination of the tryptic cleavage sites in Sp1 (Fig. 3 A) reveals that two large C-terminal fragments would result from protease digestion. The presence of both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine in spot 2 (data not shown) makes it likely that this spot is the aa624–672 tryptic fragment as the aa673 to aa696 peptide does not contain threonines. The large size of this fragment would be consistent with its low mobility in the two-dimensional separation. Spot 1 appears to represent a proteolytic cleavage product of spot 2. Tryptic mapping of the Thr-579 mutant reveals that both of the weaker upper spots (spots 3 and 4) are lost (Fig. 3 B). Spot 3 likely represents the three-residue peptide that contains Thr-579, and its disappearance indicates that this site is phosphorylated by CKII. Spot 4, which also disappears, is likely a partial cleavage product as there is a lysine residue adjacent to the N-terminal arginine in this peptide (Fig. 3 A) so that cleavage at one or the other residue by trypsin is likely. These mapping experiments indicate that Thr-579, as well as a number of serine and possibly threonine residues within the D domain, are phosphorylated by CKII. In the regenerating rat liver Sp1 is less phosphorylated compared with the normal liver (29Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Google Scholar). The ability of CKII to alter Sp1 binding led us to examine if changes in CKII subunit levels in rat liver nuclear extracts are responsible for the differences in Sp1 phosphorylation. Western blot analysis of the α, α′, and β CKII subunits in nuclear extracts from normal and regenerating liver indicated that the levels of all three proteins were essentially the same in both (Fig.4). This suggested that gross CKII subunit levels were not subject to regulation but did not rule out alteration in activity due to other interactions. The possibility that dephosphorylation of Sp1 might be regulated led to the examination of endogenous phosphatases that could dephosphorylate CKII-phosphorylated Sp1. The aa521–696 Sp1 fusion protein was phosphorylated with CKII and [γ-32P]ATP and then mixed with normal rat liver nuclear extracts. These extracts were able to dephosphorylate Sp1 over the course of a 45-min incubation (Fig. 5 A). Increasing concentrations of okadaic acid were then added, which inhibit various serine/threonine phosphatases at characteristic concentrations (Fig. 5 A). At 100 nm of okadaic acid all dephosphorylation was inhibited, and this inhibition was more efficient than a mix of nonspecific phosphatase inhibitors. This indicates that it is likely PP1 that is able to dephosphorylate Sp1. This phosphatase has been suggested to be regulated under some circumstances (36Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Google Scholar, 37Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Google Scholar). However, when the phosphatase activity in normal and regenerating rat liver nuclear extracts was examined using a time course incubation, no difference in overall phosphatase levels was observed (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Dephosphorylation of casein kinase II-phosphorylated Sp1. A, the Sp1 fusion protein 521–696 was phosphorylated (phos.) using purified CKII and [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with 20 μg of regenerating rat liver nuclear extract in the presence or absence of various phosphatase inhibitors. The general phosphatase inhibitor combination (MIX) consisted of a final concentration of 1 mmeach of sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium phosphate. Okadaic acid was added at the indicated concentrations. The reactions were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and autoradiographed. Thearrow indicates the position of the Sp1 fusion protein.B, dephosphorylation reactions were carried out as described in A except that nuclear extracts from both normal and regenerating liver were used.

The arrow indicates the location of the Sp1 fusion protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In vitro assays are limited in that they may disrupt interactions essential for regulation of a given process. To investigate if Sp1 phosphorylation is a dynamic process involving both active phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the effect of okadaic acid treatment on Sp1 phosphorylation in vivo was assayed. K562 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml okadaic acid for 2 h, at which time nuclear extracts were prepared. Bandshift assays with the consensus Sp1 site, using normal and okadaic acid-treated extracts, indicates that Sp1 DNA binding activity is essentially eliminated by okadaic acid treatment (Fig. 6 A). Addition of an Sp1 antibody results in a supershift of approximately half of the DNA-protein complex in the untreated extract, confirming that this factor is Sp1. The remaining DNA binding activity represents Sp3 which is subject to similar phosphorylation-mediated regulation as Sp1. 2Manuscript in preparation. A longer exposure of these lanes is shown in Fig. 6 B to illustrate the level of reduction in DNA binding activity. Dephosphorylation of these extracts using alkaline phosphatase restores Sp1 DNA binding activity in the okadaic acid-treated extract, and the protein composition was again confirmed using a supershift assay. The extracts were also compared using an NF-Y binding site (C site), whose binding activity remains relatively constant in most cells, and indicated that slightly less protein is present in the treated extracts. Western blot analysis of Sp1 protein in these extracts was also carried out (Fig. 6 C). Again, slightly less Sp1 was present in the treated extracts, but the differences were not large. No differences in mobility of the protein after treatment with okadaic acid, or after dephosphorylation, were observed. This indicates that the amount of phosphorylation of these proteins is not high enough to affect their mobility. The phosphatase treatment of these extracts increases the DNA binding activity of Sp1 even in the untreated extracts, suggesting that a significant population of Sp1 exists in the phosphorylated form in these cells. These experiments do not establish which kinase is responsible for Sp1 phosphorylation in vivo. However, by inhibiting the endogenous phosphatase, okadaic acid treatment results in the phosphorylation of the remaining population of Sp1, indicating that Sp1 phosphorylation is an active process in the cell. Our initial observation that down-regulation of Sp1 DNA binding activity by phosphorylation occurs during terminal differentiation (29Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Google Scholar) led us to investigate which kinase was involved in this process. The presence of several consensus CKII phosphorylation sites in Sp1, as well as previous reports linking CKII phosphorylation to growth arrest (35Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. Al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Google Scholar), strongly suggested a role for this kinase in this process. In particular, the location of one of these CKII sites within the second zinc finger of Sp1 was suggestive of a possible mechanism by which phosphorylation would interfere with binding of Sp1 to DNA. The demonstration that CKII is able to phosphorylate full-length Sp1 produced from a vaccinia virus vector and that this phosphorylation interfered with Sp1 DNA binding activity indicates that CKII is able to regulate Sp1 activity. The ability of CKII to both phosphorylate and inhibit the binding of a fusion protein containing the C-terminal 175 amino acids of Sp1 (aa521–696) further localized the CKII phosphorylation site to this region. In addition, the ability of an Sp1 recognition site oligonucleotide to block the majority of the CKII-mediated phosphorylation of both the full-length and truncated proteins suggests that this C-terminal region contains most or all of the active sites. However, mutation of the acceptor threonine (aa579) in the consensus CKII site did not eliminate CKII phosphorylation of Sp1, suggesting that other non-consensus CKII sites exist in the C terminus of Sp1. This is consistent with phospho-amino acid analysis which indicates that the majority of phosphorylation occurs on serine and not threonine residues (data not shown). Phospho-tryptic analysis comparing the wild type and Thr-579 mutant proteins indicates that residue 579 is phosphorylated. Furthermore, the mutation eliminates the ability of CKII to inhibit the binding of Sp1 to its recognition sitein vitro. Extrapolation of the three-dimensional structure of Sp1 (38Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Google Scholar) from that of Zif-268 (39Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Google Scholar) indicates that Thr-579 likely lies in a position directly opposite the phosphate backbone of the DNA helix. Phosphorylation of this residue would provide a strong charge-charge repulsion, and given that the contribution of the middle zinc finger of Sp1 to total binding activity is thought to be of relatively greater importance than the other two (40Miner J.H. Wold B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2842-2851Google Scholar), this could produce the observed decrease in binding affinity. The Thr-579 residue is the only consensus CKII site in the C-terminal fragment; however, phosphorylation of non-consensus sites has been observed in numerous instances (41Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Google Scholar). The majority of the CKII phosphorylation is on serine residues and appears to be localized in the C-terminal D domain, particularly within a tryptic peptide from aa624 to aa672. This region contains 5 serine and 5 threonine residues. The binding of a specific oligonucleotide to Sp1 blocks almost all CKII-mediated phosphorylation. Due to the location of Thr-579, DNA binding would be expected to block the access of CKII to this site. Inhibition of D domain phosphorylation by DNA binding suggests that some tertiary structure may exist involving both the zinc finger domain and the D domain. Either the CKII sites cluster together in a configuration that places all of these sites in a region where access of the kinase is subject to steric hindrance by the presence of DNA, or DNA binding results in a conformational change which disrupts the CKII sites in the D domain. We have previously observed changes in the phosphorylation state of Sp1 during liver development and regeneration (29Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Google Scholar). CKII has been associated with the control of growth through its ability to phosphorylate c-jun and thus down-regulate the AP-1 complex (35Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. Al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Google Scholar). In addition, disruption of CKII function as a result of parasitic infection or in a CKII transgenic animal results in oncogenic transformation (42Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Google Scholar). All of these observations suggest a role for CKII in growth regulation. The possible involvement of Sp1 in mediating retinoblastoma function (16Kim S.J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Google Scholar, 43Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Google Scholar) and the ability of Sp1 to regulate critical factors in growth regulation such as p21CIP1/WAF1 (26Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Google Scholar) may imply that CKII-mediated regulation of Sp1 is a critical point in controlling withdrawal from the cell cycle as the initial stage of terminal differentiation. Examination of gross CKII subunit levels and phosphatase activity in normal and regenerating rat liver nuclear extracts has not revealed any substantial changes in either activity. Experiments in K562 cells clearly indicate that Sp1 phosphorylation is a dynamic process, involving the active phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Sp1 to establish steady state levels. We have not yet been able to directly establish that CKII is responsible for thisin vivo phosphorylation. PP1 has recently been suggested to modulate Sp1 activity in response to the glucose-mediated activation of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene (45Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Google Scholar). In addition, PP1 activity may be modulated by phosphorylation (46Villa-Moruzzi E. Puntoni F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 863-867Google Scholar) or through its association with proteins such as NIPP-1 (47Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Google Scholar) and p53BP2 (47Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Google Scholar). PP1 activity in the nucleus, as well as PP1α protein, is elevated in rat hepatoma cells (48Saadat M. Mizuno Y. Takizawa N. Kakinoki Y. Rikuchi R. Cancer Lett. 1995; 94: 165-170Google Scholar). It has recently been noted that the subnuclear partitioning of CKII into various fractions is altered during development (49Gruppuso P.A. Boylan J.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 65-72Google Scholar) and regeneration (50Pancetti F. Bosser R. Itarte E. Bachs O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 35-39Google Scholar). It may be that interaction between CKII or PP1 and Sp1 is modulated by subnuclear compartmentalization or that other factors are able to restrict or enhance their interaction. Whatever the mechanism by which overall Sp1 phosphorylation levels are modulated, it does appear to be a critical point in the regulation of cellular function.

On SDS-PAGE, gp-340 showed an apparent molecular mass of 290 kDa in the unreduced state. On gel chromatography under non-dissociating conditions, the apparent molecular mass of gp-340 was >1000 kDa. The presence ofN-linked glycosylation was shown by digestion withN-glycosidase F, which reduced the apparent molecular mass of gp-340 under reducing condition to about 300 kDa. Partial amino acid sequence data showed the presence of scavenger-receptor type domains. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were raised against gp-340, and their specificities were confirmed by Western blotting. The antibodies were used for immunohistochemical localization of gp-340 in the lung, where it was found on the surface of and within alveolar macrophages. Direct binding between gp-340 and SP-D took place at physiological ionic strength, required the presence of calcium, and was not inhibited by maltose. The binding between SP-D and mannan also required the presence of calcium, but this interaction was completely inhibited by maltose. The same binding pattern was seen between gp-340 and recombinant human SP-D composed of the trimeric neck region and three carbohydrate recognition domains. These findings indicate that the binding between gp-340 and SP-D is a protein-protein interaction rather than a lectin-carbohydrate interaction and that the binding to gp-340 takes place via the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D. We conclude that gp-340 is a new member of the scavenger-receptor superfamily and likely to be a truncated form of a receptor for SP-D.

Five collectins have been described, mannan-binding lectin (MBL), conglutinin and collectin-43 (CL-43), which are serum proteins produced by the liver; and lung surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D), which have until recently been described as surfactant-associated proteins synthesized by alveolar type II cells and by non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells but both have now been found to be present in cells lining the gastrointestinal tract (3Rubio S.

Biol. 1995; 12: 13-18Google Scholar). Like the other collectins, SP-D is an oligomeric lectin with subunits composed of three identical polypeptides held together by disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions at the N-terminal ends of the chains. Each polypeptide chain consists of a short N-terminal segment, followed by a collagen-like sequence, a short α-helical sequence, and the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (5Persson A. Chang D.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Google Scholar). The subunits are linked into oligomers consisting of four to eight subunits (9Lu J. Wiedermann H. Holmskov U. Thiel S. Timpl R. Reid K.B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 793-799Google Scholar, 10Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Google Scholar). SP-D has been shown to bind directly to carbohydrates on the surface of various bacteria as well as to influenza A virus and to Cryptococcus neoformans (11Kuan S.F. Rust K. Crouch E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 97-106Google Scholar, 12Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E. White M.R. Eggleton P. Tauber A.I. Chang D. Sastry K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 311-319Google Scholar, 13Schelenz S. Malhotra R. Sim R . B. Holmskov U. Bancroft G.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3360-3366Google Scholar). SP-D also interacts with surfactant-associated phospholipids in vitro, suggesting a role in the turnover of pulmonary surfactant in vivo (14Kuroki Y. Gasa S. Ogasawara Y. Shiratori M. Makita A. Akino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 963-969Google Scholar,15Persson A. Gibbons B.J. Shoemaker J.D. Moxley M.A. Longmore W.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12183-12189Google Scholar). SP-D binds directly to alveolar macrophages (16Miyamura K. Leigh L.E.A. Lu J. Hopkin J. Bernal A.L. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 237-242Google Scholar, 17Kuan S.F. Persson A. Parghi D. Crouch E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 430-436Google Scholar) and is thereby able to enhance the production of oxygen radicals (18Van Iwaarden J.F. Shimizu H. Van Golde P.H.M. Voeller D.R. Van Golde L.M.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 5-8Google Scholar). SP-D can also be internalized by alveolar macrophages in vivo(19Crouch E. Kuan S.F. Persson A. Müller B. von Wichert P. Lung Surfactant: Basic Research in the Pathogenesis of Lung Disorder. Karger, Basel1994: 123-140Google Scholar). However, the receptor responsible for the SP-D binding remains to be defined. Two molecules have so far been found to interact with collectins, and both were first described as receptors for the complement protein C1q. One was found to bind MBL, conglutinin, CL-43, and SP-A, and this receptor is now referred to as the collectin receptor (20Malhotra R. Thiel S. Reid K.B.M. Sim R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 955-959Google Scholar, 21Malhotra R,. Haurum J. Thiel S. Sim R.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1437-1445Google Scholar, 22Holmskov U. Laursen S.B. Malhotra R. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Stuart G.R. Tornøe I. Madsen P.S. Reid K.B.M. Jensenius J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 889-896Google Scholar). This molecule, which has a high degree of homology with calreticulin, has been observed on many cell types, including macrophages and alveolar type II cells. The other receptor is referred to as the C1q receptor with a molecular mass of 126 kDa. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes this cell surface molecule inhibited the MBL-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis (23Tenner A.J. Robinson S.L. Ezekowitz R.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 485-493Google Scholar). However, neither of these receptors has been shown to bind SP-D. In the present paper, we describe the purification and characterization of a 340 kDa glycoprotein obtained from lung lavage from a patient with alveolar proteinosis, and we provide data consistent with this molecule being a secreted form of a putative receptor for SP-D.

Unreduced samples were heated in sample buffer with 90 mm iodoacetamide. Protein bands were detected by silver staining (26Merril C.R. Goldman D. Van-Keuren M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 230-239Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the FAST system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was used. Proteins were separated on 8–14% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradient gels with the discontinuous buffer system and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-gp-340 antibody, 50 ng/ml, or polyclonal rabbit anti-gp-340 antiserum diluted 1/1000) and secondary alkaline-phosphatase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse Ig or alkaline-phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit Ig in TBS/Tw containing 0.5 m NaCl. The membranes were washed and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and potassium 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate. BAL was obtained from a patient suffering from pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Both lungs were lavaged for therapeutic purposes at an interval of one week, using a heat exchanger and a modified perfusion apparatus to improve the efficiency of the lavage. The result was monitored by analysis of total protein content. BAL was also obtained from four patients undergoing lung washings for diagnostic purposes other than alveolar proteinosis. One liter of human BAL was centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min and then at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. The 10,000 × g supernatant was made 5 mm in CaCl2 and 10 mm in Tris and applied to a 50-ml maltose-TSK column. After washing with TBS/E containing 5 mm CaCl2, the column was eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mm maltose. The eluate was applied to a column of rabbit anti-human Ig Sepharose (15 ml) to remove contaminating anti-carbohydrate antibodies and then passed through a Superose 6 FPLC column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with TBS containing 10 mm EDTA and 0.05% (v/v) emulphogene. Purification of gp-340 was performed on a computer-monitored FPLC system (FPLCdirector Version 1.3, Pharmacia). One liter of human BAL was centrifuged at 300 ×g for 10 min. After separation of the cell pellet, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 500 ml of TBS/E containing 10 mm EDTA and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle stirring. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A and applied to a column of Mono-Q Fast Flow (100 ml, Pharmacia), and retained proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing gp-340 were diluted in buffer A, applied to a Resource Q column (1-ml prepacked column, Pharmacia) and eluted with a stepped gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. The gp-340-containing fractions were further separated by gel permeation chromatography on a Superose 6 prepgrade column (1.6 × 57 cm, Pharmacia) with TBS, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The purity of the resulting gp-340 preparation was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography on a Superose 6 column (1 × 30 cm, Pharmacia) and by SDS-PAGE. The amount of gp-340 was estimated by measurement of absorption at 280 nm assuming that E280 of 1 mg/ml for gp-340 was 1.0. The procedures were as described in (27Crawford C. Brown N.R. Willis A.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 575-579Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis was performed directly on purified gp-340 using an Applied Biosystems 420A amino acid analyzer (Perkin-Elmer, Warrington, UK). Attempts at N-terminal sequencing of intact gp-340 were unsuccessful. To obtain internal sequence data, partially pure gp-340 was run on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The two bands of gp-340 (A = upper band and B = lower band) were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel, homogenized in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and digested with trypsin (Modified Trypsin-Sequencing Grade, Promega UK Ltd.) at an estimated enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:20 for 16 h at 37 °C. The supernatants were then run on by reverse phase chromatography using a Brownlee BU-300 VC4 column (100 × 1 mm). Peaks were collected and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Purified gp-340 was also digested directly with trypsin digestion and purification of peptides as above. Sequences similar to gp-340 were searched for in GenBankTM/EBI data bank plus DDBI and Protein Data Bank data bases using the BLAST program. Alignment of multiple sequences were carried out using the Clustal method with PAM250 residue weight table. A recombinant polypeptide composed of the α-helical neck region and the CRD of human SP-D was expressed in Escherichia coli using the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector (Pharmacia) and purified as described in (8Hoppe H-J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Google Scholar). Antisera were raised in rabbits by subcutaneous immunization with an emulsified mixture of equal volumes of gp-340 (approximately 20 μg per dose) and Freund's complete adjuvant (Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark). The rabbits were boosted at 1 month intervals with gp-340 in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Irrelevant antibodies were removed by absorption; the antiserum was incubated with 1/10 volume of normal human serum and with 80 μg of SP-A/ml for 18 h at 4 °C followed by a centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The IgG fraction of the rabbit antiserum against gp-340 was purified on a 1-ml HiTrapTM Protein G column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and the specificity was confirmed by Western blotting. CF1 × BALB/c female mice were immunized with 10 μg of purified gp-340 in 0.25 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, adsorbed onto 1 mg of Al(OH)3 gel (Alhydrogel®, Superfoss, Denmark) per injection. The injections were repeated at intervals of 14 days. Mice with a high antibody titer against gp-340, as determined by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on gp-340 coated microtiter plates, were selected for fusion of spleen cells. Fusions were performed as described by Köhler and Milstein (28Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Google Scholar) and modified by Reading (29Reading C.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 53: 261-291Google Scholar) with the cell line X63Ag8.6.5.3 and with polyethylene glycol 1500 as the fusogen. Hybridoma clones were screened by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on gp-340-coated microtiter plates. Cells from wells with antibodies against gp-340 were recloned three times by the limiting dilution method (30Goding, J. W., Monoclonal Antibodies: Principals and Practice, 1983, Academic Press, New York.Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody selected was of IgG 1 subclass, and its specificity was tested by Western blotting. The amount of N-linked saccharides in gp-340 was evaluated by enzymatic digestion withN-glycosidase F for 18 h at 37 °C using the PGNase F kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) followed by SDS-PAGE. The indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique was used. Briefly, the procedure was as follows. The dried frozen sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min, washed in TBS, preincubated in 2% (w/v) BSA in TBS for 10 min, incubated for 30 min with the monoclonal or polyclonal antibody against gp-340 diluted in 1% (w/v) BSA in TBS, washed with TBS, incubated for 1/2 h with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig (P 447, Dakopatts) or peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (P 448, Dakopatts) diluted 1:75 in TBS, washed with TBS and H2O, incubated with carbazole buffer for 20 min, washed, counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 2 min, and mounted in Aquamount (BDH Limited Poole, UK). Staining was also performed with a monoclonal anti-CD68 antibody as primary antibody (Code M 718, Dakopatts). Conventional staining controls were performed as well as replacing the primary antibody with an unrelated monoclonal antibody of the same subclass as the anti-gp-340 antibody, or preabsorbing the primary polyclonal antibody with highly purified gp-340 . Microtiter plates (Polysorp, Nunc, Kamstrup, Denmark) were coated with gp-340 (300 ng/ml in coating buffer) by overnight incubation. This incubation and all the following steps were carried out in a volume of 100 μl/well and at room temperature, and all washes and incubations were carried out with TBS/Tw containing 5 mm CaCl2 unless otherwise stated. The plates were washed and incubated with 200 μg of human serum albumin (Statens Seruminstitut) in 200 μl of TBS for 2 h. After washing, the plates were incubated with dilutions of SP-D or with SP-D containing 100 mm maltose. As a control, the SP-D was also applied in buffer containing 10 mm EDTA instead of calcium. The same experiments were carried out using rSP-D. The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed. They were then incubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-human SP-D (a generous gift from Dr. Jinhua Lu, Department of Biochemistry, University of Singapore, Singapore) diluted 1:500 in TBS/Tw. After washing, the plates were incubated for 2 h with alkaline-phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit Ig diluted 1:2000. After a final wash, the bound enzyme was estimated by adding 1 mg/ml of para-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt in diethanolamine buffer. The absorbance of the 96 wells was read at 405 nm by means of a multichannel spectrophotometer. During the purification of human SP-D from the 10,000 ×g supernatant from BAL of a patient suffering from alveolar proteinosis, a molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 340 kDa was observed by SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions. When the supernatant was applied to a maltose-TSK column in the presence of calcium, the component was bound and could be eluted with maltose together with SP-D and anti-carbohydrate antibodies. The component could then be separated from SP-D and immunoglobulins by gel permeation chromatography in the presence of EDTA (data not shown). Rechromatography of the recovered component on a maltose-TSK column in the presence of calcium showed no binding, indicating that the initial retention of the component on the column must be mediated by one of the other proteins bound to the maltose. Because of low yields, another purification procedure was developed, utilizing the 10,000 × g pellet from BAL as starting material for ion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. The component was named gp-340 because of its glycoprotein nature and because of its molecular mass of 340 kDa in the reduced state on SDS-PAGE (see below). gp-340 was eluted from the 10,000 × g pellet in the presence of EDTA and purified by ion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. Fig. 1shows the elution profile from ion-exchange on Mono-Q Fast Flow (Fig.1 A), on Resource Q (Fig. 1 B), and the gel permeation chromatography on Superose 6 Prepgrade (Fig. 1 C). Purified gp-340 was analyzed by chromatography on Superose 6 where it emerged close to the void volume, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass >1000 kDa (Fig. 1 D). Approximately 500 μg of gp-340 (estimated by E280) was obtained from 1 liter of washings. Fig. 2 shows a comparison by SDS-PAGE of gp-340 reduced (lane 1), unreduced (lane 2), and reduced after treatment with N-glycosidase F (lane 3). gp-340 showed two closely spaced bands with a mobility corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 340 kDa when reduced and an apparent molecular mass of 290 kDa in its unreduced state. When glycosidase-digested gp-340 was examined on SDS-PAGE in its reduced state, the two closely spaced bands appeared at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 300 kDa. Amino acid sequences of different fragments obtained by tryptic digestion of gp-340 are shown in Fig.3. Peptide 5 obtained from the upper band of gp-340 (band A) was found to have an identical N-terminal sequence to that of peptide 6 obtained from the lower band of gp-340 (band B). The amino acid composition of gp-340 is shown in Table I. The presence of 0.3% hydroxyproline indicated that gp-340 might contain collagen-like sequences. However, gp-340 was not digested by collagenase (data not shown), and the appearance of hydroxyproline in the amino acid composition of gp-340 may be due to small amounts of SP-A or SP-D in the gp-340 preparation.Table IAmino acid composition of gp-340CompositionMole percentAla6.3Cys2.4Asx12.7Glx6.1Phe3.2Gly11.0His2.4Ile3.2Lys4.3Leu8.5MetNDPro6.2Arg6.1Ser10.7Thr6.0Val7.0TrpNDTyr3.4Hyp0.3ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. The specificities of the selected monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against gp-340 was analyzed by Western blots of both purified gp-340 and crude lung lavage separated on SDS-PAGE in the reduced and unreduced state (Fig.4). The monoclonal antibody directed against gp-340 reacted with both bands of 340 kDa equally well in the reduced and unreduced state, and it also reacted with deglycosylated gp-340 (Fig.4 A). The rabbit anti-gp-340 antibody reacted with both bands of 340 kDa, but, in contrast to the monoclonal antibody, it displayed less binding after reduction of the antigen and no binding when the antigen was reduced and deglycosylated (Fig. 4 B). Western blot analysis revealed that the monoclonal antibody also reacted with gp-340 in lung washings from four patients undergoing diagnostic bronchioalveolar lavage for other reasons than alveolar proteinosis (data not shown). Staining of normal human lung revealed gp-340 immunoreactivity on and within the alveolar macrophages (Fig.5). The staining was distinctly granular with both types of antibody. However, staining with the monoclonal antibody was distinctly weaker than that obtained with the polyclonal antibody. Staining of serial sections with monoclonal anti-CD68 antibody identified the gp-340 stained cells as cells belonging to the macrophage cell lineage (data not shown). Staining, absorption, and substitution controls were all negative. In the presence of calcium, human SP-D binds to microtiter plates coated with gp-340 (Fig. 6). The binding was saturable and dependent on the concentration of SP-D and on the amount of gp-340 coated on the plate. In the presence of calcium, human SP-D binds to microtiter plates coated with mannan (Fig. 7 A). The binding was also dependent on the concentration of SP-D and could be totally inhibited by EDTA or by the addition of 100 mmmaltose. The binding of human SP-D to microtiter plates coated with gp-340 was also inhibited by EDTA (Fig. 7 B), but, when 100 mm maltose was added in the presence of calcium, no inhibition of binding was observed.Figure 7Effect of maltose and EDTA on the binding of SP-D to gp-340 and mannan. A, mannan-coated microtiter plates were incubated with serial dilutions of SP-D in the presence of calcium (•-•), calcium and 100 mm maltose (▴-▴), or with 10 mm EDTA (▪-▪). B, gp-340-coated microtiter plates were incubated with serial dilutions of SP-D in the presence of calcium (•-•), calcium and 100 mm maltose (▴-▴), or with 10 mm EDTA (▪-▪). Bound SP-D was detected by means of rabbit anti-human SP-D, followed by alkaline-phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit Ig and substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Like native SP-D, rSP-D also bound mannan in the presence of calcium, and the binding was inhibited by EDTA or by the addition of 100 mm maltose (Fig. 8 A). rSP-D also bound gp-340 in the presence of calcium, and the binding was inhibited by EDTA (Fig. 8 B). When 100 mm maltose was added in the presence of calcium, only minor inhibition of binding was seen. The IgG fraction of the polyclonal antiserum against gp-340 completely abolished the SP-D binding to solid phase gp-340 when plates coated with gp-340 were incubated with the IgG fraction prior to addition of SP-D (data not shown). The present report describes the identification and purification of an SP-D-binding protein from BAL obtained from a patient with alveolar proteinosis. The SP-D-binding molecule has provisionally been termed gp-340 since it is a glycoprotein of apparent molecular mass of 340 kDa on SDS-PAGE. In contrast to the molecular mass of 340 kDa seen in the reduced state, gp-340 showed an apparent molecular mass of 290 kDa when analyzed in the unreduced state. This difference suggests that intra-molecular disulfide bonds have been broken by reduction. gp-340 always appeared as two closely spaced but distinct bands. Since gp-340 may be a membrane protein requiring proteolytic cleavage for release from the surface of macrophages, the difference in size could be explained by two different, closely spaced cleavage sites within each polypeptide chain of gp-340. The apparent molecular weight of native gp-340 was estimated by gel filtration to be greater than 1000 kDa. This suggests that gp-340 is either a very extended molecule, thereby leading to an overestimation of its molecular mass on gel filtration, or that it exists as an oligomer of identical or closely related non-covalently linked polypeptide chains. Partial amino acid sequences showed the presence of scavenger-receptor type domains in both bands A and B, and identical sequences were obtained from the two bands. The different sizes of the components of these bands could also be due to alternative splicing of the molecule since size heterogeneity due to alternative splicing has been described for closely related members of the scavenger receptor superfamily (31Law S.K. Micklem K.J. Shaw J.M. Zhang X.P. Dong Y. Willis A.C. Mason D.Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2320-2325Google Scholar). The spacing of the cysteines in the domains showed that gp-340 belongs to group B of the scavenger-receptor superfamily (32Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Google Scholar). Members of this group are all transmembrane proteins and many of them are located on immunocompetent cells such as B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes or macrophages. Although no direct function has been described for these molecules, a role in the primary immune system has been suggested on the basis of their localization on such cells (32Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Google Scholar). Three members of the scavenger-receptor superfamily, bovine gallbladder mucin, Ebnerin, and CRP-ductin-alpha, showed an extremely high homology with gp-340, and an alignment between domains from these molecules and peptides 1–4, 6–7 from gp-340 is shown in Fig. 9. Bovine gallbladder mucin is a densely glycosylated molecule which is the primary secretory product of the gallbladder epithelium (33Nunes D.P. Keates A.C. Afdhal N.H. Offner G.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 41-48Google Scholar). Four SRCR domains are found in bovine gallbladder mucin along with short tandem repeating sequences found in mucins. Ebnerin, which was cloned from a rat taste bud gland cDNA library (34Li X.-J. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17674-17679Google Scholar), is also a mosaic protein containing four SRCR, two bone morphogenic domains, a zona pellucida domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. CRP-ductin-alpha (35Cheng H. Bjerknes M. Chen H. Anat. Rec. 1996; 244: 327-343Google Scholar) has an overall domain organization similar to Ebnerin, but it has eight SRCR domains instead of four and five bone morphogenic domains instead of two. The cDNA of CRP-ductin-alpha, which is the largest of the three molecules, predicts a protein of 2083 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 227 kDa and shows an apparent molecular mass of 260 kDa in the reduced state on SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of reduced and deglycosylated gp-340 was estimated to be 300 kDa using reduced and unreduced fibronectin (molecular mass = 220 kDa and 440 kDa, respectively), purified α-2 macroglobulin-receptor (molecular mass = 500 kDa, a gift from Søren Moestrup, Aarhus University, Denmark), together with standard molecular weight markers (data not shown). A very high degree of homology was found both between the SRCR domains of mouse CRP-ductin-alpha and bovine gallbladder mucin and peptides 1–7 of gp-340 (100% amino acid sequence identity between SRCR 1, 3, and 4 of bovine gallbladder mucin, and with SRCR 3 of CRP-ductin-alpha and the 19 amino acid residues in peptide 6 of gp-340) (Fig. 9). However, as the same high degree of homology is seen on comparison of the different proteins of SRCRs and between species, and, in view of the size difference between gp-340 and the gall-bladder mucin, Ebnerin, and the CRP-ductin-alpha proteins, it seems unlikely that gp-340 is the human analogue of these proteins. Moreover, CRP-ductin-alpha mRNA was only expressed in cells lining the small and large intestine, the pancreatic duct system, and the larger hepatic ducts, and no CRP-ductin-alpha mRNA was detected in the lung (35Cheng H. Bjerknes M. Chen H. Anat. Rec. 1996; 244: 327-343Google Scholar). Purified gp-340 was used to immunize mice and rabbits, and the resulting monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used for the immunohistochemical localization of gp-340. In the lung, both antibodies revealed a distinct granular staining of alveolar macrophages, with the most intense staining at the cell membrane, but in some cells, organelles considered to be phagolysosomes were also stained. This staining pattern is in agreement with what would be expected for a receptor for SP-D. It has earlier been shown that SP-D is found in the endocytic compartment of rat and human alveolar macrophages, and a receptor for SP-D will probably be internalized together with SP-D and material bound via the CRD of SP-D (19Crouch E. Kuan S.F. Persson A. Müller B. von Wichert P. Lung Surfactant: Basic Research in the Pathogenesis of Lung Disorder. Karger, Basel1994: 123-140Google Scholar, 36Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Kuroki Y. Ogasawara Y. Van Golde L.M.G. Geuze H.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1589-1597Google Scholar). It is also worth noting that, to date, all the proteins containing SRCRs of type B are known to be membrane bound, and both CRP-ductin and Ebnerin are known to have both a membrane-bound form and a free form due to either cleavage of the molecules or alternative splicing of the molecules (34Li X.-J. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17674-17679Google Scholar, 35Cheng H. Bjerknes M. Chen H. Anat. Rec. 1996; 244: 327-343Google Scholar) Direct binding of SP-D to purified gp-340 was observed at physiological ionic strength. The binding was saturable, and dependent on the presence of calcium ions. No inhibition was observed on the addition of the disaccharide maltose. In contrast, binding of mannan to SP-D was completely inhibited by maltose. The same binding pattern was seen between rSP-D (consisting of the neck-region and CRD of SP-D) and gp-340. Maltose would be expected to inhibit any binding of the CRD of SP-D to carbohydrates on gp-340. The result thus suggests that the binding between SP-D and gp-340 is a protein-protein interaction rather than a lectin-carbohydrate interaction, and the fact that the rSP-D is also bound shows that the binding site is located within the neck-CRD structure. The crystal structure of the CRD of rat MBL-A complexed with an oligosaccharide revealed two calcium binding sites (37Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourmem R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Google Scholar, 38Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Google Scholar). The calcium ion in site 2 forms coordination bonds with the carbohydrate ligand while no such bonds were found for the calcium ion in site 1. All the amino acid residues involved in calcium and carbohydrate binding in rat MBL-A are present in human SP-D. No function of the first calcium binding site has so far been suggested for any CRD. We, therefore, suggest that this calcium binding site may be important for recognizing ligands other than carbohydrates. It is interesting to note that CD72, which has one extracellular CRD, is the ligand for CD5 which has three extracellular SRCRs (39Van de Velde H. von Hoegen I. Luo W. Parnes J.R. Thielemans K. Nature. 1991; 351: 662-665Google Scholar). It has earlier been shown that the direct binding of SP-D to alveolar macrophages (and neutrophil granulocytes) can be completely abolished by maltose, indicating that SP-D in these experiments bound to the cells via a carbohydrate-lectin interaction (19Crouch E. Kuan S.F. Persson A. Müller B. von Wichert P. Lung Surfactant: Basic Research in the Pathogenesis of Lung Disorder. Karger, Basel1994: 123-140Google Scholar). SP-D also enhances the respiratory burst in rat alveolar macrophages (18Van Iwaarden J.F. Shimizu H. Van Golde P.H.M. Voeller D.R. Van Golde L.M.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 5-8Google Scholar), a reaction which was also inhibited by carbohydrates. These observations suggest that more than one ligand or receptor for SP-D is present on alveolar macrophages. We conclude that gp-340 is the soluble form of a molecule that binds SP-D in a calcium-dependent manner. The gp-340 molecule is thus a potential receptor for SP-D that has been shed or cleaved from the surface of the alveolar macrophages. We thank Mr. Ole Nielsen and Annette Kliem for skilled technical assistance."

FS-288 exhibits high affinity for cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, whereas FS-315 shows low affinity. To understand the physiological role of cell-associated FS, we investigated the binding of activin to cell-associated FS and its behavior on the cell surface using primary cultured rat pituitary cells. Affinity cross-linking experiments using125I-activin A demonstrated that activin bound to rat pituitary cells via FS as well as to their receptors on the cell surface. FS-288 promoted the binding of activin A to the cell surface more markedly than FS-315. When the cells were incubated with125I-activin A in the presence of FS-288, significant degradation of activin A was observed, and this was dependent on the FS-288 concentration. This activin degradation was abolished by heparan sulfate, chloroquine, and several lysosomal enzyme inhibitors. Moreover, FS-288 stimulated cellular uptake of activin A, whereas chloroquine suppressed lysosomal degradation following internalization, as demonstrated by microscopic autoradiography. These results suggest that cell-associated FS-288 accelerates the uptake of activin A into pituitary cells, leading to increased degradation by lysosomal enzymes, and thus plays a role in the activin clearance system.

Inhibin and follistatin inhibit, and activin stimulates, FSH release from the pituitary both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibin and activin are structurally related and belong to the transforming growth factor β superfamily. Both are disulfide-linked dimers; inhibin is composed of α- and β-subunits, whereas activin is a dimer of the inhibin β-subunit. Two forms of inhibin (A and B) and three forms of activin (A, AB, and B) have been isolated from ovarian follicular fluid. These forms arise because of the existence of two homologous but distinct β-subunits, called βA and βB (5Vale W.W. Rivier J. Vaughan J. McClintock R. Corrigan A. Woo W. Karr D. Spiess J.

Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 388-396Google Scholar).In addition to stimulation of FSH synthesis and release, various biological roles of activins outside the reproductive system have been extensively investigated. Almost all functions associated with activins can now be interpreted by their proliferative, antiproliferative, and differentiative activities. In view of the widespread expression of activin subunits in both the embryo and the adult (13Meunier H. Rivier C. Evans R., M. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 247-251Google Scholar), as is also the case with activin receptors, it is not too surprising that activin effects have been noted in a multitude of diverse tissues and cell types. Activins exert their effects through specific binding to two different types of receptors, called types I (molecular mass ∼53 kDa) and II (molecular mass ∼70 kDa) that have recently been cloned. Types I and II receptors, which belong to the serine/threonine kinase receptor family, form heteromeric receptor complexes that are essential for signal transduction after ligand binding, but little is yet known about the events immediately following receptor activation (14Mathews L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 310-325Google Scholar).The activity of FS resembles that of inhibin, but its structure is quite different because FS is a glycosylated single-chain protein (7Ueno N. Ling Y. Ying S.-Y. Esch F. Shimasaki S. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8282-8286Google Scholar). There are two forms of FS, resulting from alternative mRNA splicing and hence two different mRNAs that encode FS-315 and its carboxyl-terminal truncated homologue FS-288 (consisting of 315 and 288 amino acids, respectively) (15Shimasaki S. Koga M. Esch F.S. Cooksey K. Mercado M. Koba A. Ueno N. Ying S.-Y. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4218-4222Google Scholar). Because of the widespread distribution of FS mRNA in extragonadal tissues, physiological roles of FS other than FSH suppression have been predicted (16Shimasaki S. Koga M. Buscaglia M.L. Simmons D.M. Bicsak T.A. Ling N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 651-659Google Scholar). In line with these expectations, we previously demonstrated that FS is an activin-binding protein (17Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H. Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Google Scholar) and neutralizes the diverse activin bioactivities in various systems by stoichiometrically forming inactive complexes with activins (18Kogawa K. Nakamura T. Sugino K. Takio K. Titani K. Sugino H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1434-1440Google Scholar). We have also shown that FS is capable of associating with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans and proposed that FS participates in the regulation of the multiple actions of activin (19Nakamura T. Sugino K. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19432-19437Google Scholar). The affinities of the two FS proteins, purified from porcine ovaries, for activins were demonstrated to be essentially similar. However, the affinity of FS-288 for heparan sulfate side chains was found to be much higher than that of FS-315 (20Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Nakamura T. Takio K. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15579-15587Google Scholar). The widespread and similar tissue distributions of both FS and the β-subunit mRNAs imply that FS and activin proteins are produced locally and that FS acts as a local modulator of activin activity. This assumption is supported by the findings that activin binding to FS inhibits the effect of activin on granulosa (21Nakamura T. Hasegawa Y. Sugino K. Kogawa K. Titani K. Sugino H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 103-109Google Scholar), embryonal carcinoma (22Hashimoto M. Nakamura T. Inoue S. Kondo T. Yamada R. Eto Y. Sugino H. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7203-7206Google Scholar), Xenopus animal explant (23Asashima M. Nakano H. Uchiyama H. Sugino H. Nakamura T. Eto Y. Ejima D. Nishimatsu S. Ueno N. Kinoshita K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To improve understanding of the role of FS in the local control of activin function, the association of FS with cell-surface proteoglycans could be of importance.The pituitary has been identified as the production site of a number of cell growth factors and peptide hormones, including activins and FS. Some of these have been shown to locally modulate pituitary function. Therefore, a study was undertaken to investigate the physiological significance of the activin-FS-glycosaminoglycan interaction in cultured pituitary cells. The results demonstrate that cell-associated FS-288 (carboxyl-terminal truncated FS) accelerates the endocytotic internalization of activin into pituitary cells leading to its degradation by lysosomal enzymes. Cell-associated FS, therefore, plays a role in clearance of the activin signal from the cell surface.DISCUSSIONFS binds stoichiometrically to activin to form an inactive complex, which results in blockade of various activin bioactivities. However, the physiological significance of this complex formation is not fully understood. Recently, de Winter et al. (33De Winter J.P. ten Dike P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Vershueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Google Scholar) demonstrated that the preincubation of radioiodinated activin A with FS completely abolished binding to type II activin receptors and consequently binding to type I receptors and proposed that FS can neutralize activin bioactivity by interfering with activin binding to type II receptors. Our affinity cross-linking experiments also showed this inhibition of activin binding to its receptors on rat pituitary cells (Fig. 1). This may be explained by assuming that FS masks the as yet unidentified receptor binding domain of the activin molecule, thus preventing activin from transducing its signal in responsive cells. Furthermore, in the present study, we investigated the importance of FS adhesiveness to the cell surface in its role in controlling activin bioavailability. The two FS isoforms studied showed different degrees of adhesion to rat pituitary cell surfaces in the cross-linking experiment; the intensity of the FS-288 band (the COOH-terminal truncated form) was much stronger than that of FS-315 (full-length form) (Fig. 1). More direct evidence was obtained as shown in Fig. 2; FS-288 showed a higher affinity for the rat pituitary cell surface than FS-315. As previously observed in rat granulosa cells (19Nakamura T. Sugino K. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19432-19437Google Scholar), heparitinase treatment of pituitary cells resulted in significant suppression of FS-288 binding to the cell, whereas treatment with chondroitinase ABC had no effect. Furthermore, the binding of FS-288 to pituitary cells was significantly reduced after cells had been cultured in the presence of sodium chlorate, which is a potent inhibitor of protein and carbohydrate sulfation (34Baeuerle P. Huttner W.B. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Google Scholar). 2O. Hashimoto, unpublished data. These findings clearly support our idea that FS-288 binds mainly to the heparan sulfate side chains of proteoglycans on the cell surface.Significant binding of radioiodinated activin A to pituitary cell surfaces was observed only in the presence of FS (Fig. 5). As expected, FS-288 markedly promoted this binding and had a greater effect than FS-315. Recently, Sugahara 3K. Sugahara, unpublished data. found that the smallest heparin oligosaccharides that could be recognized by FS-288 was a dodecasaccharide, suggesting that FS-288 distinguishes certain glycosaminoglycan configurations.When incubated with pituitary cells in the presence of FS-288, activin A in the medium appeared to be trapped by cell-associated FS-288. Binding to heparan sulfate side chains via FS-288 on the cell surfaces thus appears necessary for the first step of activin A degradation. This idea was further supported by our finding that activin A is not degraded in heparitinase- and sodium chlorate-treated pituitary cells, to which it cannot bind.2 After being captured on the cell surface, activin A may, together with FS-288 and proteoglycans, be ingested by endocytotic vesicles that fuse with primary lysosomes. Most of the vesicle contents were found to be hydrolyzed into small breakdown products and secreted to the exterior. There is little doubt that activin A is broken down by such an endocytotic degradation process, because various inhibitors of each stage of this process blocked activin A degradation; the inhibitors tested included chloroquine and several lysosomal protease inhibitors. Monensin, an endosome lysosome fusion inhibitor, also almost completely inhibited degradation (data not shown). As this process was visualized (Fig. 8), activin A was collected within vesicles, which were probably lysosomes because chloroquine prevented the latter half of the degradation process. As is the case with radioiodinated activin A, the proteolytic degradation of 125I-labeled FS-288 was also observed in pituitary cells (data not shown). On the other hand, the complex between FS-315 and activin A showed low affinity for cell surfaces, resulting in the avoidance of endocytotic degradation by these complexes. Indeed, these complexes were found to be relatively stable under our incubation conditions for at least 48 h (data not shown). Activin might select FS, which adheres with difficulty to cell surfaces, as its binding partner and could therefore defend itself against endocytotic internalization followed by proteolytic attack. The anterior pituitary gland consists of many different cell types, classified on the basis of size, shape, and the hormone secreted. Therefore, it is also important to identify the type of pituitary cells that undertake the degradation process.As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, FS-288 was approximately twice as effective as FS-315 in assisting degradation of 125I-activin A, and binding of FS-288 to the cells was more than 10 times higher than that of FS-315 (Fig. 2). There is no direct evidence to explain these phenomena clearly, but there are several possible explanations. As described in our previous paper (20Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Nakamura T. Takio K. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15579-15587Google Scholar), the majority of FS isolated from porcine ovaries is FS-303, which is thought to be derived from FS-315 by proteolytic cleavage of the 12 COOH-terminal amino acids and shows moderate affinity for cell surfaces. During incubation of FS-315 with pituitary cells, proteolytic degradation of the COOH-terminal portion of FS-315 may occur, and the resulting COOH-terminal truncated FS becomes attached to cells so that it can be degraded by endocytosis. Another possibility is that 125I-activin A may be more effectively degraded when it binds to FS-315.The number of growth factors and cytokines discovered to bind to heparin and heparan sulfate is increasing steadily, and the list includes fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin-3, pleiotrophin, hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and midkine, among others. On the basis of our present results, we speculate that, like the activin A·FS-288 complex, these growth factors bind to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, become internalized, and are eventually degraded in lysosomes. In fact, we found that125I-basic FGF bound to cultured rat pituitary cells in a concentration-dependent manner and that its intracellular degradation was time-dependent. 4T. Nakamura, unpublished data. Therefore, it is conceivable that endocytotic degradation is a common mechanism for eliminating signaling molecules from cell surfaces.It is well documented that the interaction between FGF and heparin-like molecules in the extracellular matrix is important for various biological functions, such as protection of this factor against proteolytic degradation and regulating its concentration on cell surfaces. The role of heparin-like molecules in the signal transduction of FGF is noteworthy; binding of basic FGF to its receptor requires prior binding either to the heparan sulfate side chains of cell-surface proteoglycans or to free heparin to present the ligand to the receptor (35Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar). De Winter et al. (33De Winter J.P. ten Dike P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Vershueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Google Scholar) attempted to determine whether cell surface-bound FS-288 presents activin A to the activin receptors on human erythroleukemic K562 cells and found that FS-288 and the activin A·type IIA receptor complex were not co-precipitated by an anti-type IIA activin receptor antibody, suggesting that, unlike basic FGF, cell surface-associated FS cannot present ligands to signaling receptors. Judging from these results, FS appears to be nothing more than a negative regulator for activin, its function being to form an inactive complex with activin and thereby neutralize its activity. There are some situations in which FS traps activin on the cell-surface heparan sulfate and leads to endocytotic degradation. However, taking these findings together, we hypothesize that endocytotic degradation of growth factors via cell-surface heparan sulfate is necessary to erase their signals from cell surfaces when they become excessive and thus useless. It has been established that the binding of a signaling ligand to its receptor stimulates a biological response and triggers a sequence of events leading to cellular desensitization to the ligand to regulate the responsiveness of the target cell to the ligand. We propose that, in addition to such receptor-mediated endocytosis, there must be a scavenger mechanism for clearing signaling molecules away from their target cell surfaces.

The two FS isoforms studied showed different degrees of adhesion to rat pituitary cell surfaces in the cross-linking experiment; the intensity of the FS-288 band (the COOH-terminal truncated form) was much stronger than that of FS-315 (full-length form) (Fig. 1). More direct evidence was obtained as shown in Fig. 2; FS-288 showed a higher affinity for the rat pituitary cell surface than FS-315. As previously observed in rat granulosa cells (19Nakamura T. Sugino K. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19432-19437Google Scholar), heparitinase treatment of pituitary cells resulted in significant suppression of FS-288 binding to the cell, whereas treatment with chondroitinase ABC had no effect. Furthermore, the binding of FS-288 to pituitary cells was significantly reduced after cells had been cultured in the presence of sodium chlorate, which is a potent inhibitor of protein and carbohydrate sulfation (34Baeuerle P. Huttner W.B. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Google Scholar). 2O. Hashimoto, unpublished data. These findings clearly support our idea that FS-288 binds mainly to the heparan sulfate side chains of proteoglycans on the cell surface.Significant binding of radioiodinated activin A to pituitary cell surfaces was observed only in the presence of FS (Fig. 5). As expected, FS-288 markedly promoted this binding and had a greater effect than FS-315. Recently, Sugahara 3K. Sugahara, unpublished data. found that the smallest heparin oligosaccharides that could be recognized by FS-288 was a dodecasaccharide, suggesting that FS-288 distinguishes certain glycosaminoglycan configurations.When incubated with pituitary cells in the presence of FS-288, activin A in the medium appeared to be trapped by cell-associated FS-288. Binding to heparan sulfate side chains via FS-288 on the cell surfaces thus appears necessary for the first step of activin A degradation. This idea was further supported by our finding that activin A is not degraded in heparitinase- and sodium chlorate-treated pituitary cells, to which it cannot bind.2 After being captured on the cell surface, activin A may, together with FS-288 and proteoglycans, be ingested by endocytotic vesicles that fuse with primary lysosomes. Most of the vesicle contents were found to be hydrolyzed into small breakdown products and secreted to the exterior. There is little doubt that activin A is broken down by such an endocytotic degradation process, because various inhibitors of each stage of this process blocked activin A degradation; the inhibitors tested included chloroquine and several lysosomal protease inhibitors. Monensin, an endosome lysosome fusion inhibitor, also almost completely inhibited degradation (data not shown). As this process was visualized (Fig. 8), activin A was collected within vesicles, which were probably lysosomes because chloroquine prevented the latter half of the degradation process. As is the case with radioiodinated activin A, the proteolytic degradation of 125I-labeled FS-288 was also observed in pituitary cells (data not shown). On the other hand, the complex between FS-315 and activin A showed low affinity for cell surfaces, resulting in the avoidance of endocytotic degradation by these complexes. Indeed, these complexes were found to be relatively stable under our incubation conditions for at least 48 h (data not shown). Activin might select FS, which adheres with difficulty to cell surfaces, as its binding partner and could therefore defend itself against endocytotic internalization followed by proteolytic attack. The anterior pituitary gland consists of many different cell types, classified on the basis of size, shape, and the hormone secreted. Therefore, it is also important to identify the type of pituitary cells that undertake the degradation process.As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, FS-288 was approximately twice as effective as FS-315 in assisting degradation of 125I-activin A, and binding of FS-288 to the cells was more than 10 times higher than that of FS-315 (Fig. 2). There is no direct evidence to explain these phenomena clearly, but there are several possible explanations. As described in our previous paper (20Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Nakamura T. Takio K. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15579-15587Google Scholar), the majority of FS isolated from porcine ovaries is FS-303, which is thought to be derived from FS-315 by proteolytic cleavage of the 12 COOH-terminal amino acids and shows moderate affinity for cell surfaces. During incubation of FS-315 with pituitary cells, proteolytic degradation of the COOH-terminal portion of FS-315 may occur, and the resulting COOH-terminal truncated FS becomes attached to cells so that it can be degraded by endocytosis. Another possibility is that 125I-activin A may be more effectively degraded when it binds to FS-315.The number of growth factors and cytokines discovered to bind to heparin and heparan sulfate is increasing steadily, and the list includes fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin-3, pleiotrophin, hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and midkine, among others. On the basis of our present results, we speculate that, like the activin A·FS-288 complex, these growth factors bind to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, become internalized, and are eventually degraded in lysosomes. In fact, we found that125I-basic FGF bound to cultured rat pituitary cells in a concentration-dependent manner and that its intracellular degradation was time-dependent. 4T. Nakamura, unpublished data. Therefore, it is conceivable that endocytotic degradation is a common mechanism for eliminating signaling molecules from cell surfaces.It is well documented that the interaction between FGF and heparin-like molecules in the extracellular matrix is important for various biological functions, such as protection of this factor against proteolytic degradation and regulating its concentration on cell surfaces. The role of heparin-like molecules in the signal transduction of FGF is noteworthy; binding of basic FGF to its receptor requires prior binding either to the heparan sulfate side chains of cell-surface proteoglycans or to free heparin to present the ligand to the receptor (35Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar). De Winter et al. (33De Winter J.P. ten Dike P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Vershueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Google Scholar) attempted to determine whether cell surface-bound FS-288 presents activin A to the activin receptors on human erythroleukemic K562 cells and found that FS-288 and the activin A·type IIA receptor complex were not co-precipitated by an anti-type IIA activin receptor antibody, suggesting that, unlike basic FGF, cell surface-associated FS cannot present ligands to signaling receptors. Judging from these results, FS appears to be nothing more than a negative regulator for activin, its function being to form an inactive complex with activin and thereby neutralize its activity. There are some situations in which FS traps activin on the cell-surface heparan sulfate and leads to endocytotic degradation. However, taking these findings together, we hypothesize that endocytotic degradation of growth factors via cell-surface heparan sulfate is necessary to erase their signals from cell surfaces when they become excessive and thus useless. It has been established that the binding of a signaling ligand to its receptor stimulates a biological response and triggers a sequence of events leading to cellular desensitization to the ligand to regulate the responsiveness of the target cell to the ligand. We propose that, in addition to such receptor-mediated endocytosis, there must be a scavenger mechanism for clearing signaling molecules away from their target cell surfaces. FS binds stoichiometrically to activin to form an inactive complex, which results in blockade of various activin bioactivities. However, the physiological significance of this complex formation is not fully understood. Recently, de Winter et al. (33De Winter J.P. ten Dike P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Vershueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Google Scholar) demonstrated that the preincubation of radioiodinated activin A with FS completely abolished binding to type II activin receptors and consequently binding to type I receptors and proposed that FS can neutralize activin bioactivity by interfering with activin binding to type II receptors. Our affinity cross-linking experiments also showed this inhibition of activin binding to its receptors on rat pituitary cells (Fig. 1). This may be explained by assuming that FS masks the as yet unidentified receptor binding domain of the activin molecule, thus preventing activin from transducing its signal in responsive cells.

The [3H]thymidine incorporation in A7r5 overexpressed with PKC δ (DVs) was suppressed to 37.1 ± 16.3% (mean ± S.D.) of the level in control or A7r5 transfected with vector alone (EVs). The reduction of [3H]thymidine incorporation was strongly correlated with overexpressed PKC levels. Moreover, transient transfection of a dominant negative mutant of PKC δ restored the reduced proliferation in DVs. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that DVs were arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Expression of cyclins D1 and E and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation were reduced, while the protein levels of p27 were elevated in DVs as compared with EVs. There were no significant differences in the expression of c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, cyclin D2, D3, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and p21 among the clones.

In VSMC, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to regulate cell differentiation and proliferation as well as modulate agonist-stimulated phospholipid turnover and increase the contractile force (3Huang C.-L. Ives H.E. Nature. 1987; 329: 849-850Google Scholar, 4Lee M.W. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C659-C678Google Scholar, 5Andrea J.E. Walsh M.P. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 585-595Google Scholar).PKC is a complex family including three types of isozymes (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar, 7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar). The first group is the conventional PKCs (cPKC) (α, βI, βII, γ), which are Ca2+-dependent and activated by phorbol esters. The second is the novel PKCs (nPKC) (δ, ε, η, θ, μ), which are also activated by phorbol esters but in a Ca2+-independent manner. The third is the atypical PKCs (ζ, λ/ι), which are activated in a phosphatidylserine-dependent but Ca2+- or phorbol ester-independent manner (4Lee M.W. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C659-C678Google Scholar, 7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar, 8Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Google Scholar). The different PKC isozymes are thought to have distinct functions regarding phosphorylation of specific substrate proteins (7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar). Evidence accumulated to date suggests that each PKC isozyme has a distinct role in cell proliferation. For example, PKC δ, a major isozyme ubiqitously expressed in most mammalian cells, was reported to inhibit growth and induce differentiation in fibroblasts (9Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Google Scholar, 10Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Google Scholar). PKC α was also reported to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation in melanoma cells (11Gruber J.R. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13356-13360Google Scholar), while PKC ε was shown to induce cell growth (10Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Google Scholar, 12Han E.K. Cacace A.M. Sgambato A. Weinstein I.B. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2423-2428Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which individual PKC isozymes control cell proliferation.We found that PKC δ was expressed abundantly in rat aorta and rat VSMC, but the physiological role of PKC δ in VSMC and the signaling events leading from it remains to be elucidated. In this study, we first demonstrated the role of PKC δ in VSMC growth and the cellular mechanism involved. The cell cycle was arrested in the G1phase in PKC δ-overexpressing VSMC. The inhibition of cell proliferation by PKC δ was associated with suppression of G1 cyclin expression and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylation.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we first showed that PKC δ suppressed VSMC proliferation, which was closely associated with inhibition of G1/S transition and expression of G1 cyclins (cyclin D1 and cyclin E).PKC δ Suppresses Proliferation of VSMCWe successfully established a VSMC line in which PKC δ was overexpressed and found that PKC δ had a profound inhibitory effect on VSMC proliferation. Using representative clones (DVs and EVs), we found that total PDBu binding activities, which were up-regulated by PKC δ transfection, were inversely correlated to the levels of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. Furthermore, dominant negative PKC δ compromised the inhibitory effect of overexpressed PKC δ on DNA synthesis. An inhibitory role of PKC δ in the cell proliferation was also reported in fibroblast (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar, 12Han E.K. Cacace A.M. Sgambato A. Weinstein I.B. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2423-2428Google Scholar). Taken together with these observations, PKC δ appears to be an antimitogenic signaling molecule. However, the cell cycle regulators governed by PKC δ might be specific in cell species. In VSMC overexpressed with PKC δ, cell cycle was delayed or arrested in the G1 phase, while in the Chinese hamster ovary cell, Watanabe et al. (23Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K. Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Google Scholar) reported that PKC δ arrested the cell cycle at G2/M but not G1/S transition.Expression of PKC δ is shown to be regulated by cell density in NIH 3T3 cells (29Lehel C. Olah Z. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4761-4766Google Scholar) and C6 glioma cells (30Moreton K. Turner R. Blake N. Paton A. Groome N. Rumsby M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 33-38Google Scholar). Also in A7r5, PKC δ mRNA levels, but not PKC α, were significantly up-regulated by cell confluency (data not shown) suggesting that PKC δ is involved in signaling from cell-cell interaction. This idea may be supported by the observation that PKC δ-overexpressing cells ceased growing at much lower cell density than control cells. It will be important to elucidate the physiological stimuli, including cell-cell interaction, and their signaling cascades leading to PKC δ expression.Cell Cycle Regulation by PKC δPKC has been shown to be involved in PDGF-induced expression of the c-fos and c-myc genes (31Tsuda T. Hamamori Y. Yamashita T. Fukumoto Y. Takai Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 39-42Google Scholar, 32Kaibuchi K. Tsuda T. Kikuchi A. Tanimoto T. Yamashita T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1187-1192Google Scholar). Hirai et al. (9Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Google Scholar) also demonstrated that in NIH 3T3 cells PKC δ activates AP1/Jun transcription factor suggesting that these early responsive genes may mediate the function of PKC δ. However, we observed no changes in mRNA levels of c-fos, c-jun, or c-myc following PDGF stimulation in PKC δ-overexpressing VSMC, although we did not measure the transcriptional activity of AP1/Jun or Myc/Max. Thus, PKC δ may suppress the growth of VSMC downstream of these early responsive genes.We clearly demonstrated that phosphorylation of pRb and PDGF-stimulated expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, but not cdk2, cdk4, cyclin D2, or cyclin D3, were markedly suppressed in PKC δ-overexpressed VSMC. Expression of cyclin D and E and phosphorylation of the pRb family are indispensable for the progression of the G1 phase and for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle in mammalian cells (33Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Google Scholar, 34Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar, 35Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Google Scholar). Although we did not measure cyclin D/cdk4 and cyclin E/cdk2 kinase activities, down-regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E proteins may result in the abrogation of their associated kinase activities and pRb phosphorylation. Cyclin/cdk activities are also inhibited by cdk inhibitors such as p21 and p27 (27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Google Scholar, 28Hunter T. Cell. 1993; 75: 839-841Google Scholar). The protein level of p27, but not p21, was elevated in PKC δ-overexpressing VSMC. Thus, PKC δ suppressed cyclin D1 and cyclin E and up-regulated p27, and this may have led to abrogation of pRb phosphorylation and cell cycle progression.Phorbol ester has been shown to have a stimulatory (36Sewing A. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Schalk C. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 545-554Google Scholar), an inhibitory (37Bianchi S. Fabiani S. Muratori M. Arnold A. Sakaguchi K. Miki T.

However, which PKC isozyme is involved in the regulation of cyclin D1 expression has yet to be determined. We first directly demonstrated that PKC δ could suppress cyclin D1 expression in VSMC. It is of interest to determine how PKC δ regulates cyclin D1 expression in VSMC. In this study we showed that the regulation of the level of cyclin D1 protein by PKC δ was associated with its mRNA level (Fig. 6). In addition, the half-life of cyclin D1 mRNA was not affected by PKC δ transfection, suggesting that mRNA levels for cyclin D1 are subjected to transcriptional control by PKC δ. We also observed that the transcription of cyclin D1 was regulated through de novoprotein synthesis, which was in agreement with a previous report (39Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Google Scholar). PKC δ may regulate cyclin D1 transcription via this newly synthesized protein, since treatment of EV6 and DV9 cells with cycloheximide suppressed cyclin D1 mRNA induction by PDGF to the same level (data not shown).The mechanism of the suppression of cyclin E protein and mRNA by PKC δ is not clear. It is known that cyclin E is regulated by a transcription factor, E2F (40Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Google Scholar, 41DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Google Scholar), whose activity is controlled by phosphorylation of pRb (34Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar). Thus, abrogation of cyclin D1 expression and pRb phosphorylation by PKC δ may account for suppression of cyclin E expression. However, since cyclin E expression is demonstrated to be suppressed by TPA without affecting cyclin D1 expression (38Sasaguri T. Ishida A. Kosaka C. Nojima H. Ogata J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8345-8351Google Scholar), it is also conceivable that PKC δ suppresses the cyclin E expression directly in a cell cycle-independent manner.Recently specific PKC β inhibitor was reported to ameliorate diabetic vascular dysfunction (42Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.-E. Kern T.S. Ballas L.M. Heath W.F. Stramm L.E. Feener E.P. King G.L. Science. 1996; 272: 728-731Google Scholar). Clarifying specific biological functions of distinct PKC isozymes in VSMC may provide us with a therapeutic approach for preventing the progression of atherosclerotic disease.

In VSMC, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to regulate cell differentiation and proliferation as well as modulate agonist-stimulated phospholipid turnover and increase the contractile force (3Huang C.-L. Ives H.E. Nature. 1987; 329: 849-850Google Scholar, 4Lee M.W. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C659-C678Google Scholar, 5Andrea J.E. Walsh M.P. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 585-595Google Scholar). PKC is a complex family including three types of isozymes (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar, 7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar). The first group is the conventional PKCs (cPKC) (α, βI, βII, γ), which are Ca2+-dependent and activated by phorbol esters. The second is the novel PKCs (nPKC) (δ, ε, η, θ, μ), which are also activated by phorbol esters but in a Ca2+-independent manner. The third is the atypical PKCs (ζ, λ/ι), which are activated in a phosphatidylserine-dependent but Ca2+- or phorbol ester-independent manner (4Lee M.W. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C659-C678Google Scholar, 7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar, 8Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Google Scholar). The different PKC isozymes are thought to have distinct functions regarding phosphorylation of specific substrate proteins (7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar). Evidence accumulated to date suggests that each PKC isozyme has a distinct role in cell proliferation. For example, PKC δ, a major isozyme ubiqitously expressed in most mammalian cells, was reported to inhibit growth and induce differentiation in fibroblasts (9Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Google Scholar, 10Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Google Scholar). PKC α was also reported to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation in melanoma cells (11Gruber J.R. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13356-13360Google Scholar), while PKC ε was shown to induce cell growth (10Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Google Scholar, 12Han E.K. Cacace A.M. Sgambato A. Weinstein I.B. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2423-2428Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which individual PKC isozymes control cell proliferation. We found that PKC δ was expressed abundantly in rat aorta and rat VSMC, but the physiological role of PKC δ in VSMC and the signaling events leading from it remains to be elucidated. In this study, we first demonstrated the role of PKC δ in VSMC growth and the cellular mechanism involved. The cell cycle was arrested in the G1phase in PKC δ-overexpressing VSMC. The inhibition of cell proliferation by PKC δ was associated with suppression of G1 cyclin expression and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylation. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we first showed that PKC δ suppressed VSMC proliferation, which was closely associated with inhibition of G1/S transition and expression of G1 cyclins (cyclin D1 and cyclin E).PKC δ Suppresses Proliferation of VSMCWe successfully established a VSMC line in which PKC δ was overexpressed and found that PKC δ had a profound inhibitory effect on VSMC proliferation. Using representative clones (DVs and EVs), we found that total PDBu binding activities, which were up-regulated by PKC δ transfection, were inversely correlated to the levels of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. Furthermore, dominant negative PKC δ compromised the inhibitory effect of overexpressed PKC δ on DNA synthesis. An inhibitory role of PKC δ in the cell proliferation was also reported in fibroblast (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar, 12Han E.K. Cacace A.M. Sgambato A. Weinstein I.B. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2423-2428Google Scholar). Taken together with these observations, PKC δ appears to be an antimitogenic signaling molecule. However, the cell cycle regulators governed by PKC δ might be specific in cell species. In VSMC overexpressed with PKC δ, cell cycle was delayed or arrested in the G1 phase, while in the Chinese hamster ovary cell, Watanabe et al. (23Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K. Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Google Scholar) reported that PKC δ arrested the cell cycle at G2/M but not G1/S transition.Expression of PKC δ is shown to be regulated by cell density in NIH 3T3 cells (29Lehel C. Olah Z. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4761-4766Google Scholar) and C6 glioma cells (30Moreton K. Turner R. Blake N. Paton A. Groome N. Rumsby M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 33-38Google Scholar). Also in A7r5, PKC δ mRNA levels, but not PKC α, were significantly up-regulated by cell confluency (data not shown) suggesting that PKC δ is involved in signaling from cell-cell interaction. This idea may be supported by the observation that PKC δ-overexpressing cells ceased growing at much lower cell density than control cells. It will be important to elucidate the physiological stimuli, including cell-cell interaction, and their signaling cascades leading to PKC δ expression.Cell Cycle Regulation by PKC δPKC has been shown to be involved in PDGF-induced expression of the c-fos and c-myc genes (31Tsuda T. Hamamori Y. Yamashita T. Fukumoto Y. Takai Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 39-42Google Scholar, 32Kaibuchi K. Tsuda T. Kikuchi A. Tanimoto T. Yamashita T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1187-1192Google Scholar). Hirai et al. (9Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Google Scholar) also demonstrated that in NIH 3T3 cells PKC δ activates AP1/Jun transcription factor suggesting that these early responsive genes may mediate the function of PKC δ. However, we observed no changes in mRNA levels of c-fos, c-jun, or c-myc following PDGF stimulation in PKC δ-overexpressing VSMC, although we did not measure the transcriptional activity of AP1/Jun or Myc/Max. Thus, PKC δ may suppress the growth of VSMC downstream of these early responsive genes.We clearly demonstrated that phosphorylation of pRb and PDGF-stimulated expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, but not cdk2, cdk4, cyclin D2, or cyclin D3, were markedly suppressed in PKC δ-overexpressed VSMC. Expression of cyclin D and E and phosphorylation of the pRb family are indispensable for the progression of the G1 phase and for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle in mammalian cells (33Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Google Scholar, 34Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar, 35Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Google Scholar). Cyclin D/cdk4 and cyclin E/cdk2 phosphorylate pRb during early-middle G1 phase and late G1 phase, respectively (24Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Google Scholar). Although we did not measure cyclin D/cdk4 and cyclin E/cdk2 kinase activities, down-regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E proteins may result in the abrogation of their associated kinase activities and pRb phosphorylation. Cyclin/cdk activities are also inhibited by cdk inhibitors such as p21 and p27 (27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Google Scholar, 28Hunter T. Cell. 1993; 75: 839-841Google Scholar). The protein level of p27, but not p21, was elevated in PKC δ-overexpressing VSMC. Thus, PKC δ suppressed cyclin D1 and cyclin E and up-regulated p27, and this may have led to abrogation of pRb phosphorylation and cell cycle progression.Phorbol ester has been shown to have a stimulatory (36Sewing A. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Schalk C. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 545-554Google Scholar), an inhibitory (37Bianchi S. Fabiani S. Muratori M. Arnold A. Sakaguchi K. Miki T.

https://openalex.org/W1984062654,"Prostaglandin D2(PGD2) synthesis in activated mast cells occurs in two phases, an early phase that is dependent on prostaglandin synthase 1 and a delayed phase that is dependent on activation-induced prostaglandin synthase 2 gene expression. Early phase PGD2synthesis in activated mast cells also requires the activity of a secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2). It has been thought that the secretory PLA2 expressed in mast cells is group IIa PLA2, encoded by the Pla2 g2a gene. However, activated bone marrow-derived mast cells prepared fromPla2 g2a+/+ mice and mast cells prepared from mice with a mutation in the Pla2 g2a gene both demonstrate early phase PGD2 synthesis. Moreover, mast cells from both murine strains secrete PLA2 activity following activation. Northern and reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrate that mast cells from Pla2 g2a+/+and Pla2 g2a−/− mice do notexpress group IIa PLA2 message. Instead, Northern and reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrate that both Pla2 g2a+/+ and Pla2 g2a−/− mast cells express mRNA for group V PLA2, encoded by the Pla2gV gene. An antisense oligonucleotide directed against group V PLA2 is also able to inhibit both the early phase of PGD2 production and the secretion of PLA2 activity by activated mast cells. Our data suggest that (i) group IIa PLA2 does not play a significant role in murine mast cell prostaglandin synthesis, (ii) group V PLA2 mediates early mast cell PGD2production and transcellular PGE2 production in murine mast cells, and (iii) much of the data, based on studies with chemical inhibitors and antibodies, suggesting that group IIa PLA2is responsible for arachidonic acid mobilization needs to be reevaluated.

These enzymes cleave glycerophospholipids, in the presence of millimolar levels of calcium, to release arachidonic acid. Arachidonate is the substrate for lipoxygenase-mediated leukotriene synthesis and prostaglandin synthase-mediated prostanoid synthesis (1Glaser K.B. Adv.

The most well studied of these low molecular weight phospholipases are the group I PLA2, present in pancreas, and the “group II PLA2” (now termed group IIa PLA2) present in synovial fluid, intestine, and a wide range of other organs. One of our laboratories recently identified genes for two additional proteins with related sequences and similar enzymatic properties (3Tischfield J.A. Xia Y.R. Shih D.M. Klisak I. Chen J. Engle S.J.

Identification of a naturally occurring null mutation in the gene encoding group IIa PLA2presents an opportunity to examine the role of this gene and its product.Mast cells play a critical role in immune responses and in allergic disease. When activated, either by antigen aggregation of cell surface high affinity IgE receptors or by other effectors, mast cells degranulate and release a variety of agents, including histamine and serotonin, that modulate inflammatory responses. In addition, activation of mast cells also induces the synthesis and release of leukotrienes and of prostaglandin D2(PGD2).PGD2 production in activated mast cells occurs in two distinct stages, an immediate release that is completed within 10–15 min and a delayed phase of PGD2 synthesis and secretion that peaks at 4–6 h. The early phase of PGD2 synthesis in mast cells following activation is due to the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin by preexisting prostaglandin synthase 1. In contrast, the late phase of PGD2 synthesis and secretion following mast cell activation requires activation-induced synthesis of prostaglandin synthase 2 mRNA and functional protein (16Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 818-825Google Scholar, 17Murakami M. Bingham III, C.O. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4445-4453Google Scholar).We recently used both a chemical inhibitor of the group IIa PLA2 and a monoclonal antibody produced against human group IIa PLA2 to demonstrate that the early, prostaglandin synthase 1-dependent phase of PGD2 production requires the release of PLA2 from the activated mast cell (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3231-3237Google Scholar). We also showed that both recombinant group IIa PLA2and mast cell supernatants can elicit “transcellular” prostaglandin synthesis in fibroblasts, releasing from the fibroblast membranes arachidonic acid that can serve as substrate for the fibroblast prostaglandin synthase 1 (19Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 186-191Google Scholar). The ability of mast cell supernatants to elicit transcellular prostaglandin synthesis was also blocked by both the monoclonal antibody to human group IIa PLA2 and a chemical inhibitor of group IIa PLA2. Like others, we attributed the mast cell PLA2 activity essential for prostanoid synthesis to group IIa PLA2. However, we now report that mast cells derived from animals homozygous for themom1−/− incapacitating mutation in thePla2 g2a gene, which encodes group IIa PLA2, demonstrate normal prostaglandin production. Moreover, mast cells derived from mice wild type for the Pla2 g2a gene do not produce detectable message for group IIa PLA2 or for group IIc PLA2. However, group V PLA2 message is present in mast cells derived from both mom1+and mom1− mice. Moreover, preincubation with an antisense oligonucleotide directed against group V PLA2message can block both the early phase of PGD2 production and the secretion of PLA2 activity by activated mast cells.DISCUSSIONWe initially expected that mast cells derived from animals with a defective Pla2 g2a gene, unable to produce functional group IIa PLA2 (14Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22375-22385Google Scholar, 15MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R.A. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 957-966Google Scholar), would be incapable of the early phase of PGD2 production and would not engage in transcellular prostaglandin synthesis. This assumption was based on (i) previous conclusions that group IIa PLA2 is the low molecular weight phospholipase active in mast cells and (ii) our previous demonstration that both the early phase of PGD2 production in activated mast cells and mast cell/fibroblast transcellular prostaglandin production are blocked by an inhibitor (SB203347) characterized as a group IIa PLA2 inhibitor and by a monoclonal antibody to human group IIa PLA2 (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3231-3237Google Scholar, 19Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 186-191Google Scholar). However, it is clear that mast cells derived from Pla2 g2a−/− mice (i) cannot, as expected, express group IIa PLA2, (ii)do secrete a low molecular weight PLA2 in response to aggregation of their IgE receptors, (iii) are able to participate in the early phase of PGD2 production following activation, and (iv) secrete the active PLA2 responsible for mast cell/fibroblast transcellular prostaglandin synthesis. These data suggest that another PLA2 enzyme, and not group IIa PLA2, must be responsible for the early phase of PGD2 production following mast cell activation.Northern and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that mast cells derived from both AKJ (Pla2 g2a+/+) mice and B6 (Pla2 g2a−/−) mice express message for group V PLA2. In contrast, group IIc PLA2 message could not be detected in either mast cell preparation. These data suggested that the group V PLA2 enzyme mediates the early phase of PGD2 production in activated mast cells. The ability of an antisense oligonucleotide, directed against the group V PLA2 message, to inhibit the secretion of PLA2and the early phase of PGD2 production in activated mast cells confirmed this suggestion. Northern analyses of the levels of group V PLA2 message in mast cells derived from AKJ and B6 mice demonstrated that the production of group V PLA2 in mice with a mutation in the Pla2 g2a gene (encoding group IIa PLA2) is not due to a developmentally regulated compensating response to the Pla2 g2a mutation. We conclude that, in murine mast cells, PLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release is not mediated by group IIa PLA2 (the product of the Pla2 g2a gene) and is mediated by the group V PLA2 (the product of the Pla2gV gene).Balboa et al. (23Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Google Scholar) provided compelling evidence that P388D1 macrophage-like cells do not produce detectable levels of message for the group IIa PLA2 enzyme. Nevertheless, activation of these cells by endotoxin priming followed by platelet activating factor stimulation resulted in secretion of substantial PLA2 activity. P388D1 cells are wild type for the Pla2 g2a gene. Northern and RT-PCR analysis of message levels for the products of the Pla2 g2a,Pla2 g2c, and Pla2gV genes demonstrated the presence of mRNA for group V PLA2, but not for the other two low molecular weight phospholipases. Balboa et al.(23Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Google Scholar) conclude that group V PLA2, not group IIa PLA2, mediates arachidonic acid release in activated P388D1 macrophages. Their results for LPS/platelet activating factor stimulated P388D1 cells are, therefore, very similar to our results with activated mast cells.While our studies were in progress, Bingham et al. (25Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Google Scholar) also reported that activated mast cells derived from C57BL/6J (Pla2 g2a−/−) mice demonstrated normal early and delayed phase PGD2 production. However, they suggest that a secretory phospholipase activity is required for the latephase of PGD2 synthesis in mast cells. Bingham et al. (25Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Google Scholar) report that mast cells derived from Pla2 g2a+/+ mice could produce some mRNA for group II PLA2. They did not, however, compare the levels of phospholipase enzyme activity secreted from activated mast cells derived from Pla2 g2a−/− and Pla2 g2a+/+ mice, nor did they determine whether group IIc PLA2 or group V PLA2, the products of thePla2 g2c or Pla2gV genes, are expressed in mast cells. Our data showing that mast cells from Pla2 g2a+/+ and Pla2 g2a−/− (group IIa PLA2-deficient) mice (i) secrete similar levels of phospholipase activity (Fig. 4), (ii) produce equivalent amounts of PGD2 (Fig. 1), and (iii) both stimulate transcellular prostaglandin synthesis in fibroblasts (Fig. 8) all suggest that group IIa PLA2, the product of the Pla2 g2a gene, does not play a major role in prostaglandin production. While additional experiments in which mast cell preparations and inhibitors will need to be compared to understand the differences in the results of our two laboratories, it seems clear from both the results of Bingham et al. (25Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Google Scholar) and our data that the Pla2 g2a gene plays little or no role in mast cell prostaglandin production.High levels of PLA2 activity have been described in serum and/or tissue exudates of patients with a variety of inflammatory illnesses, including arthritis, pancreatitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and septic shock (6Hara S.

The identification of the PLA2 activity present in normal immune responses and inflammatory conditions has often been based on enzymatic assays, enzyme inhibitor studies, and/or immunologic detection methods that probably cannot discriminate between the enzymatic activities of the group IIa PLA2, group IIc PLA2, and group V PLA2 isoforms. Our demonstration that murine mast cells express message from the Pla2gV gene encoding message for the group V PLA2 and do not express messages for the other low molecular weight phospholipases, along with the observation that group V PLA2, and not group IIa PLA2, mediates arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin synthesis in P388D1 macrophages (23Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Google Scholar), suggests that the recently discovered group V PLA2 may play a much more prominent role in mediating normal immune responses and pathologic inflammatory responses than previously thought.Development of phospholipase A2 inhibitors has been an important topic of pharmacologic research because of the potential of such molecules for use as anti-inflammatory agents (26Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Berg O.G. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 916-924Google Scholar). Although a variety of compounds has been described that can discriminate between secretory PLA2 enzymes and the type IV cytoplasmic PLA2, these compounds have not been analyzed for their ability to discriminate between group IIa PLA2, group IIc PLA2, and group V PLA2 enzyme activity. The demonstration that group V PLA2 mediates both mast cell and macrophage prostaglandin production following ligand activation should rekindle interest in this area of drug design and screening. Four low molecular weight, “secretory” phospholipase A2 (PLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, secretory phospholipase A2; PGD2, prostaglandin D2; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, secretory phospholipase A2; PGD2, prostaglandin D2; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. enzymes are present in mammals. These enzymes cleave glycerophospholipids, in the presence of millimolar levels of calcium, to release arachidonic acid. Arachidonate is the substrate for lipoxygenase-mediated leukotriene synthesis and prostaglandin synthase-mediated prostanoid synthesis (1Glaser K.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 32: 31-66Google Scholar, 2Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Google Scholar). The most well studied of these low molecular weight phospholipases are the group I PLA2, present in pancreas, and the “group II PLA2” (now termed group IIa PLA2) present in synovial fluid, intestine, and a wide range of other organs. One of our laboratories recently identified genes for two additional proteins with related sequences and similar enzymatic properties (3Tischfield J.A. Xia Y.R. Shih D.M. Klisak I. Chen J. Engle S.J.

Murine group IIc PLA2 is found in testis, while the group V PLA2 mRNA is most actively expressed in the heart. Group IIa PLA2 has been proposed to play a role in many pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (6Hara S. Hudo I. Chang H.W. Matsusta K. Miyamoto T. Inoue K. J. Biochem.

Ilderton E. Summerly R. Yardley H.J. Br. J. Dermatol. 1983; 108: 103-105Google Scholar), that are mediated by arachidonic acid release. The Pla2 g2a gene, encoding group IIa PLA2, has also been implicated in colon cancer. The “murine intestinal neoplasia” or min1 gene is the murine orthologue of the APC gene, mutated in human familial adenomatosis polyposis, a hereditary form of colon cancer. The number of intestinal tumors and the longevity of mice with themin1− mutation is greatly influenced by their genetic background. Recently, mice carrying the “modifier of min1” or mom1 mutation have been shown to have a frameshift mutation in the Pla2ga gene. Mice with this mutation express marginally detectable group IIa PLA2 mRNA and no group IIa PLA2 protein (14Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E.

We recently used both a chemical inhibitor of the group IIa PLA2 and a monoclonal antibody produced against human group IIa PLA2 to demonstrate that the early, prostaglandin synthase 1-dependent phase of PGD2 production requires the release of PLA2 from the activated mast cell (18Reddy S.T.

We initially expected that mast cells derived from animals with a defective Pla2 g2a gene, unable to produce functional group IIa PLA2 (14Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22375-22385Google Scholar, 15MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R.A. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 957-966Google Scholar), would be incapable of the early phase of PGD2 production and would not engage in transcellular prostaglandin synthesis. This assumption was based on (i) previous conclusions that group IIa PLA2 is the low molecular weight phospholipase active in mast cells and (ii) our previous demonstration that both the early phase of PGD2 production in activated mast cells and mast cell/fibroblast transcellular prostaglandin production are blocked by an inhibitor (SB203347) characterized as a group IIa PLA2 inhibitor and by a monoclonal antibody to human group IIa PLA2 (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3231-3237Google Scholar, 19Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 186-191Google Scholar). However, it is clear that mast cells derived from Pla2 g2a−/− mice (i) cannot, as expected, express group IIa PLA2, (ii)do secrete a low molecular weight PLA2 in response to aggregation of their IgE receptors, (iii) are able to participate in the early phase of PGD2 production following activation, and (iv) secrete the active PLA2 responsible for mast cell/fibroblast transcellular prostaglandin synthesis. These data suggest that another PLA2 enzyme, and not group IIa PLA2, must be responsible for the early phase of PGD2 production following mast cell activation. Northern and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that mast cells derived from both AKJ (Pla2 g2a+/+) mice and B6 (Pla2 g2a−/−) mice express message for group V PLA2. In contrast, group IIc PLA2 message could not be detected in either mast cell preparation. These data suggested that the group V PLA2 enzyme mediates the early phase of PGD2 production in activated mast cells. The ability of an antisense oligonucleotide, directed against the group V PLA2 message, to inhibit the secretion of PLA2and the early phase of PGD2 production in activated mast cells confirmed this suggestion. Northern analyses of the levels of group V PLA2 message in mast cells derived from AKJ and B6 mice demonstrated that the production of group V PLA2 in mice with a mutation in the Pla2 g2a gene (encoding group IIa PLA2) is not due to a developmentally regulated compensating response to the Pla2 g2a mutation. We conclude that, in murine mast cells, PLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release is not mediated by group IIa PLA2 (the product of the Pla2 g2a gene) and is mediated by the group V PLA2 (the product of the Pla2gV gene). Balboa et al. (23Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Google Scholar) provided compelling evidence that P388D1 macrophage-like cells do not produce detectable levels of message for the group IIa PLA2 enzyme. Nevertheless, activation of these cells by endotoxin priming followed by platelet activating factor stimulation resulted in secretion of substantial PLA2 activity. P388D1 cells are wild type for the Pla2 g2a gene. Northern and RT-PCR analysis of message levels for the products of the Pla2 g2a,Pla2 g2c, and Pla2gV genes demonstrated the presence of mRNA for group V PLA2, but not for the other two low molecular weight phospholipases. Balboa et al.(23Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Google Scholar) conclude that group V PLA2, not group IIa PLA2, mediates arachidonic acid release in activated P388D1 macrophages. Their results for LPS/platelet activating factor stimulated P388D1 cells are, therefore, very similar to our results with activated mast cells. While our studies were in progress, Bingham et al. (25Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Google Scholar) also reported that activated mast cells derived from C57BL/6J (Pla2 g2a−/−) mice demonstrated normal early and delayed phase PGD2 production. However, they suggest that a secretory phospholipase activity is required for the latephase of PGD2 synthesis in mast cells. Bingham et al. (25Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Google Scholar) report that mast cells derived from Pla2 g2a+/+ mice could produce some mRNA for group II PLA2. They did not, however, compare the levels of phospholipase enzyme activity secreted from activated mast cells derived from Pla2 g2a−/− and Pla2 g2a+/+ mice, nor did they determine whether group IIc PLA2 or group V PLA2, the products of thePla2 g2c or Pla2gV genes, are expressed in mast cells. Our data showing that mast cells from Pla2 g2a+/+ and Pla2 g2a−/− (group IIa PLA2-deficient) mice (i) secrete similar levels of phospholipase activity (Fig. 4), (ii) produce equivalent amounts of PGD2 (Fig. 1), and (iii) both stimulate transcellular prostaglandin synthesis in fibroblasts (Fig. 8) all suggest that group IIa PLA2, the product of the Pla2 g2a gene, does not play a major role in prostaglandin production. While additional experiments in which mast cell preparations and inhibitors will need to be compared to understand the differences in the results of our two laboratories, it seems clear from both the results of Bingham et al. (25Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Google Scholar) and our data that the Pla2 g2a gene plays little or no role in mast cell prostaglandin production. High levels of PLA2 activity have been described in serum and/or tissue exudates of patients with a variety of inflammatory illnesses, including arthritis, pancreatitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and septic shock (6Hara S.

The identification of the PLA2 activity present in normal immune responses and inflammatory conditions has often been based on enzymatic assays, enzyme inhibitor studies, and/or immunologic detection methods that probably cannot discriminate between the enzymatic activities of the group IIa PLA2, group IIc PLA2, and group V PLA2 isoforms. Our demonstration that murine mast cells express message from the Pla2gV gene encoding message for the group V PLA2 and do not express messages for the other low molecular weight phospholipases, along with the observation that group V PLA2, and not group IIa PLA2, mediates arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin synthesis in P388D1 macrophages (23Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Google Scholar), suggests that the recently discovered group V PLA2 may play a much more prominent role in mediating normal immune responses and pathologic inflammatory responses than previously thought. Development of phospholipase A2 inhibitors has been an important topic of pharmacologic research because of the potential of such molecules for use as anti-inflammatory agents (26Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Berg O.G. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 916-924Google Scholar). Although a variety of compounds has been described that can discriminate between secretory PLA2 enzymes and the type IV cytoplasmic PLA2, these compounds have not been analyzed for their ability to discriminate between group IIa PLA2, group IIc PLA2, and group V PLA2 enzyme activity. The demonstration that group V PLA2 mediates both mast cell and macrophage prostaglandin production following ligand activation should rekindle interest in this area of drug design and screening.

A V2E mutant has been shown to dominantly interfere with wild-type envelope-mediated syncytium formation and virus infectivity. To understand this phenomenon, a 33-residue peptide (wild type, WT) identical to the N-terminal segment of gp41 and its V2E mutant were synthesized, fluorescently labeled, and characterized. Both peptides inhibited HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and had similar α-helical content in membrane mimetic environments. Studies with fluorescently labeled peptide analogues revealed that both peptides have high affinity for phospholipid membranes, are susceptible to digestion by proteinase-K in their membrane-bound state, and tend to self- and coassemble in the membranes. In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the WT peptide formed dimers as well as higher order oligomers, whereas the V2E mutant only formed dimers. The WT, but not the V2E mutant, induced liposome aggregation, destabilization, and fusion. Moreover, the V2E mutant inhibited vesicle fusion induced by the WT peptide, probably by forming inactive heteroaggregates. These data form the basis for an explanation of the mechanism by which the gp41 V2E mutant inhibits HIV-1 infectivity in cells when co-expressed with WT gp41.

To infect mammalian cells, enveloped viruses have to deposit their nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm of a host cell. Membrane fusion represents a key element in this entry mechanism. The basic unit of most viral fusion proteins is one or two type 1 integral membrane glycoproteins. These often combine into oligomers that project from the viral envelope (1Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Google Scholar). A key feature of most viral fusion proteins is a fusion peptide, a stretch of highly hydrophobic amino acids that is believed to trigger the fusion process. It was proposed that fusion is initiated by the insertion of the fusion peptide into either the target membrane (2Stegmann T. Doms R.W. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

The fusion peptide located at the N terminus of the transmembrane viral protein gp41 is assumed to have a major role in this fusion process (12Gallaher W.R. Cell. 1987; 50: 327-328Google Scholar). A polar amino acid substitution at position 2 of the fusion peptide of gp41 (V2E) results in an envelope glycoprotein that dominantly interferes with both syncytium formation and infection mediated by the wild-type HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (13Freed E.O. Delwart E.L. Buchschacher G.J. Panganiban A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 70-74Google Scholar, 14Elson H.F. Dimitrov D.S. Blumenthal R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 165-169Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of the interference by the V2E mutant is not clear, it does not result from aberrant envelope glycoprotein synthesis, processing, or transport. This mutant elicits a dominant interfering effect even in the presence of excess wild-type glycoprotein, which suggests that a higher order envelope glycoprotein complex is involved in the membrane fusion (13Freed E.O. Delwart E.L. Buchschacher G.J. Panganiban A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 70-74Google Scholar). The fusion process is a complex phenomenon that involves an entire range of biochemical and biophysical interactions (15Blumenthal R. Schoch C. Puri A. Clague M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 635: 285-296Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the steps involved in the fusion process, synthetic peptides that resemble or mimic the putative fusion peptide's regions of envelope proteins of viruses, or model peptides, have been synthesized, and their interactions with liposomes or cells have been examined. Among them there are peptides corresponding to the fusion sequences of influenza virus (8Wharton S.A. Martin S.R. Ruigrok R.W. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 1847-1857Google Scholar, 16Burger K.N. Wharton S.A. Demel R.A. Verkleij A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11173-11180Google Scholar, 17Clague M.J. Knutson J.R. Blumenthal R. Herrmann A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15124-15131Google Scholar), simian immunodeficiency virus (20Martin I. Defrise Q.F. Mandieau V. Nielsen N.M. Saermark T. Burny A. Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.M. Vandenbranden M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 872-879Google Scholar), and HIV (21Nieva J.L. Nir S. Muga A. Goñi F.M. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3201-3209Google Scholar, 22Rafalski M. Lear J.D.

Commun. 1990; 172: 952-957Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies, the mode of action of fusion peptides that promote fusion is still not clear. Interaction of viral fusion peptides with host-cell membranes was simulated by computer analysis (24Brasseur R. Vandenbranden M. Cornet B. Burny A. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 267-273Google Scholar), which led to the conclusion that the fusogenic helices were obliquely oriented with respect to the lipid-water interface. This conclusion was experimentally supported by the finding that a mutation that modified the oblique orientation of the fusion peptide of simian immunodeficiency virus gp32 reduced the peptide's fusogenic activity (25Horth M. Lambrecht B. Khim M.C. Bex F. Thiriart C. Ruysschaert J.M. Burny A. Brasseur R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2747-2755Google Scholar). Further support for this oblique orientation comes from a recent study (19Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15124-15131Google Scholar) showing that the fusion peptide of the Sendai virus is obliquely oriented in its membrane-bound state. Furthermore, the peptide could self-assemble in its membrane-bound state, thus suggesting its role in assisting in the assembly of the envelope protein of the virus. More recently, Martin et al. (26Martin I. Schaal H. Scheid A. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 298-304Google Scholar) showed, using attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, that a short portion of the fusion peptide of HIV is obliquely oriented in its membrane-bound state. This oblique orientation was postulated to locally disorganize the structure of the lipid bilayer and to generate new lipid phases that are thought to be associated with the initial steps of membrane fusion. To understand better the role of fusion peptides in the mediation of cell fusion, a 33-residue peptide that represents the N terminus of HIV-1 gp41, and its V2E mutant were synthesized and fluorescently labeled. The peptides were then used in a variety of biophysical and functional studies to characterize their structure, their abilities to interact with and permeate phospholipid membranes, to self- and coassemble within membranes, to induce fusion of phospholipid membranes, and to inhibit cell-cell fusion. The results revealed that the fusogenic properties of the intact gp41 and its V2E mutant can be modeled using synthetic peptides. Thus, this synthetic peptide model was used to explore the mechanism in which the V2E mutant interferes with the fusion peptide activity. BOC-amino acid phenylacetamidomethyl-resin was purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and BOC-amino acids were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). NBD-fluoride and other reagents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) from bovine spinal cord (sodium salt, grade I) were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). Cholesterol (extra pure), purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), was recrystallized twice from ethanol. N-[Lissamine-rhodamineB-sulfonyl]-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Rho-PE),N-[7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl]-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE), 3–3′-diethylthiodicarbocyanine iodide, 5-(and 6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (Rho), succinimidyl ester, 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA), and 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI(C18:3)) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). TF228 and SupT1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (with 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin G at 100 units/ml, and streptomycin sulfate at 100 μg/ml). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared using double glass-distilled water. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was composed of NaCl (8 g/liter), KCl (0.2 g/liter), KH2PO4 (0.2 g/liter), and Na2HPO4 (1.09 g/liter), pH 7.4. Peptide markers for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Fluka. Recombinant soluble CD4 was obtained from Intracel (Cambridge, MA). The peptides were synthesized by a solid phase method on phenylacetamidomethyl-amino acid resin (0.15 milliequivalents) (27Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Google Scholar), as described previously (28Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Google Scholar,29Shai Y. Hadari Y.R. Finkels A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22346-22354Google Scholar). Labeling of the N terminus of the peptides was achieved as described previously (30Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Google Scholar, 31Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Google Scholar); briefly, resin-bound peptides, with their amino acid side chains fully protected, were treated with trifluoroacetic acid, to remove the BOC protecting group from their N-terminal amino groups, while keeping all the other reactive amine groups of the attached peptides still protected. When needed the resin-bound peptides were reacted with the desired fluorescent probe and finally cleaved from the resins by hydrofluoric acid, extracted with trifluoroacetic acid, and precipitated with ether. This procedure yielded peptides selectively labeled with fluorescent probes at their N-terminal amino acid. The synthetic peptides were purified (>95% homogenicity) by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column using a linear gradient of 25–80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, for 40 min. The peptides were subjected to amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry to confirm their composition. Unless stated elsewhere, stock solutions of concentrated peptides in Me2SO were used to avoid aggregation of the peptides prior to their use. The final concentration of the Me2SO in each experiment did not exceed 2%, a concentration that did not have any effect on the system tested. The actions of the peptides upon human cell-cell fusion were investigated using fluorescence video imaging microscopy. TF228 cells, expressing the HIV type 1 envelope protein, were labeled with DiI, a lipophilic dye. SupT1 cells, expressing CD4 receptors, were labeled with CMFDA, an aqueous dye. Transfer of DiI and CMFDA to another cell indicates membrane mixing and cytosolic mixing, respectively. Both cell lines are derived from lymphocytes. SupT1 cells were loaded with CMFDA as follows. Cells were pelleted and incubated in fresh RPMI containing 10 μm CMFDA for 45 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Inside the cytosol, acetate groups of CMFDA are cleaved by esterases, thereby converting a nonfluorescent compound into a green fluorescent one. Also, the chloromethyl moiety is conjugated to intracellular thiols, producing cell-impermeant dye-thioether adducts. The reaction is believed to be mediated by glutathione S-transferase (Molecular Probes data). The cells were washed twice in RPMI and then incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for another 45 min to ensure complete conversion of the dye. The cells were washed twice again and allowed to settle onto polylysine-coated glass coverslips in serum-free medium for 15 min before addition of DiI-loaded TF228 cells and serum. TF228 cells were labeled by incubation in 3 μm DiI(C18:3) for 10 min at room temperature in a 1:1 mixture of diluent C and RPMI medium, followed by three washes in RPMI. TF228 and SupT1 cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and video fluorescence images were taken. After 30 min of this incubation period, different doses of WT, V2E, orN-succinyl-Sendai fusion peptide were applied.N-Succinyl-Sendai fusion peptide consists ofN-succinylated 33 N-terminal amino acids of the Sendai fusion peptide, and it is not expected to interact specifically with HIV-1. The proportion of TF228 cells, in contact with SupT1 cells, that had fused to SupT1 cells was counted. Fused cells are those labeled with both dyes. A control experiment was performed in which TF228 cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of 20 μg/ml soluble CD4 immediately prior to co-culture with the SupT1 cells. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by sonication, from PC/PS/Chol. (4:4:1, w/w). The cholesterol was included to reduce the curvature of the small unilamellar vesicles (32Lelkes P.I. Friedmann P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 775: 395-401Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were also prepared from PC/PS/Chol. (4:4:1, w/w) and, when necessary, with different amounts of Rho-PE and NBD-PE. The procedure was as follows. Dry lipids were hydrated in buffer and dispersed by vortexing to produce large multilamellar vesicles. The lipid suspension was freeze-thawed five times and then extruded eight times through a polycarbonate membranes with 0.1- or 0.4-μm diameter pores (Nuclepore Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Lipid mixing of large unilamellar vesicles was measured using a fluorescence probe dilution assay, based on resonance energy transfer measurements (33Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Google Scholar). Lipid vesicles containing 0.6 mol % each of NBD-PE (energy donor) and Rho-PE (energy acceptor) were prepared in PBS. A 1:4 mixture of labeled and unlabeled vesicles was suspended in 400 μl of the buffer at room temperature, and a small volume of peptide in Me2SO was added. The increase in NBD fluorescence at 530 nm was monitored with the excitation wavelength set at 467 nm. The inner filter effect was minimized by using a 0.5-cm pathlength cuvette. The fluorescence intensity before the addition of the peptide was referred to as 0% lipid mixing, and the fluorescence intensity upon the addition of Triton X-100 (0.25% v/v) was referred to as 100% lipid mixing. All the fluorescence measurements in the present study were done on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B Spectrofluorometer. The effects of the peptides on liposomal suspensions were examined by negative staining electron microscopy. A drop containing LUV alone or a mixture of LUV and peptide was deposited onto a carbon-coated grid and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The grids were examined using a JEOL JEM 100B electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co. Tokyo, Japan). The changes in the vesicles' size were measured by visible absorbance measurements. Aliquots of peptide stock solutions were added to 200-μl suspensions of 89 μm PC/PS/Chol (4:4:1) LUV in PBS. Absorbance was measured using Bio-Tek Instruments microplate before and after the addition of a peptide. Membrane destabilization, in the form of diffusion potential collapse, was detected fluorimetrically as described previously (28Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Google Scholar, 34Loew L.M. Rosenberg I. Bridge M. Gitler C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 837-844Google Scholar). Briefly, a liposome suspension, prepared in “K+ buffer,” was added to an isotonic buffer (K+-free buffer), to which the dye diS-C2-5 was then added. Subsequent addition of a valinomycin created a negative diffusion potential inside the vesicles by a selective efflux of K+ ions, resulting in a quenching of the dye's fluorescence. Peptide-induced membrane permeability toward all the ions in the solution caused dissipation of the diffusion potential, as monitored by an increase of fluorescence. Fluorescence was monitored using excitation at 620 nm and emission at 670 nm. The percentage of fluorescence recovery (Ft) was defined as shown in Equation 1. Ft=[(It−Io)/(If−Io)]100%Equation 1 Where It is the fluorescence observed after addition of peptide, at time t; I0 is the fluorescence after addition of valinomycin; and If is the total fluorescence prior to addition of valinomycin. The experiments were done as described (35Schägger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar), except for a change in the sample preparation; high performance liquid chromatography-purified peptide and SDS (1:1, w/w) were dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1 v/v). The solvents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and then lyophilized. The peptide and SDS mixtures were resuspended in buffer composed of 0.065 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% glycerol by sonication. Fixing, staining, and destaining times were shorted to 1 min, 1 h, and overnight, respectively, to decrease diffusion effects. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-500A spectropolarimeter. The spectra were scanned with a quartz optical cell with pathlength of 2 mm, at room temperature. Each spectrum was the average of eight scans at wavelengths of 250 to 195 nm. Fractional helicities (36Wu C.S. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Google Scholar) were calculated as shown in Equation 2. fh=([θ]222−[θ]2220)[θ]222100Equation 2 Where θ is the experimentally observed mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, and values for θ2220 and θ222100, corresponding to 0 and 100% helix content at 222 nm, estimated at −2,000 and −30,000 degrees·cm2/dmol, respectively. Changes in the fluorescence of NBD-labeled peptides were measured upon their binding to vesicles. NBD-labeled peptide (0.1 μm) was added to 2 ml of PBS, containing SUV (403 μm). Emission spectra were recorded, with excitation set at 467 nm (10 nm slit), and compared with the emission spectra of the NBD-labeled peptide in a liposome-free buffer. The degree of peptide association with lipid vesicles was measured by adding lipid vesicles to 0.1 μm of NBD-labeled peptides at 28 °C, as has been previously described with tryptophan containing peptides (37Rizzo V. Stankowski S. Schwarz G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2751-2759Google Scholar, 38Schwarz G. Stankowski S. Rizzo V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 861: 141-151Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of the lipid/peptide molar ratio, with an excitation set at 467 nm (10 nm slit), and with emission set at 530 nm (5 nm slit). The fluorescence values were corrected by taking into account the dilution factor corresponding to the addition of microliter amounts of liposomes and by subtracting the corresponding blank (buffer with the same amount of vesicles). SUV (500 μm) composed of PC/PS/Chol. (4:4:1, w/w) were added to 0.1 μm NBD-labeled peptide, followed by the addition of proteinase K (1 μg/400 μl). Fluorescence intensities as a function of time were obtained before and after the addition of the enzyme. In these experiments, the peptide/lipid molar ratio was kept at a level such that more than 90% of the peptides are assumed to be bound to the vesicles. To estimate the percent of cleavage, a control experiment was done, in which the enzyme was added before the addition of the liposomes. The emission at the end of the control experiment was referred to as 100% cleavage. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was measured using NBD-labeled peptides serving as donors and Rho-labeled peptides serving as energy acceptors (39Gazit E. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12363-12371Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were obtained at room temperature, with excitation set at 467 nm using a 10-nm slit width. In a typical experiment, donor peptide (final concentration 0.04 μm) was added to a dispersion of PC/PS/Chol. (4:4:1, w/w) SUV (224 μm) in PBS, followed by the addition of acceptor peptide in several sequential doses. Fluorescence spectra were obtained before and after addition of the acceptor. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was determined by measuring the decrease in the quantum yield of the donor as a result of the presence of acceptor.E was determined experimentally from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities of the donor in the presence (Ida) and in the absence (Id) of the acceptor, at the donor's maximum emission wavelength (524 nm in the case of the WT peptide, 522 nm in the case of the V2E mutant, and 531 nm in the case of the control peptide, A13 Paradaxin). The percentage of transfer efficiency (E) is shown by Equation 3, E=(1−Ida/Id)×100%.Equation 3 Correction for the contribution of acceptor emission as a result of direct excitation was made by subtracting the signal produced by the acceptor-labeled analogue alone. The contribution of buffer and vesicles was subtracted from all measurements. Peptides representing the 33-amino acid residues N-terminal of gp41 of HIV-1 (LAV1a), as well as its V2E analogue, were synthesized and fluorescently labeled at their N-terminal amino acid with either NBD (to serve in the binding experiments and as an energy donor) or rhodamine (to serve as an energy acceptor). The sequences of the peptides and their designations are given in Table I. The table gives also the sequences of other two membranous α-helical peptides, the N-terminal succinylated analogue of the fusion peptide of Sendai virus, and a pore forming toxin, A13-pardaxin.Table IAmino acid sequences of the peptides and their fluorescently labeled analoguesPeptide no.DesignationSequence1WTH2N-AVGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQL-COOH2NBD-WTNBD-HN-AVGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQL-COOH3Rho-WTRho-HN-AVGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQL-COOH4V2EH2N-AEGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQL-COOH5NBD-V2ENBD-HN-AEGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQL-COOH6Rho-V2ERho-HN-AEGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQL-COOH7NBD-A13-pardaxinNBD-HN-GFFALIPKIISSALFKTLLSAVGSALSSSGGQE-COOH8Suc-SendaiSuc-HN-FFGAVIGTIALGVATSAQITAGIALAEAREAKR-COOH Open table in a new tab Both WT and V2E peptides inhibited fusion of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-expressing cells with a CD4+ cell line (Fig. 1). Statistical analysis using Student'st test showed that the data sets of control compared with WT peptides are different to the 97.5% confidence level and that the control compared with V2E data sets are different to >99% confidence (p = 0.0038). The data indicate 50% inhibition of fusion at 0.01 μm peptide. CEM cells, expressing CD4 receptors but not the envelope protein, were used as negative controls. These cells were labeled with DiI in the same manner as the TF228 cells and incubated for 2 h with SupT1 cells. Only 2% of CEM cells showed dye overlap with SupT1 cells showing that background overlap is low. Fig. 2 shows representative images of fluorescent cells in the presence of WT, V2E, and control peptides at 4 μg/ml. Images D, H, and L show regions of overlap of CMFDA and DiI fluorescence (AND function of the “Metamorph” software, Universal Imaging). Little fluorescence overlap is seen in the case of the WT and V2E peptides, whereas considerable overlap is observed using the control peptide.Figure 2Representative images of the actions of WT, V2E, and control peptides upon TF228 to SupT1 cell fusion. In all cases 4 μg/ml peptide was used. A–D, images of the same field of TF228 and SupT1 cells after 2 h incubation at 37 °C in the presence of control peptide (N-succinyl wild-type Sendai).

I, bright field; J, green CMFDA fluorescence; K, red DiI fluorescence; L, overlap. There is considerably more overlap of red and green fluorescence in the presence of control peptide than in WT or V2E peptides. Bright field images were used to confirm that overlap was due to the presence of both dyes in the same cell rather than just due to one cell lying over another.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Preincubation for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of soluble CD4 (20 μg/ml) prior to co-culture of the TF228 and SupT1 cells showed that soluble CD4 inhibits cell-cell fusion as measured by the dye mixing assay. Fusion in the presence of soluble CD4 was 20.6 ± 2.2 and 42.3 ± 5.5% in the absence of soluble CD4 (mean ± S.E., six experiments). This is the same sCD4 concentration as that required for half-maximal inhibition of syncytium formation using these cells (40Fu Y.K. Hart T.K. Jonak Z.L. Bugelski P.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3818-3825Google Scholar). The induction of intervesicular lipid mixing by the peptides, as a measure of their fusogenic activity, was tested with PC/PS/Chol. (4:4:1) LUV (100-nm diameter) utilizing the probe dilution assay (33Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Google Scholar). The dependence of the extent of the lipid mixing process, on the peptide's concentration, was examined. In separate experiments, increasing amounts of each peptide were added to a fixed amount of vesicles. To compare the activity of the two peptides, the levels of lipid mixing, reached 10 min after the addition of the peptides, were plotted as a function of the [peptide]/[lipid] ratio (Fig.3 A). It is evident that only the WT peptide was able to cause lipid mixing. The ability of the V2E mutant to inhibit lipid mixing induced by the WT peptide was tested using the same experimental system.

Induction of the human DNA damage- and growth arrest-inducible gene, GADD34, by ionizing radiation was only seen in certain cell lines and correlated with apoptosis following ionizing radiation. In addition, the kinetics and dose response ofGADD34 to ionizing radiation closely paralleled that of the apoptosis inhibitor, BAX. However, unlike BAX, the GADD34 response was independent of cellular p53 status. The carboxyl terminus of GADD34 has homology with the carboxyl termini of two viral proteins, one of which is known to prevent apoptosis of virus infected cells. The association of GADD34 expression with certain types of apoptosis and its homology with a known apoptosis regulator suggests that GADD34 may play a role in apoptosis as well.

The response to genotoxic stress in mammalian cells is complex and may include several processes, including enhanced DNA repair, transient growth arrest, and/or apoptosis (1Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O.

The p53 tumor supressor gene has been shown to be required for a G1 phase arrest following treatment with agents producing DNA strand breaks and other lesions in DNA (1Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O.

Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Google Scholar). It may play a role also in cell cycle arrest in the G2 and M phases but is not strictly required (6Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Google Scholar, 7Cross S.M. Sanchez C.A. Morgan C.A. Schimke M.K. Ramel S. Idzerda R.L. Raskind W.H. Reid B.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Google Scholar). However, other pathways for apoptosis are evident, since cells lacking normal p53 may also undergo apoptosis following various cellular stresses (9Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 849-852Google Scholar, 10Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Google Scholar). Models have been proposed whereby specific gene products are involved in various aspects of the DNA damage response. However, there are many missing pieces in all of these pathways that may include novel proteins. The five gadd genes were originally isolated as UV-inducible transcripts in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus-1; IR, ionizing radiation; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; poly(A), polyadenylated RNA; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); Gy, gray(s). 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus-1; IR, ionizing radiation; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; poly(A), polyadenylated RNA; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); Gy, gray(s).cells. All five gadd genes were also found to be inducible by stressful growth arrest and by various types of DNA damage, hence the designation gadd. GADD33, GADD34, GADD45, and GADD153 are expressed in human cells and are inducible by a wide variety of genotoxic agents. The mouse homolog of GADD153, CHOP, has been shown to be a member of the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors. The protein binds other CCAAT enhancer-binding protein family members and changes their DNA sequence binding specificity (12Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar). A translocation that leads to a fusion between GADD153 and an RNA-binding protein is associated with myxoid liposarcomas, and this fusion protein shows altered biochemical properties relative to the normal GADD153 protein (13Barone M.V. Crozat A.Y. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Google Scholar). The GADD45 protein is also a predominantly nuclear protein that binds proliferating cell nuclear protein and whose expression is regulated by the tumor supressor p53 as mentioned above (14Smith M.L. Chen I. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C. Gilmer T. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1376-1380Google Scholar, 15Carrier F. Smith M.L. Bae I. Kilpatrick K.E. Lansing T.J. Chen C.-Y. Engelstein M. Friend S.H. Henner W.D. Gilmer T. Kastan M.B. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32672-32677Google Scholar). GADD153, GADD45, and GADD34 all lead to growth inhibition as measured by colony formation when overexpressed in several human cells lines (16Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Google Scholar). Interestingly, combinations of these three genes, when overexpressed, lead to synergistic or cooperative effects, suggesting that they inhibit growth through different and perhaps complementary pathways. Apoptosis occurs in certain cell types after treatment with genotoxic agents. Since these treatments also induce the gadd genes, it has been suggested that the gadd genes may be involved in apoptosis as well as in growth arrest after DNA damage. The decrease in plating efficiency in response to overexpression of the gaddgenes could be due to the stimulation of apoptosis, a permanent inhibition of cell growth, necrosis, or any combination of these. GADD34 is the human/hamster homolog of the mouseMyD116 cDNA that was subsequently isolated as a primary response transcript expressed during myeloid differentiation of M1 cells (17Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 637-645Google Scholar). Treatment of M1 cells with MMS leads to apoptosis without differentiation, while treatment with interleukin-6 or lung conditioned medium leads to a myeloid terminal differentiation program, which culminates in apoptosis. In mouse M1 cells, both thegadd and the MyD gene groups respond to MMS with increased mRNA within several hours. Differentiation of M1 cells with interleukin-6 or lung-conditioned medium leads to a rapid increase in MyD gene mRNA, while the gadd response occurs much later at a time that corresponds to the onset of apoptosis. However, gadd34/MyD116 was unique in that it showed a biphasic response, which was suggestive of both the gadd andMyD kinetics (16Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Google Scholar). Therefore, in this system, increased expression of gadd34/MyD116 coincides with apoptosis and not with differentiation or DNA damage alone. To further elucidate the regulation of GADD34 expression by DNA damage and possible functions of the GADD34 protein, a human GADD34 cDNA clone and genomic DNA clones for both the human and hamster genes were isolated and characterized. The human gene is inducible by various types of DNA damage and interestingly is induced by ionizing radiation (IR) in cells which undergo apoptosis following this treatment. The predicted human protein is 73.5 kDa and, like GADD45, GADD153, MDM2, and other damage-inducible proteins, is among the most highly negative charged of mammalian proteins (16Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Google Scholar). The predicted protein product of the GADD34 gene has a region of homology with two viral proteins. One of these, the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) protein γ134.5, is required for inhibition of apoptosis of HSV-1-infected neuroblastoma cells (18Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3266-3270Google Scholar). GADD34 has appreciable but less homology with the NL protein of the African swine fever virus, whose function is as yet unknown (19Stewart N. Hicks G.G. Paraskevas F. Mowat M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 109-115Google Scholar). This area of homology is limited to an 84-amino acid stretch at the carboxyl terminus of the two viral proteins and near the carboxyl terminus of the 674-amino acid GADD34. Substitution of the carboxyl terminus ofγ134.5 in the HSV-1 genome with the corresponding domain from MyD116, the mouse homolog of gadd34, prevented shutoff of protein synthesis and inhibited apoptosis similar to the wild type HSV-1 virus (20He B. Chou J. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 84-90Google Scholar). Based on this similarity, and the increased expression of GADD34 in cells treated with agents that elicit apoptosis, it is conceivable that GADD34 may be involved in apoptosis as well. A full-length hamstergadd34 probe, pXR34m, was used to screen a human λ ZAP XR cDNA library (Stratagene) to isolate a cDNA corresponding to the full-length human GADD34 transcript. This library was made from mRNA from ML-1 cells treated with 20 Gy of ionizing radiation harvested 3.5 h after treatment. A λ CHO FIXII library (Stratagene) was screened for hamster genomic clones. A human genomic clone, p1-1812, was obtained by polymerase chain reaction screening of a P1 library (Genome Systems) with GADD34-specific primers. The 5′ primer was CH040 (AAGAGGGAGTTGCTGAAGAGGAGGGAG), and the 3′ primer was CH041 (TCCTCCGTGGCTTGATTCTCTTCCTCC). Several p1-1812 fragments were subcloned into pGEM3Zf(−). Sequencing of the inserts of pHu34B and partially of pHG34B1 were done using the dideoxy chain termination method and by Lark Sequencing Technologies (Houston, TX). Sequence comparisons were done with the Genetics Computer Group Sequence Analysis Software Package (21Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information Blast program (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

For pPGK-Hygro, the hygromycin resistance gene was amplified from pREP4 (Invitrogen) by polymerase chain reaction and blunt end-ligated with the 4-kbPstI fragment of pKJ1 (23McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra C.N. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5755-5761Google Scholar). Plasmid 3056, which contains the human BCL-2 cDNA driven by the pCMV promoter, was obtained from Stanley Korsmeyer (24Walton M.I. Whysong D. O'Connor P.M. Hockenbery D. Korsmeyer S.J. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1853-1861Google Scholar). pCMV-ICP34.5 was made by inserting the 2-kbSphI fragment of pRB143 into pCMV.3. pZipBcl2-neo contains the human BCL-2 cDNA ligated into the BamHI site of pZipneoSV(X) and was obtained from J. Marie Hardwick (25Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Google Scholar). ML-1 and WMN cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. A549, Ovcar-4, and RKO cells were grown in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. MMS (Aldrich) was diluted immediately before use to 10 mg/ml in water. Cells were irradiated with a Shepherd Mark I model 68 137-Cs irradiator at 5 Gy/min. Other cell lines were grown as described in Ref. 26Zhan Q. Fan S. Bae I. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3743-3751Google Scholar. For RNA isolation, cells were rinsed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline and were then immediately lysed in situ with 5 ml of 4 m guanidine thiocyanate/150-cm tissue culture plate. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the acid phenol method (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Poly(A) RNA was isolated by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (28Fornace Jr., A.J. Mitchell J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5793-5811Google Scholar). Poly(A) RNA was size separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and blotted to nylon membranes (Nytran, Schleicher & Schull) or dot-blotted directly onto nylon membranes (29Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Google Scholar). cDNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using random nanomer primers and Klenow fragment and hybridized as described previously (29Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Google Scholar). The poly(A) content of all RNA samples was estimated by hybridization to a labeled polythymidylic acid probe (30Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 174-179Google Scholar). For RNase protection assays, a T7 RNA polymerase template was made using a 5′ promoter primer (CH067 = GCTATAAAACGCTAGTGG) and a 3′ first exon primer containing a T7 promoter (CH068 = CCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACCCCGGGGGCAGG). T7 RNA polymerase would generate a probe of 271 nucleotides, and this probe would protect a GADD34 fragment of approximately 220 bases based on the cDNA sequence. The glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe has been described previously (5Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Google Scholar). Probes were synthesized using the Maxiscript RNA transcription kit and T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion). RNase protection assays were done using Ambion's Ribonuclease Protection Assay Kit with the following conditions: 0.2 μg of poly(A) RNA, 2 × 105 dpm of GADD34 probe (2 × 109 dpm/μg), and 1 × 104 dpm of GAPDH probe (2 × 107 dpm/μg) were hybridized overnight in 20 μl of 80% formamide hybridization buffer at 50 °C. RNA hybrids were digested for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.05 unit of RNase A and 10 units of RNase T1. Radioactivity for RNA dot blots, Northern blots, and RNase protection assays was counted on a Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen). Chromosomal localization was performed by Bios Inc. DNA from p1-1812 was labeled with biotin-dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized with normal metaphase chromosomes derived from PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 × SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slides in fluoresceinated avidin. Following signal detection the slides were counterstained with propidium iodide and analyzed. A total of 120 metaphase cells were analyzed with 113 cells exhibiting specific labeling. Based on the number of clones obtained from the human cDNA library screen, the abundance of GADD34 mRNA was estimated to be less than 0.01% of polyadenylated messages in untreated ML-1 cells. Since theGADD34 transcript size is 2.4 kb, several cDNA clones of over 2.2 kb were considered to be nearly full length when the poly(A) tail is taken into consideration. The 2330-bp insert of pHu34B was predicted to comprise a nearly full-length GADD34 cDNA. This clone contains the entire open reading frame and 221 bp of 5′ nontranslated sequence (Fig. 1). The 3′-untranslated sequence is 87 bp. The human GADD34 cDNA has 67–68% identity with the mouse (MyD116) and hamster homologs, while the hamster and mouse have 77% identity between them. At the amino acid level, the human protein has 52–55% identity and 67–70% similarity with the rodent proteins using the GAP program of the Genetics Computer Group Sequence Analysis Software Package (21Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). The hamster and mouse proteins are 69% identical with 79% similarity. The predicted human GADD34 protein is 674 amino acids with a predicted size of 73.5 kDa and a pI of 4.4. The protein would be expected to have a net charge of −64 and a net charge per amino acid percent of −9.5. This is similar to both hamster and mouse GADD34 proteins and also to protein products from other gadd and related genes (16Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Google Scholar). The hamster and mouse proteins are expected to be 64.5 and 71.8 kDa, respectively. The human GADD34 protein, like the hamster and mouse homologs, contains a series of repeated sequences in the center portion of the predicted protein. These repeats are 34 amino acids long for the human protein and 40 and 39 for the hamster and mouse proteins, respectively. The hamster protein has 3.5 copies, and the mouse protein 4.5 copies of this sequence, while the human protein has 4 copies. The repeats of the mouse and hamster proteins are arranged in tandem, while the human repeats are separated by varying numbers of amino acids (data not shown). The repeats of the hamster and mouse proteins show nearly 100% identity to each other. However, the human repeats show less similarity to each other and to the rodent repeats (Fig.2). There were two additional sequences in the human cDNA that showed limited similarity with the other human repeats (data not shown).Figure 2Similarity of repeats within the human GADD34 protein. The four copies of the human repeated amino acid sequence are indicated with their locations. Highlighted amino acids are shared by two or more of the repeats. The lower two lines represent the consensus from these repeats for the hamster and mouse GADD34 proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A search of the data bases for sequences homologous to the humanGADD34 yielded two viral proteins, one of which has nearly 50% identity to human GADD34 in an 90-amino acid region (Fig.3). This protein, herpes simplex virus type-1-infected cell protein 34.5 (γ134.5 or ICP34.5) was previously known to have homology to the rodent GADD34 sequences (16Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Google Scholar, 31Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Google Scholar). The other viral protein, the African swine fever virus NL protein, shows less homology to GADD34, but this is in the same region as the homology to γ134.5. In GADD34, this region is the most highly conserved between species with greater than 90% amino acid homology. Several nucleolin proteins were somewhat homologous to GADD34, but this similarity was limited mostly to aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues present at high numbers in both GADD34 and nucleolin (data not shown). GADD34 was found to be a single copy gene as only one band is visualized on genomic Southern blots when human DNA was cut with 6-bp recognition restriction enzymes, and the full-length cDNA was used as probe (data not shown). Genomic clone p1-1812 hybridized at high stringency with a probe made from the insert in pHu34B. Equivalent sized hybridizing bands were observed with p1-1812 and genomic DNA after DNA was cut with the 6-bp recognizing restriction enzymes HindIII, EcoRI,BamHI, XbaI, and KpnI (data not shown). Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that the human GADD34 gene has two introns and that translation begins in the second exon (data not shown). To facilitate analysis of proximal genomic sequences, several genomic fragments were subcloned from p1-1812. pHG34B1 has a 2.1-kb insert containing approximately 600 bp of the promoter through the middle of the second exon. pHG34E contains a 9.1-kb fragment containing approximately 2.6 kb ofGADD34 promoter and the entire coding region. Comparison of the human and hamster gadd34 promoters revealed only limited homology. Approximately 250 bp of the proximal promoter showed about 75% homology between species (Fig.4). However, a TATA box was conserved at −48 and −51 in both human and hamster gadd34, respectively. At −77 (human) and −76 (hamster) a 10-bp binding site for the activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP response element binding family of transcription factors was also conserved. Just distal to this is a GC box, which may bind the Sp1 transcription factor. There is one other GC box in the promoter as well as one in the first intron, although these are not conserved between species (data not shown). In the human promoter, an Alu sequence occurred from −784 to −319. To roughly map the transcription start site, an antisense genomic riboprobe extending 58 bp more 5′ than the start of the cDNA, Hu34B, was hybridized to mRNA and digested with RNase. The size of the protected fragment was very close to the expected size of 220 bases by comparison with molecular size markers (data not shown). The rodentgadd34 transcript was previously found to be inducible by treatment of cells with various types of DNA damaging agents (16Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Google Scholar, 32Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Google Scholar). As expected, the human GADD34 transcript was increased also by these agents in several cell types. In all cells tested, treatment with the alkylating agent MMS led to increased GADD34mRNA within several hours (Fig. 5). Previous data had shown that maximum transcript levels are seen 4 h following DNA damage in rodent cells (29Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Google Scholar). In human cells of lymphoid origin, ionizing irradiation caused an increase in GADD34 mRNA levels (Fig. 5, Table I). Similar to BAX, induction of GADD34 by IR plateaued at a low dose (5 Gy), while induction of the p53-regulated GADD45 continued to increase with increasing dose (Fig. 6 A). Unlike previously published data for induction of GADD34 by MMS, maximal levels of GADD34 following IR were seen at 8 h but decreased to near basal levels by 12 h (Fig.6 B). This is in contrast to the rodent gadd34transcript, which was not increased by ionizing radiation in any rodent cell type examined (data not shown). Induction of GADD34 by IR was also not seen in multiple human monolayer cell lines of various tissue origins (Fig. 5, Table I). However, induction by MMS was greater in these adherent cells than in suspension cells (Fig. 5). As a control transcript, levels of GAPDH mRNA varied by less than 2-fold.Table IInduction of GADD34 is associated with apoptosis but is independent of p53 statusCell lineCell typep53 status1-bp53 status in various lines is quoted from previous work (5,26, 42). wt, wild type; mut, mutant.G1arrest1-cData for G1 arrest in human cells are taken from Ref. 5 and was carried out at 2 and 4 Gy or at 6 Gy in Burkitt's lymphoma lines (43).apoptosis1-dApoptosis in human cells was determined by DNA degradation measured by gel electrophoresis or by filter elution as described previously (26).Fold increase in relative mRNAaHuman cells with normal or abnormal p53 status were treated with 20 Gy of ionizing radiation.

https://openalex.org/W2164218605,"Smad proteins are a family of highly conserved, intracellular proteins that signal cellular responses downstream of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family serine/threonine kinase receptors. One of these molecules, Smad4, originally identified as the candidate tumor suppressor gene dpc-4, reconstitutes TGF-β- and activin-dependent transcriptional responses in Smad4 null cell lines and interacts in a ligand-dependent manner with other Smad family members in both TGF-β, activin, and bone morphogenetic protein-2/-4 pathways. Here, we used an assay based on the restoration of ligand-dependent transcriptional responses in a Smad4 null cell line to characterize functional domain structures within Smad4. We showed that restoration of TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses by Smad4 was inhibited by co-transfection with a kinase dead TGF-β type II receptor and that constitutive activation was blocked with TGF-β neutralizing antibodies, confirming the essential role of Smad4 in TGF-β signaling. Using a series of Smad4 mutation, deletion, and Smad1/Smad4 chimera constructs we identified a 47-amino acid deletion within the middle-linker region of Smad4 that is essential for the mediation of signaling responses. In addition, we showed that the NH2-terminal domain of Smad4 augments ligand-dependent activation associated with the middle-linker region, indicating that there is a distinct ligand-response domain within the N terminus of this molecule.

TGF-β 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; SAD, Smad4 activation domain. is the prototype for a family of structurally related proteins that mediate a diverse array of biological functions in organisms as disparate as the fruit fly and man. Cloning and characterization of TGF-β family receptors revealed that these ligands signal through two interacting transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (1Massague J. Cell.. 1996; 85: 947-950Google Scholar). While it is recognized that the ligand binds the type II receptor, which then recruits and transphosphorylates the type I receptor to signal downstream pathways (2Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar), the mechanisms involved in mediating signaling cascades downstream of the type I receptor were, until recently, largely unknown. Clues from Drosophila genetics have been applied to identify a number of novel mammalian proteins involved in signaling downstream of TGF-β family members (1Massague J. Cell.. 1996; 85: 947-950Google Scholar). In Drosophila, decapentaplegic (dpp) encodes a TGF-β superfamily ligand that is essential for dorsal-ventral patterning in developing fruit flies (3Gelbart, W. M. (1989) Development (Camb.)107, (suppl.) 65–74.Google Scholar). Genetic screening for mutants acting in this pathway identified a novel gene, Mothers against dpp(mad), which encodes an essential cytoplasmic element in the dpp signal transduction pathway (4Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A. Chartoff E.H. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1347-1358Google Scholar, 5Newfeld S.J. Chartoff E.H. Graff J.M. Melton D.A. Gelbart W.M. Development ( Camb .). 1996; 122: 2099-2108Google Scholar). Searches for Mad-related proteins in other organisms have revealed an array of conserved homologues in species from Caenorhabditis elegans to man (1Massague J. Cell.. 1996; 85: 947-950Google Scholar). Characteristically these proteins contain highly conserved NH2- and COOH-terminal domains separated by a proline-rich linker and lack any known enzymatic or functional sequence motifs. Five mammalian Mad-related proteins, Smad1 through 5, have been characterized and shown to participate in signaling responses induced by TGF-β, activin, and BMP2/4. The rudimentary mechanisms of action of the Smad family proteins are now beginning to be understood. For example, Smad1 is phosphorylated and undergoes nuclear translocation following treatment with BMP2, BMP4 (6Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Google Scholar, 7Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Google Scholar), and possibly TGF-β (8Lechleider R.J. de Caestecker M.P. Dehejia A. Polymeropoulos M.H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17617-17620Google Scholar, 9Yingling J.M. Das P. Savage C. Zhang M. Padgett R.W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8940-8944Google Scholar), while Smad2 is phosphorylated and undergoes nuclear translocation in response to TGF-β and activin (10Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Google Scholar,11Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P., A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J., L Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event occurs in association with the activated TGF-β receptors and results in dissociation of Smad2 from the receptor complex and translocation to the nucleus (11Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P., A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J., L Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Google Scholar). Recent studies using Xenopus embryos indicate that Smad2 forms a transcriptional complex with the winged-helix transcription factor FAST1 when co-injected with activin mRNA (12Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Google Scholar), providing a downstream mechanism whereby activin response elements may be activated following ligand-induced phosphorylation of Smad2. Interestingly, Smad3 has also been shown to signal in the TGF-β pathway, to associate with the activated TGF-β receptor complex, and to be phosphorylated following activation (13Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Google Scholar), suggesting that receptor-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation may represent a more generalized phenomenon. Furthermore, Smad1 displays transcriptional activity in response to BMP4 when fused to a heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain (7Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Google Scholar), indicating that other members of Smad family may act as transcriptional activators once translocated to the nucleus. Smad4 is a Mad-related protein independently identified as the candidate tumor suppressor gene dpc4, deleted or mutated in a proportion of pancreatic (14Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Google Scholar), breast, ovarian (15Schutte M. Hruban R.H. Hedrick L.

Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 343-348Google Scholar), with tumor suppressor activity attributable to its participation in TGF-β receptor-mediated signaling (13Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Google Scholar, 17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar). However, while this molecule shares broad sequence similarity with the other Smad family members, it displays significant variance in all three molecular domains (1Massague J. Cell.. 1996; 85: 947-950Google Scholar), suggesting that it may have distinct functional characteristics. For example, while Smad4 has been clearly implicated in both TGF-β and activin signaling pathways (13Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Google Scholar, 17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar), it is phosphorylated only in response to activin (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar) and does not associate with activated TGF-β receptor complexes (11Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P., A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J., L Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Google Scholar, 13Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Google Scholar). Smad4 also lacks the COOH-terminal serine residues that are phosphorylated in Smad2 following activation of the TGF-β receptor complex (11Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P., A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J., L Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Google Scholar) and are present in all the other mammalian Smad family members. In addition, Smad4 not only forms ligand-dependent heterodimeric complexes with Smad2 following activation of TGF-β or activin pathways, but also with Smad1 following activation through BMP2/4 receptors (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar). These data further support a model in which Smad4 acts in a manner distinct from Smad1, -2, and -3, and is central to signaling pathways involving multiple TGF-β family ligands. However, the mechanisms regulating ligand-dependent transmission of signaling responses by Smad4 remain largely unknown. In this study, we employ an assay based on the restoration of ligand-dependent transcriptional responses in a Smad4 null cell line to characterize the functional domains within Smad4 that are essential for the mediation of TGF-β-dependent signaling responses. Using a series of mutants, chimeras, and deletion constructs, we have identified a 47-amino acid region within the proline-rich middle linker domain of Smad4 which, when deleted, disrupts the ability of the wild-type protein to restore TGF-β-dependent signal transduction in the Smad4 null cell line. We also show that the NH2-terminal domain of Smad4 enhances TGF-β -dependent activation associated with the middle-linker region, indicating that there is separate ligand-response domain within the N terminus of this molecule. Mutant, chimeric, deletion, and COOH-terminal constructs were designed as shown in the Figs. 5, 6, and 8 based on the known sequence similarity domains (8Lechleider R.J. de Caestecker M.P. Dehejia A. Polymeropoulos M.H. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17617-17620Google Scholar), and cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector. These were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification and primer extension with proofreading polymerase, using Smad4 and Smad1 templates. Deletion constructs were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide method.Figure 6Mapping of the activation domain in Smad4. A, schematic of intra-domain Smad4 deletions.

All cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cellular proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (18Danielpour D. Dart L.L. Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 79-86Google Scholar), after treatment with or without 10 ng/ml recombinant human TGF-β1 over a 48-h period in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant human TGF-β1 was labeled with 125Iodine using the chloramine-T method (19Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 60% confluence in 100-mm plates and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 100 pm [125I] TGF-β1 with or without 100-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 competitor. Cross-linking was performed with disuccinimidyl suberate as described previously (20Glick A.B. Danielpour D. Morgan D. Sporn M.B. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 46-52Google Scholar), samples subjected to electrophoresis on a 4–12% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Cells were seeded in six-well dishes, incubated for 18 h in medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum with or without 1 ng/ml TGF-β1, and labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine over the last 6 h. After metabolic labeling, PAI-1 and fibronectin were extracted from the cell associated extracellular matrix and supernatants, respectively, as described previously (21Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar). Both preparations were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. PAI-1 and fibronectin were identified from their characteristic sizes (45 and 240 kDa) and inducibility by TGF-β in a TGF-β-responsive cell line. MDA-MB468 cells were transiently transfected using the polyamine transfection reagent LT-2 (Pan Vera Co.). Cells were seeded to 50% confluence in six-well plates and incubated in serum-free medium with LT-2, cDNAs, reporter constructs, and empty vector to equalize amounts of DNA. After 6 h, cells were washed and allowed to recover for 24 h in growth medium. Cells were serum starved overnight prior to the addition of TGF-β1 for a further 24 h. Luciferase activity was determined in the cell lysate using an assay kit (Analytic Luminescence Laboratory), and a Dynatech Laboratories ML3000 luminometer. Activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression from pSV β-galactosidase in all luciferase reporter experiments. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. To develop a functional assay for Smad4, we used the MDA-MB468 breast carcinoma cell line that has a homozygous deletion of the complete Smad4 coding region (15Schutte M. Hruban R.H. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Nadasdy G.M. Weinstein C.L. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Cairns P. Nawroz H. Sidransky D. Casero R.A. Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis shows that these cells express Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad5 and confirms the absence of Smad4 mRNA expression. 2R. J. Lechleider, unpublished data. Receptor cross-linking shows that these cells express types I and II TGF-β receptors (Fig.1 A), but show no growth inhibitory (Fig.1 B), PAI-1 or fibronectin induction responses to TGF-β (Fig. 1 C). Having established that Smad4 deficiency is associated with a lack of responsiveness to TGF-β, we performed a series of experiments to characterize the role of this molecule in TGF-β-dependent signaling responses. Transient transfection with Smad4 and the reporter constructs p3TP-Lux (which contains multiple TGF-β response elements (21Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar)) or p800-Luc (which contains only the PAI-1 gene promoter (22Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.-J. Loskutoff D.J. J Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Google Scholar)), resulted in a clear activation of luciferase reporter activity in response to TGF-β (Fig.2 A). Ligand-dependent activation of p800-Luc was lower than that of p3TP-Lux, although both were dependent on the dose of Smad4 DNA added to the transfection mix (Fig.2 A) and the concentration of exogenous TGF-β used to treat the cells (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Smad4 restores TGF-β responsiveness inSmad4 null cells. MDA-MB468 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs along with pSV β-galactosidase and TGF-β-responsive reporter constructs. Following transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 24 h prior to the addition of TGF-β 1 for an additional 24 h. Cell lysate luciferase activity was determined and activities corrected on the basis of β-galactosidase expression in all luciferase reporter experiments. Results are expressed as the mean (± S.D.) of duplicate luciferase assays from a representative experiment. A, transfection with Smad4 restores transcriptional activation responses to TGF-β. Cells were transfected with the indicated concentrations of Smad4 and/or empty vector, and two TGF-β-responsive reporter constructs, p3TP-Lux (left panel) or p800-Luc (right panel). The results are standardized as fold changes relative to the untreated vector, and the experiment repeated three times with similar results. B, transfection with Smad4 restores dose-dependent transcriptional activation responses to TGF-β. MDA-MB468 cells were transfected using 1 μg of Smad4 DNA/reaction with the indicated reporter constructs and treated with varying concentrations of TGF-β1 for 24 h. Results are shown from a representative experiment, repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if these responses were TGF-β receptor-dependent, we evaluated reporter gene activation after co-transfection of TGF-β type I and type II receptors with and without Smad4 (Fig. 3 A). Transfection of TGF-β type I or type II receptors alone had no effect on the transcriptional response to TGF-β, although co-transfection of Smad4 with the TGF-β type II receptor caused an apparent ligand-independent activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter gene (Fig. 3 A). Importantly, this effect was blocked almost entirely by treatment with TGF-β neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the apparently ligand-independent signaling response seen in cells transfected with both the type II TGF-β receptor and Smad4 is the result of stimulation by secreted TGF-β. In addition, while transfection of the kinase inactive TGF-β type II receptor alone had no effect on the transcriptional response to TGF-β, co-transfection of the mutant receptor with Smad4 caused a nearly complete loss of ligand-induced signaling (Fig. 4), confirming the receptor specificity of the Smad4 induced response. Furthermore, basal transcriptional activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter with Smad4 was also inhibited by co-transfection with the kinase-inactive type II TGF-β receptor, indicating that stimulation of endogenous receptors by autocrine or paracrine TGF-β may account for some of the constitutive activation seen in the absence of additional exogenous ligand.Figure 4Dominant negative activity of a kinase inactive TGF-β type II receptor on the restoration of signaling responses by Smad4. MDA-MB468 cells were transfected with the p3TP-Lux reporter and the indicated constructs prior to treatment with TGF-β1.

Furthermore missense mutations of a highly conserved glycine residue in the COOH-terminal domain ofDrosophila Mad, and C. elegans Sma2, generate null phenotypes in both species (4Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A. Chartoff E.H. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1347-1358Google Scholar, 23Savage C. Das P. Finelli A.L. Townsend S.R. Sun C.Y. Baird S.E. Padgett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 790-794Google Scholar), indicating that the functional activity of these molecules may be disrupted by specific point mutations within this domain. The corresponding glycine to serine substitution at position 508 in Smad4 (Fig. 5A) did not abolish ligand-dependent augmentation of reporter gene activation, although it significantly reduced the maximal luciferase induction compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that the biological inactivation resulting from mutation of this residue in other Mad-related proteins (4Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A. Chartoff E.H. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1347-1358Google Scholar, 10Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L.

A. 1996; 93: 790-794Google Scholar) may result from a decrease in specific transcriptional responses below critical levels rather than a total loss of function. Alternatively, other Mad family members may be completely inactivated by this mutation, while the Smad4 G508S mutation retains some signaling activity. The COOH-terminal domains of Smad1 (234–465) and Smad4 (266–552) display constitutive transcriptional activity when fused to a heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain, while the full-length Smad1 fusion protein demonstrates ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (7Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Google Scholar). In addition, Lagna et al.(17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar) have shown a constitutive, ligand-independent activation of p3TP-Lux reporter activity when MDA-MB468 Smad4 null cells are transfected with the 266–552 COOH-terminal Smad4 construct. In our study, however, neither the Smad1 (270–465) nor the Smad4 (322–552) COOH-terminal domain constructs (Fig. 5 A) induced constitutive or ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that there may be an activation domain between amino acids 266–321 in Smad4, which is involved in the regulation of signaling responses by this protein. To define the activation domain within the middle-linker region of Smad4 further, we created a series of amino acid deletions within this region (Fig. 6 A). When these constructs were transfected into MDA-MB468 cells, the ΔM1 (136–181) and ΔM2 (182–227) deletions had similar functional activity to the full-length molecule in restoring TGF-β-dependent activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter. In contrast, deletion of amino acids 228–273 in ΔM3 substantially reduced this response, while the ΔM4 (274–321) deletion had virtually no signaling activity (Fig. 6b). Smad1 alone does not restore reporter gene activation in MDA-MB468 cells, nor does it augment Smad4-dependent activity (Fig.5 B; Fig. 7). For this reason, we were able to extend our studies to identify regions of Smad4 that confer ligand-specific responses, by generating a panel of domain-swap chimeras between Smad4 and Smad1 (Fig. 8 A). Like the Smad4 G508S mutant, none of the chimeras reconstituted the degree of luciferase expression seen with intact Smad4 (Fig.8 B), but the presence of a Smad4 proline-rich linker domain was associated with reproducible ligand-responsive reporter gene activation, regardless of the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domain structures. Furthermore, while the N-terminal domain of Smad4 had no effect on ligand-dependent transcriptional activity in the 4.1.1 and 4.1.4 chimeras, ligand-dependent activation was dramatically increased when the Smad4 NH2 terminus was associated with the Smad4 middle-linker domain in the 4.4.1 chimera, bringing the level of ligand-dependent activation to within 36 (±7)% of the full-length Smad4 (results from three separate experiments expressed as mean (±S.D.)). This is comparable with the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation seen with the G508S mutation of Smad4 (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that this mutation may be functioning like the 4.4.1 chimera, with incomplete activation of response elements in Smad4. These data indicate that there is a ligand-response domain within the N terminus of Smad4 and that this region requires the presence of a Smad4 middle-linker domain to produce ligand-dependent transcriptional activation responses to TGF-β. Smad4/DPC4 is a member of the Smad family of intracellular signaling proteins and appears to be central to signaling pathways involving multiple TGF-β family ligands (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar). Despite this, the mechanisms regulating the transmission of signaling responses by this molecule are largely unknown. In these studies, we characterize separate activation and ligand-response domains within Smad4 using a functional assay based on the restoration of TGF-β responsiveness in a Smad4 null cell line by transient transfection with Smad4. We have shown that restoration of cellular responses to TGF-β by Smad4 in MDA-MB468 cells is dependent on TGF-β receptor function, as reporter gene activation is inhibited by co-transfection with a kinase-inactive TGF-β type II receptor mutant shown previously to exert a dominant negative effect on TGF-β -induced transcriptional responses in other systems (24Brand T. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8274-8284Google Scholar). Furthermore, augmentation of basal reporter gene activation seen following co-transfection of Smad4 and the wild-type TGF-β type II receptor, and its reversal following incubation of the transfected cells with TGF-β neutralizing antibodies, indicates that restoration of cellular responses following transfection with Smad4 is dependent both on the level of receptor expression and the degree of autocrine or paracrine stimulation of this pathway resulting from the secretion of TGF-β into the culture medium. In the same manner, basal reporter gene activation following transfection with Smad4 alone could be inhibited by co-transfection with a kinase inactive TGF-β type II receptor, indicating that stimulation of endogenous receptors by secreted TGF-β could account for some of the variability in basal activation of this system. This also has implications for other assay systems. For example, the apparently ligand-independent activation of a PAI-1 reporter construct seen following co-transfection of Smad3 and Smad4 into Smad4 null SW480 cells (13Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Google Scholar) could result from the effects of endogenous TGF-β on this cell line. Indeed these authors showed that constitutive reporter gene activation associated with transfection of Smad3 and Smad4 was reduced when their cells were co-transfected with a dominant negative TGF-β type II receptor construct, indicating that the observed basal reporter gene activation is likely to have resulted from stimulation of the TGF-β receptor signaling pathway by endogenous TGF-β. Having characterized this assay for Smad4, we have used it to identify functional domains within the Smad4 molecule that are involved in regulating TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses. Comparison of our initial studies, demonstrating that a 322–552 COOH-terminal Smad4 construct had no effect on constitutive or ligand-dependent activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter gene (Fig. 5), with those of Lagnaet al. (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar) demonstrating constitutive p3TP-Lux activation in the same cell line following transfection with a 266–552 Smad4 construct (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar), indicates that there may be critical residues within the intervening amino acids 266–321 in Smad4 that are required to activate signaling responses by this protein. We have delineated this region further with the demonstration that deletion of amino acid residues 274–321 in Smad4 prevents the restoration of TGF-β responsiveness by this molecule in our assay system (Fig. 6). While it is possible that this is an indirect effect resulting from conformational disruption of other domain structures within Smad4, taken together with data derived using the Smad4 COOH-terminal constructs, these results suggest that there is an SAD within the COOH-terminal portion of the middle-linker region of Smad4 that is necessary for this molecule to transduce signaling responses downstream from TGF-β receptors. This domain of Smad4 shows minimal sequence similarity with the other Smad family members, and it is of interest that a COOH-terminal Smad1 construct 234–465, corresponding to residues 270–552 in Smad4, does not restore constitutive activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter in this assay system (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar), indicating that the localization of the SAD between residues 274 and 322 in Smad4 may be unique to this particular Smad family member. Transfection with the full-length Smad4 induces a much lower basal activation of the p3TP-Lux reporter gene than the 266–552 construct (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar). This suggests that the signaling response associated the SAD is reversibly inhibited by either direct or indirect interaction with structures upstream of residue 266 in the full-length Smad4. Interestingly, Baker and Harland (25Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1880-1889Google Scholar) describe a constitutively active NH2-terminal truncation of Smad2 184–467, corresponding to residues 160–552 in Smad4, that may result from the deletion of a similar inhibitory component in the NH2 terminus of this molecule. Our data indicate that this type of inhibitory domain is also located within the NH2 terminus of Smad4, as none of the segmental deletions upstream of the SAD and within the middle-linker domain of Smad4 ΔM1, ΔM2, and ΔM3 (137–273) were constitutively active in our assay system (Fig. 6). On this basis, ligand-activated signal transduction by Smad4 may result from dissociation of intra- or extramolecular inhibitory structures from the SAD, themselves under the regulation of a ligand-responsive region within the NH2terminus of Smad4. Experiments using the Smad1/Smad4 domain swap chimeras further characterize the activation and ligand-responsive domains in Smad4. Thus, while the proline-rich linker domain of Smad4 is essential for the transduction of TGF-β signaling responses by the Smad1/Smad4 chimeras, results with the 1.4.4 and 1.4.1 chimeras show that the activity of this region is only weakly enhanced by the NH2-terminal domain of Smad1. In contrast, TGF-β responses are significantly enhanced when the Smad1 NH2terminus is swapped for the corresponding NH2-terminal domain of Smad4 in the 4.4.1 chimera (Fig. 8). This indicates that there is a ligand-response domain located within the NH2terminus of Smad4 and that the ligand-dependent regulatory activity of this domain requires the presence of the Smad4 middle-linker region. Taken together, these data suggest a model for Smad4 functional domains that is reminiscent of that of other signaling molecules. In the absence of ligand, the NH2 terminus and/or middle-linker domains of Smad4 may obscure the SAD located at the extreme COOH terminus of the middle-linker domain, either by direct blockade of this region or by conformational interference. Following ligand-activation, there may be unfolding of the molecular structure resulting in exposure of the SAD, allowing it to interact with other signaling partners. This event is not associated with phosphorylation of Smad4 (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar), but may result from intermolecular conformational interference with NH2-terminal domain structures following association between Smad4 and other, activated Smad family members (17Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar). Identification of specific activation domains within the N terminus and how they interact with the rest of the molecule will help elucidate this mechanism.

Our solution of the crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ revealed a conserved amphipathic groove that may allow the association of 14-3-3 with diverse ligands (Liu, D., Bienkowska, J., Petosa, C., Collier, R. J., Fu, H., and Liddington, R. (1995)Nature 376, 191–194). Here, the contributions of three positively charged residues (Lys-49, Arg-56, and Arg-60) that lie in this Raf-binding groove were investigated. Two of the charge-reversal mutations greatly (K49E) or partially (R56E) decreased the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with Raf-1 kinase, whereas R60E showed only subtle effects on the binding. Interestingly, these mutations exhibited similar effects on the functional interaction of 14-3-3ζ with another target protein, exoenzyme S (ExoS), an ADP-ribosyltransferase fromPseudomonas aeruginosa. The EC50 values of 14-3-3ζ required for ExoS activation increased by ∼110-, 5-, and 2-fold for the K49E, R56E, and R60E mutants, respectively. The drastic reduction of 14-3-3ζ/ligand affinity by the K49E mutation is due to a local electrostatic effect, rather than the result of a gross structural alteration, as evidenced by partial proteolysis and circular dichroism analysis. This work identifies the first point mutation (K49E) that dramatically disrupts 14-3-3ζ/ligand interactions. The parallel effects of this single point mutation on both Raf-1 binding and ExoS activation strongly suggest that diverse associated proteins share a common structural binding determinant on 14-3-3ζ. 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved dimeric molecules that bind to a range of cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and oncogenesis.

Multiple biochemical activities have been ascribed to the 14-3-3 family of proteins, although the precise function of 14-3-3 in cellular regulation is unclear. They have been shown to activate tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases (6Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 79-82Google Scholar, 7Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Araki K. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7084-7088Google Scholar) and are involved in the regulation of protein kinase C activity (8Toker A.

In vitro, 14-3-3 directly activates a bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase, exoenzyme S (ExoS), 1The abbreviations used are: ExoS, exoenzyme S from P. aeruginosa; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SBTI, soybean trypsin inhibitor; WT, wild-type. 1The abbreviations used are: ExoS, exoenzyme S from P. aeruginosa; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SBTI, soybean trypsin inhibitor; WT, wild-type. from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Google Scholar). Because of its specificity and sensitivity, activation of ExoS has been used as a simple functional assay for the presence of 14-3-3 proteins (12Fu H. Xia K. Pallas D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 266: 126-129Google Scholar). Recently, members of the 14-3-3 protein family were found to associate with a number of proto-oncogene and oncogene products (13Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-57Google Scholar) as well as with proteins involved in apoptosis. These 14-3-3-associated proteins include Raf kinases (12Fu H. Xia K. Pallas D.C. Cui C. Conroy K.

Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Google Scholar). Through protein/protein interactions, 14-3-3 may regulate diverse cellular processes. The 14-3-3/Raf interaction has been extensively studied because of the central importance of Raf kinases in mitogenic signal transduction. Both in vivo and in vitro experimental data strongly support a biologically relevant interaction of 14-3-3 with Raf kinases. For instance, overexpression of either the yeast homologue,BMH1, or mammalian 14-3-3 stimulates the biological activity of mammalian Raf in budding yeast (14Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1716Google Scholar, 15Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Errede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1994; 265: 1716-1719Google Scholar). Additionally, microinjection of 14-3-3 mRNA into Xenopus oocytes promotes Raf-dependent oocyte maturation (16Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T. Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Google Scholar). Raf immunoprecipitates from yeast or oocytes in the above experiments have increased kinase activity. However, when Raf kinase activity is measured directly with purified 14-3-3 in vitro, no activation of Raf can be demonstrated (12Fu H. Xia K. Pallas D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 266: 126-129Google Scholar, 24Suen K.L. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 825-831Google Scholar, 25Li S. Janosch P. Tanji M. Rosenfeld G.C. Waymire J.C. Mischak H. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 685-696Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Dent et al. (26Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Google Scholar) found that 14-3-3 proteins can block the dephosphorylation and inactivation of Raf kinase by phosphatasesin vitro. Recent demonstration of oligomerization-induced Raf activation suggests an intriguing role of 14-3-3 in promoting Raf dimerization/oligomerization during the activation process (27Farrar M.A. Alberol I. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Google Scholar, 28Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Google Scholar) because it is possible for one dimeric 14-3-3 molecule to bind two Raf kinase molecules (29Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Google Scholar, 30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Google Scholar). A negative role of 14-3-3 in Raf regulation has also been postulated based on the observation that Raf-1 mutants unable to stably interact with 14-3-3 exhibit enhanced kinase activity in mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes and are biologically activated (31Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Google Scholar). However, it remains elusive how 14-3-3 proteins contribute to Raf signaling pathways. To understand the biological consequence of the 14-3-3/Raf interactionin vivo, it is important to determine the key residues of 14-3-3 required for Raf binding. Defined point mutants will provide essential tools for dissecting the role of 14-3-3 proteins in Raf activation and in cellular regulation in general. Toward this goal, we have solved the three-dimensional crystal structure of the ζ-isoform of the 14-3-3 proteins (30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Google Scholar). In the structure, each monomer of the dimeric protein consists of a bundle of nine α-helices organized in an antiparallel fashion. The four N-terminal α-helices participate in dimer formation. When viewed along the mean helix axis, the bundle of helices, α-helices 3–9, form a palisade. Residues that are conserved among members of the 14-3-3 family line the inside of this palisade and define a conserved groove. Not surprisingly, 14-3-3 proteins are also conserved at the tertiary structural level. The structure of 14-3-3τ (29Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Google Scholar) exhibits a very similar folded conformation to the ζ-isoform, and this should facilitate the identification of common residues of 14-3-3 required for ligand binding. Inspection of the surface property of the conserved groove of the 14-3-3ζ monomer reveals an amphipathic structure that is lined with charged residues on one side and hydrophobic residues on the other (30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Google Scholar). Based on the fact that 14-3-3 proteins bind to a wide range of cellular partners, it is possible that this conserved groove of 14-3-3ζ is involved in ligand binding. To test the crystal structure model, we set about to systematically analyze the contribution of individual residues in the amphipathic groove to ligand binding. Here, we report the identification of the first point mutation (K49E) of 14-3-3 proteins that disrupts the association of 14-3-3ζ with Raf-1 kinase and diminishes its ability to activate ExoS. The impaired binding is not due to gross alteration of the mutant 14-3-3ζ protein based on our partial proteolysis and CD analysis. The concomitant effects of a single point mutation on both Raf binding and ExoS activation strongly suggest that diverse ligands may share a common site on 14-3-3 proteins and that Lys-49 may represent a general site for ligand binding. Escherichia coli strains were grown routinely at 37 °C in LB broth or on LB agar plates (15 g/l). Ampicillin was used as required at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for the propagation of plasmids, and strain BL21(DE3) was used for expression of proteins using bacteriophage T7 promoter-based overexpression vectors (32Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains were grown at 30 °C either in rich medium or in synthetic medium supplemented with relevant amino acids and 2% glucose or galactose as a carbon source (33Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1987, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). Minipreparation of plasmids, restriction enzyme digestion, subcloning procedures, cell transformation, and other molecular biology procedures were performed essentially as described (33Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1987, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar) or as indicated. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed using Sequenase Version 2.0 (Amersham Corp.). Restriction enzymes and other molecular biology reagents were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), Promega (Madison, WI), and Life Technologies, Inc. pHAF625 is a pUC19-based shuttle vector for 14-3-3ζ subcloning. The DNA sequence encoding 14-3-3ζ was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pHAF612 (11Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Google Scholar) as a template. The following primers were used to introduce required restriction sites for the subsequent in-frame fusion constructions: 5′-GTCAAGAGGGAATTCCATATGGATAAAAACGAGCTG-3′ (EcoRI and NdeI sites underlined) and 5′-CGTATAGAATTCGTCGACTCATTAATTTTCCCCTCC-3′ (EcoRI and SalI sites underlined). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pUC19 at the EcoRI site with the 14-3-3ζ gene in the opposite orientation of lacZ. To introduce appropriate restriction sites for in-frame fusion of various versions of Raf-1 kinase, we constructed three basic Raf vectors. For this purpose, Raf sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with added restriction sites using a full-length raf gene as a template (33Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1987, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). The following primers were used: 1) 5′-GGATCCGAATTCCATATGGAGCACATACAG-3′ (EcoRI andNdeI sites underlined), 2) 5′-CAGGGTACCATCGATCTATGGTGCCCGCTCTCT-3′ (ClaI site underlined), 3) 5′-CATATGGAATTCGTATCTGGGACCCAG-3′ (EcoRI site underlined), and 4) 5′-CAGGGTACCATCGATCTAGAAGACAGGCAG-3′ (ClaI site underlined). Primer pairs 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 were used to amplify the full-length sequence of the Raf-1 kinase and the N-terminal (Raf-N, residues 1–320) and C-terminal (Raf-C, residues 321–648) fragments, respectively. These polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with EcoRI and ClaI and subcloned into pKS(+) (Stratagene), generating pHW102 (Raf-1), pHW103 (Raf-N), and pHW105 (Raf-C). The integrity of the polymerase chain reaction sequences was verified by sequencing. Parental vectors for the interaction trap system were kind gifts from Dr. Roger Brent (Harvard Medical School) and included pEG202 and pJG4-5 (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar). pEG202 carries the sequence encoding the DNA-binding domain of the bacterial LexA protein, the expression of which is under the control of the ADH promoter. pJG4-5 carries the B42 transcriptional activation sequence fused to a nuclear localization sequence under the control of a GAL1 promoter. An epitope tag (influenza virus hemagglutinin) was inserted between the nuclear localization sequence and the sequence of interest to enable surveillance of the expressed fusion protein by immunoblotting. For studying 14-3-3ζ/Raf interaction, the wild-type 14-3-3ζ sequence and its mutant derivatives (EcoRI-SalI fragments; see description below) were obtained from pHAF625 and subcloned into either pEG202 (EcoRI-SalI sites) or pJG4-5 (EcoRI-XhoI sites), generating in-frame fusion constructs. Similarly, the EcoRI-SalI fragments of pHW102, pHW103, and pHW105 were ligated to the LexA sequence in pEG202, generating pHW107 (LexA-Raf-1), pHW108 (LexA-Raf-N), and pHW110 (LexA-Raf-C), and to the B42 sequence in pJG4-5, generating pHW112 (B42-Raf-1), pHW113 (B42-Raf-N), and pHW115 (B42-Raf-C), respectively. For protein expression in E. coli, the NdeI-EcoRI fragments of pHAF625 encoding the mutant 14-3-3ζ proteins (see below) were subcloned intoNdeI-EcoRI-cut pET-15b (Novagen, Madison, WI), generating pLZ121 (K49E), pHW167 (K49L), pHW168 (K49Q), pHW169 (K49R), pLZ125 (R56E), and pLZ126 (R60E). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed with double-stranded plasmid as the starting material according to the unique site elimination method (35Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar). Two primers were used in this process, a mutagenic primer containing a desired mutation and a selection primer containing a mutation that eliminated a uniqueSspI site in pHAF625 (5′-AAATGCTTCAATGATATCGAAAAAGGAAG-3′; a newEcoRV site was introduced (underlined)). To facilitate the screening of the desired mutations and based on the degeneracy of the codons, restriction sites were purposely introduced into the mutagenic primers. The incorporation of the mutagenic primers was screened by restriction enzyme digestion, and the introduced mutations were verified by sequencing. The mutagenic primers used are listed below (mutations generated with the corresponding oligonucleotides are underlined, and the SacI sites introduced for screening are in lower-case letters): 1) 5′-GCTTATGAAAATGTTGTAGgagctcGTAGGTC-3′ (Lys-49 to Glu); 2) 5′-GTTGCTTATCTAAATGTTGTAGgagctcGTAGG-3′ (Lys-49 to Leu); 3) 5′-GCTTATCAAAATGTTGTAGgagctcGTAGG-3′ (Lys-49 to Gln); 4) 5′-GCTTATAGAAATGTTGTAGgagctcGTAGG-3′ (Lys-49 to Arg); 5) 5′-GTAGgagctcGTGAGTCATCTTGG-3′ (Arg-56 to Glu); and 6) 5′-GTAGgagctcGTAGGTCATCTTGGGAGGTCGTCTC-3′ (Arg-60 to Glu). A modified version of the yeast two-hybrid system (36Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar), the interaction trap (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar), was used for studying 14-3-3ζ/Raf interactionsin vivo (33Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1987, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae EGY48 (MAT a trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::pLexAop6LEU2) was used as a host for all interaction experiments. Both pSH18-34 and pJK103 were used as reporters. pSH18-34 directs expression of a GAL1-lacZ gene from eight high affinity ColE1 LexA operators, whereas pJK103 uses two ColE1 LexA operators. For the protein/protein interaction analysis, EGY48 harboring a lacZ reporter was cotransformed with pEG202 derivatives and pJG4-5 derivatives by the lithium acetate method (33Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1987, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). Transformants were maintained in synthetic medium with glucose (2%) under selection for the URA3, HIS3, andTRP1 markers. Colonies were patched onto synthetic medium plates containing galactose (2%), raffinose (1%), and X-gal (Gold Biotechnology, Inc., St. Louis, MO) to induce and detect the expression of the lacZ reporter gene. The time required for color development of positive interactions on X-gal selection plates ranged from 8 to 24 h. For the quantitative liquid assay, yeast transformants were grown overnight in the appropriate synthetic selecting medium with glucose to A600 ∼ 1.0. Cells were washed with and transferred to the galactose induction medium with 1% raffinose. After 12 h of induction, cells were prepared in fresh Z buffer and permeabilized using three drops of chloroform and two drops of 0.1% SDS as described (33Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1987, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). For quantitation, chlorophenyl-red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) was added as a chromogenic substrate. The amount of liberated chlorophenol red was determined by A574, and the specific activity in Miller units was calculated based on the following equation: unit = (A574/(A600 ×V × T)) × 1000, whereA600 is the cell density used, V is the volume of the culture in ml, and T is the reaction time in min. Three independent colonies were used for each activity determination. Single colonies from LB/ampicillin plates, freshly streaked withE. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET-15b-derived plasmids expressing 14-3-3ζ or its mutant derivatives, were transferred into 3-ml cultures of LB/ampicillin. These cultures were fermented overnight at 37 °C on a rotary wheel. On the second day, 2-liter flasks, each containing 250 ml of LB/ampicillin, were inoculated with the 3-ml overnight culture. The flasks were aerated on a rotary shaker (300 rpm; Innova 4000, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) at 37 °C. The cultures were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) when A600 reached ∼0.5. The cells were harvested after 4 h, immediately chilled, and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). For the in vitro binding assay, the pellets were resuspended in ice-cold sonication buffer composed of 50 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0 mm EDTA. The resuspended pellets were sonicated four times on ice for 20 s each using a Branson 450 Sonifier cell disruptor, with the power control at 3 and the duty cycle at 50%. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used as the source of hexahistidine-tagged 14-3-3ζ. For the purpose of protein purification, crude extracts were made as described above, except that the sonication buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, wild-type 14-3-3ζ and its mutant derivatives were purified using Ni2+ chelating chromatography essentially as described (11Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Google Scholar). Hexahistidine tags were removed by thrombin digestion (0.5 unit/mg of proteins). The 14-3-3 proteins used for the quantitative assays were further purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200) in a Pharmacia FPLC system. For the in vitro binding assays, hexahistidine-tagged 14-3-3ζ proteins in the crude extracts were incubated with Ni2+-charged Sepharose 6B beads (Novagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Radiolabeled Raf-1 proteins were generated using the TNTin vitro transcription-translation system (Promega). The DNA template (pKS(+)-Raf-1) was incubated with TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine (final concentration, 0.8 μCi/ml) for 90 min at 30 °C according to the manufacturer's specifications. For the binding assays, the immobilized 14-3-3ζ proteins (∼5 μg each) were mixed with35S-labeled Raf-1 in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The 14-3-3ζ complexes were extensively washed with Nonidet P-40 buffer three times, followed by radioimmune precipitation assay wash (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 137 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) three times, and boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer before resolution by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). The presence of the radiolabeled products in the 14-3-3ζ complexes was visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The NAD+:SBTI ADP-ribosyltransferase assay measures the rate of incorporation of the [32P]ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ into the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable SBTI fraction of the reaction mixture. SBTI is used as an artificial substrate, and the assays were performed essentially as described previously (11Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Google Scholar, 37Kulich S.M. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 307-313Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained (in a final volume of 25 μl) 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0), 20 nm purified ExoS, 30 μm SBTI, 30 μm[adenylate-32P]NAD+, 1.5 μm bovine serum albumin, and varying concentrations of 14-3-3ζ or its mutant proteins. After 30 min at 25 °C, reactions were stopped by removing 15 μl of the reaction mixture, which was directly pipetted onto trichloroacetic acid-saturated filter paper. The filter pads were placed immediately into ice-cold trichloroacetic acid solution (5%) and washed three to five times by gentle agitation on a platform rocker until no counts could be detected in the discarded wash solutions. The filter pads were then washed twice for 5 min each in ice-cold methanol, dried, and counted with 3 ml of liquid scintillation mixture in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Incorporation of ADP-ribose into SBTI was calculated based on the increase in counts (minus background) with <20% of the reactants having been utilized. Activities were obtained from at least three separate experiments, each performed in duplicate. Data are expressed as pmol of ADP-ribose incorporated per min/pmol of ExoS. To verify the specific incorporation of the ADP-ribose into SBTI, 5 μl of the reaction mixtures were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide (12.5%) gel and visualized using autoradiography. The amount of 32P incorporated specifically into SBTI was quantified using a PhosphorImager with Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and was found to be comparable to that obtained with the liquid assay described above. ExoS activation data were fit to the following equation using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific): v =Vmax[A]/(EC50 + [A]), where Vmax is the maximal activation expressed as pmol of ADP-ribose incorporated per min/pmol of ExoS, v is the observed enzyme activity, EC50 is the concentration of 14-3-3 proteins giving half-maximal activation, and [A] is the 14-3-3 concentration. WT 14-3-3ζ and its mutant derivatives (2.5 μg) were incubated with 0.5 unit of chymotrypsin in a final volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. Digested fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15%), and the digestion patterns of the WT and mutant proteins were visualized using Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad). The far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter. Results are expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity ([θ], degree·cm2·dmol−1) calculated from the following equation: [θ] = ([θ]obs × MRW)/(10 × L × C), where [θ]obs is the observed ellipticity expressed in millidegree, MRW is the mean residue molecular weight (114 for 14-3-3ζ), L is the optical path length in cm (0.1 cm), and C is the final protein concentration in mg/ml. Far-UV CD spectra were the average of four scans obtained by collecting data at 0.2-nm intervals from 250 to 190 nm with a protein concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. For the guanidine hydrochloride denaturation experiments, changes in the helical content of the sample were monitored at 222 nm. Phosphate-buffered saline was used for these studies. The half-melting concentration (Cm) is defined as the concentration of denaturant at the midpoint of the transition. The breadth of the transition (ΔC) is defined as the difference in denaturant concentrations between the points at which the transition is one-fourth and three-fourths complete. An SDS-PAGE system was used essentially as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The enzyme-linked immunoblotting procedures of Towbin et al. (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) were followed. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically"
https://openalex.org/W2054276465,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) alone and in combination with interleukin 1β (IL-1β) on inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein expression, nitrite production, and insulin secretion by islets of Langerhans. Treatment of rat islets with IL-1β results in a concentration-dependent increase in the production of nitrite that is maximal at 5 units/ml. Individually, 0.1 unit/ml IL-1β or 150 units/ml rat IFN-γ do not stimulate iNOS expression or nitrite production by rat islets; however, in combination, these cytokines induce the expression of iNOS and the production of nitrite to levels similar in magnitude to the individual effects of 5 units/ml IL-1β. The islet β-cell, selectively destroyed during insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, appears to be one islet cellular source of iNOS as 150 units/ml rat IFN-γ and 0.1 unit/ml IL-1β induced similar effects in primary β-cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and in the rat insulinoma cell line, RINm5F. iNOS expression and nitrite production by rat islets in response to 150 units/ml rat IFN-γ and 0.1 unit/ml IL-1β are correlated with an inhibition of insulin secretion and islet degeneration that are prevented by the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine. The mechanism by which IFN-γ increases the sensitivity of β-cells for IL-1-induced iNOS expression appears to be associated with an increase in the stability of iNOS mRNA. Last, cellular damage during physical dispersion of islets results in the release of sufficient amounts of IL-1β to induce iNOS expression and nitrite production in the presence of exogenously added rat IFN-γ. The cellular source of IL-1β under these conditions is believed to be resident islet macrophages as depletion of macrophages prior to dispersion prevents IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitrite formation by dispersed islet cells. These studies show that the T-lymphocyte cytokine, IFN-γ, increases the sensitivity of rat islets to the effects of IL-1β on iNOS expression and nitrite production by 10-fold, in part, through the stabilization of iNOS mRNA. Our studies also support an effector role for IFN-γ, in concert with resident islet macrophage release of IL-1β, in mediating β-cell destruction during the development of autoimmune diabetes.

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease characterized by the selective destruction of insulin secreting β-cells found in islets of Langerhans. Many lines of evidence support a role for the involvement of cytokines as effector molecules that participate in the development of diabetes. Mandrup-Poulsen et al. (1Mandrup-Poulsen T. Bendtzen K. Nielsen H. Bendixen G. Nerup J. Allergy ( Cph .). 1985; 40: 424-429Google Scholar) first showed that treatment of isolated rat islets with conditioned media derived from activated mononuclear cells results in a potent inhibition of insulin secretion followed by islet destruction. The active component of this conditioned media was determined to be the cytokine IL-1 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1β, interleukin 1β; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; NMMA,N G-monomethyl-l-arginine; AG, aminoguanidine; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; IRAP, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

IL-1-induced inhibition of insulin secretion is both time- and concentration-dependent and requires mRNA transcription and new protein synthesis (3Hughes J.H. Colca J.R. Easom R.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 856-863Google Scholar). Recently, IL-1-induced inhibition of insulin secretion has been attributed to the expression of iNOS and increased production of nitric oxide by β-cells (4Eizirik D.L. Flodstrom M. Karlsen A.E. Welsh N. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 875-890Google Scholar, 5Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Hill J.R. McDaniel M.L. Marshall S.M. Home P.D. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Annual 9. Elsevier Science Publishers B.

Lett. 1990; 276: 42-44Google Scholar) first demonstrated that treatment of rat islets with IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor results in an inhibition of insulin secretion that is attenuated by the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. We and others (7Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Bendtzen K. Sandler S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3167-3173Google Scholar, 8Corbett J.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Sweetland M.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol.

The expression of iNOS by rat islets has been demonstrated at the level of mRNA and protein (10Eizirik D.L. Cagliero E. Bjorklund A. Welsh N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 249-252Google Scholar, 11Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Misko T.P. Rodi C.P. McDaniel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C48-C54Google Scholar, 12Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical colocalization of iNOS and insulin demonstrates that IL-1β selectively induces the expression of iNOS by β-cells (12Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Google Scholar). The inhibitory and destructive effects of IL-1β on islet function and viability are mediated, in part, by the ability of nitric oxide to target and inhibit the enzymatic activity of mitochondrial enzymes, including aconitase and the electron transport chain complexes I and II (7Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Bendtzen K. Sandler S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3167-3173Google Scholar, 13Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin.

Treatment of rat islets for 18 h with IL-1β results in an 80% inhibition of aconitase activity that is prevented by NMMA (7Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Bendtzen K. Sandler S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3167-3173Google Scholar, 13Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2384-2391Google Scholar). IL-1β has also been shown to reduce islet cellular levels of ATP and to inhibit glucose oxidation in a nitric oxide-dependent manner (15Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Hughes J.H. Wolf B.A. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 229-235Google Scholar). Autoimmune diabetes is associated with a local inflammatory reaction (insulitis) in and around pancreatic islets. In an activated state, T-lymphocytes and macrophages, primary cellular components of islet insulitis, release high levels of IL-1 and IFN-γ, respectively. Although the effects of IL-1 on islet function have been examined in detail, few studies have investigated the effects of IFN-γ on β-cell function and viability. Many lines of evidence support a role for IFN-γ in the development of autoimmune diabetes. This evidence includes 1) IFN-γ mRNA expression in islets correlates with the development of insulitis and diabetes in the nonobese diabetic mouse (16Rabinovitch A. Suarez-Pinzon Sorensen O. Bleackley R.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2093-2099Google Scholar); 2) transgenic mice expressing IFN-γ under control of the insulin promoter develop insulitis and diabetes (17Sarvetnick N. Liggitt D. Pitts S.L. Hansen S.E. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 773-782Google Scholar); and 3) monoclonal antiserum specific for IFN-γ attenuates the development of diabetes in the nonobese diabetic mouse (18Campbell I.L. Kay T.W.H. Oxbrow L. Harrison L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 739-742Google Scholar, 19Debray-Sachs M. Carnaud C. Boitard C. Cohen H. Gresser I. Bedossa P. Bach J.-F. J. Autoimmun. 1991; 4: 237-248Google Scholar). In this study we have examined the effects of IFN-γ alone and in combination with IL-1β on iNOS expression, nitrite formation, and islet function and viability. Alone, IFN-γ does not modulate islet function or viability; however, IFN-γ increases the sensitivity of rat islets to IL-1β by stabilizing IL-1-induced iNOS mRNA expression resulting in the increased production of nitric oxide. The increased sensitivity of rat islets for IL-1 results in the inhibition of β-cell function and islet destruction at concentrations of IL-1β that alone have no effect on islet viability or function. RINm5F cells were obtained from Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center (St. Louis, MO). RPMI Medium 1640 containing 1 × l-glutamine, CMRL-1066 tissue culture medium, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and rat and human recombinant IFN-γ were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was obtained from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Male Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN).

Aminoguanidine hemisulfate (AG) and collagenase type XI were from Sigma. [α-32P]dCTP and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Amersham Corp. Human recombinant IL-1β was from Cistron Biotechnology (Pine Brook, NJ). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.

Searle, St. Louis, MO). iNOS and cyclophilin cDNAs were gifts from Dr. Charles Rodi (Monsanto Corporate Research, St. Louis, MO) and Dr. Steve Carroll (Department of Pathology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), respectively. Mouse recombinant interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) was a gift from Dr. Charles Hall (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI). All other reagents were from commercially available sources. Islets were isolated from male Sprague Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (20McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Google Scholar). Following isolation, islets were cultured overnight in complete CMRL-1066 (CMRL-1066 containing 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Human islets were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in complete CMRL-1066 before the initiation of experiments. Prior to each experiment, islets were washed 3 times in complete CMRL-1066, counted, and then cultured for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Experiments were then initiated by the addition of cytokines and iNOS inhibitors, followed by culture for the indicated times. For experiments using RINm5F cells, cells were removed from growth flasks by treatment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA at 37 °C. Cells were washed 2 times with complete CMRL-1066, plated at a concentration of 200,000 cells/200 μl of complete CMRL-1066 in 96-well microtiter plates, and then cultured at 37 °C for 2–3 h prior to cytokine treatment. Experiments were initiated by the addition of cytokines, and the RINm5F cells were then incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. Isolated rat islets were dispersed into individual cells by treatment with trypsin (1.0 mg/ml) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' solution at 37 °C for 3 min as stated previously (21Ono J. Takaki R. Fukuma M. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1977; 24: 265-270Google Scholar). The dispersed islet cells were counted and then immediately aliquoted into 24-well microtiter plates (100,000 cells/well in 400 μl of complete CMRL-1066) and cultured for 1 h at 37 °C. For macrophage depletion studies, islets were cultured for 7 days at 24 °C followed by 2 days at 37 °C prior to cell dispersion (24Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1183-1190Google Scholar). Where indicated, islet cells were pretreated for 30 min with IRAP; cytokines were then added, and the islet cells were incubated for 24 h. Islets isolated from 10 rats were cultured overnight (∼1200 islets/3 ml) in complete CMRL-1066 media under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Islets were then dispersed into individual cells as stated above. Dispersed islet cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in complete CMRL-1066 prior to cell sorting. Islet cells were purified as described previously (11Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Misko T.P. Rodi C.P. McDaniel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C48-C54Google Scholar,13Corbett J.A. Wang J.L.

Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Google Scholar) using a FACSTAR + flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The cells were illuminated at 488 nm, and emission was monitored at 515–535 nm. The sorting process yielded a 95% population of β-cells and an 80–85% population of α-cells. Islets (220/ml of complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 40 h with the indicated concentrations of IL-1β, IFN-γ, and aminoguanidine (AG). The islets were then isolated and washed 3 times in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB, 25 mm Hepes, 115 mm NaCl, 24 mmNaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 3 mmd-glucose. Groups of 20 islets were counted into 10- × 75-mm borosilicate test tubes and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking in 200 μl of the same buffer. The preincubation buffer was removed, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was initiated by the addition of 200 μl of KRB containing either 3 or 20 mmd-glucose. Islets were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, the incubation buffer was removed, and insulin content was determined by radioimmunoassay (23Wright P.H. Makulu D.R. Vichick D. Sussman K.E. Diabetes. 1971; 20: 33-45Google Scholar). Islets (25/500 μl of complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 96 h in 24-well microtiter plates with the indicated concentrations of IL-1β, IFN-γ, and aminoguanidine. Islet degeneration was determined in a double-blind manner by phase-contrast microscopic analysis. Islet degeneration is characterized by the loss of islet integrity, disintegration, and partial dispersion of islets as described previously (14Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 719-724Google Scholar, 24Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1183-1190Google Scholar, 25Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Misko T.P. Zhao W. Hickey W.F. McDaniel M.L. Autoimmunity. 1993; 15: 145-153Google Scholar). RINm5F cells (400,000/400 μl of complete CMRL-1066), cultured in 24-well microtiter plates with the indicated concentrations of IL-1β and IFN-γ for 24 h at 37 °C, were washed 3 times with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, followed by the addition of 25 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample mix (0.25 m Tris-HCl, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, and 4% SDS). The lysed cells were then transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and the individual wells of the microtiter plate were rinsed with 15 μl of distilled H2O which was then added to the corresponding lysed samples. The samples were boiled for 4 min followed by the addition of 4 μl of loading dye (0.05% bromphenol blue in 80% glycerol). Rat islets (150/400 μl of complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 40 h with the indicated concentrations of IL-1β and IFN-γ at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The islets were isolated by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 3 min) and washed 3 times with 0.1 m PBS. Islets were lysed by the addition of 25 μl of SDS sample mix and 15 μl of distilled H2O, boiled for 4 min, followed by the addition of 4 μl loading dye. Proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis using standard conditions (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and transferred to Nitrocell nitrocellulose membranes (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) under semi-dry transfer conditions. Blots were blocked overnight in TBST (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were washed one time with TBST and then incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-mouse iNOS (1:2000 dilution) in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk. Following incubations with the primary antisera, blots were washed 4 times with TBST (5 min/wash) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:7000. The blots were washed 3 times in TBST and once in 0.1 m PBS at room temperature. Detection of rat iNOS was by enhanced chemiluminescence according to manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Corp.). RINm5F cells (10 × 106 cells/3 ml complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 6 and 12 h at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of IL-1β and IFN-γ. For the mRNA stability experiments, RINm5F cells (10 × 106 cells/3 ml of complete CMRL-1066) were cultured for 6 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of IL-1 and IFN-γ. Actinomycin D (1 μm) was then added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 6 h. After culture, the cells were washed 3 times with 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Total cellular RNA (10–20 μg) was denatured and fractionated by gel electrophoresis using a 1.0% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde. RNA was transferred by capillary action in 20 × SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) to Duralon UV nylon membranes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the membranes were hybridized to a 32P-labeled probe specific for rat iNOS or cyclophilin (27Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 4.2.1-4.2.6Google Scholar). The cDNA probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Prime-a-Gene nick translation system from Promega (Madison, WI). iNOS cDNA probe corresponds to bases 509–1415 of the rat iNOS coding region. 28 S RNA band or cyclophilin was used as an internal control for RNA loading. Hybridization and autoradiography were performed as described previously (28Burd P.R. Rogers H.W. Gordon J.R. Martin C.A. Jayaraman S. Wilson S.D. Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Dorf M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 245-257Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were scanned into NIH Image version 1.59 using a COHU high performance CCD camera (Brookfield, WI). Densities were determined using NIH Image version 1.59 software. PhosphorImaging analysis of RINm5F cell mRNA stability experiments was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant Software Version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For Western blot data, autoradiograms were scanned into NIH Image and then imported into Canvas 3.5 (Deneba Software, Miami, Fl) for the preparation of figures. Nitrite production was determined by mixing 50 μl of culture medium with 50 μl of Griess reagent (29Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Google Scholar). The absorbance at 540 nm was measured, and nitrite concentrations were calculated from a sodium nitrite standard curve. Statistical comparisons were made between groups using a one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences between treatment groups compared with untreated controls (p < 0.05) were evaluated using a Scheffe's F test posthoc analysis. To determine if IFN-γ modulates iNOS expression, the effects of rat IFN-γ, alone and in combination with IL-1β, on nitrite production and iNOS expression by isolated rat islets were examined. Incubation of rat islets for 40 h with IL-1β results in a concentration-dependent increase in the production of nitrite (Fig. 1 A). IL-1β induces the first detectable increase in nitrite production by rat islets at 0.5 units/ml IL-1β with maximal nitrite production observed at 1 and 5 units/ml IL-1β (data not shown for 1 unit/ml IL-1β). Alone, rat IFN-γ (concentrations from 1.5 to 150 units/ml) does not stimulate nitrite formation by rat islets; however, in the presence of 0.1 unit/ml IL-1β (which alone does not stimulate nitrite formation), rat IFN-γ induces the concentration-dependent production of nitrite by rat islets. The levels of nitrite produced in response to 0.1 unit/ml IL-1β and 150 units/ml rat IFN-γ are similar in magnitude to the levels produced by rat islets treated with 5 units/ml IL-1β. Rat IFN-γ also slightly increases (∼8%) the production of nitrite by rat islets stimulated with 5 units/ml IL-1β as compared with 5 units/ml IL-1β alone. The effects of rat IFN-γ and IL-1β on iNOS expression from the same islets used in Fig. 1 A are shown in Fig. 1 B. Alone, 0.1 unit/ml IL-1β or 150 units/ml rat IFN-γ do not induce the expression of iNOS by rat islets; however, a combination of 0.1 unit/ml IL-1β and 150 units/ml rat IFN-γ stimulates the expression of iNOS to levels similar in magnitude to the expression of iNOS induced by 5 units/ml IL-1β. Also, the combination of 5 units/ml IL-1β and 150 units/ml rat IFN-γ induce iNOS expression to levels that exceed those induced by the treatment of rat islets with 5 units/ml IL-1β. This effect is consistent with the ability of rat IFN-γ to increase the level of nitrite produced by rat islets in response to maximal concentrations of IL-1β. These results indicate that rat IFN-γ, in combination with IL-1β at concentrations that alone do not induce iNOS expression, stimulate the expression of iNOS by rat islets to levels that are similar to the individual effects of maximal concentrations of IL-1β. For convenience, we have defined 0.1 unit/ml IL-1β as submaximal and 1 and 5 units/ml IL-1β as maximal concentrations of IL-1β. Our previous studies have shown that nitric oxide mediates the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (8Corbett J.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Sweetland M.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21351-21354Google Scholar). The effects of rat IFN-γ and IL-1β on insulin secretion by rat islets were examined to determine if nitric oxide production, stimulated by submaximal concentrations of IL-1β in the presence of rat IFN-γ, is associated with an inhibition of insulin secretion. Treatment of rat islets with a maximal concentration of IL-1β results in a complete inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (TableI). We have previously shown that IL-1β-induced inhibition of insulin secretion is prevented by the NOS inhibitors NMMA and AG and that iNOS inhibitors do not modulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the absence of cytokines (8Corbett J.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Sweetland M.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21351-21354Google Scholar, 9Corbett J.A. Tilton R.G. Chang K. Hasan K.S. Ido Y. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R.

Incubation of islets for 40 h with a combination of rat IFN-γ and a submaximal concentration of IL-1β also results in a complete inhibition of insulin secretion that is prevented by AG (Table I). Individually, submaximal IL-1β or rat IFN-γ do not inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The lack of an inhibitory effect of submaximal IL-1β or rat IFN-γ on insulin secretion is consistent with the inability of these cytokines to stimulate nitrite production by rat islets. These findings indicate that treatment of rat islets with a submaximal concentration of IL-1β, in the presence of rat IFN-γ, results in an inhibition of insulin secretion that is mediated by the production of nitric oxide.Table IEffects of rat IFN-γ on IL-1β-induced inhibition of insulin secretion and islet degeneration by rat isletsCytokineAGInsulin secretion (ng/30 min per 20 islets), GlucosePercent viableIL-1βIFN-γ3 mm20 mmunits/mlmm0000.4 ± 0.111.8 ± 1.399.4 ± 0.50.1000.9 ± 0.313.8 ± 1.2100.0 ± 0.01.0002.3 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.47.7 ± 3.21-a*, p < 0.05.0.115001.4 ± 0.52.2 ± 0.27.9 ± 4.41-a*, p < 0.05.0.11501.01.5 ± 0.58.3 ± 1.699.0 ± 1.0015000.7 ± 0.28.4 ± 0.998.9 ± 0.61.001.0NDND98.6 ± 0.9For insulin secretion experiments, rat islets (220 islets/ml complete CMRL-1066) were incubated for 40 h with the indicated concentrations of IL-1β, rat IFN-γ, and AG.

Incubation of islets for 96 h with a maximal concentration of IL-1β results in the complete degeneration of islets.

The destructive effects of IL-1β on islet viability are completely prevented by the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG), indicating that nitric oxide participates in IL-1β-induced islet degeneration. Alone, rat IFN-γ (150 units/ml) or a submaximal concentration of IL-1β do not induce islet degeneration; however, in combination these cytokines stimulate islet degeneration to levels similar to the individual effects of maximal concentrations of IL-1β alone. The destructive effects of submaximal concentrations of IL-1β, in combination with rat IFN-γ, are completely prevented by AG. These findings indicate that islet degeneration stimulated by rat IFN-γ and submaximal concentrations of IL-1β is mediated by the production of nitric oxide.

E6AP is a member of a family of functionally related E3 proteins that share a conserved carboxyl-terminal region called the Hect domain. Although several different E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes have been shown to function with E6AP in the E6-dependent ubiquitination of p53 in vitro, the E2s that cooperate with E6AP in the ubiquitination of its normal substrates are presently unknown. Moreover, the basis of functional cooperativity between specific E2 and Hect E3 proteins has not yet been determined.Here we report the cloning of a new human E2, designated UbcH8, that was identified in a two-hybrid screen through specific interaction with E6AP. We demonstrate that UbcH7, an E2 closely related to UbcH8, can also bind to E6AP. The region of E6AP involved in complex formation with UbcH8 and UbcH7 was mapped to its Hect domain. Furthermore, we show that UbcH5 and UbcH6, two highly homologous E2s that were deficient for interaction with E6AP, could associate efficiently with another Hect-E3 protein, RSP5. Finally, only the E6AP-interacting E2s could function in conjunction with E6AP in the ubiquitination of an E6 independent substrate of E6AP, whereas the noninteracting E2s could not. Taken together, these studies demonstrate for the first time complex formation between specific human E2s and the Hect domain family of E3 proteins and suggest that selective physical interaction between E2 and E3 enzymes forms the basis of specificity for functionally distinct E2:E3 combinations.

Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis constitutes a major pathway in the cell for selective protein degradation (1Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Google Scholar, 3Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Google Scholar). The covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues of a target protein serves to signal its recognition and rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Ubiquitin conjugation can also result in nonproteolytic modification of target proteins (4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Google Scholar, 5Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Google Scholar, 6Hicke L. Reizman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Google Scholar, 7Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of a protein substrate requires the concerted action of three classes of enzymes; the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin protein ligase; HPV, human papillomavirus; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; WGE, wheat germ extracts; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Gal4-AD, Gal4-activation domain; WT, wild type. initially activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction through the formation of a thiol ester bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and the thiol group of a specific cysteine residue of E1. Ubiquitin is then transferred to a specific cysteine residue on one of several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubcs or E2s). E2 enzymes in turn may transfer the ubiquitin either directly to a substrate or to the final class of enzymes known as ubiquitin protein ligases (or E3s). The E3 enzymes catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of lysine residues on a target protein (3Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Google Scholar, 8Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar, 9Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar). A substrate may be multiply ubiquitinated through the attachment of additional ubiquitin molecules to specific lysine residues (lysine 48 or 63) of ubiquitin itself, although the processive nature of a multiubiquitination reaction is presently unclear (3Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Google Scholar, 4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Google Scholar, 7Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Google Scholar). In order for this process to be efficient, it is likely that the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes involved form multiprotein complexes to allow rapid thiol ester transfer of ubiquitin molecules (4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Google Scholar, 7Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Google Scholar). Whereas multiubiquitination of some proteins leads to their rapid degradation by the proteasome, in other instances ubiquitination may serve as a modification resulting in functional regulation (5Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Google Scholar, 6Hicke L. Reizman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Google Scholar). At present it is unclear how specific proteins are recognized as substrates for the ubiquitin system and what precise roles the E2 and E3 enzymes play in the recognition as well as in the ubiquitination of a substrate. While only one functional E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme has been identified thus far, over 30 different E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes have been isolated from various organisms (10Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Google Scholar). All E2s contain a conserved domain of approximately 14 kDa (∼130 amino acids) and an active site cysteine residue that is required for thiol ester formation with ubiquitin. E2 enzymes that consist almost exclusively of the conserved Ubc domain (class I E2s) are unable to transfer ubiquitin to protein substrates in vitro, suggesting that this class of E2s may require E3 ubiquitin protein ligases for substrate recognition. A second group of E2 enzymes (class II) contain unique carboxyl-terminal extensions (e.g. cdc34, Rad6, Ubc6) (10Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Google Scholar) that may contribute to substrate specificity and cellular localization (10Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Google Scholar). The E3 ubiquitin protein ligases may be the key enzymes that provide substrate specificity for the ubiquitin conjugation system. Although two E3 enzymes have been previously identified from rabbit reticulocytes (E3α and E3β) and one from yeast (UBR1), it was not until the cloning and characterization of E6AP that the structural and functional features of a new class of E3 enzymes was revealed (10Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Google Scholar, 11Reiss Y. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10378-10383Google Scholar, 12Reiss Y. Hershko A. J. Biol.

E6AP was initially identified as a 100-kDa cellular protein that in conjunction with the E6 oncoprotein of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) constituted the E3 activity in the ubiquitination of p53 (8Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar,14Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Google Scholar, 15Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 13: 4129-4135Google Scholar, 16Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Google Scholar). E6AP can also promote the ubiquitination of cellular proteins in the absence of E6, indicating that E6AP can function as an E3 independent of E6 (8Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of E6AP revealed a region of approximately 350 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus that was highly conserved among a number of proteins from various organisms (17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). This region, termed the Hect domain (homologous toE6AP carboxyl terminus), also contains a conserved cysteine residue that serves as the active site for thiol ester formation with ubiquitin (17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). In addition to E6AP, two other Hect domain proteins, RSP5 and rat p100, have been shown to form thiol ester complexes with ubiquitin (9Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar, 17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). A total of six genes encoding Hect proteins have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several in Drosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals (17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). The question of substrate specificity is key to understanding how the ubiquitin system is regulated. Although the recognition of specific proteins as substrates appears to involve protein-protein interactions with specific E3s, the relative contribution of E2 enzymes in substrate recognition and ubiquitination has not yet been established. The existence of multiple E2s and Hect E3 proteins, however, suggests that specific combinations of these proteins are likely to function together in the ubiquitination of a substrate. At least 12 different genes encoding E2 enzymes have been isolated from S. cerevisiaeand shown to be involved in a variety of cellular functions, including DNA repair, cell cycle control, protein translocation, stress response, and chromosomal organization (3Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Google Scholar, 10Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Google Scholar). Moreover, gene inactivation experiments in mice have indicated very specific roles for certain E2s, suggesting that, despite belonging to a large multigene family, their functions are not redundant. For example, proviral integration and inactivation of UbcM4 (mouse homologue of UbcH7) results in placental defects and embryonic lethality (18Harbers K. Muller U. Grams A. Li E. Jaenisch R. Franz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12412-12417Google Scholar). In another recent study, it was demonstrated that inactivation of mHR6B (one of the mouse homologues of yeast Rad6/Ubc2) in mice causes male sterility associated with chromatin modification (19Roest H.P. van Klaveren J. de Wit J. van Gurp C.G. Koken M. Vermey M. van Roijen J.H. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Vreeburg J. Baarends W.M. Bootsma D. Grootegoed J.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 799-810Google Scholar). This is an intriguing result in terms of functional specificity of E2 enzymes since another mouse homologue of Rad6, mHR6A, which shares over 90% sequence identity with mHR6B and is expressed in all the same organs and tissues as mHR6B, was intact in these mice (19Roest H.P. van Klaveren J. de Wit J. van Gurp C.G. Koken M. Vermey M. van Roijen J.H. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Vreeburg J. Baarends W.M. Bootsma D. Grootegoed J.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 799-810Google Scholar). In addition, both human homologues of Rad6, hHR6A and hHR6B, were shown to complement Rad6 function in DNA repair but not in sporulation in yeast (20Koken M.H.M. Reynolds P. Jaspers-Dekker I. Prakash L. Prakash S. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8865-8869Google Scholar). These data strongly indicate that individual E2 enzymes, despite having closely related homologues, carry out very specific functions in the cell. The critical question with regard to different E2s is how functional specificity for each enzyme is achieved. Although the expression profiles, tissue distribution and subcellular localization of individual E2s may contribute to functional specificity, an equally important aspect is the ability of E2s to cooperate with specific E3 proteins in substrate ubiquitination. However, the basis underlying the specificity of why certain E2 enzymes and not others function with particular E3s is not yet known. To identify potential substrates and regulators of E6AP, we have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using E6AP as bait. In this study, we report the cloning of a new human E2 (designated UbcH8) that was isolated as an E6AP-interacting protein and demonstrate that UbcH8 can transfer ubiquitin to E6AP. We have extended this analysis to additional E2s and Hect domain E3s. Our results demonstrate that only a subset of structurally related E2s physically interact with E6AP and function in the ubiquitination of an E6AP substrate (22Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar). 2S. Kumar, W. H. Kao, and P. M. Howley, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, we show that a different subfamily of structurally related E2s bind to the S. cerevisiae Hect protein RSP5 (17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar, 23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies demonstrate specific complex formation between E2 enzymes and the Hect domain family of E3 proteins, and suggest that the ability of E2s to physically associate with specific Hect E3s constitutes the basis of specificity for functionally distinct E2:E3 combinations. A modified version of the yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out to identify E6AP-interacting proteins (21Sardet C. Vidal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Google Scholar, 24Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Google Scholar, 25Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar, 26Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-291Google Scholar). The bait vector was constructed by inserting a catalytically inactive mutant of E6AP (C833A) into pPC97, in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147). The prey cDNA library contained the Gal4 activation domain fused to cDNAs derived from activated human T cells in pPC86 vector. The bait and prey constructs were transformed into yeast strain MaV103 (MAT a ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 trp1-901 his3Δ200 ade2-101 gal4Δgal80Δ GAL1::HIS3 @ lys2 SPAL10::URA3) and transformants plated in the absence of histidine. Since increasedHIS3 expression resulting from an interacting clone will render the yeast resistant to 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), selection of interacting clones was performed in the presence of 25 mm3-AT. pPC86-derived interaction positive cDNAs were rescued by transformation of competent HB101 with total yeast DNA. The DNA sequence of isolated clones was determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using appropriate oligonucleotide primers. The pPC97 vector, pPC86-derived human T cell cDNA library and the yeast host strain MaV103 were kindly provided by Dr. Marc Vidal (Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA). The ubch8, ubch7,ubch5, and ubch9 (27Yasugi T. Howley P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2005-2010Google Scholar) genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using appropriate oligonucleotide primers and inserted into pET23a vector (Novagen) for bacterial expression. For expression in MaV103 yeast strain, PCR-derived E2 cDNAs (UbcH8, UbcH7, UbcH6, UbcH5, and UbcH9) were cloned in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain in the pPC86 plasmid. E6AP, RSP5, and rat p100 cDNAs harboring a substitution of the active site cysteine residue with alanine were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pPC97 vector in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. E6AP deletion mutants were generated by PCR using appropriate oliginucleotide primers and inserted in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain in pPC97 (see Fig.3 B). dC109, dC217, and dC325 delete 109, 217, and 325 residues, respectively, from the carboxyl terminus of E6AP. dHect is a deletion of 350 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus corresponding to the Hect domain. pPC97-Hect expresses the Hect domain of E6AP fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and dNHect is a deletion of 150 residues from the amino terminus of the Hect domain. The full-length HHR23A cDNA was cloned into pGem-1 by PCR for in vitroexpression (Promega). E1, UbcH8, UbcH7, UbcH5, and UbcH9 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the pET expression system (Novagen) (23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Construction, purification, and radioactive labeling of GST-ubiquitin has been described previously (8Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar). Preparation of E6AP from Hi5 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing WT or mutant E6AP proteins has been described (8Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M.

Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Google Scholar). In vitro expression of HHR23A was performed in TNT-coupled wheat germ extracts (WGE) in the presence of [35S]methionine as per manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The expression of fusion proteins in yeast strain MaV103 was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain and anti-Gal4 activation domain antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Ubiquitin thiol ester formation on UbcH8 and E6AP was determined as described previously (9Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained approximately 5–10 ng of E1, 100 ng of UbcH8, 200 ng of WT-E6AP or E6AP (C833A), and 500 ng of 32P-labeled GST-ubiquitin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl, 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol for 3 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by incubating the mixtures for 15 min at 30 °C in SDS-sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) in the absence of reducing agents and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Radioactively labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The yeast strain MaV103 was co-transformed with pPC97-derived Hect protein constructs and pPC86-derived E2 constructs using standard lithium acetate procedures and plated in the absence of leucine and tryptophan (21Sardet C.

Individual colonies were picked and equivalent number of cells, as determined by OD reading at 600 nm, were spotted on histidine drop-out plates containing 25 mm 3-AT. Interactions were scored based on growth in the presence of 3-AT after incubation at 30 °C for 3 days. HHR23A protein was synthesizedin vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine for 90 min at 30 °C using TNT-coupled wheat germ extracts (22Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M.

Reactions were terminated after 2 h. at 30 °C by the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. To identify cDNA clones that encode E6AP-interacting proteins, a modified version of the yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using E6AP as bait (21Sardet C. Vidal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Google Scholar). A catalytically inactive form of E6AP in which the active site cysteine residue has been substituted with alanine (C833A) was used to avoid potential degradation of interacting proteins. The yeast reporter strain MaV103 expressing E6AP (C833A) as a fusion protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was transformed with the prey cDNA library derived from human T cells (21Sardet C. Vidal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Google Scholar). A total of 12 independent interacting clones were isolated by plating the transformants on histidine drop-out plates containing 25 mm 3-AT. Here we describe the identification of two independent clones consisting of identical cDNA inserts that were determined to code for a protein of 152 residues with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 17 kDa (Fig.1 A). Amino acid sequence comparison of the isolated clone revealed strong homology with ubiquitin conjugating enzymes from various organisms, indicating that the isolated clone encodes a previously unidentified human E2 enzyme. In keeping with the nomenclature, we have designated the new E2 UbcH8 (30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment and percent homology of UbcH8 with other known human E2s was obtained using the DNAsis program is shown in Fig.1 B. The primary sequence of UbcH8 indicates that it belongs to class I type E2s as it consists primarily of the Ubc domain and does not contain amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions (10Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Google Scholar). A previously described E2, UbcH7, that was shown to transfer ubiquitin to E6APin vitro, was found to have the highest degree of homology to UbcH8 (45.7% identity, Fig. 1 B) (30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar). To ascertain whether UbcH8 can form thiol ester complexes with ubiquitin and transfer the ubiquitin to the active site cysteine residue of E6AP, the UbcH8 cDNA was inserted into pET23a vector and expressed inE. coli (23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Google Scholar, 28Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23878-23885Google Scholar, 29Hatfield P.M. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14799-14803Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed UbcH8 was incubated in the presence of ATP with E1, wild type or catalytically inactive E6AP, and radiolabeled ubiquitin. As shown in Fig.2 (lanes 2 and 3), UbcH8 could efficiently form thiol ester complexes with ubiquitin. Furthermore, UbcH8 could transfer ubiquitin to wild type E6AP and not to the E6AP mutant (C833A) containing a substitution of the active site cysteine residue with alanine (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). The complex of E6AP and ubiquitin could be disrupted by the addition of dithiothreitol, indicating the labile nature of a reduction sensitive thiol ester bond (data not shown). No thiol ester adduct was detected on E6AP in the absence of UbcH8 (lane 1). It should be noted that in the presence of mutant E6AP (C833A), the amount of ubiquitin thiol ester complexes remaining on UbcH8 was greater than in the presence of wild type E6AP indicating the specificity of ubiquitin transfer from UbcH8 to E6AP. These results demonstrate that like other E2s that have been characterized thus far, UbcH8 can form thiol ester complexes with ubiquitin. In addition, UbcH8 has the ability to transfer ubiquitin to the active site cysteine residue of E6AP. The finding that UbcH8 can not only transfer ubiquitin to E6AP but also physically interact with E6AP, suggested that the binding of E2 enzymes to Hect E3 proteins might be a general property important for functional cooperation between E2 and E3 enzymes. We therefore examined the ability of other human E2s to associate with E6AP using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The yeast strain MaV103 was co-transformed with E6AP (C833A) and various E2s, and interactions were scored by growth on histidine-minus plates containing 25 mm 3-AT. Whereas both UbcH8 and the closely related UbcH7 (30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar) interacted efficiently with E6AP, UbcH5 and UbcH9 (23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Google Scholar, 27Yasugi T. Howley P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2005-2010Google Scholar) did not show significant levels of interaction (Fig. 3 A). Thus E6AP can associate with only a subset of E2s, namely UbcH8 and UbcH7. In addition, as suggested by the high degree of homology between UbcH8 and UbcH7 (shown in Fig. 1 B), these E2s may represent a structurally and functionally related subfamily. To map the region of E6AP that is required for its interaction with UbcH8 and UbcH7, several deletion constructs of E6AP were generated and assayed for their ability to interact with the different E2s. As summarized in Fig. 3 B, the Hect domain of E6AP was found to be required and sufficient for interaction with UbcH8 and UbcH7, while the amino-terminal sequences of E6AP were dispensable. Each of the deletions within the Hect region resulted in a loss of binding, further indicating the requirement of this region for interaction with the specific E2s (Fig. 3 B). Finer deletions within the Hect domain will be required to determine whether the entire region is involved in the interaction with E2s or whether specific segments mediate the binding. Nonetheless, these results suggest that the conserved Hect domains of this family of proteins may enable them to associate with specific E2 enzymes and as such provide the specificity for functional cooperation in substrate ubiquitination. Since the conserved Hect domain defines a family of proteins believed to function as E3s, the Hect domains of two other proteins, RSP5 and the rat p100 protein (17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar), were tested for their ability to interact with different E2s using the two-hybrid assay. Whereas the E6AP Hect domain interacted selectively with UbcH8 and UbcH7, the RSP5 Hect region was found to interact with UbcH6 and UbcH5, and not with other E2s (Fig.4). It should be noted that just as UbcH8 and UbcH7 are closely related to each other (45.7% identity; Fig. 1 B), UbcH6 and UbcH5 share strong homology with each other (53.7% identity; Fig. 1 B). The rat p100 protein was unable to interact with any of the five E2s that were tested in these experiments. On the basis of these results, it seems that different Hect containing proteins interact with specific subsets of closely related E2s and that the selective association of E2 and E3 proteins may constitute the basis of specificity for distinct E2:E3 combinations. Since UbcH8 and UbcH7 interact with E6AP, we next tested whether these E2s could function in conjunction with E6AP in the ubiquitination of HHR23A, an E6 independent substrate of E6AP (22Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar).2 The HHR23A protein was synthesized in WGE in the presence of radiolabeled methionine and incubated with E6AP either in the absence (Fig. 5, lane 2) or in the presence of equivalent amounts of bacterially expressed E2s as indicated. Due to the presence of endogenous E2 activity in WGE, some ubiquitinated forms of HHR23A were observed even in the absence of any exogenously added E2s (lane 2). However, upon addition of bacterially expressed UbcH8 or UbcH7, the ubiquitination of HHR23A was enhanced (lanes 3 and5). In contrast, the addition of UbcH5 did not seem to further facilitate the reaction over background levels (lane 4). Similar negative results were obtained using UbcH9 (data not shown). Therefore, consistent with the interaction data, the two E6AP-interacting E2s (UbcH8 and UbcH7) were also able to function with E6AP in the ubiquitination of one of its substrates, whereas noninteracting E2s were unable to do so. These results support the hypothesis that physical interaction between specific E2 and E3 enzymes may be important for functional cooperativity. The ubiquitin system plays a major role in selective protein degradation and may also be an important pathway for protein modification (4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Google Scholar, 5Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Google Scholar, 6Hicke L. Reizman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Google Scholar, 7Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Google Scholar). The specificity of substrate recognition by the ubiquitin system may be achieved by different E3 enzymes capable of interacting with specific substrates. However, specificity within the enzymatic components of the pathway, i.e. different E2:E3 combinations, may also influence substrate recognition and ubiquitination. As noted earlier, gene inactivation experiments in mice have indicated very specific roles for E2 enzymes (18Harbers K. Muller U. Grams A. Li E. Jaenisch R. Franz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12412-12417Google Scholar, 19Roest H.P. van Klaveren J. de Wit J. van Gurp C.G. Koken M. Vermey M. van Roijen J.H. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Vreeburg J. Baarends W.M. Bootsma D. Grootegoed J.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 799-810Google Scholar), although the way functional specificity for different E2s is achieved is not yet known. The existence of multiple E3 proteins and their likely role in substrate recognition strongly suggests that cooperation between specific E2 and E3 enzymes may play an important role in defining the specificity involved in substrate ubiquitination. Accordingly, ubiquitination of a substrate may depend upon the transfer of ubiquitin from E1 to a given E2, the ability of that E2 to cooperate with a specific E3, and finally the interaction between the E3 and the substrate. To date, however, the only physical interaction demonstrated between E2 and E3 proteins involves the S. cerevisiae Rad6 (Ubc2) protein and UBR1, a non-Hect domain E3 involved in the N-end rule pathway for protein degradation (13Bartel B. Wunning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Google Scholar, 31Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Google Scholar, 32Madura K. Dohmen R.J. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12046-12054Google Scholar, 33Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 250-261Google Scholar). UBR1 has not been shown to form thiol ester complexes with ubiquitin, suggesting that it may function more like an adaptor or docking protein by bringing in close proximity the relevant E2 and the substrate. The Hect domain family of E3 proteins, as established for E6AP, play a more direct role in substrate ubiquitination as they can form high energy thiol ester bonds with ubiquitin prior to the transfer and covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate (9Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar, 17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). Therefore, the Hect domain family of E3s do not function simply as adaptors between E2s and substrate proteins but rather participate as intermediates in the cascade of ubiquitin transfers from E1 to E2s, from E2s to specific E3s, and finally to substrates (9Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar, 17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). However, the basis of specificity for ubiquitin thiol ester transfer from E2s to E3s has not been addressed, and prior to this study, physical association of specific E2 and Hect E3 proteins had not been demonstrated. The studies presented here demonstrate for the first time complex formation between specific E2s and Hect E3 proteins in vivo, and suggest that the ability of E2s to interact selectively with Hect domain E3s forms the basis for functional cooperativity between E2 and E3 enzymes in substrate ubiquitination. UbcH8 and the closely related UbcH7 interacted specifically with E6AP. This interaction was mapped to the Hect domain of E6AP, suggesting that other Hect family E3 proteins may also have the ability to interact with specific E2s. Interestingly, two other E2s closely related to each other, UbcH6 and UbcH5, were found to interact selectively with RSP5, a Hect-domain protein from S. cerevisiae (17Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar, 23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Google Scholar, 30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar). None of the five E2s examined in this study interacted with the rat p100 protein. Finally, we demonstrate that the two E6AP-interacting E2s also functioned in conjunction with E6AP in the ubiquitination of HHR23A, an E6AP substrate (22Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar).2 The noninteracting E2s were unable to enhance the ubiquitination of HHR23A above background levels observed in wheat germ extracts. Prior to this report, the only assay used to define the specificity of ubiquitin thiol ester transfer from E2s to Hect E3s was based uponin vitro reactions in which relatively high amounts of partially purified components were used to detect the transfer of a radiolabeled GST-ubiquitin fusion protein to E6AP (9Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar, 30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar). Using thesein vitro thiol ester assays, E6AP was shown to accept ubiquitin from A. thaliana Ubc8, UbcH5, and UbcH7 (23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Google Scholar, 30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar); and, RSP5 from UbcH5 (30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar). However, as shown in this study, UbcH5 fails to interact efficiently with E6AP in the yeast two-hybrid system whereas it can interact strongly with RSP5. The most probable explanation for a lack of efficient interaction between E6AP and UbcH5 may be that the two proteins do not have a high affinity for each other. Accordingly, it is possible that unlike the assay conditions for thiol ester transfer in vitro (9Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar), the comparatively low levels of protein expression from centromeric plasmids in yeast cells (21Sardet C. Vidal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Google Scholar) may preclude the detection of relatively low affinity interactions. Consistent with this possibility, UbcH5 was unable to enhance the ubiquitination of HHR23A under conditions where E6AP-interacting UbcH8 and UbcH7 did so efficiently. In this regard, it is also important to note that UbcH5, which is very similar to Arabidopsis thaliana Ubc8, was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using two degenerate primers corresponding to conserved sequences in A. thaliana Ubc8 and other similar E2s (23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Google Scholar). As such, the isolation of UbcH5 was not based upon any functional criteria that link it directly to E6AP. On the other hand, UbcH7 (initially called E2-F1) was isolated as an E2 activity from reticulocyte lysates and shown to function with E6 and E6AP in the ubiquitination of p53 (34Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Google Scholar, 35Ciechanover A. Shkedy D. Oren M. Bercovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9582-9589Google Scholar). The cDNA for E2-F1 was subsequently cloned by Nuber et al. (30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar) based upon peptide sequences derived from direct protein sequencing (34Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Google Scholar) and designated as UbcH7 (30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar). UbcH7 was shown to be capable of transferring ubiquitin to E6APin vitro (30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Google Scholar). As described in this report, we isolated UbcH8 as a specific E6AP-interacting protein, and show that it also can transfer ubiquitin to E6AP. Sequence comparison revealed that UbcH8 was most closely related to UbcH7, and both E2s could interact specifically with E6AP. As noted above, UbcH5 and UbcH6 share a high degree of homology with each other. Both of these E2s failed to bind E6AP efficiently but interacted strongly with RSP5. Consistent with this observation, UbcH6 and to a lesser extent UbcH5, were also able to bind Pub-1, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of RSP5. 3S. Kumar, W. H. Kao, and P. M. Howley, unpublished observation. Based on the interaction and functional data presented here, UbcH8 and UbcH7 represent a structurally related subfamily of E2s that may function physiologically with E6AP in the ubiquitination of its substrates, whereas UbcH6 and UbcH5 may belong to a subfamily that functions with the mammalian homologues of RSP5. Further studies are currently underway to extend the analysis of E2:E3 interactions to additional E2s and Hect E3s. As more substrates of the E3 enzymes become known, different E2:E3 combinations can be tested for their ability to function in the ubiquitination of specific substrates, thereby allowing the identification of E2:E3 pairs that cooperate in substrate ubiquitination.

After insertion into, or translocation across, the membrane of the ER, newly synthesized proteins often require the assistance of folding enzymes and molecular chaperones to assist subsequent folding and oligomeric assembly (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar, 2Helenius A. Marquardt T. Braakman I. Trends Cell. Biol. 1992; 2: 227-231Google Scholar). Many chaperones specifically associate with newly synthesized proteins, apparently by recognizing specific features present in the incompletely folded or assembled polypeptide (3Blond-Elguindi S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Google Scholar). Calnexin, an integral membrane protein, and calreticulin, its luminal homologue, are two ER-resident molecular chaperones that have been shown to bind selectively and transiently to glycoproteins that carry asparagine-linked carbohydrate side chains (5Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Google Scholar, 6Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Google Scholar, 7Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Google Scholar). More precisely, calnexin and calreticulin interact specifically with the monoglucosylated form of the oligosaccharide (8Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Google Scholar, 9Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Google Scholar, 10Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Google Scholar), leading to retention of the glycoprotein within the ER (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Google Scholar). The monoglucosylated glycans are generated by the action of glucosidases I and II, which rapidly remove two of the three glucoses from the mannose-rich oligosaccharide core (12Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Google Scholar). Slow removal of the final glucose by glucosidase II allows the release of the glycoprotein by calnexin and calreticulin. The re-addition of a single, terminal, glucose residue by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (13Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 771-779Google Scholar, 14Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Google Scholar) occurs when a glycoprotein has not attained its correctly folded state, thus regenerating a monoglucosylated glycan. In this way a cycle of de- and reglucosylation acts to modulate the association of calnexin and calreticulin (8Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Google Scholar, 12Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Google Scholar), allowing the selective binding and retention of incompletely folded or assembled glycoproteins within the ER. Hence, calnexin, calreticulin, and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase are believed to constitute a “quality control” step for newly synthesized glycoproteins prior to their exit from the ER (11Hammond C.

We have recently identified a third ER-resident protein that binds specifically to secretory glycoproteins containing trimmedN-linked oligosaccharides (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J.

Several mammalian ERp57 cDNAs have been identified, and the amino acid sequences encoded all share significant homology with protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) (27Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Google Scholar). Although ERp57 has been suggested to be a cysteine-dependent protease (19Urade R. Nasu M. Moriyama T. Wada K. Kito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15152-15159Google Scholar, 28Otsu M. Urade R. Kito M. Omura F. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14958-14961Google Scholar), a carnitine palmitoyltransferase (29Murthy M.S.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 336-342Google Scholar), its precise function remains to be established. Consistent with its thiol-dependent reductase activity is the presence of two WCGHCK motifs identical to those found in PDI and ERp72, and very similar to those in thioredoxin (27Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Google Scholar). We previously found that ERp57 interacts specifically with glycosylated secretory proteins (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). In this study we show that ERp57 can bind integral membrane proteins only when they bear N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Furthermore, this N-linked carbohydrate must be “trimmed” by the removal of a terminal glucose residue(s), and ERp57 appears to interact in combination with either calnexin or calreticulin. Hence, ERp57 may be a generic component of a glycoprotein-specific folding machinery operating in the ER. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK)). SP6 RNA polymerase and transcription buffers were supplied by Promega (Southampton, Hampshire, UK), and Protein A-Sepharose was from Zymed (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK). The cross-linking reagent bismaleimidohexane (BMH) was purchased from Pierce and Warriner (Warrington, UK), while succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) was obtained from M & G (Stockport, Cheshire, UK).l-[35S]Methionine was purchased from New England Nuclear (DuPont, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK). Proteinase K, cycloheximide, puromycin, emetine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and castanospermine (CST) were obtained from Sigma (Dorset, UK). 1-Deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) was purchased from Oxford Glycosystems (Oxford, UK). Polyclonal rabbit anti-calreticulin serum was from Affinity BioReagents (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK), while anti-calnexin serum raised against the carboxyl terminus of calnexin was a gift from Professor Ari Helenius (Department of Cell Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Rabbit antiserum recognizing canine PDI was a gift from Dr. N. Bullied (School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum recognizing the NH2 terminus of GlyC was raised against a peptide representing the first 12 amino acids. Antibodies recognizing canine ERp57 were affinity-purified from total rabbit serum as described previously (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). Chicken antiserum raised against rat ERp57 (anti-ERp57-2) was the generous gift of Dr. J. Holtzman (Department of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). The 5′-noncoding region of the cDNA encoding human glycophorin C (GlyC) (32Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Google Scholar) was replaced with the sequence 5′-AGATCTTCCACCATG-3′. This sequence contains a consensus “Kozak” sequence and a BglII site, allowing the glycophorin C coding region to be subcloned into pSPUT-K (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) as a BglII/HpaI fragment, resulting in pSK-GlyC. Point mutants of glycophorin C were generated using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Cambridge, UK). GlyC-Cys contains a cysteine residue rather than a serine at position six of GlyC. In GlyC-Cys ΔCHO the site of glycosylation, an asparagine residue at position eight, has been replaced with a serine. The cDNA for the human glucose transporter (Glut 1) was provided by Dr. S. Baldwin (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, UK). A mutant with a cysteine residue replacing the tyrosine at position 44, adjacent to the glycosylated asparagine, was generated as described above (cf. Ref. 32Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Google Scholar). This mutant construct, Glut 1-Cys44, was used in all subsequent experiments. All mutant constructs were checked by DNA sequencing prior to use. pSK-GlyC was linearized withBamHI and used as a template in an SP6 RNA polymerase transcription system according to the manufacturers instructions (Promega). The resulting mRNA encoded full-length GlyC. mRNA encoding the NH2-terminal 155 amino acids of Glut 1-Cys44 was prepared as described previously for wild type Glut 1 (32Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Google Scholar). The mRNAs were translated at 26 °C in a wheat germ lysate system (33Steuber D. Ibrahimi I. Cutler D. Dobberstein B. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3143-3148Google Scholar) in the presence ofl-[35S]methionine and canine pancreatic microsomes. After 20 min, further initiation was inhibited by the adding 7-methylguanosine 5′-monophosphate to a final concentration of 4 mm. Following an additional 10 min, translation was terminated by the addition of cycloheximide to a final concentration of 2 mm, and samples were placed on ice. The membrane-associated fraction was isolated from the translation mixture by centrifugation through a high salt/sucrose cushion (250 mm sucrose, 500 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9) at 130,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in ∼0.67 volumes of the original translation reaction using low salt/sucrose buffer (250 mmsucrose, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9) containing 1 mm emetine. Cross-linking was performed with either BMH or SMCC. SMCC is a heterobifunctional reagent, which reacts with suitable amino groups, i.e. the ε amino group of lysines and the primary amine found at the NH2 terminus of most proteins, and free sulfhydryls. BMH is a homobifunctional reagent specific for the free sulfhydryls of cysteine residues. The resuspended membrane fraction was incubated for 10 min at 26 °C in the presence of either 1 mm BMH or 1 mm SMCC added from a 50 mm stock in Me2SO. Control samples were treated with Me2SO alone. The reaction was quenched by adding either 0.1 volumes of 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 500 mm glycine (for SMCC), or 0.1 volumes of 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (for BMH), and the samples were left for 20 min on ice. Following cross-linking the samples were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation to yield the total membrane fraction, or specific products were immunoprecipitated as described below. Membrane-associated GlyC was incubated with 250 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min on ice. Where present, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% prior to the incubation. Following the digestion, proteinase K was inhibited by the addition of 200 μg/ml PMSF, followed by precipitation with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, 50% acetone. The resulting pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.9, at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. The cross-linking products were either solubilized directly (“nondenaturing”), or were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C in the presence of 1% SDS (“denaturing”) prior to solubilization. The solubilization buffer was 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (32Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added to the samples, which were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 9.6%, 12%, or 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as indicated, and then visualized using a Fujix BAS 2000 Bioimager. We have previously shown that the “PDI-like” protein, ERp57 (see Ref.27Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Google Scholar), associates specifically with newly synthesized secretory glycoproteins in the lumen of the ER (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). In this present study, the carbohydrate-dependent interactions between integral membrane proteins and components of the ER lumen were investigated. The glycosylated integral membrane protein glycophorin C (GlyC) was used as a model glycoprotein for this analysis. GlyC is a single spanning membrane protein with an uncleaved signal-anchor sequence, which results in the protein assuming a type 1 orientation in the membrane (i.e. NH2 terminus translocated; see Refs. 34High S. Tanner M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 277-280Google Scholarand 35High S. Dobberstein B. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 581-586Google Scholar). The protein has a single site for the addition of an asparagine-linked glycan at amino acid residue eight (Ref. 34High S. Tanner M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 277-280Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1). Wild type GlyC (GlyC-wt) contains no cysteine residues, and the only lysine residues are in the cytoplasmic region of the protein (Fig. 1). This allowed us to use the free amino terminus, and a cysteine introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1,[Ser6 → Cys6]) as potential site-specific targets for bifunctional cross-linking reagents. Since our main aim was to identify carbohydrate-specific interactions, we generated a second GlyC mutant construct, which contained a cysteine at position six but lacked an asparagine at position eight (GlyC-Cys ΔCHO) and hence could not be glycosylated at this position. Before we investigated the interactions of GlyC with luminal ER proteins, we established that the point mutations we had introduced did not influence the integration or transmembrane orientation of GlyC. To this end, a protease protection assay of the various membrane integrated GlyC polypeptides was performed (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the absence of protease treatment, two forms of GlyC-wt were observed, representing the glycosylated (GlyC-CHO) and non-glycosylated (GlyC) polypeptides (Fig. 2, lane 1). The 3-kDa difference in mobility is consistent with the addition of a single N-linked oligosaccharide side chain. GlyC-Cys behaved identically to GlyC-wt (Fig. 2, lane 7). As expected, only the faster migrating non-glycosylated product was seen with GlyC-Cys ΔCHO (Fig. 2, lane 4), confirming that this protein was not glycosylated. Following proteinase K treatment, products that corresponded to the glycosylated (unfilled arrowhead) or unglycosylated (asterisk) NH2 terminus of GlyC (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 5, and 8) could be immunoprecipitated. The bulk of the protease-protected GlyC-wt and GlyC-Cys was glycosylated (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and8), while all of the protease-protected GlyC-Cys ΔCHO fragment was unglycosylated (Fig. 2, lane 5). No products were observed when Triton X-100 was present during proteinase K treatment, indicating complete digestion of GlyC (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 6, and 9). These results demonstrated that the mutant GlyC proteins used in this study are correctly inserted into canine pancreatic microsomes, with an orientation identical to the wild type protein. Since the membrane insertion of GlyC was unaffected by the introduction of the point mutations, we proceeded to analyze the interactions of these proteins with ER luminal components. Following translation of GlyC-wt in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes, the membrane-associated fraction was treated with the heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent SMCC. After cross-linking, the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a variety of antibodies against ER proteins (Fig. 3). Cross-linking products were precipitated by antisera specific for calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 5, and 7), but not with a control unrelated antiserum (Fig. 3, lane 3). Likewise, no discrete cross-linking to PDI was observed, although a faint smear could be seen (Fig. 3, lane 6). Since the amino-group at the NH2 terminus of the protein is the only SMCC-reactive group present in GlyC-wt, we conclude that GlyC can be cross-linked via its free NH2 terminus to three glycoprotein-specific ER components (cf. Refs. 16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar and 32Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Google Scholar). As expected, no such cross-linking products were observed when SMCC was omitted from the experiment (data not shown). The cysteine mutant (GlyC-Cys) was created to introduce a cross-linking site into GlyC that was closer to the site of carbohydrate addition than the NH2-terminal amino group (see Fig. 1, [Ser6 → Cys6]). The incorporation of the cysteine into GlyC appeared to increase the efficiency of SMCC-dependent cross-linking to calnexin and calreticulin (cf. Figs. 3 and4). An additional calnexin-containing adduct, barely visible in the GlyC-wt samples (Fig. 3, lane 4), was also considerably enhanced in GlyC-Cys (Fig. 4, lane 4,open arrowhead). An ∼80-kDa product was observed with GlyC-Cys even in the absence of any added cross-linking reagent (Fig.4, lane 1, filled circle). This product was not consistently observed (cf. Fig. 4, lane 1 and Fig. 5, lane 1) and may represent a small proportion of GlyC that has formed an aberrant inter-molecular disulfide linkage. When GlyC-Cys was processed in the absence of SMCC, no products were observed following immunoprecipitation by the antisera recognizing ER components (data not shown). Introduction of an additional lysine, in place of the serine at position six of GlyC, had no effect and the cross-linking pattern observed with SMCC was identical to that seen with GlyC-wt (data not shown). The cross-linking of GlyC-wt and GlyC-Cys to calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 allowed us to address the dependence of these interactions upon the glycosylation of the polypeptide.Figure 5Interaction of ERp57 with GlyC-Cys is dependent upon glycosylation. GlyC-Cys and a non-glycosylated mutant version (GlyC-Cys ΔCHO) were translated, and the membrane fraction isolated. Samples were treated with 1 mmBMH and subjected to denaturing immunoprecipitation with antisera specific for the following proteins: control unrelated serum (lanes 3 and 10), GlyC (COOH terminus) (lanes 4 and 11), PDI (lanes 5 and12), ERp57 (lanes 6 and 13), and ERp57-2 (lanes 7 and 14). Total products after treatment with Me2SO only (lanes 1 and8) or 1 mm BMH (lanes 2 and9) are also shown. Cross-linking products between GlyC and ERp57 (arrow), PDI (filled diamond), and an unidentified 68-kDa glycoprotein (open circle) are indicated. The samples were analyzed on a 9.6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.TCA, trichloroacetic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The luminal region of GlyC-Cys has two potential sites from which SMCC may cross-link to adjacent proteins: the amino group at the NH2 terminus and the sulfhydryl of the cysteine. By using the homobifunctional, sulfhydryl-specific reagent BMH (see Ref. 36Laird V. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Google Scholar), we could limit the cross-linking targets in GlyC-Cys to the sulfhydryl of the cysteine alone. Using BMH, in combination with GlyC-Cys and a non-glycosylated mutant (GlyC-Cys ΔCHO), we set out to establish the role of the N-linked carbohydrate in promoting specific interactions with glycosylated integral membrane proteins. Following treatment with BMH, a complex pattern of cross-linking products was observed with membrane inserted GlyC-Cys and GlyC-Cys ΔCHO (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 9, respectively). With GlyC-Cys, three of these cross-linking products, with apparent molecular masses between 80 and 90 kDa (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and7, arrow), were immunoprecipitated by two different antisera specific for ERp57. None of these ERp57-GlyC cross-links were observed with GlyC-Cys ΔCHO. In contrast, PDI was found to be cross-linked to both GlyC-Cys and GlyC-Cys ΔCHO (Fig. 5,lanes 5 and 12, filled diamond). The identity of the glycosylation-independent 91–94-kDa cross-linking product, observed with both GlyC-Cys and GlyC-Cys ΔCHO (Fig. 5,lanes 2 and 9, unfilled circle), remains to be established. Thus, the BMH-dependent cross-linking of ERp57 to GlyC required an N-linked carbohydrate side chain. Since the immunoprecipitations were carried out after SDS denaturation of the samples, all three products visible must contain ERp57 (Fig. 5,lanes 6 and 7). The different products are most likely all GlyC-Cys-ERp57 adducts with different mobilities resulting from the cross-linking of GlyC-Cys to different cysteine residues within ERp57. CST inhibits the ER glucosidases I and II, preventing the removal of the terminal glucose residues fromN-linked oligosaccharides. CST has been used to establish that glucose trimming is required for several ER proteins to interact with nascent glycoproteins (7Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Google Scholar, 12Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Google Scholar, 16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). The effect of CST and dMM (a mannosidase inhibitor) on the BMH-dependent cross-linking of GlyC-Cys to ERp57 and PDI was assessed. A decrease in the mobility of glycosylated GlyC-Cys was observed following CST treatment, demonstrating that glucose trimming was efficiently inhibited (Fig. 6, lane 9,unfilled arrow). In the presence of CST the amount of ERp57 cross-linking products obtained was dramatically reduced (by ∼75%) (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, there was an ∼50% increase in the PDI cross-linking product (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and3). Treatment with dMM had little effect on either the ERp57 cross-linking products (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5) or the PDI cross-linking products (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and2). These results confirm that ERp57 associates much more efficiently with GlyC polypeptides which bear a glucose-trimmed oligosaccharide. The carbohydrate-dependent interactions of GlyC-Cys were further investigated by sequential immunoprecipitation. Membrane-associated GlyC-Cys was treated with BMH, and the cross-linking products were immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions, i.e. without SDS denaturation, using antisera specific for calnexin, calreticulin, or PDI (Fig.7, lanes 1, 4, and 7, respectively). Prior to a second round of immunoprecipitation, samples were denatured by heating with 1% SDS at 95 °C, and the resulting products were then re-precipitated using a variety of antibodies (Fig.7, lanes 2, 3, 5, 6,8, and 9). Calnexin (asterisk), calreticulin (unfilled arrow), and PDI (filled diamond) were all shown to be cross-linked to GlyC-Cys by re-precipitation with the respective antisera (Fig. 7, lanes 2, 5, and 8, respectively). ERp57-GlyC-Cys cross-linking products had co-immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin and anti-calreticulin sera under nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 7,lanes 3 and 6, respectively). However, no co-precipitation of ERp57 with PDI cross-linking products was observed (Fig. 7, lane 9). Hence, ERp57 appears to interact with glycosylated glycophorin C in combination with calnexin or calreticulin. To determine whether the association of ERp57 with glycosylated membrane proteins was more widespread, the carbohydrate-dependent interactions of the human Glut 1-glucose transporter were examined. A 155-residue amino-terminal fragment of Glut 1-Cys44, GT155-Cys44 (cf. Ref. 32Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Google Scholar), was translated in the presence of microsomes, with or without CST, and the membranes isolated by centrifugation through a high salt/sucrose cushion. The membrane fraction was then treated with 1 mmSMCC and cross-linking products immunoprecipitated under both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions (Fig. 8,A and B, respectively). In the absence of SDS treatment, the anti-calnexin and anti-calreticulin sera immunoprecipitated a major cross-linking product of approximately 74 kDa (Fig. 8 A, lanes 3 and 4,arrow), which was not observed under denaturing conditions (Fig.8 B, lanes 3 and 4). However, a product of identical mobility was immunoprecipitated by anti-ERp57 serum under denaturing conditions, indicating that ERp57 interacts with GT155-Cys44 (Fig. 8 B, lane 6). When CST was present during protein synthesis and cross-linking, the interaction with ERp57 was completely inhibited (Fig. 8 B, lane 12). Hence, the previously characterized NH2-terminal fragment of Glut 1 (32Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Google Scholar) interacts with ERp57 only after glucose trimming of theN-linked carbohydrate side chain. The GT155-Cys44-ERp57 cross-linking product is co-precipitated with calnexin and calreticulin antisera, and we conclude that ERp57 is identical to the 60-kDa calnexin-associated protein (CAP-60) we previously identified in association with the wild type GT155 (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar, 32Oliver J.D. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13691-13696Google Scholar). Hence, ERp57 interacts specifically with two glycosylated integral membrane polypeptides. We recently established that the “PDI-like” protein, ERp57, interacts specifically with secretory glycoproteins bearing glucose-trimmed, N-linked, oligosaccharides (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). In this study we have established that ERp57 shows a similar specificity for integral membrane glycoproteins. We have used the cross-linking reagents SMCC and BMH to identify calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 as cross-linking partners of the single-spanning membrane glycoprotein, GlyC. ERp57 was also cross-linked to an NH2-terminal fragment of the multiple spanning membrane glycoprotein, Glut 1. Crucially, the interaction of ERp57 with both GlyC and Glut 1 was shown to require the presence of a glucose-trimmed, N-linked, oligosaccharide side chain. Calnexin and calreticulin are also specific for glucose-trimmed glycoproteins, binding preferentially to proteins with monoglucosylatedN-linked carbohydrate side chains (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Google Scholar). We have now established that ERp57 associates specifically with two different integral membrane glycoproteins (this work) and three soluble glycoproteins (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). On this basis it seems likely that ERp57 is a generic ER component with the potential to interact with all newly synthesized glycoproteins. Hence, ERp57 may play a specific role in modulating glycoprotein biosynthesis at the ER and constitute part of the quality control pathway devoted to these molecules (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Google Scholar). Both the ERp57-GlyC and ERp57-Glut 1 cross-linking products co-precipitate with either anti-calnexin or anti-calreticulin sera under nondenaturing conditions. This is consistent with the proposal that ERp57 interacts with glycoproteins in combination with calnexin or calreticulin (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). The carbohydrate specificity of the interaction may be mediated by the lectin-like proteins calnexin and calreticulin (7Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Google Scholar,10Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Google Scholar, 37Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Google Scholar, 38Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Google Scholar), rather than by ERp57 itself. In this regard it is interesting to note the presence of an ∼160-kDa cross-linking product immunoprecipitated by anti-calnexin sera (Fig. 4, lane 4,open arrowhead). This presumably represents a ternary complex between GlyC, calnexin, and an as yet unidentified protein, suggesting calnexin may be able to recruit components other than ERp57 into a ternary complex. The exact role of ERp57 within the lumen of the ER remains to be established. ERp57 shares significant sequence homology with PDI, a soluble ER-resident protein that catalyzes disulfide interchange, promoting the formation of native disulfide bonds within newly synthesized proteins (27Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Google Scholar). The greatest homology occurs within two 110-amino acid repeats, which each contain a Trp-Cys-Gly-His-Cys-Lys motif. These motifs are completely conserved between a number of PDI-like proteins, and they contain the catalytic cysteine residues (27Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Google Scholar, 39Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Google Scholar). Several groups have detected a thiol-reductase activity in ERp57 (21Srivastava S.P. Fuchs J.A. Holtzman J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 971-978Google Scholar, 22Bourdi M. Demady D. Martin J.L. Jabbour S.K. Martin B.M. George J.W. Pohl L.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 397-403Google Scholar, 30Srivastava S.P. Chen N.Q. Liu Y.X. Holtzman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20337-20344Google Scholar, 31Hirano N. Shibasaki F. Sakai R. Tanaka T. Nishida J. Yazaki Y. Takenawa T. Hirai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 336-342Google Scholar), suggesting it may be serving a similar function to PDI. However, our results indicate that unlike PDI, ERp57 has a specificity for glycoproteins (see also Ref. 16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). Although both calnexin and calreticulin have been described as molecular chaperones (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Google Scholar, 15Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Google Scholar) and have been shown to bind glycoprotein folding intermediates (6Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Google Scholar, 7Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Google Scholar, 8Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Google Scholar, 40Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Google Scholar), no direct effect of calnexin or calreticulin upon protein folding has been demonstrated. Since ERp57 has the potential to influence disulfide bond formation, it may be that the role of calnexin and calreticulin is to direct newly synthesized glycoproteins into specific folding pathways mediated by other components, such as ERp57. In fact, the interaction of ERp57 with glycoproteins is not dependent upon the presence of a cysteine residue since the wild type GlyC, lacking any cysteines, is still cross-linked to ERp57. Likewise, the soluble glycoprotein, yeast pro-α-factor, which also has no cysteine residues, can be cross-linked to ERp57 in a CST-sensitive manner (16Oliver J.D. Van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar). Thus, ERp57 might function as a more general “molecular chaperone” in addition to a specific role in modulating disulfide bond formation. This is consistent with the idea that, in addition to its disulfide isomerase activity (27Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Google Scholar), PDI may play other roles within the lumen of the ER (41Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Google Scholar, 42Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Google Scholar). The proposal that ERp57 may act as a molecular chaperone is supported by the observation that, like BiP (GRP78) and GRP94, it is a glucose-regulated protein (17Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 106: 119-125Google Scholar, 31Hirano N. Shibasaki F. Sakai R. Tanaka T. Nishida J. Yazaki Y. Takenawa T. Hirai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 336-342Google Scholar), and its synthesis is rapidly increased upon glucose deprivation and the inhibition of protein glycosylation (43Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of GRP94, BiP, ERp57, and calreticulin all show a 5–10-fold increase in the thyrocytes of mice synthesizing a mutant form of thyroglobulin when compared with the levels of these proteins in the thyrocytes of normal mice (44Kim P.S. Kwon O.Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Google Scholar). Since BiP and GRP94 are functional molecular chaperones (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar, 11Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Google Scholar), ERp57 may also have a similar function as part of the ER “stress response.” A second member of the PDI family, ERp72, has also been shown to be induced under conditions of stress and hence proposed to function as some form of molecular chaperone (42Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Google Scholar, 44Kim P.S. Kwon O.Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Google Scholar, 45Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Google Scholar). Significantly, when the association of ERp57, calnexin, and calreticulin with GlyC is impaired by blocking glucose trimming, the cross-linking of GlyC to PDI shows a reciprocal increase. This suggests that the association of one set of ER luminal proteins with a newly synthesized glycoprotein may restrict the access of alternative components. We envisage that, following recruitment by calnexin or calreticulin, ERp57 acts to modulate the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins and contributes to the recently described “quality control” pathway for these molecules (see Ref. 11Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Google Scholar). We are now trying to address the role of ERp57 upon glycoprotein folding directly.

https://openalex.org/W1989352995,"We recently described two eye guanylyl cyclases (GC-E and GC-F) that contain an apparent extracellular domain potentially capable of binding ligands (Yang, R.-B., Foster, D. C., Garbers, D. L., and Fülle, H.-J. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 602–606). Here, Northern and Western analyses showed that both cyclases are expressed in the retina and enriched in photoreceptor outer segments. By the use of specific GC-E and GC-F antibodies coupled to different sized gold particles both cyclases were colocalized within the same photoreceptor cells raising the possibility of homomeric and/or heteromeric interactions. A point mutant of GC-E (D878A) was constructed and expressed; it contained no detectable cyclase activity but acted in a dominant negative fashion to abolish the activity of native GC-E and GC-F in coexpression studies. These results suggested that GC-E and GC-F could form either homomers or heteromers, at least when overexpressed in COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitation with GC-E and GC-F antibody followed by Western analysis confirmed that both homomers and heteromers could be formed. However, similar experiments using retina or outer segments revealed that a vast majority of GC-E and GC-F were precipitated as homomers in the eye. Therefore, like other members of the membrane guanylyl cyclase subfamily, GC-E and GC-F appear to preferentially form homomers. We recently described two eye guanylyl cyclases (GC-E and GC-F) that contain an apparent extracellular domain potentially capable of binding ligands (Yang, R.-B., Foster, D. C., Garbers, D.

Therefore, like other members of the membrane guanylyl cyclase subfamily, GC-E and GC-F appear to preferentially form homomers. Rod and cone cells convert the energy of an absorbed photon to an electrophysiological signal in a process called phototransduction. The photoexcitation beginning with rhodopsin leads to an enzymatic cascade resulting in the increased hydrolysis of cyclic GMP (cGMP) and closure of the cGMP-gated cation channel. Photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases have been suggested to be regulated by Ca2+-sensitive guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (1Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S. Surgucheva I.R. Subbaraya I. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22029-22036Google Scholar, 2Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Google Scholar); thus a decrease in cytoplasmic Ca2+ in response to light is suggested to relieve inhibition of the cyclases, for subsequent restoration of cGMP concentrations, and for a return to the dark state (3Koch K.W. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 314-321Google Scholar, 4Detwiler P.B. Gray-Keller M.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 440-444Google Scholar). Two membrane forms of guanylyl cyclase have been found specifically expressed in the eye of the rat (5Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 602-606Google Scholar), human (6Shyjan A.W. de Sauvage F.J. Gillett N.A. Goeddel D.V. Lowe D.G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 727-737Google Scholar, 7Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M.

J. 1994; 302: 455-461Google Scholar). In the rat, they are termed GC-E 1The abbreviations used are: GC, guanylyl cyclase; RetGC, retinal GC; HA, hemagglutinin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: GC, guanylyl cyclase; RetGC, retinal GC; HA, hemagglutinin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and GC-F (5Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 602-606Google Scholar), whereas their human homologs are designated RetGC-1 and RetGC-2, respectively (7Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M. Laura R. Lu L. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5535-5539Google Scholar). These cyclases contain an apparent extracellular domain that retains a number of conserved cysteine residues found in guanylyl cyclases with known ligands (5Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 602-606Google Scholar, 9Fülle H.-J. Vassar R. Foster D.C. Yang R.-B. Axel R. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3571-3575Google Scholar). The eye cyclases also contain an intracellular protein kinase homology domain and a cyclase catalytic domain homologous to all other membrane guanylyl cyclases. Although other membrane guanylyl cyclases are known to form homomers (10Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Google Scholar, 11Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Google Scholar, 12Vaandrager A.B. van der Wiel E. Hom M.L. Luthjens L.H. De Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16409-16415Google Scholar), the existence of two cyclases in the eye raises the important question of whether both are located within the same cell, and if so, whether these membrane cyclases could form heteromers, a characteristic of the soluble forms of guanylyl cyclase (13Harteneck C. Koesling D. Soling A. Schultz G. Bohme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 221-223Google Scholar, 14Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24871-24875Google Scholar). Based on Northern and Western analyses, we showed that GC-E and GC-F are expressed in a retinal-specific manner with enriched partition to the outer segments. GC-E and GC-F not only form homo-oligomers but also associate in a heteromeric state in co-transfected COS cells. In addition, a point mutant of GC-E (D878A) exerts a dominant negative effect when coexpressed with wild-type GC-E and GC-F. Therefore, in cultured cells overproducing GC-E or GC-F, either hetero- or homo-oligomers can be formed. Using immunogold labeling, colocalization of both cyclases was evident within the same photoreceptor cells raising the possibility that hetero- and homo-oligomers also exist normally. However, solubilization of the cyclases from the retina or outer segment membranes followed by immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western analysis demonstrated that GC-E and GC-F exist principally as homomers. The full-length cDNAs for GC-E and GC-F were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 and termed pCMV5-GC-E and pCMV5-GC-F, respectively (5Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 602-606Google Scholar). The FLAG (DYKDDDDK) and HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitopes were positioned immediately after the cleavage site of the signal peptide by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (15Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). Briefly, the resulting PCR fragments containing the desired epitope insertions were used to replace 5′ wild-typeEcoRI/XhoI or BglII/NsiI fragments in pCMV5-GC-E or pCMV5-GC-F constructs, respectively. A similar approach was used to generate a GC-E D878A point mutation. The PCR product with the D878A mutation was digested with SalI and NdeI and then ligated with additional wild-type 5′EcoRI/SalI and 3′ NdeI/SalI fragments into the pCMV5 vector. Modified sequences in all constructs were confirmed by sequencing of both strands. The following primers were used in the constructions (modified sequences are underlined): FLAG-E1S, 5′-GAC TAC AAG GAC GAT GAC GAT AAG GCT GTG TTC AAA GTG GGG GTG-3′; FLAG-E1A, 5′-CTT ATC GTC ATC GTC CTT GTA GTC GGA GAA GGC AGA CGG AGA TGG-3′; HA-E1S, 5′-TAT CCT TAC GAC GTA CCT GAT TAC GCT GTG TTC AAA GTG GGG GTG-3′; HA-E1A, 5′-AGC GTA ATC AGG TAC GTC GTA AGG ATA GGA GAA GGC AGA CGG AGA TGG-3′; M13–20, 5′-TAA AAC GAC GGC CAG TGA GCG -3′; E09A, 5′-TCC TGG TCT AAT AGC TCG-3′; FLAG-F1S, 5′-GAC TAC AAG GAC GAT GAC AAG CTC CCC TAC AAG ATA GGG GTC-3′; FLAG-F1A, 5′-CTT ATC GTC ATC GTC CTT GTA GTC TGC TTG CCC CCA TAT GAG-3′; HA-F1S, 5′-TAT CCT TAC GAC GTA CCT GAT TAC GCT CTC CCC TAC AAG ATA GGG GTC-3′; HA-F1A, 5′-AGC GTA ATC AGG TAC GTC GTA AGG ATA TGC TTG CCC CCA TAT GAG-3′; F-PCR2S, 5′-AGA TCT CCT CCA GTA TCT CAT CAC-3′; F-5A, 5′-AGT GTG TCT GAG TCT CTC-3′; E878DA-1S, 5′-GTG GAA ACA ATT GGA GCT GCA TAC ATG GTG GC-3′; E878DA-1A, 5′-GCC ACC ATG TAT GCA GCT CCA ATT GTT TCC AC-3′; E878-2S, 5′-GAA GAG GTG ACA CTC TAT TTC-3′; E878-2A, 5′-GCA GTA CCG AGG CAT GGT GAG-3′. FLAG-E1S/E1A or HA-E1S/E1A primer pairs combined with M13–20 and E09A primers were used to construct the pFLAG-GC-E or pHA-GC-E vector. FLAG-F1S/F1A, HA-F1S/F1A, F-PCR2S, and F-5A primers were used to create PFLAG-GC-F and PHA-GC-F constructs. Other primers were designed for the point mutation pE-D878A plasmid. Whole eyes were collected from Sprague-Dawley rats after decapitation. The retinas were dissected from the posterior chamber of the eye cup, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNAs were isolated from the whole eye, retina, and retina-depleted eye by homogenization in guanidinium thiocyanate followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation with isopropyl alcohol (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). 30 μg of RNA was separated on 2.2 m formaldehyde, 1% agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes in 20 × SSC. Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA with a 1.6-kilobase pair GC-E or a 1.0-kilobase pair GC-F cDNA probe (5Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 602-606Google Scholar). Blots were washed twice at room temperature and twice at 65 °C in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (30 min per wash). Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C for 3 days. Two peptides, NH2-IPPERRKKLEKARPGQFTGK-COOH and NH2-AEIAAFQRRKAERQLVRNKP-COOH, corresponding to the COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of GC-E and GC-F were synthesized (5Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 602-606Google Scholar). Peptides were conjugated to tuberculin (Serumstaatensinstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark). Each conjugated complex mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant was injected subcutaneously in female New Zealand White rabbits. Booster injections were given every 3 weeks. Anti-FLAG (M2) and HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection was by the DEAE-dextran method on 100-mm plates (17Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Google Scholar). Two days following transfection, cells were washed twice with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and scraped into centrifuge tubes. The cell pellet was frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. To determine guanylyl cyclase activity, membrane proteins from transfected cells or chromatographic fractions were added to a total reaction volume of 100 μl containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 4 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm GTP, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP. Incubations were for 10 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 110 mm zinc acetate and 0.5 ml of 110 mm Na2CO3. [32P]cGMP was purified by Dowex chromatography and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting as described (18Domino S.E. Tubb D.J. Garbers D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 345-355Google Scholar). To determine cellular cGMP, transfected cells in one 100-mm dish were split into a 6-well plate. The next day transfected cells were washed with serum-free medium and then incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 10 min at 37 °C. 0.5 n perchloric acid was used to terminate the reaction. Cyclic GMP in the acidified cell extracts was purified by column chromatography and quantitated by radioimmunoassay (18Domino S.E. Tubb D.J. Garbers D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 345-355Google Scholar). Bovine eyes were freshly collected from the local slaughterhouse. All procedures were performed in ambient light and at 4 °C. Ten retinas were dissected and washed twice with cold PBS and homogenized in 25 ml of cold sample buffer containing 25 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20% glycerol. The homogenates were centrifugated for 10 min at 1,000 ×g. The resulting supernatant fluids were centrifugated for 30 min at 20,000 × g to obtain the crude retinal membranes, which were then washed once by the sample buffer. Washed retinal membranes were solubilized by 5 ml of the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. After 30 min on ice, lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 350,000 × g to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant fraction was stored at −20 °C until use. The outer segments were prepared by a modification of the discontinuous sucrose density gradient technique as described (19McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Photoreceptor Cells. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 123-130Google Scholar). Purity of the outer segment membranes was confirmed by the enriched presence of rhodopsin (greater than 90%). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoretic transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with PBS (pH 7.5) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated with anti-GC-E or GC-F antisera at 1:10,000 or 1:5,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. For the control, each antiserum was incubated with 1 mg/ml peptide antigen in PBS (pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C. Following two washes (15 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Tago Inc.) at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h. After washing the membranes, the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) was used for detection. For immunoprecipitation, transfected cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20% glycerol) for 40 min on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 350,000 ×g. 2.5 μl of polyclonal antiserum were added to the clarified lysates. The immunocomplexes were precipitated by adsorption to protein A-agarose (Pierce), washed four times with lysis buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Light-adapted female Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle were sacrificed. The posterior portion of each eye was dissected and immediately placed into a fixative containing 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. The specimens were then rinsed three times (1 h each) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.9% NaCl and incubated in the same rinse solution overnight at 4 °C. The next day the samples were transferred into the same rinse buffer containing 0.1 m glycine. The ultrathin sections were prepared from LR White-embedded tissue and used to perform colloidal gold labeling as described (20Bozzola J.J. Polakoski K. Haas N. Russell L.D. Campbell P. Peterson R.N. Am. J. Anat. 1991; 192: 129-141Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis using RNA (30 μg) isolated from the whole eye, retina, and retina-depleted eye demonstrates that GC-E and GC-F mRNA is enriched in the retina but not detectable in samples from the retina-depleted eye (Fig. 1). Thus, both eye guanylyl cyclase mRNAs are expressed in a retinal-specific manner. Polyclonal antibodies were generated against the COOH-terminal segment of rat GC-E or GC-F (see “Experimental Procedures”). These peptide antigens share sequence similarity among their potential homologs in mouse, human, or bovine (6Shyjan A.W. de Sauvage F.J. Gillett N.A. Goeddel D.V. Lowe D.G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 727-737Google Scholar, 7Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M. Laura R. Lu L. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5535-5539Google Scholar, 8Goraczniak R.M.

Genomics. 1996; 31: 367-372Google Scholar) and yet are unique compared with other guanylyl cyclases. To examine the specificity of antibodies, membrane proteins (10 μg) extracted from the GC-E- or GC-F-transfected COS cells were analyzed for antibody cross-reactivity by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2, the anti-GC-E polyclonal antibody reacts with a single 120-kDa polypeptide in COS cells expressing GC-E. COS cells expressing GC-F or vector alone show no reactivity. Likewise, the anti-GC-F antiserum specifically recognizes a polypeptide with slightly greater mobility (∼116 kDa) in COS cells transfected with the GC-F construct. Again, vector alone or GC-E-transfected cells show no reaction to this antibody. Moreover, these two antisera do not cross-react with other membrane guanylyl cyclases, GC-A, GC-B, GC-C, or GC-D (not shown). With respect to tissue distribution, the corresponding GC-E or GC-F immunoreactive bands were observed in rat retina (Fig.3), but not in other tissues such as brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spleen, or testes (data not shown). This is consistent with the retinal expression of GC-E and GC-F determined by Northern analyses (Fig. 1 and Ref. 5Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 602-606Google Scholar). The immunolabeled bands were not detected when the primary antibodies were preincubated with the individual peptide antigen, which confirms the specificity of these antisera (Fig. 3). There is apparent cross-species reactivity in mouse and bovine retinal membranes, presumably owing to the existence of orthologous GC-E and GC-F proteins in these species (not shown). To examine the partitioning of GC-E and GC-F receptors in the retina, we determined their distribution by Western blot analysis with membranes solubilized from the retina, photoreceptor outer segment, or outer segment-depleted preparations. The immunolabeled bands corresponding to GC-E and GC-F are enhanced in the outer segments where phototransduction occurs (Fig. 4). These data clearly verify that both GC-E and GC-F are predominantly expressed in the photoreceptors but do not exclude much lower expression in areas outside the photoreceptors (Fig. 4). Enrichment of both GC-E and GC-F in the outer segments leads to an important question of whether they are colocalized in the same photoreceptors or not. To determine their subcellular localization at the ultrastructural level, the rat retinas were used for subsequent immunoelectron microscopy studies with specific anti-GC-E and GC-F antisera. A double immunolabeling technique was used in which sections were immunolabeled on one side with 5-nm gold-labeled anti-GC-E antiserum and the other with antiserum against GC-F coupled to 10-nm gold particles (Fig. 5 B). The data clearly showed that both cyclases are located within the same rod cells (Fig.5 B). In addition, the gold particles of either size are primarily distributed over the marginal region of both disk and plasma membranes in the outer segments. Therefore, if GC-E and GC-F are receptors, ligands apparently are present either outside the photoreceptors or in the disk itself. No labeling was seen in the connecting cilium, inner segment, and photoreceptor cell body (not shown). In addition, the immunogold label of GC-E over the outer segments appears to be consistent with a proposed role of RetGC in phototransduction in several species (22Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1345-1352Google Scholar, 23Liu X. Seno K. Nishizawa Y. Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Matsumoto H. Wakabayashi T. Usukura J. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 761-768Google Scholar, 24Cooper N. Liu L. Yoshida A. Pozdnyakov N. Margulis A. Sitaramayya A. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 211-222Google Scholar, 25Hallett M.A. Delaat J.L. Arikawa K. Schlamp C.L. Kong F.S. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1803-1812Google Scholar). Due to the rod-rich rat retina that contains very few cones, we were not able to compare the expression differences between rods and cones. In our experiments, peptide antigens do not completely abolish the immunogold label, which may be due to a higher affinity of the antibody for the true antigens rather than peptide alone. Regardless, the gold labels are considered significant since the anti-GC-E and GC-F antibodies invariably give rise to a stronger immunogold signal compared with a negligible background by the preimmune serum (Fig.5 A). Previous studies have documented that other membrane guanylyl cyclases can assemble into homodimeric or higher ordered homomeric complexes in the absence of ligand (10Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Google Scholar, 11Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Google Scholar). However, soluble cyclases are known to form heterodimers and therefore the existence of GC-E and GC-F within the same photoreceptors raised the important question of whether or not heteromeric forms of the retinal cyclases exist. We constructed cDNAs encoding HA or FLAG epitope-tagged GC-E and GC-F proteins and examined their association by co-immunoprecipitation assays from both singly and co-transfected COS cells. We first examined whether GC-E or GC-F formed homomeric complexes. COS cells were transfected with cDNAs for FLAG-GC-E and/or GC-E tagged with a HA epitope (HA-GC-E). Lysates of these cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, then the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with M2 or the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5, respectively. A 120-kDa immunoreactive band recognized by the anti-HA antibody was observed in the M2 immunoprecipitates from cells coexpressing FLAG-GC-E and HA-GC-E proteins, but not from cells transfected with individual tagged constructs alone (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, the M2 monoclonal antibody immunoprecipitates both FLAG-GC-F and HA-GC-F in cells co-transfected with both epitope-tagged GC-F constructs (Fig.6 B). These results demonstrated that photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases are capable of forming homomeric complexes. Whether heteromeric complexes could form was ascertained by co-transfection of FLAG-GC-E and untagged GC-F constructs in COS cells. Cells were then subjected to assay for complex formation by immunoblotting of anti-FLAG M2 immunoprecipitates with GC-F or GC-E antisera. If a stable interaction is maintained by coexpressing COS cells, it is predicted to co-immunoprecipitate the FLAG-GC-E·GC-F complexes. The anti-FLAG M2 immunoprecipitates from coexpressing cells resulted in a coprecipitation of GC-F, but not from cells expressing either FLAG-GC-E or GC-F alone (Fig. 6 C). Likewise, the reciprocal immunoprecipitation of GC-F results in the coprecipitation of the overexpressed GC-E (not shown). Furthermore, association between the expressed receptors appears to require coexpression and is not an artifact formed only after cell lysis, since a mixture of lysates containing separately expressed proteins is not sufficient for complex formation in heterologous expression systems (not shown). The apparent ability to form heteromers was confirmed by introduction of an alanine (D878A) at the same relative position as Asp-893 of GC-A. The D893A mutation results in an inactive cyclase that forms dimers with wild-type GC-A, thus acting as a dominant negative protein (26Thompson D.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 425-430Google Scholar). No cGMP production could be detected in cells expressing the GC-E D878A construct (Table I). However, coexpression of GC-E D878A and wild-type FLAG-GC-E constructs resulted in a substantial decrease (75%) in guanylyl cyclase activity as well as a 92% decrease in overall cGMP production (Fig. 7 A and TableI). Likewise, coexpression of this mutant with wild-type GC-F also resulted in inhibition of cyclase activity and intact cell cGMP concentrations to 30 and 4% of wild-type controls, respectively (Fig.7 B and Table I). These results are in agreement with the observation that photoreceptor cyclases are capable of forming oligomers in the overexpressing COS cells (Fig. 6). Importantly, the expression of wild-type GC-E and GC-F, as monitored by immunoblots, remained unchanged in the presence of either vector plasmid or the GC-E D878A mutant construct (Fig. 7, A and B).Table IDominant negative effects of the GC-E D878A mutant on cellular cGMP productionPlasmidcGMPInhibitionpmol/well%pCMV5-GC-E + pCMV516.4 ± 1.3pCMV5-GC-F + pCMV524.3 ± 3.2pE-D878A + pCMV5NDaND, not detectable.pCMV5-GC-E + pE-D878A1.3 ± 0.192pCMV5-GC-F + pE-D878A1.0 ± 0.296COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of DNA of each indicated construct as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cGMP concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (mean ± S.D.).a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of DNA of each indicated construct as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cGMP concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (mean ± S.D.). That GC-E and GC-F could form heteromers and homomers in overexpressing cells leads to the question of which forms are normally present in the retina. GC-E or GC-F was immunoprecipitated from the Triton-solubilized retinal membranes with either anti-GC-E or GC-F-specific antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed for the presence of GC-E and GC-F by Western blot analyses. As shown in Fig.8 A, GC-E antibody predominantly immunoprecipitated GC-E, but a signal was only barely detectable with GC-F. Likewise, anti-GC-F antiserum also quantitatively immunoprecipitated GC-F and a limited amount of GC-E. The same patterns of precipitation were also observed in the outer segment membranes (Fig. 8 B). Examination of the unbound supernatant fluids from the immunoprecipitation assay indicates that all photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases were precipitated (Fig.8 B). These results demonstrate that individual photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases preferentially interact to form a homomeric complex in the outer segments; only a small portion of cyclases appear to assemble as heteromers. The molecular size of receptor oligomers was further determined by gel filtration chromatography. The freshly detergent-solubilized retinal cyclase activity was eluted in a relatively broad peak within a range of estimated molecular mass of 240–480 kDa (not shown); a similar elution profile was also reported in other studies (27Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Google Scholar, 28Aparicio J.G. Applebury M.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 501-511Google Scholar). This apparent size is consistent with the oligomeric state of GC-E and GC-F shown by immunoprecipitation assay, suggesting an enzymatic complex of a dimer or higher ordered structure (Fig. 6). Therefore, like other membrane receptor guanylyl cyclases (10Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Google Scholar, 11Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Google Scholar, 12Vaandrager A.B. van der Wiel E. Hom M.L. Luthjens L.H. De Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16409-16415Google Scholar), photoreceptor GC-E and GC-F appear to preexist in an oligomeric state. In summary, we have demonstrated that rat GC-E and GC-F are photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases that can be expressed within the same cells. These two photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases, therefore, appear unique compared with various other components of the phototransduction cascade that are expressed in rod- or cone-specific manners (29Jackson T. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 50: 425-442Google Scholar, 30Lerea C.L. Somers D.E. Hurley J.B. Klock I.B. Bunt-Milam A.H. Science. 1986; 234: 77-80Google Scholar, 31Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K.

Using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting, GC-E and GC-F expressed in COS cells could assemble in homomeric or heteromeric complexes. This is further sustained by a point mutation of D878A GC-E, which exerts a dominant negative effect to block the activity of wild-type GC-E and GC-F in coexpression studies. However, similar experiments with retina and outer segments showed that both cyclases appear to preferably form homomers. We thank Deborah E.

However, many of the functions of Vn are regulated by its conformational state and degree of multimerization.

Vitronectin (Vn), 1The abbreviations used are: Vn, vitronectin; GPIIb/IIIa, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI-1, type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SMB, somatomedin B. an adhesive glycoprotein present in blood and in a variety of tissues, belongs to a group of molecules that contain the RGD cell adhesion sequence and play key roles in the attachment of cells to their surrounding matrix (1Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Google Scholar,2Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1990; 10: 269-305Google Scholar). In addition, Vn has several other functions in the complement, coagulation, and fibrinolytic system. For example, Vn is identical to the S protein of the complement system and thus inhibits complement-mediated cell lysis (3Jenne D. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3153-3157Google Scholar, 4Suzuki S. Oldberg A. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2519-2524Google Scholar). Vn competes with heparin binding to antithrombin III, thereby preventing the rapid inactivation of thrombin and factor Xa by this protease inhibitor (5Lane D.A. Flynn A.M. Pejler G. Lindahl U. Choay J. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15348-16343Google Scholar, 6Preissner K.T. Müller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12247-12253Google Scholar). Vn also binds to and stabilizes the biological activity of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), the physiological inhibitor of both tissue- and urinary-type plasminogen activators (7Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1989; 9: 87-116Google Scholar, 8van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 263-276Google Scholar). Thus, Vn provides unique regulatory links between cell adhesion and proteolytic enzyme cascades, although it is not clear how the multiple functions of Vn are coordinately regulated. Vn is a conformationally labile molecule, and this lability is likely to play a large role in regulating the functions of the protein. This notion is based on the observation that different preparations of Vn exhibit differing abilities to bind to the glycosaminoglycan heparin. Only 2% of the Vn in plasma is capable of binding to heparin-Sepharose, whereas this fraction is increased to 7% by the generation of serum (9Izumi M. Yamada K.M. Hayashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 101-108Google Scholar). In addition, the formation of complexes of Vn with PAI-1 (10Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Google Scholar), thrombin-antithrombin III (11Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 903-912Google Scholar), or complement C5b-C9 (12Hogasen K. Mollnes T.E. Harboe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23076-23082Google Scholar) induces conformational changes in the molecule, which expose the heparin binding domain. Moreover, conformational changes are also induced by denaturation with chaotropic agents, heat-treatment and acidification. These changes are accompanied by the spontaneous formation of disulfide-linked multimers of Vn. Using a panel of conformationally sensitive antibodies, we provided evidence that conformational changes within Vn are not limited to the heparin binding domain, but also occur in the N-terminal half of the molecule, including the N-terminal somatomedin B (SMB) domain (13Seiffert D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 155-159Google Scholar), a site that encompasses the RGD sequence. Understanding the interrelationship between the binding domains of Vn has been complicate, because the exposure and function of these sites depends on the conformational state of this molecule. For example, a number of ligands interact preferentially with the conformationally altered and multimeric (i.e. denatured form) of Vn. These include collagen (14Gebb C. Hayman E.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16698-16703Google Scholar), glycosaminoglycans (15Hayashi M. Akama T. Kono I. Kashiwagi H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1985; 98: 1135-1138Google Scholar, 16Barnes D.W. Reing J.E. Amos B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9117-9122Google Scholar), β-endorphin (17Hildebrand A. Preissner K.T. Müller-Berghaus G. Teschemacher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15429-15434Google Scholar), PAI-1 (18Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar), and urokinase receptor-urokinase complex (19Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar, 20Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Google Scholar). In contrast, thrombin-antithrombin III complexes appear to preferentially interact with native, plasma Vn (21de Boer H.C. Preissner K.T. Bouma B.N. de Groot P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2264-2268Google Scholar). The function of native and denatured Vn in promoting cell adhesion is even more complicated. Native Vn was reported to bind specifically and saturably to glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa on stimulated platelets (22Thiagarajan P. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3035-3038Google Scholar, 23Asch E. Podack E. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1372-1378Google Scholar, 24Mohri H. Ohkubo T. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1991; 96: 605-609Google Scholar). The binding of denatured Vn to platelets are conflicting (25DiFaxio L.T. Stratoulias C. Greco R.S. Haimovich B. J. Surg. Res. 1994; 57: 133-137Google Scholar). In addition, Vn has been reported to both block (26Roger M. Halstensen T.S. Hogasen K. Mollnes T.E. Solum N.O. Hovig T. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1992; 34: 47-54Google Scholar) and stimulate (23Asch E. Podack E. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1372-1378Google Scholar) platelet aggregation. The reasons for these discrepancies remain unclear. Vn is one of many adhesive proteins that bind to cell surface receptors called integrins (27Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 28Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Google Scholar). Each integrin is a noncovalently associated αβ heterodimer that spans the plasma membrane. To date, nine integrin α subunits and 12 β subunits have been identified. Since the ligand binding specificity of each receptor is conferred by its subunit composition, functional diversity within the family of integrins is achieved by heterologous pairing between subunits. Three different integrins have been identified as receptors for Vn, GPIIb/IIIa (also known as αIIβ3 (29Thiagarajan P. Kelly K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 514-517Google Scholar)), αvβ3, expressed by endothelial cells and implicated in angiogenesis (30Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Google Scholar), and αvβ5(31Smith J.W. Vestal D.J. Irwin S.V. Burke T.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11008-11013Google Scholar). Vn contains a single RGD sequence located adjacent to the SMB domain (3Jenne D. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3153-3157Google Scholar, 4Suzuki S. Oldberg A. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2519-2524Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the RGD motif shows that this sequence is required for cell adhesion and can not be compensated for by other parts of the molecule (32Zhao Y. Sane D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 575-582Google Scholar, 33Cherny R.C. Honan M.A. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9725-9729Google Scholar). A number of reports indicated that the cell adhesion domain is exposed on both native and denatured Vn (1Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Google Scholar, 34Eikelenboom P. Zhan S.S. Kamphorst W. van der Valk P. Rosemuller J.M. Virchows Arch. 1994; 424: 421-427Google Scholar). Consequently, the adhesive capacity of the protein is not thought to be regulated by the conformational lability of the molecule. However, this concept is challenged by two observations. First, only denatured Vn induces tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells by binding to the αvβ3integrin on the cell (35Bhattacharya S. Fu C. Bhattacharya J. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16781-16787Google Scholar). Second, αvβ5-dependent endocytosis of Vn by skin fibroblasts was only observed using denatured Vn, the native form of Vn is not internalized (36Panetti T.S. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11988-11993Google Scholar, 37Panetti T.S. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11492-11495Google Scholar). In the present report, we compare the binding of native and denatured Vn to purified GPIIb/IIIa and αvβ3. Evidence is provided that native Vn is incapable of binding to integrin adhesion receptors and that its RGD sequence is not exposed. Conformational changes in Vn, induced by chemical or thermal denaturation, or by complexation with PAI-1, expose the integrin binding site on Vn, allowing it to bind tightly to both αvβ3 and GPIIb/IIIa. Denatured Vn was purified by heparin affinity chromatography in the presence of 8 m urea (38Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Google Scholar). Vn was also isolated under nondenaturing conditions (i.e. native Vn) according to published procedures (39Dahlbaeck B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). The final Vn preparations were devoid of fibrinogen and fibronectin immunoreactivity as judged by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-human fibrinogen or fibronectin (Calbiochem). Denatured Vn was biotinylated using NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). Briefly, 1.5 mg of Vn was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, at 20 μm and incubated with 3 mg of biotinylation reagent dissolved in 100 μl of Me2SO for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). GPIIb/IIIa was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, and αvβ3 was isolated from human placenta extracts by affinity chromatography (40Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2168-2172Google Scholar). Human fibrinogen was obtained from Calbiochem. PAI-1 was purified as described (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar), activated with 4m guanidinium hydrochloride (42Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Google Scholar), dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.345m NaCl, pH 6.5, to stabilize the biological activity of PAI-1 (43Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-222Google Scholar), and the specific activity was determined by titration against urinary-type plasminogen activator (Calbiochem). Prior to each experiment, PAI-1 was dialyzed into ice-cold PBS. Latent PAI-1 was prepared by incubation of activated PAI-1 at 37 °C for 24 h. After this incubation step, the structural integrity of the resulting PAI-1 preparation was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with silver nitrate. The remaining PAI-1 activity after this incubation was determined by binding to immobilized tissue-type plasminogen activator (Calbiochem) (44Schleef R.R. Sinha M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1985; 106: 408-415Google Scholar) and was less than 0.5% of the starting material (not shown). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 611, 153, and 1244 were obtained by standard hybridoma techniques using denatured Vn as immunogen (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar). IgG was produced in mice as ascites fluid and purified by using protein A-Sepharose. The generation of rabbit anti-human Vn was described previously (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled secondary antibodies, streptavidin alkaline phosphatase, and substrate were from Zymed. Conformational changes in the Vn molecule were quantified by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (13Seiffert D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 155-159Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with denatured Vn (1 μg/ml in PBS, 4 °C, 16 h), and nonspecific binding sites on the plastic dishes were blocked by incubating the washed wells for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 3% casein and 0.05% Tween 20. The wells were co-incubated for 1 h with a constant amount of IgG (50 ng/ml final concentration) and the indicated concentration of Vn in PBS containing 0.1% casein and 0.1% Tween 20. Bound IgG was detected with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by streptavidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate and the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Zymed). The change of absorbance at 405 nm of duplicate wells was determined and the absorbance of wells not incubated with antibodies but otherwise treated identically was subtracted. The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT 1080 was obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described (45Seiffert D. Curriden S.A. Jenne D. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5474-5480Google Scholar). Semiconfluent cultures were labeled for 16 h with [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp; 100 μCi/ml in 80% methionine-deficient medium, 20% complete growth medium). After washing with PBS, the cells were detached by treatment with PBS containing 0.2 mm EDTA for 5 min and washed three times in adhesion buffer (1 × Hanks' balanced salt solution, 50 mm Hepes, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, pH 7.4) and resuspended at 2 × 105cells/ml in adhesion buffer. Flat-bottomed microtiter wells were coated with 100 ng/well denatured Vn. Following an 18-h coating period at 4 °C, the plates were blocked with PBS containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Antibodies (50 μl) were prebound to the wells at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells (1 × 104) were added to the antibody containing wells in triplicate and allow to adhere for 1 h. The wells were washed gentle three times in PBS to remove nonadherent cells, and the bound cells were solubilized in 1% SDS and quantified by β-counting. The radioactivity associated with bovine serum albumin coated wells was subtracted from that of the Vn-coated wells. Results are expressed as percentage cell binding in the absence of antibodies. The binding of purified Vn preparations to immobilized integrins was analyzed with the methods essential as described previously (46Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Google Scholar). Briefly, integrins were immobilized at 50 ng/well (αvβ3) or 250 ng/well (GPIIb/IIIa) for 18 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, nonspecific protein binding sites on the plates were blocked with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2 (binding buffer), and 35 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After washing with binding buffer, unlabeled Vn was added for 1 h at 37 °C in binding buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Bound Vn was detected using rabbit anti-human Vn IgG (10 μg/ml), followed by biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, streptavidin alkaline phosphatase, and substrate. The change of absorbance (405 nm) of duplicate wells was determined. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the binding to wells incubated with the same concentration of Vn in the presence of 10 mm EDTA. For competitive ligand binding studies, biotin-labeled denatured Vn (1 μg/ml; a concentration required to obtain half- maximal binding) was co-incubated (3 h, 37 °C) with unlabeled native Vn, denatured Vn, or fibrinogen on integrin-coated plates (see above). After washing, bound Vn was detected using streptavidin alkaline phosphatase and substrate. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the binding of biotin-labeled wells incubated in the presence of 10 mmEDTA from that incubated in the presence of divalent cations. Results are expressed as percentage binding in the absence of soluble competitor. The effects of three different anti-Vn mAbs on cell adhesion to immobilized Vn were determined (Fig. 1 A). Microtiter wells were coated with denatured Vn and incubated with the indicated concentration of antibody and metabolically labeled HT 1080 cells. Cells were allowed to attach for 1 h. Bound cells were quantified by β-counting. mAb 153 and 611 inhibited cell adhesion to Vn in a dose-dependent manner, whereas mAb 1244 was significantly (approximately 20-fold) less effective. The observed difference was apparently not due to a lower affinity of mAb 1244 for denatured Vn, since this antibody and clone 153 differ in the affinity for denatured Vn only by factor 2 (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar). In contrast, no inhibition was observed using normal mouse IgG (data not shown). The mAbs 153 and 611 bind to Vn polypeptides encompassing amino acids 1–51, a fragment of Vn containing the RGD sequence, whereas the control antibody interacts with amino acids 52–239 (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar) (data not shown). We previously provided evidence that an immunoepitope (mAb 153) located in the SMB domain of Vn (amino acids 1–51) is cryptic in plasma Vn (13Seiffert D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 155-159Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to understand whether lack of reactivity with native plasma Vn is a general feature of antibodies derived to this region of the Vn molecule. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed to determine the reactivity of mAB 611 with purified preparations of native and denatured Vn and Vn present in unfractionated plasma (Fig. 1 B). Results were compared with mAb 153. Microtiter wells coated with denatured Vn were incubated with a constant amount of anti-Vn IgG and increasing concentrations of different types of Vn (Fig. 1 B). Denatured Vn competes with the binding of both antibodies to immobilized denatured Vn in a dose-dependent manner, whereas neither antibody reacted well with Vn present in unfractionated plasma. The reactivity with purified native Vn with these two conformationally sensitive antibodies was at least 50-fold lower than that of denatured Vn. Based on the strong reactivity of the inhibitory antibodies with denatured Vn, and the inability of these antibodies to bind native Vn, we hypothesized that the RGD sequence in native Vn is cryptic. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the binding of native and denatured Vn to purified integrins (Figs. 2 and 3). To measure binding, microtiter wells were coated with purified integrin and then incubated with a range of either native or denatured Vn. Bound Vn was detected with an polyclonal antibody against Vn. Denatured Vn bound to GPIIb/IIIa in a dose-dependent manner and approached saturation at 5 μg/ml. Specific binding did not further increase using 10 μg/ml denatured Vn. In the concentration range presented in Fig. 2 A, specific binding was more than 85% of total binding. In contrast, little binding of native Vn was observed under the same conditions.Figure 3Binding of native and denatured Vn to αvβ3. A, direct binding of Vn to αv β3. Microtiter wells were coated with purified αvβ3 and incubated with the indicated concentration of either denatured (closed circles) or native (open circles) Vn. Bound Vn was detected with rabbit anti-human Vn, followed by biotin anti-rabbit IgG, streptavidin alkaline phosphatase, and substrate. Results are expressed as mOD/min (change of absorbance at 405 nm).B, competition of Vn for binding of biotin-labeled Vn to αvβ3. A constant concentration of biotin-labeled denatured Vn was incubated on αvβ3 coated microtiter wells in the presence of the indicated concentration of native (open circles), denatured (closed circles) Vn, or fibrinogen (closed squares). Bound labeled Vn was detected using streptavidin alkaline phosphatase and substrate. Results are expressed as percentage binding in the absence of unlabeled competitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To exclude the possibility that the lack of binding of native Vn to GPIIb/IIIa was due to reduced reactivity of the rabbit anti-Vn IgG with native Vn, competitive binding assays were employed to confirm the results of the direct binding studies (Fig. 2 B). In this assay, immobilized GPIIb/IIIa was co-incubated with a constant amount of biotinylated denatured Vn and a range of competing native or denatured Vn. Fibrinogen was also used as a competitor, because it is the physiological ligand for GPIIb/IIIa. Fibrinogen was 10–50-fold more efficient in competing with the binding of labeled Vn for GPIIb/IIIa than denatured Vn. More importantly, no competition was observed using native Vn, confirming the inability of the native form of Vn to bind to GPIIb/IIIa. GPIIb/IIIa is only one of several integrins that are reported to bind Vn. The αvβ3 integrin is also considered a receptor for Vn and was originally named the “vitronectin receptor.” To determine whether the αvβ3integrin also exhibited preferential binding to the denatured form of Vn, similar binding studies were performed using immobilized αvβ3 (Fig. 3 A). Denatured Vn bound to αvβ3 in a dose-dependent manner and again approached saturation at 5 μg/ml Vn. In contrast, native Vn showed little binding. Again, results were confirmed in competitive binding studies and compared with fibrinogen. Native Vn failed to compete with the binding of denatured Vn for binding to αvβ3. Both denatured Vn and fibrinogen competed for the binding of biotinylated Vn to αvβ3. Little difference was observed in the extent of competition between the latter two ligands. Only about 7% of the total Vn present in plasma is recovered using a purification procedure that maintains the protein in its native conformation (39Dahlbaeck B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that a nonintegrin-binding subpopulation of native Vn could have been purified and employed in the binding studies. To address this issue, a heat denaturation procedure was employed to convert native Vn into conformationally altered, multimeric Vn (Fig.4). Heat treatment of native Vn resulted in the exposure of the mAb 611 epitope (Fig. 4 A) and mAb 153 epitope (not shown) to a similar extent as in denatured Vn. In addition, the electrophoretic mobility of heat-treated native Vn on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was indistinguishable from denatured Vn (i.e. heat treatment resulted in the formation of high molecular weight multimers that failed to enter the separating gel) (not shown). The interaction of heat-treated native Vn with αvβ3 was compared with that of purified denatured Vn (Fig. 4 B). Heat-treated Vn binds to immobilized αvβ3 in a dose-dependent manner similar to denatured Vn (Fig. 4 B). In addition, heat-treated native Vn competes with labeled denatured Vn for binding to this integrin to an extent comparable with that of denatured Vn (Fig.4 C). Similar results were obtained when binding to GPIIb/IIIa was examined (not shown). In addition, an alternative denaturation procedure (i.e. treatment of native Vn with 8m urea) also induced integrin binding (not shown). These observations indicate that denaturation of native Vn results in the exposure of the cryptic cell binding domain and that the inability of native Vn to bind to αvβ3 or GPIIb/IIIa was not due to the purification of a nonintegrin-binding subpopulation of Vn from plasma. Vn binds to a number of plasma proteins, and these interactions alter the conformation of this molecule (10Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Google Scholar, 11Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 903-912Google Scholar, 12Hogasen K. Mollnes T.E. Harboe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23076-23082Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to test whether physiological ligands of native Vn can induce the exposure of the cell adhesion domain. The binding of native Vn to active PAI-1 results in the formation of Vn multimers that express epitopes for conformationally sensitive antibodies like mAbs 153 (10Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Google Scholar) and 611 (data not shown). Interestingly, PAI-1·Vn complexes are relatively labile and PAI-1 readily dissociates from Vn, but Vn remains multimeric and conformationally altered (10Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Google Scholar). We reasoned that the binding of PAI-1 to native Vn is likely to expose the integrin binding site on Vn. Native Vn was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of active PAI-1 for 16 h at 37 °C. After this incubation period, more than 99% of the PAI-1 was converted into the latent conformation as based by binding to immobilized tissue-type plasminogen activator (not shown). Little competition of native Vn (Fig. 5 A, left closed bar) for mAB 153 binding to immobilized denatured Vn was observed. Incubation of native Vn with active PAI-1 (Fig. 5 A, left open bar) resulted in the exposure of the conformationally sensitive mAb 153 epitope. In contrast, no effects of latent PAI-1 on the exposure of this epitope was observed (Fig. 5 A, left hatched bar). The mAb 153 does not detect Vn in complex with PAI-1 (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar), confirming that the majority of the Vn was present in an uncomplexed, conformationally altered form. In parallel experiments, the effects of pretreatment of native Vn with PAI-1 on its ability to bind to αvβ3 (Fig. 5 A, right bars) was analyzed. Again, while little binding of native Vn (Fig. 5 A, right closed bar) to αvβ3 was observed, PAI-1 induced Vn multimers (A, right open bar) demonstrated increased binding to αvβ3. In contrast, latent PAI-1 (Fig. 5 A, right hatched bar) had failed to induce αvβ3 binding of native Vn. The PAI-1 and integrin binding sites in denatured Vn are structurally distinct but located in close proximity, raising the possibility that PAI-1 may modulate the adhesive functions of denatured Vn. To test this hypothesis, microtiter wells were co-incubated with a constant amount of denatured Vn (which binds to αvβ3) and increasing concentrations of either active or latent PAI-1 in this binding assay (Fig. 5 B). Active PAI-1 blocked the binding of denatured Vn to immobilized αvβ3 in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest concentration of PAI-1, approximately 80% inhibition was observed. The competition reached a plateau at a 10-fold molar excess of active PAI-1 over denatured Vn. In contrast, latent PAI-1 has little effect on the binding of Vn to αvβ3. These findings are consistent with the observation that latent PAI-1 lacks high-affinity binding to denatured Vn (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar). However, when Vn·αvβ3 were preformed on microtiter wells, active PAI-1 failed to dissociated these complexes (data not shown). The observations in this report demonstrate that native Vn, present in blood, is not an adhesive glycoprotein. This conclusion is based on the findings that antibodies against Vn that block its adhesive function fail to bind to the native form of Vn. These blocking antibodies are capable of binding to denatured Vn or PAI-1-induced Vn multimers. In addition, direct binding studies prove that denatured Vn binds to both GPIIb/IIIa and αvβ3, but that native Vn is unable to bind to these integrins. Moreover, native Vn, which is not adhesive, could be converted into an adhesive glycoprotein by chemical and thermal denaturation. It should be noted that at high concentration, binding of native Vn to integrins was observed. This finding is probably related to the presence of some denatured Vn in the native Vn preparation. This conclusion is supported by the observation that unfractionated plasma was unreactive with conformationally sensitive antibodies, whereas the native Vn employed in this study showed exposure, although limited in comparison with denatured Vn, of conformationally sensitive epitopes. Based on the observations presented here, the majority of Vn present in vivo(i.e. in plasma) is not expected to bind to integrins. A number of consideration suggest that the adhesive functions of Vn are mediated through the N-terminal SMB domain rather then the C-terminal glycosaminoglycan binding domain. First, site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the RGD motif located between amino acids 45 and 47 is required for cell adhesion to Vn (32Zhao Y. Sane D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 575-582Google Scholar, 33Cherny R.C. Honan M.A. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9725-9729Google Scholar). Second, heparin does not effect the adhesion of HT 1080 or a number of other cell lines to immobilized Vn. 2D. Seiffert and J. W. Smith, unpublished observation. Similarly, heparin was without effect in the purified receptor binding assay. Third, recent studies from our laboratory indicate that native Vn binds heparin, implying that the glycosaminoglycan binding domain is exposed in the native conformation. 3D. Seiffert, unpublished observation. Interestingly, PAI-1 can have opposing effects on the adhesive properties of Vn. First, active PAI-1 blocked the binding of denatured Vn to αvβ3 in a dose-dependent manner. The binding site for active PAI-1 has been localized to amino acids 1 to 40 (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar), a region in close proximity to the RGD sequence at residues 45–47 of Vn (3Jenne D. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3153-3157Google Scholar, 4Suzuki S. Oldberg A. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2519-2524Google Scholar). RGD-containing peptide has no effect on the binding of PAI-1 to Vn (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar), suggesting that PAI-1 is not binding directly to the cell adhesion domain in Vn. The close proximity of both sides makes it likely that the competition of PAI-1 is due to steric hinderance. In contrast, latent PAI-1, which does not bind to the N-terminal high affinity PAI-1 binding site in Vn (41Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar), failed to compete with integrin binding of Vn. In addition, PAI-1 failed to dissociate pre-existing Vn·αvβ3complexes. Thus, PAI-1 is not expected to detach anchored cells, but may modulate biological processes dependent on de novoformation of adhesive contacts between Vn and αvβ3, including cell migration. These observations have been confirmed in a recent publication (47Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Google Scholar). Second, active PAI-1 had an additional affect on Vn binding to integrins. PAI-1 induced the formation of conformationally altered Vn multimers, and these multimers present, after dissociation from PAI-1, an exposed cell adhesion domain. The Vn concentration in plasma is between 2.5 and 5 μm (1Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Google Scholar, 2Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1990; 10: 269-305Google Scholar), whereas normal PAI-1 levels are approximately 0.4 nm (48Loskutoff D.J. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 5: 197-206Google Scholar). Plasma levels of PAI-1 are regulated under pathophysiological conditions, and for example endotoxinemia results in a dramatic up-regulation of plasma PAI-1 levels to 20 nm (48Loskutoff D.J. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 5: 197-206Google Scholar). However, these concentrations are still 100-fold lower than that of Vn. Using this ratio of PAI-1 and Vn, we were unable to detect PAI-1 induced Vn multimers (10Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Google Scholar). Thus, PAI-1 induced Vn multimerization in plasma is expected to have little affects on the adhesive properties of Vn. The scenario may be quite different in tissues and in platelets. PAI-1 and Vn are both contained within platelet α-granules (49Preissner K.T. Holzhueter S. Justus C. Mueller-Berghaus G. Blood. 1989; 74: 1989-1996Google Scholar, 50Seiffert D. Schleef R.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 552-560Google Scholar), and platelets contain 26 nmVn and 12 nm PAI-1 per 109 platelets (49Preissner K.T. Holzhueter S. Justus C. Mueller-Berghaus G. Blood. 1989; 74: 1989-1996Google Scholar, 51Booth N.A. Robbie L.A. Croll A.M. Bennett B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 667: 70-80Google Scholar,52Kruithof E.K.O. Nicolosa G. Bachmann F. Blood. 1987; 70: 1645-1653Google Scholar). Interestingly, platelet Vn is present in high molecular weight multimers that express the mAB 153 epitope (50Seiffert D. Schleef R.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 552-560Google Scholar). It should be noted that the expression of the cryptic mAB 153 epitope appears to correlate with the adhesive properties of Vn. These observation suggest that platelet Vn is adhesion competent. Platelet-derived proteins concentrate up to 200-fold in areas of thrombosis, suggesting that platelet-derived adhesion competent Vn will accumulate in areas of tissue injury and thrombosis. Similarly, increased tissue-associated levels of PAI-1 have been reported in a number of pathophysiological conditions, including endotoxinemia (48Loskutoff D.J. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 5: 197-206Google Scholar), raising the possibility that PAI-1 will regulate the adhesive properties of Vn in inflamed tissues. Taken together, these observation support the concept that plasma Vn is in a latent form. Interactions with either free proteases inhibitors or inhibitors in complex with the respective target protease results in the exposure of the cryptic RGD motif."

Thus, the pattern of expression for ppGaNTase-T4 is more restricted than for the three previously reported isoforms of the enzyme. The variation in expression patterns and substrate specificities of the ppGaNTase enzyme family suggests that differential expression of these isoenzymes may be responsible for the cell-specific repertoire of mucin-type oligosaccharides on cell-surface and secretedO-linked glycoproteins.

The acquisition of carbohydrate side chains inO-glycosidic linkage to either Thr or Ser has a profound structural impact on a polypeptide backbone and thus underlies the unique physicochemical properties of heavily O-glycosylated proteins such as mucin glycoproteins (1Tabak L.A.

The first committed step ofO-glycosylation is initiated through the action of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.41) (ppGaNTase). 1The abbreviations used are: ppGaNTase, UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reactions; aa, amino acid; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). 1The abbreviations used are: ppGaNTase, UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reactions; aa, amino acid; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). Thus far, three isoforms of this enzyme have been cloned and expressed, ppGaNTase-T1 (5Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Google Scholar, 6Homa F.L. Hollander T. Lehman D.J. Thomsen D.R. Elhammer A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12609-12616Google Scholar), -T2 (7Sørensen T. White T. Wandall H.H. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24166-24173Google Scholar), and -T3 (8Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Google Scholar, 9Zara J. Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 38-44Google Scholar). The three isoforms differ with regard to their patterns of tissue expression and appear to have both overlapping as well as unique substrate preferences. Thus, to fully understand howO-glycosylation of specific peptide sequences is initiated and how the process is regulated in a given tissue or cell type, the repertoire of ppGaNTases in that cell background will have to be defined. In the present study, we have used degenerate primers derived from conserved sequences within a region spanning 420-aa residues to amplify putative ppGaNTases from RNA samples. Subcloned PCR products were then secondarily screened by plaque hybridization and subjected to sequence analysis. The method was validated by the successful isolation of products corresponding to ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, and -T3 isoforms from murine RNA samples. In addition, the approach led to the detection of a cDNA that appeared to encode a novel form of ppGaNTase. When a truncated version of this cDNA was expressed as a secreted product in COS7 cells, ppGaNTase activity was recovered. However, the peptide substrate specificity of this enzyme appeared to be more selective than ppGaNTase-T1. Further, this isoform displayed a pattern of transcript expression that is more restricted than ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, or -T3 transcripts. Collectively, these data indicated that we have identified a fourth distinct isoform of the ppGaNTase family. ppGaNTase family members from mouse and/or human ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, -T3 and Caenorhabditis elegans clones that encode putative ppGaNTase-TA, -TB, and -TC (ZK688.8, yk2F11, and yk3G10, respectively) 2F. K. Hagen, unpublished observations. were aligned, and all were found to contain the translated amino acid sequence AGGLF (Fig. 1) and CH(G/N)XGGNQ (Fig. 1), an average of 180-aa apart. A pool of sense and antisense strand degenerate PCR primers were reverse-translated from the consensus aa sequence AGGLF and CH(G/N)XGGNQ, respectively. Sense primers (primer 1, Fig. 1 A) were d(CNCCNAYNNWKGCNGGWGICTITT) and d(WGCNGGWGGNCTCTT) and antisense primers (primer 2, Fig.1 A) were d(TGRTTNCCHCCIIIRTTRTGRCA), d(TGRTTNCCNCCNNNNCCRTGRCA), and d(TGRTTNCCNCCIIIICCRTGRCA). Reverse transcriptase-PCR of spleen total RNA yielded the expected 540-bp PCR product (using the identical protocol as described in Hagen et al. (5Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Google Scholar)). The complete PCR sample was cloned into a M13 cloning vehicle and screened for putative ppGaNTase fragments using plaque hybridization and a panel of oligonucleotides, d(GARATHTGGGGNGGNGARAA) (primer 3, Fig. 1 A), d(GTNGGNCAYGTNTTYMG) (primer 4, Fig. 1 A), d(TTRTAYTCRTCCATCCANAC) (primer 5, Fig. 1 A), and d(GGRTADATRTTYTCNARRTACCA) (primer 6, Fig. 1 A), which corresponded to the conserved aa residues IWGGEN, CSXVGHVFR, EVWMDE, and WYLEN, respectively. Positive M13 clones were sequenced with infrared fluorescent dye-labeled primers on a LiCOR DNA 4000L DNA sequencer. The insert was used to screen a random and oligo(dT)-primed λ ZapII, mouse spleen cDNA library (Stratagene). Three positive clones were sequenced on both strands (Fig. 2).

This PCR fragment was fully sequenced (found to be identical to ppGaNTase-T4 except for the presence of the MluI site) and reinserted into the full-length cDNA construct. AMluI-NheI digest released a 1.6-kb fragment that contained the coding region of the truncated ppGaNTase-T4 isozyme and 5 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated region. ThisMluI-NheI fragment was cloned into theMluI-BamHI sites of a SV40 promoter-driven mammalian expression vector, pIMKF1, containing an insulin secretion signal (I) to direct the secretion of the recombinant ppGaNTase-T4 enzyme into the cell culture medium (5Hagen F.K.

Mock transfections with pSVL-β-galactosidase and a positive control, pF1-mT1, which expresses mouse ppGaNTase-T1 (9Zara J. Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 38-44Google Scholar), were performed in parallel. To assess transfection efficiency, two independent constructs of pF1-mT4 were used to transfect COS7 cells. There was ≤16% variation observed well to well among the independent transfections (n = 4) with pF1-mT4. The expression vector, COS7 cell transfections, and kinetic assays were performed as reported previously (10Wragg S. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16947-16954Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of supercoiled DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to transfect 35-mm wells of COS7 cells at 85–90% confluency as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were grown at 30 °C in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after transfection. After 3 days the enzyme activity was measured in clarified (centrifuged 100 ×g for 10 min) cell culture medium, using 5 μl of medium and the following assay conditions: a final volume of 25 μl containing a final concentration of 500 μm peptide EA2, PTTDSTTPAPTTK (which corresponds to the tandem repeat sequence of rat submandibular gland apomucin (11Albone E.F. Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16845-16852Google Scholar)), 50 μm total UDP-GalNAc containing UDP-[14C]GalNAc (25,000 cpm), 10 mm MnCl2, 40 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. All assays were performed in duplicate as indicated in the figures at 37 °C. One unit of activity was defined as the transfer of 100 pmol of GalNAc to the EA2 peptide/h under these assay conditions. To compare the substrate preferences of the ppGaNTase-T4 and ppGaNTase-T1 isoforms, a panel of peptide substrates was screened using anti-FLAGTM affinity-purified recombinant ppGaNTase-T4 and -T1 enzymes. Briefly, clarified cell culture medium (1.5 ml) from COS7 cells transfected with either pF1-mT1 or pF1-mT4 was incubated with anti-FLAGTM M2 affinity gel (150 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry) (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Bound materials were eluted with 4 mm FLAGTMpeptide dissolved in 75 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5. Peptide substrates included EA2, Muc 1a-APPAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGC, and Muc 1b-PDTRPAPGSTAPPAC (12Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.-N.

Atkinson J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 431-455Google Scholar) derived from human testis membrane cofactor protein. Assays were conducted in duplicate using enzymes derived from the same transfection. To verify that ppGaNTase-T1 and ppGaNTase-T4 have different substrate specificities and that the recombinant preparations do not contain differing levels of transferase inhibitors, mixing experiments were performed in which the level of sugar transfer by each isoform was compared with that obtained when the two isoforms were mixed together. Following electrophoresis, mouse total RNA samples were transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Corp.). A 117-bp segment of the ppGaNTase-T4 cDNA region (nucleotide position 562–679, Fig. 2) was labeled by asymmetric PCR (18Bednarczuk T.A. Wiggins R.C. Konat G.W. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 478-479Google Scholar) using the antisense oligonucleotide d(CCAGGAAAGTGAGGACA) and then used as a probe for the ppGaNTase-T4 transcript. ppGaNTAse-T1 message was detected by the same method using cDNA sequences encoding aa positions 515–559 of the ppGaNTase-T1 cDNA and oligonucleotide d(AAGAAAGGATTGACTGGGCTAC). Antisense 18 S ribosomal subunit oligonucleotide d(TATTGGAGCTGGAATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG) was end-labeled (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used to normalize sample loading by hybridizing with a 5-molar excess of probe. All hybridizations were performed in 5× SSPE/50% formamide at 42 °C with two final washes in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min. Primary sequence alignments of three different isoforms of the ppGaNTase family from different mammals and putative transferases from C. elegansdemonstrated that the size of the conserved region of this enzyme is approximately 420 amino acids in length (consensus aa 151–570, Fig.3). This 420-aa region consists of 13 segments of 7–12 amino acids that are highly conserved (>70% similarity) among 3 mammalian forms and 3 homologues found in C. elegans (Fig.1 A). Two such short blocks of nearly invariant sequences, AGGLF at consensus aa 367 (Fig. 3) and CH(G/N)XGGNQ at consensus aa 543 (Fig. 3), were used to design degenerate PCR primers (Fig. 1, primers 1 and2). Reverse transcriptase-PCR of 14 different RNA sources produced 540-bp PCR products in all samples tested (data not shown). We continued the analysis of the PCR products from spleen samples because in prior work we had demonstrated that the spleen expresses a low level of ppGaNTase-T1 transcript but expresses high levels of ppGaNTase enzyme activity (20Hagen F.K. Gregoire C.A. Tabak L.A. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 901-909Google Scholar). PCR products were then subcloned to create a library in M13; the resultant clones were re-screened with internal nested primers (Fig. 1 A, primers 3, 4,5, and 6) to eliminate false positive clones. Based on DNA sequencing results, the degenerate PCR primers and oligonucleotide probes were successful in identifying all known ppGaNTase isoforms (ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, and -T3) from a variety of tissue sources (data not shown), thus validating the approach. In addition, a PCR fragment lacking nucleic acid sequence identity with ppGaNTase-T1, T2, or -T3 was detected among the amplified fragments derived from spleen RNA. This fragment was used to probe a mouse spleen cDNA library (1 × 106 plaques). Of the 34 positive clones obtained, one contained a 1734-bp open reading frame encoding a 578-amino acid protein (Fig. 2). Conceptual translation of the ppGaNTase-T4 message revealed a protein with a type II membrane protein architecture, typical of the ppGaNTase family. An N-terminal 12-aa cytoplasmic segment preceded a 22-aa hydrophobic transmembrane domain, which was followed by a 544-amino acid C-terminal luminal domain. Potential N-glycosylation sites are found at Asn466 and Asn471. Sequence analysis using the Clustal Method produced alignments demonstrating that this protein is distinct from the ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, and -T3 isozymes yet shares a sequence similarity between consensus aa positions 150 and 570 (Fig.3). BestFit analysis reveals that the overall amino acid sequence similarity of this 420-aa region is 69, 67, and 68% when mouse ppGaNTase-T4 is compared with mouse-ppGaNTase-T1, human ppGaNTase-T2, and mouse ppGaNTase-T3, respectively. The 100-amino acid segment from consensus positions 358 to 457 is highly conserved as is a span of 26 aa beginning at consensus position 185 (Fig. 3). A search of the combined GenBankTM/NCBI data bases did not reveal any genes or expressed sequence tags that were identical to ppGaNTase-T4. A truncated coding region of the putative transferase beginning with the first alanine (Ala34) codon following the N-terminal transmembrane domain was cloned downstream of a FLAGTM epitope tag and insulin secretion signal creating the vector pF1-mT4 (Fig. 4). The expressed product was secreted into the culture medium of the transfected COS7 cells and shown to be active. A low background of activity equal to 1% of the wild-type ppGaNTase-T1 activity was detected in the culture medium of mock-transfected cells. Following enrichment of each recombinant enzyme by immunoadsorption on anti-FLAGTM affinity matrix, similar units of ppGaNTase-T1 and ppGaNTase-T4 enzyme activity were compared using the EA2 peptide to normalize the amount of enzymatic activity used. Recombinant ppGaNTase-T1 glycosylated 6 peptides from a diverse set of 11 substrates, whereas ppGaNTase-T4 displayed a marked preference for EA2, a peptide derived from the tandem repeat sequence of rat submandibular gland mucin (Fig. 5). ppGaNTase-T4 showed limited activity (≤252 cpm/h) on five additional substrates. To demonstrate that ppGaNTase-T1 and ppGaNTase-T4 have different substrate specificities and to rule out the possibility that the results obtained are not due to the presence of specific inhibitors of transferase activity in each enzyme preparation, we performed a mixing experiment under conditions where each reaction was linear (data not shown). As summarized in Table I, the activity of the two isoforms is additive (within a 10% error margin). The calculated sum of ppGaNTase-T1 and -T4 activities per μl of enzyme preparation yielded the same activity as in assays in which both isoforms were added simultaneously.Table IThe activities of ppGaNTase-T1 and -T4 are additiveEnzyme(s)[14C]GalNAc incorporation into peptidesEA2EPO-T(cpm/h)ppGaNTase-T11-aRate of [14C]GalNAc incorporation in cpm/h is expressed for 1 μl of each enzyme using 500 μmeither EA2 or EPO-T peptide.2373 ± 2839 ± 58ppGaNTase-T41-aRate of [14C]GalNAc incorporation in cpm/h is expressed for 1 μl of each enzyme using 500 μmeither EA2 or EPO-T peptide.1688 ± 133157 ± 10Expected sum of ppGaNTase-T1 and T41-bExpected sum of ppGaNTase-T1 and T4 was calculated by adding the rate of glycosylation for 1 μl of each enzyme preparation (T1 + T4).4061996Observed value for mixing ppGaNTase-T1 and T41-cObserved value is obtained by performing a standard enzyme assay of a mixture containing 1 μl of ppGaNTase-T1 and 1 μl of ppGaNTase-T4.4023 ± 371107 ± 151-a Rate of [14C]GalNAc incorporation in cpm/h is expressed for 1 μl of each enzyme using 500 μmeither EA2 or EPO-T peptide.1-b Expected sum of ppGaNTase-T1 and T4 was calculated by adding the rate of glycosylation for 1 μl of each enzyme preparation (T1 + T4).1-c Observed value is obtained by performing a standard enzyme assay of a mixture containing 1 μl of ppGaNTase-T1 and 1 μl of ppGaNTase-T4. Open table in a new tab The size and tissue distribution of the murine ppGaNTase-T4 and -T1 messages clearly differ (Fig.6). The predominant ppGaNTase-T4 transcript was 5.5 kb; minor levels of message were 2.8 and 1.7 kb in length. The most abundant ppGaNTase-T4 signal was observed in the mouse sublingual gland, stomach, colon, small intestine, and cervix. Intermediate levels of message were seen in kidney, ovary, lung, and uterus. Low levels of transcript were observed in the spleen sample with trace amounts detected in liver, heart, and brain. No signal was detected from submandibular and parotid glands, skeletal muscle, and testis. In contrast, the ppGaNTase-T1 message is expressed as a doublet at 3.6 and 4.2 kb at varying levels in all the tissues surveyed. To help define the repertoire of ppGaNTases in a tissue, we have devised a PCR-based strategy that employs a series of oligonucleotides derived from conserved sequences found within a 420-aa region of the ppGaNTase family of enzymes. PCR products could be amplified with one set of oligonucleotide primers, cloned into an M13 vehicle, and then screened using a second set of degenerate oligonucleotides that are nested within the original primers. This strategy yields an M13 library of the PCR products and a means to discriminate among clones encoding different ppGaNTase isoforms and false PCR products. In contrast to the approach of Bennett et al. (8Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Google Scholar), we avoided using restriction enzyme cleavage patterns as a means to identify novel isoforms, because some restriction recognition sequences were conserved among different isoforms whereas other sites were not present in all mammalian species. Using this approach we were able to identify products corresponding to the previously identified ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, and -T3 as well as ppGaNTase-T4 described herein. A search of the GenBankTM/NCBI data base failed to identify any identical matches, indicating that this isoform is novel. We have also identified transcripts that encode additional putative transferases, which are expressed in the rat sublingual gland.2 We are currently determining if these species code for active enzyme. All four members of the ppGaNTase family share a type II membrane architecture, consisting of a short (4–19 aa) N-terminal cytoplasmic segment, a 19–24-aa transmembrane domain, a variable length stem region, and a luminal catalytic domain that is represented by most of the coding region on the C terminus. While there is no obvious primary aa sequence similarity in the N-terminal transmembrane and stem region of the enzymes, the sequence of the Golgi luminal domain is highly conserved within a block of approximately 420 aa (consensus aa 151–570, Fig. 3). This region is noticeably larger than the putative 61-aa “GalNAc-T Motif” previously reported by Bennett et al. (8Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Google Scholar). The sequence divergence within this large 420-aa region among the known isoforms of ppGaNTases is not sufficiently high to simply identify potential aa residues that may be involved in substrate binding or catalysis. When partially purified recombinant ppGaNTase-T1 and -T4 were compared for their ability to incorporate GalNAc into a panel of peptide substrates, we determined that only EA2 (PTTDSTTPAPTTK) was a good acceptor for ppGaNTase-T4. Thus, ppGaNTase-T4 transferred GalNAc to EA2 at a rate approximately 12 times greater than that observed for the single site substrate EPO-T. This is in contrast to ppGaNTase-T1, which transfers GalNAc to EA2 at only a 2-fold higher rate than EPO-T (Fig.5). To verify that ppGaNTase-T1 and -T4 have different substrate specificities, we took advantage of the apparent substrate preferences for EA2 and EPO-T and performed mixing experiments under conditions in which each reaction was linear. The activity of the transferases in a mixture was shown to be additive. This result eliminates the possibility that inhibitors from each enzyme preparation account for the differences in substrate specificity observed. The patterns of transcript expression of the known forms of ppGaNTase differ. Based upon our work (Refs. 9Zara J. Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 38-44Google Scholar and 20Hagen F.K. Gregoire C.A. Tabak L.A. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 901-909Google Scholar and the present study) and that of others (8Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Google Scholar) it appears that ppGaNTase-T1 and -T2 are expressed ubiquitously, -T3 is expressed in a more limited range of tissues, and -T4 more restricted still. Perhaps the pattern of expression reflects the diversity of endogenous substrates that must be O-glycosylated. For example, the rat submandibular gland, which expresses a relatively simple apomucin (11Albone E.F. Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16845-16852Google Scholar), expresses relatively low levels of ppGaNTase-T1 and -T3 transcript but not -T4. In contrast, the rat sublingual gland, which produces a much larger apomucin, 3K. G. Ten Hagen and L. A. Tabak, unpublished observations. expresses at least seven forms of ppGaNTase transcript (i.e. ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4 plus three as yet uncharacterized forms identified with the PCR approach described here), with very high levels of ppGaNTase-T4 noted (Fig. 5). Thus, it is conceivable that more than one enzyme may be required to fully glycosylate the complete repertoire of mucin-type substrates expressed in a given cell. This likely accounts for the differences observed in the tissue-specific expression of the various ppGaNTases identified to date."
https://openalex.org/W2071388690,"The effect of hepatic lipase (HL) deficiency on the susceptibility to atherosclerosis was tested using mice with combined deficiencies in HL and apoE. Mice lacking both HL and apoE (hhee) have a plasma total cholesterol of 917 ± 252 mg/dl (n = 24), which is 184% that of mice lacking only apoE (HHee; 497 ± 161 mg/dl, n= 20, p < 0.001). The increase in cholesterol was mainly in β-migrating very low density lipoproteins, although high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) was also increased (53 ± 37 versus 20 ± 13 mg/dl, p < 0.01). Despite the increase in plasma cholesterol, we found that HL deficiency significantly decreased aortic plaque sizes in female mice fed normal chow (31 × 103 ± 22 × 103μm2 in hhee versus 115 × 103 ± 69 × 103 μm2 inHHee, p < 0.001). Reduction of plaque sizes was also observed in female heterozygous apoE-deficient mice fed an atherogenic diet (2 × 103 ± 2.5 × 103 μm2 in hhEe versus 56 × 103 ± 49 × 103 μm2 inHHEe, p < 0.01). Changes in aortic lesion size were not apparent in the small number of male mice studied. InHHee females, both HDLc and the capacity of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles to promote cholesterol efflux from cultured cells were 26% of the wild type. The absence of HL in hheefemales partially restored HDLc levels to 57% and cholesterol efflux to 55% of the wild type. Circulating pre-β1-migrating HDL were present in all mutants, suggesting that there are alternative pathways in the formation of these pre-β-HDL not involving apoE, HL, or cholesteryl ester transfer protein. The improved capacity to promote cholesterol efflux, together with increased HDL, may explain why these animals can overcome the increase in atherogenic lipoproteins. The effect of hepatic lipase (HL) deficiency on the susceptibility to atherosclerosis was tested using mice with combined deficiencies in HL and apoE. Mice lacking both HL and apoE (hhee) have a plasma total cholesterol of 917 ± 252 mg/dl (n = 24), which is 184% that of mice lacking only apoE (HHee; 497 ± 161 mg/dl, n= 20, p < 0.001). The increase in cholesterol was mainly in β-migrating very low density lipoproteins, although high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) was also increased (53 ± 37 versus 20 ± 13 mg/dl, p < 0.01). Despite the increase in plasma cholesterol, we found that HL deficiency significantly decreased aortic plaque sizes in female mice fed normal chow (31 × 103 ± 22 × 103μm2 in hhee versus 115 × 103 ± 69 × 103 μm2 inHHee, p < 0.001). Reduction of plaque sizes was also observed in female heterozygous apoE-deficient mice fed an atherogenic diet (2 × 103 ± 2.5 × 103 μm2 in hhEe versus 56 × 103 ± 49 × 103 μm2 inHHEe, p < 0.01). Changes in aortic lesion size were not apparent in the small number of male mice studied. InHHee females, both HDLc and the capacity of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles to promote cholesterol efflux from cultured cells were 26% of the wild type. The absence of HL in hheefemales partially restored HDLc levels to 57% and cholesterol efflux to 55% of the wild type. Circulating pre-β1-migrating HDL were present in all mutants, suggesting that there are alternative pathways in the formation of these pre-β-HDL not involving apoE, HL, or cholesteryl ester transfer protein. The improved capacity to promote cholesterol efflux, together with increased HDL, may explain why these animals can overcome the increase in atherogenic lipoproteins. In circulation, nascent lipoproteins are remodeled by removal of core lipids and transfer of surface proteins and lipids prior to their removal through receptor-mediated mechanisms (1Rader D.J. Brewer Jr., H.B. Goldbourt U. de Faire U. Berg K. Genetic Factors in Coronary Heart Disease. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 83-103Google Scholar). Hepatic lipase (HL) 1The abbreviations used are: HL, hepatic lipase; IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein(s); HDL, high density lipoprotein(s); VLDL, very low density lipoprotein(s); LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); TG, triglyceride(s); CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; HDLc, HDL cholesterol. is a 60-kDa lipolytic enzyme involved in the processing of chylomicrons, intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), and high density lipoproteins (HDL) (2AppleBaum-Bawden D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 130-135Google Scholar). HL efficiently hydrolyzes both triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids, while lipoprotein lipase is mainly responsible for hydrolysis of plasma TG. The preferred enzymatic substrates for HL are intermediate-size particles, such as IDL, and HDL2. Changes observed in lipoprotein profiles in humans with congenital HL deficiencies are the presence of β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL) and larger HDL (3Hegele R.A. Little J.A. Vezina C. Maguire G.F. Tu L. Wolever T.S. Jenkins D.J. Connelly P.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 720-727Google Scholar). The β-VLDL that accumulate in HL deficiency are more TG-rich than β-VLDL in typical type III hyperlipoproteinemia subjects (4Connelly P.W. Ranganathan S. Maguire G.F. Lee M. Myher J.J. Kottke B.A. Kuksi A. Little J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14184-14188Google Scholar). We previously reported that HL-deficient mice have a mild dyslipidemia with increased cholesterol and phospholipid, and the plasma contains large HDL floating in the 1.02–1.04 g/ml density range (5Homanics G.E. de Silva H.S. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2974-2980Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, overexpression of HL decreases HDL cholesterol and HDL particle size in mice (6Busch S.J. Barnhart R.L. Martin G.A. Fitzgerald M.C. Yates M.T. Mao S.J.T. Thomas C.E. Jackson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16376-16382Google Scholar) and decreases HDL cholesterol and IDL in rabbits (7Fan J. Bensadoun A. Lauer S.J. Dang Q. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8724-8728Google Scholar). Both HL and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) participate in the metabolism of HDL (8Clay M.A. Newnham H.H. Forte T.M. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 52-58Google Scholar). Both enzymes decrease HDL core lipids, apparently making lipid-poor apoA-I available for dissociation or transfer to other particles (8Clay M.A. Newnham H.H. Forte T.M. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 52-58Google Scholar, 9Demant T. Carlson L.A. Holmquist L. Karpe F. Nilsson-Ehle P. Packard C.J. Shepard J. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1603-1611Google Scholar, 10Bamberger M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3693-3701Google Scholar). Addition of HL to native plasma or during perfusion through isolated liver from rat produces small pre-β-migrating HDL (11Barrans A. Collet X. Barbaras R. Jaspard B. Manent J. Vieu C. Chap H. Perret B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11572-11577Google Scholar). HL-mediated lipolysis may be the primary source of the circulating HDL subfractions, pre-β-HDL, with a pre-β electrophoretic mobility on agarose gel. Pre-β1-HDL particles are thought to be the acceptors of cellular cholesterol in the early steps of reverse cholesterol transport (12Neary R. Bhatnagar D. Durrington P. Ishola M. Arrol S. Mackness M. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 89: 35-48Google Scholar, 13Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Google Scholar). Disruption of this pathway could be detrimental to cholesterol homeostasis in peripheral tissues. Mice provide a useful model for studying both HDL metabolism and the role of HDL in atherogenesis. Because mice lack CETP (14Jiao S. Cole T.G. Kitchens R.T. Pfleger B. Schonfeld B. Metabolism. 1990; 39: 155-160Google Scholar), one pathway for reverse cholesterol transport, e.g. transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL to apoB-containing particles, is not operating. Also, specific components involved in lipoprotein remodeling, such as HL, can be genetically eliminated in mice by gene targeting. This allows specific mutations affecting lipoprotein metabolism to be related to atherogenesis. Certain genetically engineered mice have atherosclerotic plaques similar to those found in humans. For example, mice completely lacking apoE develop atherosclerosis on a regular chow diet (15Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4471-4475Google Scholar, 16Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Google Scholar, 17Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek K. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 141-147Google Scholar), while mice carrying a single copy of the apoE gene are susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis (19Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Burkey B. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 937-945Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluated the effect of HL deficiency on plasma lipoprotein distribution and atherogenesis in mice with apoE deficiency. We found that HL deficiency increases plasma cholesterol levels in female apoE-deficient mice, but their aortic plaque sizes were reduced compared with mice deficient in apoE, but normal in HL. HL- and apoE-deficient mice were bred to generate double mutants (5Homanics G.E. de Silva H.S. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2974-2980Google Scholar, 15Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4471-4475Google Scholar, 16Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Google Scholar). The parental apoE mutants were a seventh generation backcross of F1 (129/Ola: C57BL/6J) to C57BL/6J, and the HL mutants were a second generation backcross to C57BL/6J. Seven groups of animals were compared for lipid concentration in plasma: 1) the wild type, normal gene for HL and apoE (HHEE); 2) homozygous for HL deficiency, normal apoE gene (hhEE); 3) homozygous for HL deficiency and heterozygous for apoE (hhEe); 4) normal for HL and heterozygous for apoE deficiency (HHEe); 5) normal for HL and homozygous for apoE deficiency (HHee); 6) homozygous for apoE and heterozygous for HL deficiency (Hhee); and 7) homozygous for both HL and apoE deficiencies (hhee). Four groups, HHEE,hhEE, HHee, and hhee, were further characterized for lipid and lipoprotein distribution. To test the effects of HL on lipoproteins and atherosclerosis, three experiments were designed. In the first experiment, female 129/B6 F2 mice deficient in HL (hhEE; n = 10) and their wild-type littermates (HHEE; n = 10) were fed the atherogenic diet for 4 months. In the second experiment, female mice heterozygous for apoE deficiency, which develop atherosclerosis only when fed an atherogenic diet (18Reddick R.L. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 141-147Google Scholar), were tested in the presence (HHEe; n = 7) or absence (hhEe; n = 10) of a normal HL gene. The atherogenic diet contained 15.8% (w/w) fat, 1.25% (w/w) cholesterol, and 0.5% (w/w) sodium cholate ad was from Teklad Premier (Madison, WI). This diet was fed to the mice for 4 months, and the mice were killed at 6 months of age. In the third experiment, mice homozygous for apoE deficiency in the presence (HHee; n = 14, 5 males and 9 females) or absence (hhee;n = 18, 4 males and 14 females) of HL expression were maintained on normal chow and killed at 4 months of age. Mice were maintained on 12-h dark/light cycles and allowed access to food and water ad libitum. The animals were handled following the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Following an overnight fast, 200–300 μl of blood were collected by retro-orbital bleeding into tubes containing EDTA (final concentration of 2 mm). Plasma samples obtained by centrifugation (8000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C) were supplemented with aprotinin and gentamicin (final concentrations of 0.1 IU and 1 μg/ml, respectively). Plasma was kept at 4 °C until use. Total cholesterol and TG were determined immediately using reagents from Sigma. HDL cholesterol and phospholipids were determined within 3 days by using a kit from Wako Bioproducts (Richmond, VA). For lipoprotein analysis, blood was collected in the morning from fasted mice under anesthesia with a lethal dose of Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol). Plasma samples (100 μl) were subjected to gel filtration using a Superose 6HR column (Pharmacia, Uppsala), and lipid analysis of the fractions was carried out as described (20de Silva H.V. Mas-Oliva J. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1297-1310Google Scholar). Lipoproteins from 1 ml of plasma combined from three mice were fractionated by sequential density ultracentrifugation (20de Silva H.V. Mas-Oliva J. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1297-1310Google Scholar) at 70,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Lipoprotein fractions in the density ranges of d < 1.006,d = 1.006–1.02, d = 1.02–1.04,d = 1.04–1.06, d = 1.06–1.08,d = 1.08–1.10, and d = 1.10–1.12 g/ml were obtained following successive centrifugation for 5 h. Thed = 1.12–1.21 g/ml fraction was isolated following overnight centrifugation. Lipoproteins from each fraction were recovered by tube slicing and dialyzed in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Lipoproteins were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis using commercially available precast gels (Ciba Corning, Palo Alto, CA). The apolipoprotein composition of each fraction was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the proteins. ApoA-I distribution in plasma lipoproteins was determined by two-dimensional nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (13Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Google Scholar). The first dimension was carried out on 0.75% agarose in 50 mm barbital buffer, pH 8.6, on GelBond (FMC Corp. BioProducts) at 4 °C (200 V) for 100 min. The second dimension was carried out on 2–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels at 120 V for 16 h. Thereafter, the gel content was transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet in buffer containing 0.025m Tris and 0.192 m glycine, pH 8.3, for 100 min at 392 mA under semidry conditions. ApoA-I-containing fractions were detected by chemiluminescence using an anti-mouse apoA-I antibody labeled with peroxidase and an ECL kit (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Cellular cholesterol efflux from rat Fu5AH hepatoma cells was determined following the procedure described (21De la Llera Moya M. Atger V. Paul J.L. Fournier N. Moatti N. Giral P. Friday K.E. Rothblat G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1056-1065Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 ml of medium containing cells at a concentration of 25,000 cells/ml were plated in 2.4-cm multiwell plates and grown until confluence in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% calf serum. Two days after plating, cellular cholesterol was labeled during a 48-h incubation with [3H]cholesterol (1 μCi/well). To allow equilibration of the label, the cells were rinsed and incubated for 24 h in minimal essential medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. For determination of cholesterol efflux, the cells were washed with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with 100 μg of HDL protein that had been isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration. After recovery of the incubation medium, the remaining cellular cholesterol was then extracted. Radioactivity was measured in both medium and cells, and percentage of cholesterol efflux was calculated. The mice were killed with an overdose of Avertin. The heart and vascular tree were perfused with 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4. Segments containing aortic sinus area were embedded, serially sectioned, and stained. Four sections were used for morphologic evaluations (16Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Google Scholar, 19Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Burkey B. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 937-945Google Scholar). The average of the sizes of lesions in the four sections was used to represent lesion size of each animal's aorta. Morphometric evaluation of the lesions was conducted using the Image measure/IP IM 2500 morphometry system (Phoenix Technology, Federal Way, MA). Paired and unpaired Student'st tests were performed for the plasma lipid concentrations. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion sizes. Fasted plasma lipid levels of mice with both HL and apoE deficiencies (hhee) were significantly elevated compared with mice with only apoE deficiency (HHee), as shown in Table I. Total cholesterol levels in hhee mice were nearly twice those inHHee controls. While a significant reduction in HDLc levels was observed in apoE-deficient animals (HHee) compared with wild-type mice (HHEE), HDLc levels in hheemutants were similar to those in wild-type mice. HDLc levels in hhee mice showed a 2-fold increase over those in HHee mice. Triglycerides were also significantly higher in hheecompared with HHee mice. Male mice heterozygous for HL and homozygous for apoE (Hhee) had intermediate levels of plasma cholesterol (765 ± 110 mg/dl). An ∼75% increase in total cholesterol was observed in hhee compared with HHee mice. In contrast, only a 26% increase in total cholesterol was observed inhhEE compared with HHEE mice. Therefore, the increase in total cholesterol levels seen in HL deficiency is enhanced by the absence of apoE.Table ILipid concentration in mutant mouse plasmaGenotypeSexDietnTC1-aTc, total cholesterol; C, normal chow diet; HF, high-fat diet.TriglyceridesHDL cholesterolPhospholipidsTC/HDLcmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlExp. 1HHEEFC388 ± 1748 ± 2645 ± 589 ± 32HF11179 ± 741-bp<0.01,hhEE versus HHEEmatched for gender and diet.57 ± 2836 ± 95hhEEFC4113 ± 3449 ± 2981 ± 311.4HF10210 ± 911-bp<0.01,hhEE versus HHEEmatched for gender and diet.52 ± 1568 ± 283.1Exp. 2HHEeFC1062 ± 1080 ± 4044 ± 171.4HF10281 ± 12518 ± 1336 ± 227.7hhEeFC8102 ± 241-cp < 0.001, hhEe versus HHEematched for gender and diet.63 ± 261-dp < 0.05, hhEe versus HHEematched for gender and diet.55 ± 221.8HF10345 ± 8722 ± 843 ± 248Exp. 3HHeeMC7639 ± 15495 ± 3528 ± 15132 ± 1522FC13421 ± 10462 ± 2216 ± 10115 ± 1526hheeMC111143 ± 1091-ep < 0.001, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.199 ± 761-fp < 0.01, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.79 ± 421-fp < 0.01, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.232 ± 221-ep < 0.001, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.14FC13726 ± 1601-ep < 0.001, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.91 ± 321-gp < 0.05, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.35 ± 191-fp < 0.01, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.173 ± 311-fp < 0.01, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.21Data are presented as means ± S.D.1-a Tc, total cholesterol; C, normal chow diet; HF, high-fat diet.1-b p<0.01,hhEE versus HHEEmatched for gender and diet.1-c p < 0.001, hhEe versus HHEematched for gender and diet.1-d p < 0.05, hhEe versus HHEematched for gender and diet.1-e p < 0.001, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.1-f p < 0.01, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet.1-g p < 0.05, hhee versus HHeematched for gender and diet. Open table in a new tab Data are presented as means ± S.D. Female mice heterozygous for apoE with and without HL (HHEeand hhEe, respectively) responded to an atherogenic diet with a significant increase in total plasma cholesterol. Degrees of increase in HHEe and hhEe mice were similar, suggesting that apoE (but not HL) is the primary factor affecting the plasma lipid increase in response to dietary change. The atherogenic diet reduced TG by 65–77% and HDLc by 17–23% in HHEe andhhEe mice, respectively. Plasma from different mutants was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). In contrast to HHEEand hhEE mice, in which most of the cholesterol was in the HDL range, the cholesterol in apoE-deficient mutants (HHeeand hhee) was distributed mostly among larger lipoproteins in the VLDL and IDL/LDL range. The hhee mutants had further increased cholesterol content in these potentially atherogenic particles compared with HHee mice. In addition, the HDL fractions in hhee mice were increased, resulting in similar HDLc levels as observed in wild-type mice (HHEE). Consistent with previous results (5Homanics G.E. de Silva H.S. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2974-2980Google Scholar), HL deficiency increased the size of HDL particles as revealed in the earlier elution of HDL fractions from the gel permeation column (Fig. 1). However, the shift of the HDL fraction peak was not obvious in hhee compared with HHeemice. Fractionation of lipoproteins by sequential ultracentrifugation also showed that the distribution of cholesterol and phospholipids is determined mainly by apoE genotype (Fig. 2). Most of the cholesterol in apoE-deficient mice was within the density range of 1.006–1.04 g/ml. In contrast, the cholesterol in HHEE andhhEE mice was present primarily within the density range of 1.06–1.21 g/ml. The distribution of cholesterol in HL-deficient mice was shifted toward lower buoyant density compared with that in wild-type mice. In contrast, no significant difference among different groups of mice was observed in TG distribution, which was mostly in VLDL fractions (Fig. 2).Figure 2Lipid distribution in lipoprotein density fractions. Equal volumes of plasma from HHEE,hhEE, HHee, and hhee mutant mice fed a regular chow diet were pooled to make a 1-ml final volume. Plasma was then fractionated by sequential density ultracentrifugation using a density range of 1.006–1.21 g/ml. Percent recovery of cholesterol and phospholipids in each density fraction is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Agarose gel electrophoresis of lipoproteins in density fractions revealed a dramatic increase in the d < 1.02 g/ml fractions (β-VLDL) in HHee mice, which was further increased in hhee mutants (Fig. 3). Consistent with gel permeation data, there was also a significant increase in the α-migrating particles in hhee mice, similar to the amount observed in HHEE mice. Inhhee mice, lipoproteins with α-mobility were present in fractions with d < 1.06 g/ml. Similar particles were present at much lower levels in hhEE mutants, but they were absent in HHEE and HHee mutants. Previous studies showed that the d = 1.02–1.04 g/ml fraction ofhhEE mice contains α-migrating HDL that reacts with anti-apoE and anti-apoA-I antisera, but not anti-apoB antiserum (5Homanics G.E. de Silva H.S. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2974-2980Google Scholar). The absence of apoE is associated with increased apoB-48 and apoB-100 in the d < 1.006 g/ml fraction. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lipoproteins showed that the amount of apoB in the various density fractions from hhee and HHee mice was not altered (data not shown), suggesting that the particle number had not significantly changed, but that the increase in size was mostly due to enrichment of cholesterol. To investigate the effect of HL deficiency on atherosclerosis development, three experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, hhEE mice and their wild-type littermates were fed an atherogenic diet for 4 months. No significant plaques were found in animals of either group, suggesting that hepatic lipase deficiency does not by itself increase susceptibility to diet-induced atherosclerosis in mice (data not shown). In the second experiment, we evaluated diet-induced atherosclerosis using animals heterozygous for apoE deficiency. We fed the atherogenic diet to HHEe and hhEe females for 4 months. Animals were killed at 6 months of age, and aortic plaque sizes were evaluated (Fig. 4 a). We found that the extent of lesions in hhEe mice was only 3% (2.0 × 103 ± 2.5 × 103 μm2,n = 7) of that in HHEe mice (56 × 103 ± 49 × 103 μm2,n = 10) despite the higher levels of plasma cholesterol in HHEe mice, shown in Table I. In the third experiment, we evaluated the effect of HL deficiency on spontaneous atherosclerosis caused by the complete lack of apoE. Mice homozygous for apoE deficiency in the presence or absence of HL were maintained on a regular chow diet and killed at 4 months of age. All apoE null mutants developed atherosclerotic lesions (Fig.4 b). Strikingly, the plaque sizes in hhee females were 25% (31 × 103 ± 21 × 103μm2, n = 14) of those in HHeecontrol females (115 × 103 ± 69 × 103 μm2, n = 9,p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant difference in plaque size was observed in the small number of males examined (20 × 103 ± 5.5 × 103 μm2(n = 4) versus 21 × 103 ± 12 × 103 μm2 (n = 5)) despite higher plasma cholesterol levels as compared withHHee mice (Table I). Lesion sizes in male and femalehhee mice were not significantly different. Maturity of plaques was directly correlated with their size, and no particular differences in plaque components between mice with and without HL were apparent by light microscopic evaluation. To determine if HDL function is altered in HL-deficient mice, we assessed their capacity to promote efflux of cellular cholesterol (Fig. 5). HDL from both hhee and HHee mice had reduced capacity to promote cholesterol efflux (55 and 26%, respectively) compared with HDL from wild-type mice (100%). Both male and female HHeemice had equal capacity to promote cholesterol efflux, but HDL from male hhee mice had 50% higher capacity compared with HDL from female hhee mice, consistent with the fact that malehhee mice have a higher plasma HDLc level compared with female hhee mice (Table I). We then examined whether the effect on cholesterol efflux was related to qualitative changes in HDL particles. Plasma samples from different mice were separated by two-dimensional nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and blotted with an apoA-I antibody (Fig.6). The general electrophoretic pattern of HDL was similar in all genotypes and very close to that observed in humans (13Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Google Scholar). However, pre-β1-HDL from all mutant mice displayed increased levels and slightly larger sizes compared with wild-type mice. The α1-HDL fraction was markedly reduced inHHee mutants and less in hhee mutants. A new fraction of α-mobility, α2, was found inhhee mice and much less so in HHee mice. This fraction is larger than α1 in size. Electrophoretic patterns of male and female mutants were indistinguishable (data not shown). The most striking change in the lipid profiles of mice deficient in both HL and apoE is a marked increase in cholesterol present mostly in β-VLDL. Although this increase primarily results from the lack of apoE, the comparison between hhee and HHee mice clearly demonstrates additional and independent effects of HL deficiency. The absence of HL therefore increases the accumulation of atherogenic β-VLDL already present in apoE deficiency. The increase in lipids is, however, not associated with an apparent increase in apoB-48 or apoB-100, suggesting that hhee mice accumulate larger apoB-containing particles. This is consistent with a role of HL in the remodeling of remnant particles. In addition to lipid abnormalities in HL-deficient humans, several studies have suggested that HL plays a role in chylomicron remnant removal (22Goldberg I.J. Le N.-A. Paterniti Jr., J.R. Ginsberg H.N. Lindgren F.T. Brown W.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 1184-1192Google Scholar, 23Ji Z.-S Lauer S.J. Fazio S. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13429-13436Google Scholar). Acute inhibition of HL activity by antibodies in primates or in a rat liver perfusion system causes the accumulation of TG-rich lipoproteins (22Goldberg I.J. Le N.-A. Paterniti Jr., J.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13429-13436Google Scholar) have shownin vitro that cell surface-bound HL enhances binding of remnant lipoproteins to the cells. This process does not require apoE since binding of β-VLDL isolated from apoE-deficient mice and binding of apoE-containing β-VLDL from rabbits were equally enhanced. HL has been shown to bind to the LDL receptor-related protein and promote β-VLDL uptake (24Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Google Scholar). These interactions are inhibited by heparin, suggesting that HL may act as a bridge between remnant lipoproteins and cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. However, HL-deficient mice display no apparent impairment in chylomicron clearance (5Homanics G.E. de Silva H.S. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2974-2980Google Scholar), suggesting that this pathway is not crucial for their clearance in mice under normal physiological conditions. In contrast, in apoE deficiency, when the major ligand mediating removal is not operating, the absence of HL causes a further increase in the accumulation of cholesterol-rich remnants. The increase in remnant lipoproteins in hhee mice may result from an impairment in HL-facilitated remnant uptake by the liver or delayed conversion of remnants to smaller particles, preventing their effective removal. Another effect related to HL deficiency is an increase in HDL levels. Large α-migrating HDL enriched in apoE but devoid of apoB were observed on agarose gel electrophoresis of d = 1.02–1.04 g/ml fractions in HL-deficient mice. These particles contain apoA-I, cholesterol, and phospholipids (5Homanics G.E. de Silva H.S. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2974-2980Google Scholar). In this study, we found larger HDL in HL-deficient mouse plasma fractionated by gel permeation chromatography or ultracentrifugation. In addition, two-dimensional nondenaturing gel electrophoresis showed the presence of large HDL particles in the α2-fraction in the hheemutants. We also observed a slight increase in apoA-I in the α1-migrating fraction of hhee mutant HDL compared with HHee mutant HDL. In contrast to results reported by Koo et al. (25Koo C. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11934-11943Google Scholar) suggesting that apoE is required for the formation of large HDL, our observations indicate that apoE is not essential for this process. The origin of large α2-migrating HDL in HL-deficient mice is not clear. The most simple explanation is that these particles are generated as a consequence of sequential lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-mediated enlargement of small HDL3 first to HDL2 and then to HDL1 (1Rader D.J. Brewer Jr., H.B. Goldbourt U. de Faire U. Berg K. Genetic Factors in Coronary Heart Disease. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 83-103Google Scholar). HDL1 are normally enriched in apoE and are thought to be removed through apoE-mediated LDL receptor interaction (26Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Arnold K.S. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2311-2315Google Scholar). The absence of apoE inhhee mutants may contribute to the accumulation of these particles by delaying their removal by hepatic receptors. Further studies are necessary for determining the exact origin of these large α-migrating fractions. It has been proposed that only a small portion of apoA-I-containing particles are active in cholesterol removal from peripheral cells and transport back to liver, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (27Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Google Scholar). These lipid-poor HDL have pre-β electrophoretic mobility, and HL and CETP are thought to be important in their formation (8Clay M.A. Newnham H.H. Forte T.M. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 52-58Google Scholar). HL activity has been found to contribute to the formation of pre-β-migrating HDL as observed in in vitroand liver perfusion experiments (8Clay M.A. Newnham H.H. Forte T.M. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 52-58Google Scholar, 11Barrans A. Collet X. Barbaras R. Jaspard B. Manent J. Vieu C. Chap H. Perret B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11572-11577Google Scholar). However, the distributions of pre-β-migrating HDL in the plasma of hhee,HHee, and hhEE mice are similar to that in wild-type mice. Because hhee mice lack CETP, HL, and apoE, other enzymes must be sufficient for the formation of pre-β-HDL. One alternative mechanism to generate these particles involves phospholipid transfer protein, which is believed to promote fusion of HDL particles, liberating small lipid-poor particles analogous to pre-β1-HDL (28von Eckardstein A. Jauhiainen M. Huang Y. Metso J. Langer C. Pussinen P. Wu S. Ehnholm L. Assmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 255-262Google Scholar). The absence of HL may favor this process by increasing phospholipid transfer protein substrate. Another possible mechanism may involve the recently described HDL receptor or scavenger receptor type BI, which has been reported to be expressed in a variety of tissues including the liver (29Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar). This receptor mediates selective uptake of cholesteryl esters without endocytosis, perhaps making apoA-I available to form smaller particles similar to pre-β1-HDL. HL deficiency increased β-VLDL cholesterol levels in apoE-deficient mice. This would be expected to have an atherogenic effect. However, the female hhee mutants developed smaller atherosclerotic lesions compared with the HHee mutants. No difference was observed in the small number of males examined. Reduction in plaque size was also observed in female hhEe mice compared withHHEe mice when fed an atherogenic diet. Since genetic background is clearly a factor that contributes to atherosclerosis, it is important to use experimental and control groups of mice with comparable genetic backgrounds. The mice used in this study carried ∼87% of their genome from the C57BL/6J strain, with the rest being from 129/Ola. Offspring from several families were used to help ensure that the region from 129/Ola would be randomly distributed. The only systemic difference between the two groups (HHee andhhee, or HHEe and hhEe) is the region near the HL gene: this region in hh mice is from 129/Ola, while in HH mice, it is from C57BL/6J. We cannot therefore exclude a possibility that some loci linked to HL, but not HL deficiency itself, are the cause of the protection in hheemice. However, since no major loci that affected atherosclerosis are known to be linked to the HL gene, this systemic difference is unlikely to have influenced our results. An increase in β-VLDL particles but reduced atherosclerosis was recently observed in apoE-deficient mice overexpressing human apoA-IV (30Duverger N. Tremp G. Caillaud J.M. Emmanuel F. Castro G. Fruchart J.C. Steinmetz A. Denèfle P. Science. 1996; 273: 966-968Google Scholar). The reason for these findings is not clear, but they may be the result of a more favorable balance in extrahepatic cholesterol by either decreased influx or increased efflux. Although the size of β-VLDL was not directly measured, our data are consistent with an increase in β-VLDL size. Larger β-VLDL particles have a lesser ability to enter the artery wall, and their conversion by HL to smaller particles may increase their atherogenecity, as suggested by previous studies in rabbits (31Stender S. Zilversmit D.B. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 38-49Google Scholar, 32Nordestgaard B.G. Stender S. Kjeldsen K. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 421-428Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed an increase in HDL cholesterol in hhee mutants and a higher capacity ofhhee mutant HDL to promote cholesterol efflux in vitro compared with HHee mutant HDL. However, protection against atherosclerosis in mice may not solely depend on the capacity to promote cholesterol efflux since male hhee mice had a higher efflux than female hhee mice, yet did not appear to display a decrease in atherosclerosis. Further studies including determination of the sizes of β-VLDL particles in males and females with HL deficiency are necessary to explain the sex-related differences. It is premature to conclude that the inhibition of HL may help reduce formation of atherosclerotic plaques in humans. Physiological differences between the two species, such as the absence of CETP activity in mice and apoB editing in the liver of mice, but not in humans, may influence differently the role of HL in atherogenesis. Consequently, HL deficiency in humans may be associated with premature atherosclerosis (3Hegele R.A. Little J.A. Vezina C. Maguire G.F. Tu L. Wolever T.S. Jenkins D.J. Connelly P.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 720-727Google Scholar). In addition, while men are at higher risk for developing atherosclerosis than women, the gender effects appear to be opposite in mice. Previously, we observed that chow-fed female apoE-deficient mice (33Paszty C. Maeda N. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 899-903Google Scholar) and female heterozygous apoE-deficient mice fed an atherogenic diet (34Krege H.J. Moyer J.S. Langenbach L.L. Peng L. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. Reddick R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. in press, 1997Google Scholar) develop larger plaques in their aortic sinus area compared with males. Similar observations were made by Paigen et al. (35Paigen B. Holmes P. Mitchell D. Albee D. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 64: 215-221Google Scholar) in the diet-induced atherosclerosis of inbred C57BL/6J mice. Further investigations in HL-deficient mice may help us to understand the cause of this gender difference. In conclusion, our study clearly shows that HL is involved in the catabolism of β-VLDL/IDL and HDL by a mechanism independent of apoE. We found that neither HL nor CETP is essential for the formation of murine pre-β1-HDL and that HL deficiency is associated with decreased susceptibility to atherosclerosis in female mice despite higher plasma cholesterol levels. This beneficial effect was associated with increased cholesterol efflux by HDL from HL-deficient mice. We thank D. Chappell, M. Hinsdale, S. Quarfordt, H. deSilva, and P.

The signaling pathways through which retinoids mediate these effects have not been defined. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) gene family (β1–3) were examined as potential components of the retinoid signaling pathway in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. All-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) increased the levels of TGF-β2 and IGFBP-3 mRNA and of secreted TGF-β and IGFBP-3 proteins. An antagonist of retinoic acid receptor-α, LG100629, abrogated the increase in TGF-β2 and IGFBP-3 mRNA levels induced by t-RA. t-RA increased IGFBP-3 mRNA levels transiently from 1 to 6 h, and subsequently a sustained increase began at 72 h, which coincided with the appearance of active TGF-β in the media. Treatment with TGF-β2 increased IGFBP-3 mRNA levels, but treatment with latency-associated peptide, which inactivates secreted TGF-β, did not abrogate the effect of t-RA on IGFBP-3 expression. These findings provide evidence that t-RA increased TGF-β2 and IGFBP-3 expression through an retinoic acid receptor-α-dependent pathway, and the increase in IGFBP-3 expression by t-RA did not require activation of the TGF-β pathway by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.

IGFBP-3 is one of a family of seven IGFBPs (36Cohen P. Fielder P.J. Hasegawa Y. Frisch H. Giudice L.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Acta Endocrinol. 1991; 124: 74-85Google Scholar, 37Holly J.M.P. Martin J.L.

Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 has been proposed to inhibit cell growth by reducing IGF bioavailability, by altering the responsiveness of the IGF-I receptor to IGF-I, and by mechanisms independent of the IGF-I receptor (40Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Google Scholar, 41Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 expression is also increased by TGF-β2 treatment in breast cancer cells and has been implicated in the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β2 (42Oh Y. Muller H.M. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Google Scholar). These findings support the notion that TGF-β and IGFBP-3 actions are connected through a common retinoid signal transduction pathway. In this study, we examined the regulation of IGFBP-3 and TGF-β gene family expression by t-RA in normal HBE cells. We demonstrated that t-RA increased the levels of TGF-β2 and IGFBP-3 mRNA and of secreted TGF-β and IGFBP-3 proteins. These events were inhibited by a retinoid that functions as an RAR-α antagonist. Treatment with TGF-β2 increased IGFBP-3 mRNA levels, demonstrating a linkage of IGFBP-3 with TGF-β2 signaling pathways. However, the addition of latency-associated peptide (LAP), which inactivates secreted TGF-β, did not abrogate the effect of t-RA on IGFBP-3 expression. These findings provide evidence that t-RA increased TGF-β2 and IGFBP-3 expression through an RAR-α-dependent pathway, and the increase in IGFBP-3 expression by t-RA did not require activation of the TGF-β pathway by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.

Spencer S.A. Hellmiss R. Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1176-1185Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. William Wood (Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Normal HBE cells were seeded on 10-cm plates (105 cells/plate), treated with t-RA for different time periods or with medium alone, and conditioned medium samples were collected simultaneously 144 h after cell seeding. For the medium sample that represents the 0–24-h time point, treatment with 10−6m t-RA in BPE-free medium (to eliminate exogenous TGF-β) was begun 120 h after cell seeding, and an aliquot was collected at 144 h. For the sample that represents 24–48 h, treatment was begun 96 h after cell seeding, replaced at 120 h with BPE-free medium containing t-RA, and an aliquot was collected at 144 h. For the sample that represents 48–72 h, treatment was begun 72 h after cell seeding and replaced at 120 h with BPE-free medium containing t-RA, and an aliquot was collected at 144 h. For the sample that represents 72–96 h, treatment was begun 48 h after cell seeding and replaced at 120 h with BPE-free medium containing t-RA, and an aliquot was collected at 144 h. For the sample that represents 96–120 h, treatment was begun 24 h after cell seeding and replaced at 120 h with BPE-free medium containing t-RA, and an aliquot was collected at 144 h. For the control (untreated) medium sample, no t-RA was added, the medium was changed to BPE-free medium at 120 h, and an aliquot was collected at 144 h. Conditioned medium samples were transferred to three separate wells on a six-well plate seeded with MLECs that were stably transfected with the TGF-β-responsive luciferase vector (105 cells/well). MLECs were treated for 16 h, and then cytosolic luciferase activity was measured as described previously (11Kim Y.-H. Dohi D.F. Han G.R. Zou C.-P. Oridate N. Walsh G.L. Nesbitt J.C. Xu X.-C. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Kurie J.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5603-5610Google Scholar). Luciferase values reflect TGF-β bioactivity in the conditioned medium. To examine bioactivity that reflects total (active plus latent) TGF-β levels, MLECs were treated with conditioned medium previously heated to 80 °C for 5 min, which activates latent TGF-β (21Kojima S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 323-332Google Scholar). The results represent the means and standard deviations of luciferase activities from three identical wells, and luciferase activities were corrected for normal HBE cell numbers determined at the end of t-RA treatment. The presence of t-RA in the conditioned medium did not appreciably alter luciferase activity in MLECs (data not shown). Conditioned medium samples were collected from t-RA-treated normal HBE cells as described for the TGF-β bioactivity assay. Aliquots determined on the basis of equal cell number were concentrated 1:10 with Centriprep 10 filters (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), loaded on a 1% SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gel, blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (BAS-83, Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., Burlingame, VT), incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-IGFBP-3 affinity purified monoclonal antibody (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX), and detected with the enzyme-linked chemiluminesence assay (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.). For WLB, the membrane was incubated with a 2 × 106 cpm mixture of125I-labeled IGF-I and IGF-II and exposed to film as described previously (48Cohen P. Peehl D.M. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 407-491Google Scholar). Normal HBE cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/10-cm plate and treated for 120 h with media alone, 10−6m t-RA alone, and 10−6m t-RA in combination with LAP at concentrations of 1, 10, 100, 200, and 500 ng/ml. At 120 h, the cells were trypsinized and stained with trypan blue, and the total viable cell number was counted by using an hemocytometer. We examined the regulation of IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 mRNA levels in normal HBE cells during 10−6m t-RA treatment by Northern analysis (Fig.1). An increase in TGF-β2 mRNA levels was detected between 6 and 12 h; this increase continued through 120 h. TGF-β1 was expressed constitutively with no change during treatment. TGF-β3 mRNA was not detected (data not shown). IGFBP-3 mRNA was expressed in a bimodal pattern. A transient increase was observed at 6 h, and a sustained increase appeared at 72 h of treatment. Examination of earlier time points revealed that increased IGFBP-3 mRNA was detectable at 1 h of 10−6m t-RA treatment (Fig. 2 A). The increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA at 6 h was inhibited by treatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating the necessity of both gene transcription and protein synthesis for activation of this retinoid signaling event.Figure 2Northern analysis of IGFBP-3 expression was performed on total cellular RNA prepared from normal HBE cells.Expression was examined in cells treated with 10−6m t-RA for different time periods (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 h) (A). The effect of 10−6mt-RA treatment on IGFBP-3 expression was examined in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D (Act D) or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) (B).

Normal HBE cells were treated for 120 h with 10−8m t-RA and different doses of LG100629 (43Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Google Scholar), which is a synthetic retinoid that functions as an RAR-α antagonist, and total cellular RNA was prepared for Northern analysis. In combination with 10−6m t-RA, LG100629, which must be in molar excess to inhibit t-RA-induced activation of RAR-α, was toxic to normal HBE cells (data not shown). LG100629 abrogated the increase in TGF-β2 and IGFBP-3 expression induced by 10−8m t-RA (Fig.3). TGF-β1 mRNA levels, which did not change with t-RA treatment, were not altered by LG100629. LG100629 also inhibited the increase in IGFBP-3 expression observed at 6 h of t-RA treatment (data not shown). The effect of t-RA on TGF-β bioactivity in conditioned medium was investigated. Normal HBE cells were treated with 10−6m t-RA, and conditioned medium samples that reflect defined 24-h periods (0–24, 24–48, 48–72 h, etc.) of t-RA treatment were collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MLECs that are stably transfected with a reporter plasmid containing a truncated plasminogen activator inhibitor type I promoter (16Nunes I. Kojima S. Rifkin D.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 495-499Google Scholar) were treated with conditioned medium samples for 16 h and subjected to luciferase assays to determine relative levels of TGF-β bioactivity in the conditioned media. Total TGF-β (active plus latent) bioactivity was measured by heating the conditioned medium samples to convert latent TGF-β into its active form. Luciferase activities increased during t-RA treatment (Fig. 4), demonstrating increases in total and active TGF-β. The increase in active TGF-β occurred between 48 and 72 h of treatment. The effect of t-RA on IGFBP-3 protein secretion was examined in conditioned medium samples collected at 24-h intervals (as described for the MLEC luciferase assay) by performing immunoblot and WLB (Fig.5). IGFBP-3 was detected in the media of untreated cells (t = 0) by WLB, and increased IGFBP-3 levels, first detected by immunoblot at 24 h, occurred with t-RA treatment. Because the increase in active TGF-β protein in the media coincided with the increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA levels at 72 h, we examined whether IGFBP-3 expression is responsive to activation of TGF-β2 signaling pathways. Normal HBE cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β2, which has been shown to increase IGFBP-3 expression in human breast cancer cells (42Oh Y. Muller H.M. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Google Scholar), and Northern analysis was performed at 72 h, revealing increased IGFBP-3 mRNA (Fig.6). The contribution of TGF-β signaling pathways to the t-RA-induced increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA was explored by treatment with 10−6m t-RA combined with varying doses of LAP, which noncovalently associates with active TGF-β in the extracellular space, converting TGF-β into its inactive form. Examination of conditioned medium samples collected on day 5 revealed that LAP abrogated the increase in TGF-β activity induced by 10−6m t-RA (Fig. 7), confirming its inhibitory effect on extracellular TGF-β activity. However, LAP did not measurably alter the effects of t-RA on IGFBP-3 mRNA or secreted protein levels (Fig. 8).Figure 7Luciferase assays were performed on MLECs stably transfected with a reporter plasmid containing a TGF-β response element (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). For these studies, normal HBE cells were treated for 120 h with media alone, 10−6m t-RA alone, or 10−6m t-RA combined with different doses of LAP. Fresh medium (containing BPE) was added at 72 h, and conditioned medium samples were collected at 120 h. MLECs seeded onto six-well plates were treated with the conditioned medium samples for 16 h and subjected to luciferase assays. The results represent the means and standard deviations of luciferase activities from three identical wells, and luciferase activities were corrected for normal HBE cell numbers determined at the end of t-RA treatment.RA, retinoic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8Northern (A) and immunoblot analysis (B) were performed using total cellular RNA and conditioned medium samples, respectively, prepared from normal HBE cells treated for 120 h with media alone, 10−6m t-RA, or 10−6m t-RA combined with different doses of LAP. A photograph of the ethidium bromide-stained gel illustrates the relative amounts of RNA loaded per lane. Media were replaced at 72 h, and conditioned medium samples were collected at 120 h.

In contrast to our findings in normal HBE cells, the levels of TGF-β1 and -β2 both increase in t-RA-treated hamster tracheal epithelial cells grown in collagen gels (14Niles R.M. Thompson N.L. Fenton F. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1994; 30: 256-262Google Scholar), providing evidence that retinoid signaling in bronchial epithelial cells depends upon the culture conditions and is species-specific. Further, we found that t-RA stimulated the conversion of latent TGF-β into its active form, suggesting that t-RA activated a protease that cleaves latent TGF-β in normal HBE cells. This TGF-β activity accounted for a relatively small fraction of total TGF-β, suggesting that protease activity is tightly regulated. In bovine epithelial cells, t-RA activates latent TGF-β through enhanced cell-associated plasmin activity (21Kojima S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 323-332Google Scholar), whereas in HL-60 cells, activation of TGF-β by t-RA occurs through plasmin-independent mechanisms (16Nunes I. Kojima S. Rifkin D.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 495-499Google Scholar). We examined the role of RAR-α, which is expressed constitutively and activates growth inhibitory pathways in normal HBE cells (11Kim Y.-H. Dohi D.F. Han G.R. Zou C.-P. Oridate N. Walsh G.L. Nesbitt J.C. Xu X.-C. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Kurie J.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5603-5610Google Scholar), in these retinoid signaling events. An RAR-α antagonist inhibited the effects of t-RA on TGF-β2 and IGFBP-3 expression. Normal HBE cells exhibited a bimodal pattern of IGFBP-3 mRNA expression, and the antagonist inhibited the increase at both time points. Treatment with an RAR-α antagonist also blocked the increase in transglutaminase type II expression induced by t-RA in rat tracheobronchial epithelial cells (12Zhang L.-X. Mills K.J. Dawson M.I. Collins S.J. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 6022-6029Google Scholar). Further, RAR activation increases lGFBP-3 expression in human ectocervical epithelial cell lines (32Hembree J.R. Agarwal C. Beard R.L. Chandraratna R.A.S. Eckert R.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1794-1799Google Scholar). These studies support a role for RARs in specific retinoid signaling events. Retinoid receptors regulate gene expression directly by binding to gene promoters or indirectly by protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors. We found that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to the increase in IGFBP-3 expression, and t-RA induced this effect rapidly (1 h). Based on these findings, we will investigate direct binding of retinoid receptors to the IGFBP-3 gene promoter and its role in the activation of IGFBP-3 expression by t-RA. We found increased TGF-β bioactivity in the media at 72 h of t-RA treatment, which was coincident with the increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA levels, and TGF-β2 treatment increased IGFBP-3 expression. Similarly, TGF-β2 treatment increases IGFBP-3 expression in breast cancer cells (42Oh Y. Muller H.M. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we investigated whether t-RA-induced IGFBP-3 expression was TGF-β-dependent. Supporting this possibility, retinoid signaling events such as increased expression of thrombospondin and fibronectin are TGF-β-dependent in rat prostatic epithelial cells (17Danielpour D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 231-239Google Scholar). We found that LAP did not abrogate the increase in IGFBP-3 expression induced by t-RA, suggesting that the increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA levels by t-RA did not require activation of the TGF-β2 signaling pathway through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. It is possible that multiple retinoid signaling pathways, including TGF-β-dependent ones, activate IGFBP-3 expression, and blocking one retinoid signaling pathway is not sufficient to alter the effects of t-RA on IGFBP-3 expression. Further, TGF-β may activate IGFBP-3 expression through intracrine mechanisms, which LAP cannot inhibit. Supporting this possibility, intracrine signaling has been reported to be a mechanism of TGF-β1 actions in mammary epithelial differentiation (34Kordon E.C. McKnight R.A. Jhappan C. Henninghausen L. Merlino G. Smith G.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 47-61Google Scholar). Prior work in a variety of cell types has demonstrated the importance of the TGF-β and IGFBP-3 signaling pathways in the biologic effects of t-RA. Blocking antibodies to TGF-β inhibit the mucous differentiation of hamster tracheal epithelial cells by t-RA and partially abrogate the growth inhibitory effects of t-RA in lymphoma cells, rat prostatic epithelial cells, and keratinocytes (13Glick A.B. Flanders K.C. Danielpour D. Yuspa S.H. Sporn M.B. Cell. Regul. 1989; 1: 87-97Google Scholar, 14Niles R.M. Thompson N.L. Fenton F. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.

Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 655-663Google Scholar). In breast cancer cells, t-RA increases IGFBP-3 expression, and antisense IGFBP-3 oligonucleotides abrogate the growth inhibitory effects of t-RA (24Gucev Z.S. Oh Y. Kelly K.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1545-1550Google Scholar). In contrast, LAP did not alter the growth inhibitory effects of t-RA on normal HBE cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that the role of the TGF-β pathway in cell growth and differentiation depends on the tissue of origin, culture conditions, and transformation state of the cells examined. Additional investigations into the roles of the TGF-β and IGFBP-3 signaling pathways in the biologic effects of retinoid treatment are warranted."

Conflicting results concerning the effects of Nef on the T cell activation pathways have been reported and seem to depend on its targeted intracellular localization (16Skowronski J. Parks D. Mariani R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 703-713Google Scholar, 17Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 373-384Google Scholar, 18Bandres J.C. Ratner L. J.

Galimi F. Medico E. Cottone E. Gramaglia D. Boccaccio C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6590-6593Google Scholar). The functions of Nef in HIV-1-infected cells are probably mediated by specific interactions with cellular proteins, and elucidation of the mechanisms of Nef action will require the identification of its cellular partners. We have attempted to identify the cellular proteins involved using the yeast two-hybrid system. The present report describes the identification of a cDNA encoding a Nef-interacting protein that is 42% identical with the Escherichia colithioesterase II, an enzyme involved in cleavage of thioester bonds. This human thioesterase (hTE) corresponds to a new type of eucaryotic thioesterase, distinct from the two types of animal thioesterases previously described. The Nef-hTE interaction was confirmed in vitro and in CEM cells expressing Nef. There is also a correlation between Nef-hTE interaction and CD4 down-regulation, suggesting that hTE could be one of the cellular proteins involved in Nef-mediated CD4 down-regulation. Two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (21Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Google Scholar) in the yeast reporter strain HF7c, with the NefLai protein fused to the Gal4BD in pGBT10 and a Jurkat cell cDNA library fused to the Gal4AD in pGAD1318. Positive clones were rescued and tested for specificity by retransformation into HF7c with Nef or with the extraneous targets, yeast SNF1 (22Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar), HIV-1 Vpr, and HIV-1 Gag. The cDNA inserts from specific positive clones were sequenced using the Sanger dideoxy termination method adapted to the ABI 373A Automated Sequencer. Nef sequences from HIV-1 isolates HXB3, A01, D01, and E01 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGBT10 as described for the nefLai gene (21Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Google Scholar). The liquid culture assay for quantitative β-galactosidase activity was performed using SFY526 strain as described previously (23Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Sluppaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in triplicate. The hTE coding sequence was subcloned into pGEX-4T3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the GST-hTE fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (24Bodéus M. Cardine A.-M. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured at 22 °C in a spectrophotometric assay (25Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Google Scholar) using recombinant hTE (rhTE) protein prepared from GST-hTE fusion cleaved by thrombin (24Bodéus M. Cardine A.-M. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Google Scholar). The purifiedE. coli TE II (gift from S. Smith) was used as a control. Incubation mixtures contained various amounts of rhTE in 0.05m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 7 different concentrations (between 2 and 80 μm) of acyl-CoA (either C6-CoA, C8-CoA, C10-CoA, C12-CoA, C14-CoA, C16-CoA, C18-CoA, or C20-CoA; Sigma), as substrate. The reactions were monitored spectrophotometrically by recording absorbance at 412 nm. A unit of activity is the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 nmol of substrate/min. The GST-hTE fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and immobilized on GSH-agarose beads (24Bodéus M. Cardine A.-M. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Google Scholar). Purified recombinant Nef (rNef) was prepared from GST-Nef cleaved by thrombin (24Bodéus M. Cardine A.-M. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Google Scholar). 14 μg of GST-hTE or GST immobilized on GSH-agarose beads were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, with 10 μg of rNef in TENGN buffer (24Bodéus M. Cardine A.-M. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Google Scholar). The beads were washed three times with TENGN buffer and once with TENG buffer without Nonidet P-40, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. rNef binding was analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-NefLai Abs (gift from E. Bahraoui) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). The amount of bound and unbound rNef was determined by an imaging densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). 15 × 106 CEM cells stably expressing NefLai (26Schwartz O. Rivière Y. Heard J.-M. Danos O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3274-3280Google Scholar) or 15 × 106 CEM cells (control) were lysed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Nef Abs (HIV-1BH10 Nef antiserum obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research Program, see Ref. 27Niederman T.M. Garcia J.V. Hastings W.R. Luria S. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6213-6219Google Scholar) diluted 1:1000. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added, and after extensive washes, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-Nef and purified anti-hTE Abs and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). Specific anti-hTE Abs, raised in rabbits by immunization with a synthetic peptide (Gln-304 to Lys-318 of the hTE open reading frame, see Fig. 2), were affinity purified by adsorption on GST-hTE immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. The Abs were then eluted in glycine HCl, pH 3.0, and neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Thenef gene from the HIV-1Lai isolate was amplified by error-prone polymerase chain reaction according to Ref. 28Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR. 1992; 2: 28-33Google Scholar, using the 3′ primer LexBonR (AATTCGCCCGGAATTAGC) and the 5′ primer GadSeqF (GGATGATGTATATAACTATC) priming into pGBT10. The amplified fragments were double-digested by BamHI and SalI and then cloned into pGBT10 as described (21Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Google Scholar). The E. coli DH5α strain was transformed and about 5 × 104transformants were obtained, representing the complexity of thenef potential mutant library. These transformants were pooled, and the plasmid library was prepared. HF7c yeast strain was cotransformed with the NefLai mutant library and the Gal4AD-hTE hybrid. Plasmids from mutants unable to interact with hTE were rescued and used to retransform the reporter strain with the Gal4AD-β-COP-Cter hybrid (21Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Google Scholar). A NefLai mutant (Nef*4) that did not interact with hTE but did interact with β-COP-Cter was selected and completely sequenced. NefLai and Nef*4 mutant coding sequences were cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), and the resultant plasmids (pcDNA-NefLai and pcDNA-Nef*4) were used for transient expression in P4-2 cells (HeLa cell line expressing the human CD4 molecule) as described previously (15Schwartz O. Maréchal V. Le Gall S. Lemonnier F. Heard J.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 338-342Google Scholar, 29Clavel F. Charneau P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1179-1185Google Scholar). Briefly, P4-2 cells were co-transfected by electroporation (200 V, 960 microfarads, using 4-mm wide cuvettes in a Bio-Rad gene pulser) with 30 μg of pcDNA-NefLai, pcDNA-Nef*4, or pcDNA3 (control). 24 h after transfection, cells were labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (Leu3A; Becton Dickinson) as described previously (15Schwartz O. Maréchal V. Le Gall S. Lemonnier F. Heard J.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 338-342Google Scholar). The surface CD4 was analyzed with a FACScan cytofluorimeter (Becton Dickinson). NefLai and Nef*4 expression were monitored by Western blotting of total lysates of 1 × 106 P4-2-transfected cells. The two-hybrid system was used to identify the cellular proteins interacting with the HIV-1 Nef protein. Two independent overlapping cDNAs with different 5′ ends were isolated. These cDNAs conferred on the yeast reporter strain the ability to grow in the absence of histidine and to express β-galactosidase activity in the presence of the Gal4BD-Nef hybrid (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2) but not with extraneous targets fused to Gal4BD (lanes 3–6). The longer cDNA clone contained a 1153-base pair insert flanked 3′ by a stretch of A residues preceded by a consensus polyadenylation signal 17 base pairs upstream from the poly(A). Northern blot analysis using a probe corresponding to the hTE cDNA revealed a single 1.3-kilobase pair mRNA transcript widely expressed in all human tissues tested (data not shown), indicating that hTE cDNA was close to the full-length mRNA transcript. Starting at the first in frame methionine residue, the cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a 319-amino acid (aa) long protein with a predicted molecular mass of 35.6 kDa. A data base search revealed a 42% identity with the thioesterase II (TE II) coded by the tesB gene from E. coli (25Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Google Scholar), suggesting that this cDNA encodes the human homolog (hTE) of the E. coli TE II (Fig. 2). hTE was also similar to the putative TE II homologs from Caenorhabditis elegans, Hemophilus influenzae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (37, 36, and 24% identity, respectively). hTE has no significant homology with either of the two types of animal thioesterases that have been cloned (30Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Google Scholar), indicating that it encodes a new type of eucaryotic thioesterase. In particular, neither the Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly nor the Gly-Xaa-His motifs conserved in the active site of type I and type II animal thioesterases of the classical serine esterase enzymes are found in hTE or the E. coli enzyme. By contrast, the His-58 residue of the E. coli TE II, which is suspected to be part of the active site of the enzyme (25Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Google Scholar), is conserved in the human sequence at position 78, together with the adjacent residues Val-77 and Ser-79 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, a search in the Prosite data base revealed a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (Ser-Lys-Leu) in the last three residues of hTE (see Fig. 2), suggesting that this novel thioesterase enzyme is imported in peroxisomes (31De Hoop M.J. Ab G. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 657-669Google Scholar). To confirm that hTE cDNA encoded a thioesterase enzyme, a spectrophotometric assay was performed using fatty acyl-CoA as substrates and recombinant hTE (rhTE) obtained from thrombin cleavage of GST-hTE fusion protein. The rhTE catalyzed the hydrolysis of the decanoyl-CoA thioester bond (Fig. 3 A). The kinetic properties of rhTE obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with this substrate. Vmax and Km values were calculated by fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The values found (Vmax, 7.1 μmol/min/mg andKm, 10.1 μm) were of the same order as those obtained with the purified E. coli TE II (32Barnes E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 102-109Google Scholar) used as control in this assay (data not shown). The fatty acyl chain length specificity was determined by measuring the enzymatic activity of rhTE with a panel of acyl-CoA substrates and comparing them to the specific activity obtained with decanoyl-CoA (Fig. 3 B). Clearly, rhTE showed a preference for acyl-CoAs with medium chain length of C10 to C14, with maximal activity with myristoyl-CoA (C14). The enzyme was less active with C6-, C8-, and C16-CoA, and no activity was detected with C18- or C20-CoA as substrates. These results indicate that hTE has, like the E. coli TE II, a relatively broad acyl chain length specificity that extends to medium chain lengths. The influence of Nef on the activity of rhTE in vitro was tested, but there was no evidence for any significant modification of the enzymatic activity (data not shown). The interaction between Nef and hTE was confirmed in vitro using recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 A, rNef bound specifically to GST-hTE (lane 3) but not to GST (lane 2). Densitometry scanning of the signals obtained in Fig. 4 Aindicated that 47% of rNef used in the reaction was bound to GST-TE (compare lanes 1 and 3). Allowing for the respective quantities of rNef used (10 μg = 3.7 × 10−10 mol) and of GST-hTE (14 μg = 2.2 × 10−10 mol) immobilized on GSH-agarose beads, approximately 80% of GST-hTE seemed complexed with rNef. These in vitrobinding studies demonstrated that Nef and hTE were capable of direct physical interaction independent of any yeast intermediate protein. They also suggest that myristoylation of Nef is not necessary for its association with hTE, since rNef is not myristoylated. hTE and Nef were also associated in CEM T-lymphocyte cells expressing stably HIV-1Lai Nef. The two proteins were co-precipitated from total cell lysates using anti-Nef Abs. When the immunoprecipitates were blotted and probed with purified anti-hTE Abs (Fig. 4 B, upper panel), hTE was detected as a 35-kDa polypeptide only in CEM cells expressing Nef (lane 4) and not in control CEM cells (lane 3). The specific reactivity of the 35-kDa band detected with anti-hTE Abs was demonstrated by its disappearance when Abs were incubated with the peptide used for immunization prior to the Western blot analysis (not shown). The blot was subsequently probed with anti-Nef Abs to check that Nef was indeed co-precipitated with hTE from CEMNef cells (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). Therefore, these results confirm that the Nef-hTE interaction is direct and requires no additional viral proteins. They provide strong evidence that Nef interacts physically with hTE in a specific manner within human T-lymphocyte cells expressing Nef. To determine whether interaction with hTE could influence one of the known activities of Nef, we studied the interaction of hTE with Nef proteins from several HIV-1 isolates. NefA01 and NefE01 are proteins from primary isolates that are as efficient as NefLai in promoting CD4 down-regulation (26Schwartz O. Rivière Y. Heard J.-M. Danos O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3274-3280Google Scholar). By contrast, Nef proteins from the HXB3 laboratory strain and from another primary isolate (NefD01) are unable to down-regulate CD4 despite expression levels comparable to NefLai (16Skowronski J. Parks D. Mariani R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 703-713Google Scholar). 2O. Schwartz, unpublished results. These four Nef proteins were fused to the Gal4BD and expressed in yeast. Their interaction with Gal4AD-hTE was measured by a two-hybrid quantitative β-galactosidase assay. All of these Gal4BD fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels, as judged by Western blot analysis on yeast extracts (not shown). The results of these experiments are summarized in Table I. NefA01 and NefE01 interacted strongly with hTE and induced more β-galactosidase activity than the NefLai protein, indicating that interaction with hTE is a general property of HIV-1 Nef alleles. By contrast, NefHXB3 interacted very poorly with hTE, with less than 10% of the β-galactosidase activity (9.6 units) obtained with the NefLai protein (122.5 units), whereas NefD01 did not interact at all with hTE, giving a β-galactosidase activity (1.9 units) equivalent to the background (2.8 units). These results suggest that there is a striking correlation between the ability of Nef alleles to induce CD4 down-regulation and to interact with hTE.Table IHuman thioesterase-binding and CD4 down-regulation activity of HIV-1 Nef allelesNef alleleβ-Gal unitsaNef alleles fused to the Gal4BD were analyzed for interaction with GalAD-hTE hybrid by quantitative β-galactosidase (β-Gal) two-hybrid assay.

Virol. 1993; 67: 3274-3280Google Scholar)) except for NefD012 and Nef*4 mutant (this study; see Fig.5 B). Open table in a new tab We checked this correlation by selecting a NefLai mutant (Nef*4) that did not interact with hTE (Fig. 5 A, lane 1) but still interacted with β-COP-Cter (lane 2) (21Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Google Scholar) by two-hybrid screening of a Nef random mutant library. NefLai used as a control interacted both with hTE and β-COP-Cter (lanes 3and 4). A quantitative two-hybrid assay showed that Nef*4 did not interact at all with hTE giving rise to a β-galactosidase activity lower than the background (Table I). The interaction of this mutant with β-COP-Cter (Fig. 5 A, lane 2) indicated that it was stably expressed in yeast, as confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). DNA sequence analysis revealed that Nef*4 contained six different point mutations, giving rise to 5 aa changes in the NefLai protein sequence, at positions W57R, F68S, D123G, H166R, and L170Q. This Nef*4 mutant was tested to see if it retained the ability to induce CD4 down-regulation by transient expression in P4-2 cells, a HeLa cell line stably expressing CD4 (29Clavel F. Charneau P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1179-1185Google Scholar). Transfected cells were stained with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry for CD4 cell-surface expression. While the NefLai parental protein strongly down-regulated CD4, cells expressing the Nef*4 mutant had surface levels of CD4 equivalent to those of cells transfected with the control vector (Fig. 5 B). Western blotting with anti-Nef antibodies was then used to check that the defect of Nef*4 in CD4 down-regulation activity was not due to a defect in protein expression. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the amount of Nef*4 produced (lane 1) was similar than that of NefLai (lane 2). These results clearly indicated that the Nef*4 mutant was completely unable to induce CD4 down-regulation and confirmed the correlation between the ability of Nef proteins to interact with hTE and to down-regulate the CD4 cell-surface expression. These results provide three lines of evidence that HIV-1 Nef interacts directly with a new thioesterase enzyme. First, Nef interacts specifically with hTE in the yeast two-hybrid system; second, Nef binds to hTE in vitro; and third, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Nef and hTE are physically associated in Nef-expressing cells. We also find a correlation between the capacity of Nef alleles to interact with hTE and their ability to induce CD4 down-regulation. Two HIV-1 Nef alleles (NefHXB3 and NefD01) that were unable to down-regulate the cell-surface expression of CD4 were also unable to interact with hTE. In contrast, the HIV-1 Nef proteins from HIV-1Lai or from primary isolates (NefA01 and NefE01), which can down-regulate the cell-surface expression of CD4, still interact with hTE. These results strongly suggest that the physical interaction between Nef proteins and hTE is required for Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation. In addition, we have isolated a Nef mutant from the Lai isolate (Nef*4) that does not interact with hTE and is also completely unable to down-regulate CD4. The aa mutations found in the Nef*4 mutant (W57R, F68S, D123G, H166R, and L170Q) are required for the loss of interaction with hTE, but these mutations suppressed Nef-CD4 down-regulation activity without affecting the stability of the protein. The Trp residue in position 57, corresponding to the potential cleavage site of Nef by the HIV-1 protease (33Welker R.H. Kottler H. Kalbitzer H.R. Kräusslich H.-G. Virology. 1996; 219: 228-236Google Scholar, 34Pandori M.W. Fitch N.J.S. Craig H.M. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Guatelli J.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4283-4290Google Scholar), probably does not play an essential role since the first 57 N-terminal aa of Nef are not necessary for binding to hTE. By contrast, deletion of the 17 C-terminal residues completely disrupts the Nef-hTE interaction (data not shown). These results are in agreement with recent observations indicating that mutations in the C-terminal region of Nef had more deleterious effects on CD4 down-regulation activity that those in the N-terminal region (35Aiken C. Krause L. Chen Y.-L. Trono D. Virology. 1996; 217: 293-300Google Scholar). The elucidated conformational structure of Nef (37Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.-S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 340-345Google Scholar, 38Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Google Scholar) should allow the more precise definitions of the structural domain(s) involved in Nef activities. It will be interesting to compare the structures of Nef alleles that down-regulate CD4 with those of Nef proteins unable to do so. Likewise the E. coli TE II, hTE has no sequence similarity with the previously reported animal thioesterases known to be involved in the chain termination step of fatty acid synthesis (30Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Google Scholar); the type I enzymes that cleave long chain fatty acyl-CoAs and the type II enzymes that are more active on medium chain length acyl-CoAs. In addition, no similarity was found with the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (39Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Google Scholar). All these thioesterases are, like the E. coli TE I, serine esterases. Therefore, hTE is probably the prototype of a new subfamily of eucaryotic thioesterases. The presence of a SKL C-terminal motif for targeting proteins in peroxisomes suggests that hTE is a peroxisomal enzyme. Related motifs are also found in hTE homologs from C. elegans and S. cerevisiae but not in the mammalian thioesterases reported so far (40Hwang C.-S. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14278-14284Google Scholar), although thioesterase activity was previously detected in peroxisomes from rat cells (41Berge R.K. Flatmark T. Osmundsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 637-644Google Scholar). The physiological roles of hTE and its E. coli TE II counterpart are presently unknown. The two enzymes can hydrolyze thioester bonds of fatty acyl-CoAs in vitro and have a relatively broad acyl chain length specificity. Like the E. coli TE II that functions as an homotetramer (25Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Google Scholar), hTE is able to interact with itself in two-hybrid assay (not shown). Thus, hTE probably functions also as a tetramer suggesting a conserved catalytic mechanism between the two enzymes. The specific cellular substrate(s) of hTE must be identified to elucidate the physiological role of the enzyme. Nef is a cytoplasmic protein targeted to the inner face of the plasma membrane by myristoylation. This membrane anchor motif is strictly required for its biological functions. The CD4 molecule that is down-regulated by Nef as well as its associated tyrosine kinase p56lck are palmitoylated on cysteine residues via a thioester bond (42Crise D. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13593-13597Google Scholar, 43Yurchak L.K. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6914-6922Google Scholar); p56lck, is also myristoylated (43Yurchak L.K. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6914-6922Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that palmitoylation can influence the rate of endocytosis of molecules at the plasma membrane (44Alvarez E. Gironès N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16644-16655Google Scholar, 45Barker P.H. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Google Scholar, 46Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11178-11182Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the efficiency of protein myristoylation is regulated by the size of the cell acyl-CoA pools (see Ref. 47Rudnick D.A. McWherter C.A. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. Adv.

Biol. 1993; 67: 375-430Google Scholar for review). hTE could disturb the acylation of these proteins by regulating the intracellular steady-state level of acyl-CoA and so influence the endocytosis rate of the CD4 receptor. The fatty acylation status of Nef, CD4, and p56lck within T-lymphocyte cells expressing Nef must now be analyzed to assess this hypothesis. Nef can also alter the membrane traffic of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (15Schwartz O. Maréchal V. Le Gall S. Lemonnier F. Heard J.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 338-342Google Scholar), suggesting that it has specific effects on intracellular transport pathways. It seems possible that hTE is involved in this process since it has been demonstrated that hydrolysis of long chain fatty acyl-CoA is required for correct budding of COP-I-coated vesicles (see Ref. 48Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar for review). The assembly of coated buds on the membranes requires GTP, the small GTP-binding protein ARF, and COP-I proteins, including β-COP, another Nef-interacting protein (21Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Google Scholar). In the absence of acyl-CoA, buds accumulate, and coated vesicles failed to pinch off. In addition, the formation of coated vesicles and transport are blocked by a non-hydrolyzable analogue of palmitoyl-CoA (48Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar), indicating that hydrolysis of long chain fatty acyl-CoA is required for efficient intracellular traffic. Since hTE is able to hydrolyze palmitoyl-CoA, it may be involved in this process. Several other Nef-interacting proteins, including the Src-related protein tyrosine kinases p60hck and p56lck (19Colette Y. Dutartre H. Benziane A. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. Harris M. Olive D. J.

However, the multiple independent activities of Nef are compatible with the existence of several cellular partners (13Goldsmith M.A. Warmerdam M.T. Atchison R. Miller M.D. Greene W.C. J.

Although experiments are still in progress to determine whether the Nef-β-COP interaction is required for some Nef functions, the Nef-p60hckinteraction seems to be involved in the Nef enhancement of virus infectivity (13Goldsmith M.A. Warmerdam M.T. Atchison R. Miller M.D. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4112-4121Google Scholar, 49Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D.

None of these cellular proteins seems to be involved in the Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation (13Goldsmith M.A. Warmerdam M.T. Atchison R. Miller M.D. Greene W.C. J.

In conclusion, we have identified a human thioesterase enzyme that interacts specifically with the HIV-1 Nef protein. This thioesterase represents probably the prototype of a new subfamily of eucaryotic thioesterases characterized by similarity with TE II from E. coli. Additional evidence is needed to demonstrate the physiological relevance of this interaction in vivo. Nevertheless, the correlation between the ability of Nef to interact with hTE and to mediate CD4 down-regulation from the cell surface suggests that hTE is a cellular mediator of Nef function in HIV-1-infected cells.

https://openalex.org/W1997963958,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family, mediates the cellular uptake of a diversity of ligands. A folding chaperone, the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) that resides in the early compartments of the secretory pathway inhibits the binding of all ligands to the receptor and may serve to prevent premature binding of ligands to the receptor during the trafficking to the cell surface. To elucidate the molecular interactions that underlie the interplay between the receptor, RAP, and the ligands, we have analyzed and delineated the binding sites of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)·PAI-1 complexes, RAP, and the anti-LRP Fab fragment Fab A8. To that end, we have generated a series of soluble recombinant fragments spanning the second cluster of complement-type repeats (C3-C10) and the amino-terminal flanking epidermal growth factor repeat (E4) of LRP (E4-C10; amino acids 787–1165). All fragments were expressed by stably transfected baby hamster kidney cells and purified by affinity chromatography. A detailed study of ligand binding to the fragments using surface plasmon resonance revealed the presence of three distinct, Ca2+-dependent ligand binding sites in the cluster II domain (Cl-II) of LRP. t-PA·PAI-1 complexes as well as PAI-1 bind to a domain located in the amino-terminal portion of Cl-II, spanning repeats E4-C3-C7. Adjacent to this site and partially overlapping is a high affinity RAP-binding site located on repeats C5-C7. Fab A8, a pseudo-ligand of the receptor, binds to a third Ca2+-dependent binding site on repeats C8-C10 at the carboxyl-terminal end of Cl-II. Next, we studied the RAP-mediated inhibition of ligand binding to LRP and to Cl-II. As expected, we observed a strong inhibition of t-PA·PAI-1 complex and Fab A8 binding to LRP by RAP (IC50 ≅ 0.3 nm), whereas in the reverse experiment, competition of t-PA·PAI-1 complexes and Fab A8 for RAP binding to LRP could only be shown at high concentrations of competitors (≥1 μm). Interestingly, even though the equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of RAP to LRP and to Cl-II are similar, the binding of the ligands to Cl-II is only prevented by RAP at concentrations that are at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than those required for inhibition of ligand binding to LRP. Our results favor models that propose RAP-induced allosteric inhibition of ligand binding to LRP that may require LRP moieties that are located outside Cl-II of the receptor.

Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Google Scholar, 2Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 197-213Google Scholar, 3Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Williams S.E. Argraves W.S. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 204-215Google Scholar). LRP binds and internalizes a broad spectrum of structurally unrelated ligands including two important components of the fibrinolytic system, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its specific inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) (4Orth K. Madison E.L. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7422-7426Google Scholar, 5Bu G. Williams S.E. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7427-7431Google Scholar). In rodents, LRP was shown to be one of the in vivo receptor systems involved in the clearance of t-PA (6Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 937-944Google Scholar, 7Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Google Scholar). LRP is synthesized as a 600-kDa precursor protein that is subsequently processed in the trans-Golgi compartment to a 515-kDa α-chain and a 85-kDa β-chain. Both chains remain associated in an unusual noncovalent fashion (8Willnow T.E. Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Moehring T.J. Herz J. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 71-76Google Scholar). Ligand binding by the receptor is thought to be mediated by the so-called complement-type repeats. These 40-residue-long repeats are characterized by a highly conserved spacing pattern of six cysteine residues, and they are found in all other members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Google Scholar). In the low density lipoprotein receptor, these complement-type repeats were shown to mediate ligand binding (9Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Google Scholar, 10Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Google Scholar). The α-chain of LRP contains four potential ligand-binding domains assembled as sequential series of 2, 8, 10, and 11 complement-type repeats (cluster I, II, III, and IV). The first evidence for a role of the cluster II domain (Cl-II) in ligand binding was presented by Moestrup et al., who demonstrated the binding of α2-macroglobulin-complexes, urokinase-type plasminogen activator· PAI-1 complexes, and receptor-associated protein (RAP) to a 75-kDa CNBr-generated LRP fragment, spanning Cl-II, on a ligand blot (11Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Nykjær A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Google Scholar). Using a recombinant DNA approach, Willnow et al. expressed LRP minireceptors and showed t-PA·PAI-1 complex and RAP binding to Cl-II and a low affinity binding of RAP to a truncated receptor harboring the cluster IV domain (12Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Google Scholar). In a previous study, we provided evidence for an additional ligand binding site in Cl-II by the selection of a high affinity Cl-II-binding Fab fragment (Fab A8) that bound the receptor in a Ca2+-dependent fashion and completely inhibited the binding of pro-urokinase to LRP (13Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M.M. Pannekoek H. Nielsen M.S. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11770-11775Google Scholar). The 39-kDa folding chaperone RAP is a molecule with a high affinity for LRP that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and thecis-Golgi compartments (14Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Scopus (268) Google Scholar). RAP inhibits the binding of all known ligands to LRP, and it has been proposed that this activity may serve to prevent premature binding of ligands to the receptor during the maturation and trafficking of LRP (14Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism by which RAP inhibits the binding of the diversity of structurally unrelated ligands. One model assumes a close spatial association of a RAP binding site to each of the independent LRP ligand-binding sites (16Iadonato S.P. Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 867-875Google Scholar, 17Bu G. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 3427-3436Google Scholar). Consequently, RAP would inhibit ligand binding by steric hindrance of each of the LRP ligands. An alternative model for the regulation of ligand binding by RAP proposes a RAP-induced conformational change in the LRP molecule (18Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Google Scholar). A unique feature of RAP is its repeated triplicate structure, endowing the protein with three potential LRP-binding sites as determined by cross-linking studies (14Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Binding studies performed with amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments of RAP have indicated that at least two high affinity LRP binding sites are present in RAP (19Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3325-3330Google Scholar). The presence of RAP-binding sites in the different clusters of LRP (11Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Nykjær A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Google Scholar, 12Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Google Scholar, 20Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Google Scholar), as well as the presence of multiple receptor-binding sites in RAP, may support a model in which RAP binds to different clusters synchronically, thereby inducing a conformational change in LRP that would be incompatible with ligand binding. Such a model would imply that competition by RAP for ligand binding is not on the level of the individual clusters but requires the intact LRP molecule. In this study, we have performed a detailed analysis of ligand-binding sites in the cluster II domain of the receptor. Using recombinant fragments spanning Cl-II, we demonstrate that Cl-II contains three distinct binding sites for t-PA·PAI-1 complexes, RAP, and the pseudo-ligand Fab A8. In addition, we provide evidence for an allosteric component in RAP-mediated inhibition of ligand binding to LRP. Oligonucleotides were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.

Moestrup (Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark). Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-fused RAP was kindly provided by Dr. J. Kuiper (Sylvius Laboratory, University of Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands). Two-chain t-PA was from Biopool (Umea, Sweden) and recombinant t-PA (Actilyse) was from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim/Rhein, Germany). Active PAI-1 purification procedures were essentially as described (21Sancho E. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Google Scholar,22Van Meijer M. Roelofs Y.

Recombinant t-PA was incubated with an excess of PAI-1 for 2 h at 37 °C. Complexed t-PA was then separated from the excess of unreacted PAI-1 by affinity chromatography using lysine-Sepharose. Complexes bound to the lysine-Sepharose were washed with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.001% (v/v) Tween 80 (HBST) followed by washings with HBST containing 500 mm NaCl and subsequent elutions with HBST containing 1 m NaCl and 0.2m ε-aminocaproic acid. Preparations were concentrated 20-fold by centrifugation in a Sorvall high speed centrifuge at 7,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C using Centricon 30 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and subsequently dialyzed against filtered (0.45-μm filters, Schleicher & Schuell) and degassed, modified HBST buffer (containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.001% (v/v) Tween 80). Preparations revealed a single protein band on a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were stored at −20 °C until use. Isolation of the monoclonal Fab fragment Fab A8 as well as the isolation of the anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibody CAg69 were essentially as described (13Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M.M.

The BIAcore™2000 biosensor system and reagents, including an amine-coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide, ethanolamine hydrochloride, and CM5 sensor chips (research grade), were from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Plasmids encoding recombinant LRP Cl-II fragments (Cl-II, amino acids 786–1165; Cl-II-1, amino acids 786–914; Cl-II-2, amino acids 915–1034; and Cl-II-3, amino acids 1041–1165; numbering according to Herz et al. (24Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Google Scholar)) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a plasmid clone containing the human LRP cDNA (a gift from Dr. J. Herz, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) as a template. DNAs encoding recombinant-LRP cluster II fragments were amplified using primers LRP 3 (5′-GGACTCGAGAACAAATGCCGGGTGAAC-3′) and LRP 8 (5′-AACTAGTCTGGTCGCAGAGCTCGCC-3′); LRP3 and LRP4 (5′-GACTAGTGGCTGAACAAGTGGCATT-3′); LRP5 (5′-TTACTCGAGCGCACCTGCCCCCCCAAC-3′) and LRP 6 (5′-AACTAGTGTTGGTGCAGTTGGCGTG-3′); and LRP 7 (5′-TTACTCGAGGGTGGCTGCCACACTGAT-3′) and LRP8 for LRP Cl-II fragments Cl-II, Cl-II-1, Cl-II-2, and Cl-II-3, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with XhoI andSpeI and subsequently cloned into theHindIII/XbaI-digested plasmid pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, La Jolla, California) together with a 192-base pairHindIII/XhoI fragment, encoding the entire signal and pro-sequences of t-PA (amino acids −35 to 1) (25Ny T. Elgh F. Lund B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5355-5359Google Scholar) followed by a 16-amino acid tag (KKEDFDIYDEDENQSP) that contains the antigenic determinant of the mAb CAg69 (26Leyte A. Verbeet M.P. Brodniewiecz-Proba T. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 679-683Google Scholar). Subsequently, DNA preparations encoding Cl-II fragments were obtained from the pRc/CMV constructs using HindIII and BclII, blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase, and cloned into the SmaI site of vector pZEM229R (27Meijers J.C.M. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4680-4684Google Scholar) to yield expression plasmids encoding LRP Cl-II fragments Cl-II, Cl-II-1, Cl-II-2, and Cl-II-3. Expression plasmids encoding Cl-II-1/2 and Cl-II-2/3 were obtained by digestion of expression plasmids coding for Cl-II and Cl-II-2 using either HindIII andAflIII or AflIII and BclII combinations and ligating the proper DNA fragments. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis using an ALF express automated DNA sequencer (Pharmacia). Baby hamster kidney cells (thymidine kinase-deficient BHK-570 cells, ATCC CRL 10314) were grown to subconfluency (80%) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/ml fungizone. Cells were transfected with 20 μg of DNA using the calcium precipitation method, essentially as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA-calcium-phosphate coprecipitates were added, and after 5 h the cells were incubated for 1 min with 15% (v/v) glycerol. Cells were allowed to recover in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12 h and subsequently cultured for 12 days on selective medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 1 μm methotrexate (amethopterin; Sigma)). Individual colonies were isolated and tested for the expression of recombinant LRP cluster II fragments by ELISAs using mAb CAg69, or a polyclonal antibody directed to LRP (a gift from Dr. S. K. Moestrup). Cl-II producing clones were grown to subconfluency (80%) in 500 cm2 flasks (NUNC, Kamstrup, Denmark). Next, the cells were cultured for several days in Optimem medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and conditioned media were harvested every 24 h. Cl-II fragments were purified from the conditioned media by affinity chromatography using Sepharose-coupled mAb CAg69. After binding, columns were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) and eluted with HBS containing 1 mNaCl. If required, another affinity chromatography purification step was included using either RAP- or Fab A8-Sepharose columns. These columns were washed with HBS and eluted with HBS containing 10 mm EDTA. Cl-II preparations were concentrated in a HEPES-buffered 1 m NaCl solution by centrifugation in a Sorvall high speed centrifuge at 7,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, using Centricon 10 or 30 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and dialyzed against filtered and degassed, modified HBST buffer (containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 80). All Cl-II fragment preparations were analyzed by ELISA, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting with mAb CAg69 and anti-LRP antibodies. Cl-II fragments were analyzed by a nonreducing silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12% (w/v) polyacrylamide). To assess the contribution of N-linked glycosylation to the observed migration of the fragments, the Cl-II fragment preparations were treated with glycanase (N-glycosidase F, Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, the protein samples were incubated for 30 min at 45 °C in 0.4% (w/v) SDS-containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8). Subsequently, the preparations were diluted 1:1 with 2% Triton X-100 and incubated with 0.1 unit of glycanase for 2 h at 37 °C. Treated samples were reduced and analyzed on a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The tag-binding mAb (CAg69) was immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip, using the amine-coupling kit following the instructions of the supplier at a high density of approximately 50 fmol/mm2 to determine binding of the samples under conditions of mass-transport limitation. A control channel on the sensor chip was activated and blocked using amine-coupling reagents without immobilization of protein. The binding of protein preparations to this noncoated channel was subtracted from specific binding. To calibrate the system, standard Cl-II fragment preparations with known concentrations (BCA kit, Pierce), were passed over the sensor chip at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, using HBST as running buffer. Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was performed with 100 mm H3PO4. For each concentration, the slope of the binding curve was determined by linear fitting using the BIAevaluation software (Biacore AB). Using the BIAconcentration evaluation software, the system was calibrated to determine unknown Cl-II fragment concentrations. Purified human LRP was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling at a low density of 6.7 fmol/mm2. Using modified HBST as running buffer, RAP and Fab A8 were passed over three separate channels with immobilized LRP and one control (nonimmobilized) channel at 25 °C at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Each determination was performed at least in triplicate at different concentrations (n = 4) in the appropriate concentration range (around Kd values). RAP/LRP interaction constants were determined by performing fittings according to a double site model (a single site model did not appropriately describe the interaction) according to the following equation: Rt=Req1(1−e−ks1t)+Req2(1−e−ks2t)Equation 1 where Rt is the measured response at timet (t is the elapsed time t −t0), Req1 andReq2 are the responses at equilibrium for the first and second interaction, ks1 andks2 are the observed rate constant for the first and the second interaction. The kon values are subsequently derived from secondary graphs of ksvalues plotted against the concentration (C). Thekon values are represented by the slopes of the linear curves described by the following equations: ks1=kon1·C+koff1Equation 2 ks2=kon2·C+koff2Equation 3 The dissociation phase of the curve was fitted according to the following equation: Rt=R1·e−koff1t+(R0−R1)·e−koff2tEquation 4 where Rt is the measured response at timet, R0 is the maximal response att0 of the dissociation phase,R1 and R0 −R1 represents maximal binding responses to receptor sites 1 and 2, respectively, and koff1and koff2 are dissociation rate constants for the binding sites 1 and 2, respectively. A single site model was used to describe all other interactions; the mathematical description of this model is derived from that of the two-site model (in the case of a single site model ks2 = 0). Recombinant Cl-II fragment-ligand interactions were measured as follows: RAP, purified t-PA·PAI-1 complexes, PAI-1, and Fab A8 were immobilized to the sensor chip at low densities (approximately 15–30 fmol/mm2). Measurements were performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Six different analyses were performed at least at four different concentrations. Kinetic constants were obtained by fitting to single site models (describing the interaction appropriately, as judged from residual plots and statistical parameters) and calculated as indicated above. The data were validated by subjecting them to the tests of selfconsistency (29Schuck P. Minton A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 458-460Google Scholar). ELISAs were performed at half-maximal saturating concentrations of ligands versus immobilized LRP or Cl-II. To determine half-maximal saturating concentrations, 50 ng of LRP or 160 ng of Cl-II was immobilized to 96-well plates for 30 min at 37 °C. Wells were blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated with a range of ligand concentrations in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST). Bound proteins were detected using either biotinylated anti-PAI-1 mAb CLB 2C8, biotinylated rat anti-mouse kappa light chain mAb (CLB products, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), or goat anti-glutathione S-transferase polyclonal antibodies (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for t-PA·PAI-1 complexes, Fab A8, and glutathione S-transferase-RAP, respectively. Staining was performed as described (13Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M.M. Pannekoek H. Nielsen M.S. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11770-11775Google Scholar). Competitive ELISAs were subsequently performed under identical conditions, and experiments were performed in triplicate. In a previous study, we confirmed and extended the evidence for the importance of Cl-II for ligand binding by the isolation and analysis of a “phage display” derived Fab fragment (Fab A8) (13Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M.M. Pannekoek H. Nielsen M.S. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11770-11775Google Scholar). This Fab fragment behaves like a pseudo-ligand because it binds LRP in a Ca2+-dependent fashion and its binding is completely inhibited by RAP. Using this Fab fragment, we provided evidence for a binding site for pro-urokinase in Cl-II, distinct from the binding sites for α2-macroglobulin and t-PA·PAI-1 complexes. To investigate ligand binding by Cl-II in more detail, we have expressed a series of soluble recombinant cluster II fragments (Fig. 1) in stably transfected baby hamster kidney cell lines. Each of the fragments is preceded by a t-PA-derived signal pro-sequence for targeting the fragments into the secretory pathway and a tag sequence to facilitate detection and purification. The epidermal growth factor repeat (E4) that precedes Cl-II is included in all fragments corresponding to the amino-terminal end of Cl-II, because this repeat has been postulated to be important for the binding of methylamine activated α2-macroglobulin to LRP (11Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Nykjær A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Google Scholar, 12Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Google Scholar). Purified recombinant fragments were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were stained with silver (Fig.2 A). The mobility of the fragments was somewhat slower than would be expected on the basis of the calculated molecular masses (approximately 15.9, 14.9, 15.4, 28.9, 29.3, and 43.5 kDa for Cl-II-1, Cl-II-2, Cl-II-3, Cl-II-1/2, Cl-II-2/3, and Cl-II, respectively). This observation might be readily explained byN-linked glycosylation of several of the complement-type repeats of Cl-II (20Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Google Scholar). To show that N-linked glycosylation is indeed responsible for the altered mobility of the fragments, we treated the fragments with glycanase (N-glycosidase F) and compared the migration pattern to that of the untreated fragments. As shown in Fig. 2 B, after glycanase treatment Cl-II-2/3 migrates with the mobility of a protein of the expected molecular mass (29.3 kDa). Similar results were obtained for the other recombinant fragments (data not shown), and we conclude that the mobility of the fragments during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is reduced as a result of carbohydrate moieties attached to the fragments byN-linked glycosylation. These results can also explain the observed minor bands (Fig. 2 A), which may represent unglycosylated forms of the respective fragments.Figure 2Purified recombinant cluster II fragments. A, silverstaining of a nonreducing 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The lanes represent the Cl-II fragments as indicated.

First, we determined theKd values for interactions of these ligands with the intact receptor. To that end, LRP was immobilized on a sensor chip and the association and dissociation rate constants were determined by SPR measurements. As shown in Table I, RAP binding to LRP could only be described using a double exponential decay model, indicating the presence of at least two RAP-binding sites on LRP, as reported by Williams and co-workers (30Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar). The two sites haveKd values of 39.4 and 275.0 nm, respectively, which are in good agreement with similar SPR measurements described by Moestrup et al. (high and low affinity sites of 41.7 and 240 nm, respectively) (31Moestrup S.K. Birn H. Fischer P.B. Petersen C.M. Verroust P.J. Sim R.B. Christensen E.I. Nexo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Members of the HFH/winged helix family have been implicated in cell fate determination during pattern formation, in organogenesis, and in cell-type-specific gene expression. In this study we isolated a full-length HFH-3 cDNA clone from a human kidney library which encoded a 351-amino acid protein containing a centrally located winged helix DNA binding domain. We demonstrate that HFH-3 is a potent transcriptional activator requiring 138 C-terminal residues for activity. We used in situ hybridization to demonstrate that HFH-3 expression is restricted to the epithelium of the renal distal convoluted tubules. We determined the HFH-3 DNA binding consensus sequence by in vitro DNA binding site selection using recombinant HFH-3 protein and used this consensus sequence to identify putative HFH-3 target genes expressed there. These putative HFH-3 target genes include the Na/K-ATPase, Na/H and anion exchangers, E-cadherin, and mineralocorticoid receptor genes as well as genes for the transcription factors HNF-1, vHNF-1, and HNF-4.

Deciphering the mechanisms that lead to cell-specific gene transcription is critical for understanding cellular differentiation during mammalian embryogenesis. Differential expression of protein encoding genes occurs at the point of transcriptional initiation (1Derman E. Krauter K. Walling L. Weinberger C. Ray M. Darnell Jr., J. Cell. 1981; 23: 731-739Google Scholar) and involves the assembly of several well characterized basal factors with TATA-binding protein, TATA-binding protein-associated factors, and RNA polymerase II at the initiation site of the promoter region (2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Google Scholar). Promoter and enhancer regions are also composed of multiple DNA sites that interact with sequence-specific transcription factors, which are believed to enhance the recruitment of basal factors to the initiation complex. Cell-restricted gene expression thus relies upon the combinatorial recognition of multiple cis-acting DNA sequences bound by families of cell-specific nuclear factors, which potentiate or repress transcriptional initiation (3Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Google Scholar). Because transcription factors play a central role in regulating cellular differentiation, the analysis of their molecular structure and expression patterns has facilitated elucidation of regulatory pathways involved in establishing tissue-specific gene transcription. In combination with other cell-specific transcription factors, the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3α (HNF-3α) 1The abbreviations used are: HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; HFH, fork head homolog; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus. 1The abbreviations used are: HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; HFH, fork head homolog; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus. and -3β proteins regulate cell-specific transcription in hepatocytes (4Costa R.H.

The HNF-3/fork headhomolog (HFH) proteins are an extensive family of transcription factors that share homology in the winged helix DNA binding domain (10Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Google Scholar). Members of the HFH/winged helix family have been implicated in cell fate determination during embryonic pattern formation, in organogenesis, and in cell-type-specific gene expression. Although the HNF-3α and HNF-3β genes are important for cell-type specific gene regulation, their expression initiates during the primitive streak stage of embryogenesis (11Ang S.L. Wierda A. Wong D. Stevens K.A. Cascio S. Rossant J. Zaret K.S. Development. 1993; 119: 1301-1315Google Scholar, 12Monaghan A.P. Kaestner K.H. Grau E. Schutz G.

Disruption of the HNF-3β gene in homozygous knock-out mice results in an embryonic lethal phenotype, which exhibits defects in the formation of notochord, neurotube, somites, and gut endoderm (14Ang S.-L. Rossant J. Cell. 1994; 78: 561-574Google Scholar, 15Weinstein D.C. Ruiz i Altaba A. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Prezioso V.R. Jessell T.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 575-588Google Scholar). Furthermore, targeted disruption of the winged helix of nude mouse (whn) gene results in the phenotype of the nude mouse mutation (16Nehls M. Kyewski B. Messerle M. Waldschutz R. Schuddekopf K. Smith A.J. Boehm T. Science. 1996; 272: 886-889Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of altered winged helix proteins has also been associated with neoplastic transformations (17Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc.

Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher Jr., F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1522-1535Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that the winged helix protein family plays critical roles in cellular differentiation during embryonic development. The HFH-3 winged helix DNA binding domain was previously isolated from rat kidney cDNA using a PCR protocol with degenerate primers synthesized to conserved sequences within this DNA binding domain (20Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G. Tao W. Qian X. Pani L. Lai E. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3948-3952Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis demonstrates that HFH-3 expression is restricted to the kidney. Subsequent to these studies, the winged helix domain of the human kidney-specific HFH-3 homolog, fork head-related activator-6 (Freac-6), was isolated from a human genomic library (21Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Google Scholar). Here, we report on the complete human HFH-3 cDNA sequence and its deduced amino acid sequence. We show that HFH-3 is a potent transcriptional activator and that expression is restricted to the epithelium of the renal distal tubules. We determined the HFH-3 DNA binding consensus sequence and used this consensus to identify putative target genes expressed there. In situ hybridization of paraffin embedded mouse embryos or adult kidney was performed with33P-labeled antisense RNA probe generated from anEcoRI-linearized rat HFH-3 cDNA (nucleotides 208–517) pGEM-1 template using SP6 RNA polymerase and [33P]UTP (Amersham) as described (22Duncan S.A. Manova K. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Weinstein D.C. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7598-7602Google Scholar). Antisense 33P-labeled HFH-3 RNA probes were hybridized to sectioned dewaxed mouse embryos or adult rat kidneys and rinsed at high stringency followed by autoradiography as described (22Duncan S.A. Manova K. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Weinstein D.C. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7598-7602Google Scholar). A dark field condenser was used to enhance the visualization of the silver grains corresponding to specific HFH-3 hybridization. HFH-3 winged helix DNA binding domain (amino acids 87–208) was fused to the GST protein, and GST-HFH-3 fusion protein was isolated from bacterial cultures and purified to homogeneity via glutathione affinity chromatography (23Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Google Scholar). The affinity-purified GST-HFH-3 fusion protein was used to isolate high affinity HFH-3 binding sites from a pool of partially degenerate oligonucleotides containing 14 degenerate positions by six cycles of repetitive protein selection and PCR amplification as described by Overdier et al. (23Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Google Scholar). The HFH-3 protein-selected sites were cloned in pGEM1, and the DNA insert was labeled during PCR amplification using 5′-labeled T7 and SP6 primers and tested for HFH-3 protein complex formation by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with 60 ng of affinity-purified recombinant GST-HFH-3 protein using methods described previously (23Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Google Scholar). We chose 31 high affinity HFH-3 binding sites from a total of 55 selected DNA sites to determine the HFH-3 consensus sequence. The frequency of occurrence for each nucleotide was used to compile a 13-nucleotide HFH-3 binding consensus sequence (Table I; the 14th nucleotide position was degenerate). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were made to previously described winged helix DNA binding sites (23Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Google Scholar), which conformed to the HFH-3 consensus sequence (e.g. HFH-1 site 25). Radioactively labeled oligonucleotides containing HFH-3 binding sites were used for EMSA with 60 ng of affinity-purified GST-HFH-3 fusion protein and 4 μg of poly(dI·dC-dI·dC) in a 20-μl binding reaction as described previously (23Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Google Scholar). We used the HFH-3 DNA binding consensus sequence to search 12 putative regulatory regions of genes expressed in distal convoluted tubules of the kidney (extracted from GenBank™). Eight of these promoters contained putative HFH-3 binding sites.Table IHFH-3 consensus DNA binding sequenceG45 39 27 58 52 13 13 16A20 12 34 42 48 26 7 55T32 23 27 100 100 100 100 77 58 77 23C3 26 12 23 3 3 6ConsensusaUppercase letter indicates nucleotides which are highly represented in DNA sites.

To determine the HFH-3 transcriptional activity, cotransfection assays were performed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, a cell line that does not express endogenous HFH-3 protein. This cotransfection assay consisted of a reporter plasmid containing four copies of the high affinity HFH-3 binding site (HFH-1 site 25) cloned upstream of a TATA box-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, an expression vector that used the CMV promoter to express the HFH-3 cDNA sequences and a CMV promoter-driven β-galactosidase control plasmid to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency (24Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Google Scholar). The full-length HFH-3 cDNA was cloned as an EcoRI in the CMV expression vector (24Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Google Scholar). HFH-3 cDNA deletions were created by a PCR-mediated strategy using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and primers containing XbaI (3′) orBamHI (5′) restriction sites as described previously (24Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Google Scholar). PCR-generated C-terminal or 3′ HFH-3 cDNA deletions terminated with an XbaI site, and the resultingEcoRI-XbaI fragment (5′ to 3′) was cloned into the CMV expression vector. PCR-generated N-terminal or 5′ HFH-3 cDNA deletions terminated with a BamHI site, and the resulting BamHI-XbaI fragment (5′ to 3′) was cloned in frame with a translational initiation sequence into the CMV expression vector. Internal deletions were made by cloning PCR-generated C-terminal HFH-3 XbaI fragments (247–351, 213–351) in frame with HFH-3 C-terminal deletion sequences (1–208, 1–246). The boundaries of the HFH-3 deletion constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were maintained in monolayer cultures and transfected (25Qian X. Samadani U. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1364-1376Google Scholar) using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's protocol (35 mm plates, 400 ng of CMV-HFH-3 expression vector, 1600 ng of 4 × HFH-1 site 25 CAT reporter, 100 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase construct, and 10 μl of Lipofectin). Cellular protein extracts were prepared from transfected cells 48 h after transfection and analyzed for CAT, and β-galactosidase enzyme activity was determined as described previously (25Qian X. Samadani U. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1364-1376Google Scholar). To determine the expression of HFH-3 deletion mutants during cotransfection experiments, nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells transfected with the HFH-3 cDNA constructs and analyzed by EMSA as described previously (24Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Google Scholar). The rat HFH-3 winged helix DNA binding domain was used as a probe to screen a human cDNA library propagated in λgt11 phage. The HFH-3 cDNA clone consists of 2089 nucleotides and contains an open reading frame between nucleotides 79 and 1131 encoding a 351-amino acid polypeptide (the complete HFH-3 cDNA sequence has been appended to GenBank accession number L13203; Fig.1 a). Allowing for a 200-nucleotide poly(A) tail, the HFH-3 cDNA sequence represents a full-length cDNA clone because the human HFH-3/Freac-6 mRNA size is 2.3 kilobase pairs as evidenced by Northern blot analysis (21Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Google Scholar). The HFH-3 winged helix DNA binding domain exhibits 56% amino acid identity compared with the first identified winged helix family member HNF-3α (26Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Google Scholar, 27Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Google Scholar). Included in the amino acid alignment figure are other winged helix proteins, which are expressed in the developing and/or adult kidney. However, the HFH-3 protein does not exhibit sequence similarity outside of the winged helix DNA binding motif with other transcriptional activation domains shared with members of the winged helix family (5Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G. Peterson R.S. Porcella A. Ye H. Paulson E.K. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 195-209Google Scholar,24Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 957-966Google Scholar). To determine the HFH-3 cellular expression patterns, we performed in situ hybridization of paraffin embedded sections of a 16-day post coitum mouse embryos or adult kidney with a33P-labeled antisense HFH-3 RNA probe (Fig.2). After hybridization, stringent washes, and autoradiography, dark field microscopy was used to visualize HFH-3-expressing cells in the tissues. Shown is a paraffin section of the 16-day post coitum embryonic kidney, demonstrating that the HFH-3 gene was expressed in the epithelium of the convoluted tubules (Fig.2 a). HFH-3 expression continued in the tubule epithelium located in both cortex and medulla of the adult kidney (Fig.2 b). Magnification of the renal cortex demonstrates that HFH-3 was expressed in the distal convoluted tubules but not in the proximal convoluted tubules or in the glomeruli within the renal corpuscles (Fig. 2, c and d). Because the morphology of the distal straight and convoluted tubules is indistinguishable, we are not able to rule out the possibility that HFH-3 is expressed in the distal ascending straight tubules. HFH-3 expression was not detected in the medullary ray, which is devoid of glomeruli and contains the collecting ducts (Fig. 2 b). HFH-3 hybridization signals were not detected in the descending straight tubules, which are the continuation of the proximal convoluted tubules or in the loops of Henle (data not shown). To identify putative target genes expressed in distal tubule epithelium of the kidney, we determined the HFH-3 DNA binding consensus sequence using repetitive protein selection and PCR amplification as described (23Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Google Scholar). The HFH-3 protein-selected sites were cloned, radioactively labeled, and tested for HFH-3 protein-DNA complex formation by EMSA. Those sites that exhibited high binding affinity for the HFH-3 protein were chosen for DNA sequence determination and were compared with determine the percent occurrence for each nucleotide position (TableI). This comparison allowed us to compile the HFH-3 binding consensus sequence (Table I). The HFH-3 consensus binding sequence is DBDTRTTTAYDTR (where D is not C, B is not A, R is A or G, and Y is C or T). DNA binding assays with sites containing either TTRTTTRT (HFH-1 site 25) or the TTGTTGTT (HFH-2 site 7) core sequences that adhered to the HFH-3 consensus formed complexes with recombinant HFH-3 protein in EMSA (Fig. 3, sites 1 and2; data not shown). By contrast, weak or no HFH-3 binding activity was exhibited by DNA sites that deviated from the HFH-3 consensus (Fig. 4, sequences 3–5).Figure 4Identification of HFH-3 transcriptional activation protein motifs. Schematically shown is the position of the winged helix DNA binding domain and activation domain determined in these studies (stippled box). Summarized in the bar graph is the transcriptional activity of the HFH-3 protein deletions assayed in HepG2 cell cotransfection assays with the 4 × HFH-1 site 25 CAT reporter construct (see Fig. 3). Data are presented as percent of wild-type activity, and error bars (white) represent standard deviation from three separate experiments. Thestippled box represents the HFH-3 transcriptional activation motif defined in the experiments described in this figure. Approximately equal amounts of HFH-3 protein are expressed in each transfection as evidenced by EMSA (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the HFH-3 transcriptional activation domain(s), we used cotransfection assays (24Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Google Scholar, 29Qian X. Costa R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1184-1191Google Scholar) to compare the activation levels between wild-type and truncated HFH-3 proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). To avoid complications with endogenous HFH-3 protein, we chose the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line that does not express HFH-3 to perform the cotransfection assays and monitored HFH-3 protein expression via EMSA with nuclear extracts (data not shown). None of the deletion constructs disrupted the winged helix DNA binding domain, which is sufficient to direct nuclear localization (29Qian X. Costa R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1184-1191Google Scholar). Cotransfection assays with the full-length HFH-3 cDNA expression plasmid provided an approximately 40–60-fold increase in reporter gene transcription compared with the CMV control plasmid (Fig. 4,constructs 1 and 2). This activation was dependent on retention of the HFH-3 recognition sequence in the reporter construct (data not shown). Removal of the first 86 N-terminal residues from the HFH-3 protein did not reduce transcriptional activity (Fig. 4, construct 3), but deletion of only 38 C-terminal residues resulted in a 50% decrease in HFH-3 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4, construct 4). Further C-terminal deletions eliminated detectable HFH-3 transcriptional activation (Fig. 4,constructs 5 and 6). Internal deletions were created using an XbaI site at the ends of the C-terminal deletions. A 50% reduction in transcriptional activity was observed when an XbaI linker was inserted between amino acid residues 246 and 247 of the HFH-3 protein (Fig. 4, construct 7). An internal deletion that removed amino acid residues 209–246 of the HFH-3 protein eliminated transcriptional activation in cotransfection assays and exhibited activity identical to the 1–208 C-terminal HFH-3 deletion construct (Fig. 4, compare constructs 8 and9). However, a smaller internal deletion that removed amino acid residues between 209 and 212 was almost as active as the wild-type protein. These functional studies suggest that the minimal HFH-3 transcriptional activation domain resides in the amino acid 213–351 C-terminal sequences, which do not resemble those of other winged helix transcription factors. The winged helix/HFH proteins are a large family of transcription factors that share homology in the winged helix DNA binding domain and are involved in the differentiation of diverse cellular lineages (for review, see Refs. 4Costa R.H. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 183-206Google Scholar and 30Hromas R. Costa R. Davis S. Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology. 20. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam, Netherlands1995: 129-140Google Scholar). In this study we report on the isolation of the kidney-specific HFH-3 cDNA clone and show that it is a potent transcriptional activator with activity residing in the C-terminal 138 amino acids. This region does not share sequence similarity with transcriptional activation motifs previously identified for related winged helix family members (5Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G. Peterson R.S. Porcella A. Ye H. Paulson E.K. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 195-209Google Scholar, 24Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 957-966Google Scholar). The HFH-3 activation domain possesses features found in other transcriptional activation motifs and includes an acidic amino acid composition that exhibits an estimated pI of 4.65 as well as significant numbers of proline, serine, and threonine amino acid residues (31Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Google Scholar, 32Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Google Scholar). The HFH-3 activation domain also exhibits sequence similarity in three amino acid regions (246–257, 415–432, and 513–528) with the transcriptional factors Oct-1 (GenBank accession number X70324) and of the herpesvirus 3 ICP4 (GenBank accession number X02132). These sequence comparisons suggest that the HFH-3 protein utilizes activation motifs in common with other eukaryotic transcription factors but not with the winged helix family. We used in situ hybridization to demonstrate that HFH-3 is restricted to the distal tubule epithelium of embryonic and adult kidney. The distal tubules possess regulated ion channels, which are involved in the reabsorption of sodium and bicarbonate ions from the urine in exchange for the excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions, thus rendering the urine acidic (33Oberleithner H. Weigt M. Westphale H.J. Wang W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1464-1468Google Scholar, 34Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1612-1620Google Scholar). This readsorption process is regulated by the hormone aldosterone, a ligand for the mineralocorticoid receptor involved in activation of genes involved in Na/H exchange (35Roland B.L. Krozowski Z.S. Funder J.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: R1-R7Google Scholar, 36Lombes M. Farman N. Oblin M.E. Baulieu E.E. Bonvalet J.P. Erlanger B.F. Gasc J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1086-1088Google Scholar). In support of the important role of HFH-3 in regulating genes involved in the function of the distal tubules, we used the HFH-3 DNA binding consensus sequence to identify several potential target genes involved in the function of the renal distal tubules (Table II). Potential HFH-3 binding sites were found in the genes encoding Na/H exchanger, anion exchanger, and two subunits of the Na/K-ATPase proteins (Table II). Furthermore, we found potential HFH-3 binding sites in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene, which encodes an aldosterone-dependent transcription factor that activates the expression of genes involved in renal distal tubule function. In the adult kidney, LFB1/HNF-1 expression is restricted to the proximal and distal tubules, whereas LFB3/vHNF-1 expression is also detected in the collecting ducts (37Lazzaro D. Simone V.D. Magistris L.D. Lehtonen E. Cortese R. Development. 1992; 114: 469-479Google Scholar) and HNF-4 expression is detected throughout the nephrons (22Duncan S.A. Manova K. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Weinstein D.C. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7598-7602Google Scholar). We also found potential HFH-3 binding sites in the genes for tissue-specific transcription factors HNF-1, vHNF-1, and HNF-4 (Table II). Consistent with this prediction, one of the potential HFH-3 binding sites in the vHNF-1 promoter is DNase I-footprinted with kidney nuclear extracts (38Power S.C. Cereghini S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 778-791Google Scholar). Although these transcription factors are expressed more broadly than the HFH-3 gene, HFH-3 may participate in regulating their expression in the distal tubule epithelium of the kidney.Table IIPutative HFH-3 kidney target genes (distal tubule)GeneaShown are the name of the gene, GenBank accession number (GenBank no.), position in the gene, and the putative HFH-3 binding sequence.

Open table in a new tab We used the HFH-3 consensus binding sequence (Table I) to search promoters for genes that are expressed in the epithelium of the renal distal tubules. In addition to the HFH-3 gene, other members of the winged helix transcription factors exhibit restricted cellular expression patterns in the kidney (Fig. 1 b). The HNF-3α gene is expressed in the urothelium of the embryonic and adult renal pelvis and may regulate genes involved in readsorption of water from urine (9Peterson R. Clevidence D.E. Ye H. Costa R.H. Cell Growth Diff. 1997; 8: 69-82Google Scholar). Epithelial expression of HFH-3 and HNF-3 in the kidney thus forms a continuum from the distal convoluted tubules to the collecting ducts. Another winged helix transcription factor, BF-2, is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme, which gives rise to both the nephron epithelium and stromal cells of the mature kidney (39Hatini V. Huh S.O. Herzlinger D. Soares V.C. Lai E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the BF-2 gene in mice has inhibited the induction of renal mesenchyme into tubular epithelium and branching of the ureter and renal collecting system (39Hatini V. Huh S.O. Herzlinger D. Soares V.C. Lai E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Google Scholar). Two other winged helix transcription factors are also expressed in the mesenchyme of the developing embryonic kidney, including the mesenchyme fork head 1 (MFH-1) (40Miura N. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Tanaka K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 171-176Google Scholar) and fkh-6gene (41Kaestner K.H. Bleckmann S.C. Monaghan A.P. Schlondorff J. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Schutz G. Development. 1996; 122: 1751-1758Google Scholar). Furthermore, a new member of the winged helix family, HFH-11, is transiently expressed in the cortical epithelium and mesenchyme of the embryonic mouse kidney but its expression is extinguished in the adult kidney (42Ye H., F., K.T. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Google Scholar). Like the kidney, HFH-11 is also expressed in the proliferating cells of the embryonic intestine, lung, and liver but its expression is extinguished in non-replicating cells of these organs in the adult. We have shown that HFH-11 expression is reactivated in response to proliferative signals induced following organ injury. It is therefore likely that the winged helix HFH-11 gene is reactivated in the renal cortex in response to cellular injury. The winged helix family of transcription factors thus appears to play an important role in kidney morphogenesis and terminal differentiation of various cell types in the adult kidney. In summary, we demonstrated that HFH-3 expression is restricted to the epithelium of the distal convoluted tubules in the developing and adult kidney. We determined an HFH-3 DNA binding consensus sequence and identified potential target genes in cells co-expressing HFH-3. Transfection studies demonstrate that HFH-3 is a potent transcriptional activator whose activation domain resides in sequences located at the C terminus and that these sequences possess features in common with other transcriptional activation domains, but not with other HFH family members. We thank P. Raychaudhuri for critically reading the manuscript. The DNA sequence for the human HFH-3 cDNA was determined by the DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility at Iowa State University of Science and Technology."

Romero M.F. Khosla M.C. Douglas J.G. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 932-936Google Scholar), it is conceivable that lyso-PC may act as a second messenger, transducing signals elicited from membrane receptors. This is consistent with experiments showing that lyso-PC and phospholipase A2 under certain circumstances have similar effects when incubated with cultured cells (21Asaoka Y. Yoshida K. Sasaki Y. Nishizuka Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 716-719Google Scholar, 22Asaoka Y. Yoshida K. Sasaki Y. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4917-4921Google Scholar).Despite the multiple biological activities of lyso-PC, no underlying signal transduction mechanisms have been revealed. In the present study, we report that exogenous lyso-PC induces AP-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity and activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1). Although lyso-PC may activate other signal transduction pathways, the stimulated JNK and AP-1 activity defined by this study probably plays a role in mediating the response to lyso-PC.DISCUSSIONBecause it is implicated in wound healing, inflammation, and atherogenesis (1Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 391-404Google Scholar, 2Portman O.W. Alexander M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 158-165Google Scholar, 3Vidaver G.A. Ting A. Lee J.W. J. Theor.

Roberts R. Henry P.D. Nature. 1990; 344: 160-162Google Scholar), lyso-PC is believed to act as a regulator of functions/dysfunction of fibroblasts and endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. However, little is known as to how lyso-PC elicits its actions on cells. In this report, we show that lyso-PC is a potent stimulator of JNK1 and AP-1 activity. Because JNK activation has been linked to c-Jun transactivation and AP-1 protein synthesis, our findings are compatible with a model in which lyso-PC stimulates AP-1 activity through activation of JNK, although other JNK-independent mechanisms causing increased production of AP-1 proteins may exist. In addition to c-Jun, TCF, ATF2, and p53 have recently been identified as substrates of JNK1 (49Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar, 50Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Google Scholar, 51Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5511-5518Google Scholar). Thus the JNK-AP-1 cascade defined by this study could contribute to lyso-PC-induced expression of a number of different genes that contain regulatory sites for these transcriptional factors in their promoters. In this context, it is not surprising that the AP-1 transcription factor has been implicated in the regulation of expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, which is also stimulated by lyso-PC (10Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Google Scholar, 52Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Google Scholar).The rapidly growing literature on JNK indicates that it is most potently activated by pathways other than those utilized by traditional growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. The reported activators including UV irradiation, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1, as well as stresses such as hydrogen peroxide and heat shock, involve signal transduction pathways that fail to fully activate ERK (37Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar, 53Westwick J.K. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Cobb M.H. Hibi M. Karin M. Brenner D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6030-6034Google Scholar). The pathway to JNK activation by these diverse stimuli seems to be more complicated than the Ras-Raf-KEK/MKK-ERK pathway, which is common among growth factor signaling (54Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Google Scholar). A parallel module, Rac/Cdc42-PAK-MEKK1-SEK/MKK4-JNK/SAPK, has been postulated for JNK activation from extracellular stimuli (36Coso O.M. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 54Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Google Scholar, 55Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar). There exist, however, Rac, Cdc42-independent, and even SEK-independent pathway(s) leading to activation of JNK from diverse stimuli, suggesting that JNK can be activated through multiple pathways (36Coso O.M. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 55Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar, 56Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Google Scholar).In our study, we have not defined the upstream signals leading to JNK activation by lyso-PC. Previous studies with human monocytes and a lymphoblastic cell line have implicated the generation of diacylglycerol via a metabolic pathway involving (lyso)phospholipase C, in the action of exogenous lyso-PC (57Quinn M.T. Kondratenko N. Parthasarathy S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1982: 293-302Google Scholar, 58Nishijima J. Wright T.M. Hofman R.D. Liao F. Symer D.E. Shin H.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2902-2909Google Scholar). As an intracellular second messenger, diacylglycerol may conceivably stimulate PKC activation (59Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Google Scholar). Intact PKC activity has been shown to be required for some actions of lyso-PC, e.g. stimulation of superoxide anion production in vascular tissue (41Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Zheng B. Kuo J.F. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1007-1013Google Scholar) and modification of G-protein signaling in endothelial cells (42Kugiyama K. Ohgushi M. Sugiyama S. Murohara T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Yasue H. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1422-1428Google Scholar). Despite these observations, our demonstration of PKC-independent stimulation of JNK and AP-1 activity indicates that PKC is not required for the signaling process leading to JNK and AP-1 activation by lyso-PC. In addition, the failure of lyso-PC to stimulate ERK1 and ERK2, downstream targets of PKC, in Swiss 3T3 cells suggests that lyso-PC does not activate PKC. This seems to contradict observations described above that suggested the importance of PKC in some effects of lyso-PC (41Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Zheng B. Kuo J.F. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1007-1013Google Scholar, 42Kugiyama K. Ohgushi M. Sugiyama S. Murohara T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Yasue H. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1422-1428Google Scholar, 57Quinn M.T. Kondratenko N. Parthasarathy S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1982: 293-302Google Scholar, 58Nishijima J. Wright T.M. Hofman R.D. Liao F. Symer D.E. Shin H.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2902-2909Google Scholar). These previous studies, however, only showed the dependence upon the intact PKC activity for specific actions of lyso-PC without directly demonstrating activation of PKC by lyso-PC. It could be that basal PKC activity is sufficient under these circumstances or, alternatively, that lyso-PC-mediated activation of PKC is cell type-specific.It has been reported that lyso-PC treatment of certain types of cells can stimulate a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i, resulting from transient mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores and sustained influx from an extracellular source (60Inoue N. Hirata K. Yamada M. Hamamori Y. Matsuda Y. Akita H. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1410-1421Google Scholar, 61Su Z. Ling Q. Guo Z.G. Cardioscience. 1995; 6: 31-37Google Scholar). A potential role for this change in [Ca2+]i to JNK activation by lyso-PC is compatible with a recent report describing calcium-dependent, angiotensin II-induced JNK activation in the GN4 rat liver epithelial cell line (33Zohn I.E. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar). As suggested by the authors, however, this could be a cell type-specific pattern. Furthermore, increases in [Ca2+]i are not sufficient to induce JNK activation, since calcium ionophore (A23187) failed to stimulate JNK activity in lymphocytes as well as several fibroblastic and epithelial cell lines (34Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Google Scholar).JNK is potently activated by stress such as UV irradiation, hyperosmosis, heat shock, and protein synthesis inhibition (37Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar, 46Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T.L. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar, 62Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Google Scholar,63Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs R. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar). The mechanism by which stress culminates in JNK activation remains largely unknown. It appears that these diverse stresses stimulate JNK activation through distinct cellular sensors. For instance, UV-induced, but not heat shock-mediated JNK activation is dependent on membrane-associated components and free oxygen radicals (64Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Google Scholar). Although lyso-PC at concentrations (10 and 20 μm) that sufficiently activated JNK did not cause evident cytotoxicity, the possibility cannot be excluded that lyso-PC, as a polar lipid, may cause other alterations on the membrane bilayer. This may create a stress-like condition that ultimately leads to JNK activation.Since other similar phospholipids, such as lyso-PA and platelet-activating factor have specific G-protein-coupled receptors on the cell membrane (65Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Google Scholar, 66Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Google Scholar), lyso-PC may also interact with a specific membrane receptor. It has been suggested that lyso-PC may act as an agonist for the thromboxane and platelet-activating factor receptors (17Saito T. Kudo Y. Fushimi E. Miura M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 58 (abstr.): 340Google Scholar, 67Phillipson D.A W. Tymiak A.A. Tuttle J.G. Hartl K.S. Harper T.W. Bolgar M.S. Allen G.T. Ogletree M.L. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 7: 155-167Google Scholar). We are currently testing whether lyso-PC activates JNK through binding to these receptors. Another possibility is that lyso-PC may enter cells and serve as an intracellular second messenger with JNK as a downstream target. This hypothesis has been strengthened by a series of studies demonstrating that lyso-PC was generated intracellularly through activation of phospholipase A2following stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (23Nakamura T. Lin L.L. Kharbanda S. Knopf J. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4917-4922Google Scholar), and stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors by thrombin (24McHowat J. Corr P.B. J. Biol.

Romero M.F. Khosla M.C. Douglas J.G. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 932-936Google Scholar). The identification of potential intracellular effectors of lyso-PC should help in elucidating the mechanism(s) for the multiple biological functions of this phospholipid.

Pruzanski W. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 391-404Google Scholar). Strong evidence supports a role for lyso-PC in the processes of atherogenesis, inflammation, and wound healing (1Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Lab.

Roberts R. Henry P.D. Nature. 1990; 344: 160-162Google Scholar). The lyso-PC content of atherosclerotic arteries is severalfold higher than that of normal vessels (2Portman O.W. Alexander M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 158-165Google Scholar, 3Vidaver G.A. Ting A. Lee J.W. J. Theor. Biol. 1985; 115: 27-41Google Scholar). It constitutes up to 40% of total lipid in atherogenic lipoproteins such as oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein and β-migrating very low density lipoprotein (8Parthasarathy S. Barnett Steinbrecher J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Google Scholar). Lyso-PC has been identified as an essential component responsible for some biological activities of these lipoproteins in vivo, e.g. the chemotactic effect on human monocytes (6Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Google Scholar) and mitogenic action on macrophages (9Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Google Scholar). Additionally, lyso-PC is locally generated by the action of secretory phospholipase A2 in wounds and inflammatory lesions (1Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 391-404Google Scholar), suggesting its involvement in response to injury and other stresses. The addition of lyso-PC to cultured cells can transcriptionally up-regulate the expression of a variety of genes including cell adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) (10Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Google Scholar), growth factors (platelet-derived growth factors A and B and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor) (11Kume N.

In the present study, we report that exogenous lyso-PC induces AP-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity and activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1). Although lyso-PC may activate other signal transduction pathways, the stimulated JNK and AP-1 activity defined by this study probably plays a role in mediating the response to lyso-PC.

Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Google Scholar, 52Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Google Scholar).The rapidly growing literature on JNK indicates that it is most potently activated by pathways other than those utilized by traditional growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. The reported activators including UV irradiation, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1, as well as stresses such as hydrogen peroxide and heat shock, involve signal transduction pathways that fail to fully activate ERK (37Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar, 53Westwick J.K. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Cobb M.H. Hibi M. Karin M. Brenner D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6030-6034Google Scholar). The pathway to JNK activation by these diverse stimuli seems to be more complicated than the Ras-Raf-KEK/MKK-ERK pathway, which is common among growth factor signaling (54Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Google Scholar). A parallel module, Rac/Cdc42-PAK-MEKK1-SEK/MKK4-JNK/SAPK, has been postulated for JNK activation from extracellular stimuli (36Coso O.M. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 54Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Google Scholar, 55Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar). There exist, however, Rac, Cdc42-independent, and even SEK-independent pathway(s) leading to activation of JNK from diverse stimuli, suggesting that JNK can be activated through multiple pathways (36Coso O.M. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 55Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M.

Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Google Scholar).In our study, we have not defined the upstream signals leading to JNK activation by lyso-PC. Previous studies with human monocytes and a lymphoblastic cell line have implicated the generation of diacylglycerol via a metabolic pathway involving (lyso)phospholipase C, in the action of exogenous lyso-PC (57Quinn M.T. Kondratenko N. Parthasarathy S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1982: 293-302Google Scholar, 58Nishijima J. Wright T.M. Hofman R.D. Liao F. Symer D.E. Shin H.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2902-2909Google Scholar). As an intracellular second messenger, diacylglycerol may conceivably stimulate PKC activation (59Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Google Scholar). Intact PKC activity has been shown to be required for some actions of lyso-PC, e.g. stimulation of superoxide anion production in vascular tissue (41Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Zheng B. Kuo J.F. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1007-1013Google Scholar) and modification of G-protein signaling in endothelial cells (42Kugiyama K. Ohgushi M. Sugiyama S. Murohara T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Yasue H. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1422-1428Google Scholar). Despite these observations, our demonstration of PKC-independent stimulation of JNK and AP-1 activity indicates that PKC is not required for the signaling process leading to JNK and AP-1 activation by lyso-PC. In addition, the failure of lyso-PC to stimulate ERK1 and ERK2, downstream targets of PKC, in Swiss 3T3 cells suggests that lyso-PC does not activate PKC. This seems to contradict observations described above that suggested the importance of PKC in some effects of lyso-PC (41Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Zheng B. Kuo J.F. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1007-1013Google Scholar, 42Kugiyama K. Ohgushi M. Sugiyama S. Murohara T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Yasue H. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1422-1428Google Scholar, 57Quinn M.T. Kondratenko N.

These previous studies, however, only showed the dependence upon the intact PKC activity for specific actions of lyso-PC without directly demonstrating activation of PKC by lyso-PC. It could be that basal PKC activity is sufficient under these circumstances or, alternatively, that lyso-PC-mediated activation of PKC is cell type-specific.It has been reported that lyso-PC treatment of certain types of cells can stimulate a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i, resulting from transient mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores and sustained influx from an extracellular source (60Inoue N. Hirata K. Yamada M. Hamamori Y. Matsuda Y. Akita H. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1410-1421Google Scholar, 61Su Z. Ling Q. Guo Z.G. Cardioscience. 1995; 6: 31-37Google Scholar). A potential role for this change in [Ca2+]i to JNK activation by lyso-PC is compatible with a recent report describing calcium-dependent, angiotensin II-induced JNK activation in the GN4 rat liver epithelial cell line (33Zohn I.E. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar). As suggested by the authors, however, this could be a cell type-specific pattern. Furthermore, increases in [Ca2+]i are not sufficient to induce JNK activation, since calcium ionophore (A23187) failed to stimulate JNK activity in lymphocytes as well as several fibroblastic and epithelial cell lines (34Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Google Scholar).JNK is potently activated by stress such as UV irradiation, hyperosmosis, heat shock, and protein synthesis inhibition (37Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P.

Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar). The mechanism by which stress culminates in JNK activation remains largely unknown. It appears that these diverse stresses stimulate JNK activation through distinct cellular sensors. For instance, UV-induced, but not heat shock-mediated JNK activation is dependent on membrane-associated components and free oxygen radicals (64Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Google Scholar). Although lyso-PC at concentrations (10 and 20 μm) that sufficiently activated JNK did not cause evident cytotoxicity, the possibility cannot be excluded that lyso-PC, as a polar lipid, may cause other alterations on the membrane bilayer. This may create a stress-like condition that ultimately leads to JNK activation.Since other similar phospholipids, such as lyso-PA and platelet-activating factor have specific G-protein-coupled receptors on the cell membrane (65Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Google Scholar, 66Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Google Scholar), lyso-PC may also interact with a specific membrane receptor. It has been suggested that lyso-PC may act as an agonist for the thromboxane and platelet-activating factor receptors (17Saito T. Kudo Y. Fushimi E. Miura M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 58 (abstr.): 340Google Scholar, 67Phillipson D.A W. Tymiak A.A. Tuttle J.G. Hartl K.S. Harper T.W. Bolgar M.S. Allen G.T. Ogletree M.L. J.

Another possibility is that lyso-PC may enter cells and serve as an intracellular second messenger with JNK as a downstream target. This hypothesis has been strengthened by a series of studies demonstrating that lyso-PC was generated intracellularly through activation of phospholipase A2following stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (23Nakamura T. Lin L.L. Kharbanda S. Knopf J. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4917-4922Google Scholar), and stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors by thrombin (24McHowat J. Corr P.B. J. Biol.

Romero M.F. Khosla M.C. Douglas J.G. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 932-936Google Scholar). The identification of potential intracellular effectors of lyso-PC should help in elucidating the mechanism(s) for the multiple biological functions of this phospholipid. Because it is implicated in wound healing, inflammation, and atherogenesis (1Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 391-404Google Scholar, 2Portman O.W. Alexander M. J.

Nature. 1990; 344: 160-162Google Scholar), lyso-PC is believed to act as a regulator of functions/dysfunction of fibroblasts and endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. However, little is known as to how lyso-PC elicits its actions on cells. In this report, we show that lyso-PC is a potent stimulator of JNK1 and AP-1 activity. Because JNK activation has been linked to c-Jun transactivation and AP-1 protein synthesis, our findings are compatible with a model in which lyso-PC stimulates AP-1 activity through activation of JNK, although other JNK-independent mechanisms causing increased production of AP-1 proteins may exist. In addition to c-Jun, TCF, ATF2, and p53 have recently been identified as substrates of JNK1 (49Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar, 50Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Google Scholar, 51Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. J. Biol.

The cDNA clone encodes a polypeptide with a deduced amino acid sequence of 361 residues and a predicted molecular mass of 41 kDa. The gene encoding the β subunit lies within 4 kilobase pairs of that for the catalytic subunit in the <i>Drosophila</i> genome, on the left arm of chromosome 2. The two genes have similar structural features and share several common DNA sequence elements in their upstream regions, suggesting the possibility of coordinate regulation. A human cDNA homolog of the accessory subunit was identified, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The human sequence encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 43 kDa that shows a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity to the <i>Drosophila</i> β subunit. Subunit-specific rabbit antisera, directed against the recombinant catalytic and accessory subunit polypeptides overexpressed and purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, recognize specifically and immunoprecipitate the native enzyme from <i>Drosophila</i>embryos. Demonstration of the physical association of the two subunits in the <i>Drosophila</i> enzyme and identification of a human accessory subunit homolog provide evidence for a common heterodimeric structure for animal mitochondrial DNA polymerases.U94702U94703"
https://openalex.org/W2002036032,"Recently, we have designed farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitors (FTI-277 and GGTI-298) that selectively block protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, respectively. In this study, we describe the opposing effects of these inhibitors on interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-stimulated induction of nitric-oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (RPASMC) and rat hepatocytes. Pretreatment of cells with GGTI-298 caused a superinduction of NOS-2 by IL-1β. RPASMC treated with GGTI-298 (10 μm) prior to IL-1β (10 ng/ml) expressed levels of NOS-2 protein five times higher than those exposed to IL-1β alone. This superinduction of NOS-2 protein by pretreatment with GGTI-298 resulted in nitrite concentrations in the medium that were 5-fold higher at 10 ng/ml IL-1β and 10-fold higher at 1 ng/ml IL-1β. Furthermore, NOS-2 mRNA levels in RPASMC were also increased 6- and 14-fold (at 10 and 1 ng/ml IL-1β, respectively) when the cells were pretreated with GGTI-298. In contrast, treatment of cells with the inhibitor of protein farnesylation, FTI-277 (10 μm), blocked IL-1β-induced NOS-2 expression at mRNA and protein levels. Pretreatment with lovastatin, an inhibitor of protein prenylation, resulted in superinduction of NOS-2. This superinduction was reversed by geranylgeraniol, but not by farnesol, further confirming that inhibition of geranylgeranylation, not farnesylation, is responsible for enhanced NOS-2 expression. The results demonstrate that a farnesylated protein(s) mediates IL-1β induction of NOS-2, whereas a geranylgeranylated protein(s) represses this induction. Recently, we have designed farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitors (FTI-277 and GGTI-298) that selectively block protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, respectively. In this study, we describe the opposing effects of these inhibitors on interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-stimulated induction of nitric-oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (RPASMC) and rat hepatocytes. Pretreatment of cells with GGTI-298 caused a superinduction of NOS-2 by IL-1β. RPASMC treated with GGTI-298 (10 μm) prior to IL-1β (10 ng/ml) expressed levels of NOS-2 protein five times higher than those exposed to IL-1β alone. This superinduction of NOS-2 protein by pretreatment with GGTI-298 resulted in nitrite concentrations in the medium that were 5-fold higher at 10 ng/ml IL-1β and 10-fold higher at 1 ng/ml IL-1β. Furthermore, NOS-2 mRNA levels in RPASMC were also increased 6- and 14-fold (at 10 and 1 ng/ml IL-1β, respectively) when the cells were pretreated with GGTI-298. In contrast, treatment of cells with the inhibitor of protein farnesylation, FTI-277 (10 μm), blocked IL-1β-induced NOS-2 expression at mRNA and protein levels. Pretreatment with lovastatin, an inhibitor of protein prenylation, resulted in superinduction of NOS-2. This superinduction was reversed by geranylgeraniol, but not by farnesol, further confirming that inhibition of geranylgeranylation, not farnesylation, is responsible for enhanced NOS-2 expression. The results demonstrate that a farnesylated protein(s) mediates IL-1β induction of NOS-2, whereas a geranylgeranylated protein(s) represses this induction. Nitric oxide (NO) is a radical with important physiologic effects that include modulation of vasoreactivity, prevention of thrombosis, and neurotransmission (1Schmidt H.H.H.W. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Google Scholar). NO is the product of an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by nitric-oxide synthase (NOS). 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; FTase, farnesyltransferase; GGTase I, geranylgeranyltransferase I; RPASMC, rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. Mammalian cells express three isozymes of NOS, neuronal (NOS-1), endothelial (NOS-3), and inducible (NOS-2) (reviewed in Ref. 2Morris Jr., S.M. Billiar T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 26: E829-E839Google Scholar). NOS-1 and NOS-3 are constitutively active, whereas NOS-2 is not present unless the cell is triggered to produce it. The induction of NOS-2 in cells exposed to cytokines and lipopolysaccharides is implicated in the pathophysiology of shock (3Szabo C. New Horizons. 1995; 3: 2-32Google Scholar). IL-1β is an important cytokine that is released early in inflammation and shock (4Dinarello C. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Google Scholar). As a single agent, IL-1β is capable of inducing NOS-2 at levels comparable to those induced by a mixture of cytokines and lipopolysaccharides (5Nakayama D.K. Geller D.A. Lowenstein C.J. Chern H.D. Davies P. Pitt B.R. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 471-476Google Scholar). IL-1β achieves its effects through signaling pathways that have not been fully defined (6O'Neill L.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 31-44Google Scholar), but that appear to include the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway since IL-1β activates MAP kinase itself (7Ahlers A. Belka C. Gestel M. Lamping N. Scott C. Herrmann F. Brach M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1077-1083Google Scholar, 8Bird T.A. Sleath P. deRoos P.C. Dower S.K. Virca G.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14343-14352Google Scholar), at least in some systems, via the kinase (MAP kinase kinase) immediately preceding it (10Guy G.R. Chau S.P. Wong N.S. Ng S.B. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14343-14352Google Scholar, 11Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Google Scholar, 12Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L.M. Marshall C.J. Kracht M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 189-192Google Scholar). This effect on MAP kinase kinase implicates the small GTP-binding protein Ras since this triggers activation of the pathway by interacting with Raf, a serine/threonine kinase lying immediately upstream of MAP kinase kinase (13Hallberg B. Rayter S.I. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3913-3916Google Scholar). IL-1β is also capable of activating stress-activated protein kinase (14Bird T.A. Kyriakis J.M. Tyshler L. Gayle M. Milne A. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31836-31844Google Scholar, 15Kracht M. Truong O. Totty N.F. Shiroo M. Saklatvala J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2017-2026Google Scholar) and p38 kinase (16Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Google Scholar), two kinases that occupy positions in pathways distinct from MAP kinase, but that are also potentially under the control of small G proteins such as Ras, Rho, and Rac (17Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Google Scholar). Modulating the function of these small G proteins has recently become possible with inhibitors of prenyltransferases, the enzymes responsible for attaching prenyl lipids to the proteins as the first and most critical step in post-translational processing (18Gutierrez L. Magee A. Marshall C. Hancock J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Google Scholar). The enzymes are farnesyltransferase (FTase) (19Reiss Y. Goldstein J. Seabra M. Casey P. Brown M. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Google Scholar, 20Manne V. Roberts D. Tobin A. O'Rourke E. De Vigilio M. Meyers C. Ahmed N. Kurz B. Resh M. Kung H.-F. Barbacid M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17438-17443Google Scholar, 22James G. Goldstein J. Brown M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Google Scholar), which attaches the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl. Among proteins that are farnesylated are Ha-Ras and nuclear lamins; among those that are geranylgeranylated are Rap1A, RhoA, and Rac1. Some proteins that can be both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated include RhoB and Ki-Ras 4B (23Casey P.J. Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Higgins Y.B. Thissen J.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 215-238Google Scholar). Because farnesylation and/or geranylgeranylation of small G proteins is critical for their function, we (24Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D.

Much less is known about GGTase I inhibitors, but recently, we have shown that these agents antagonize the signaling of oncogenic Ki-Ras 4B (35Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26770-26773Google Scholar), decrease levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (37McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Google Scholar), and block fibroblasts in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (36Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999Google Scholar). Very little is known about the effects of FTase and GGTase I inhibitors in cells other than fibroblasts. Recently, Singh et al. (40Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Google Scholar) showed that an inhibitor of FTase blocked IL-1β-stimulated induction of NOS-2 and activation of MAP kinase in cardiac myocytes. Here we demonstrate that an inhibitor of GGTase I causes superinduction of IL-1β-stimulated NOS-2 in smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes. The primary culture of rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (RPASMC) has been described in detail previously (5Nakayama D.K. Geller D.A. Lowenstein C.J. Chern H.D. Davies P. Pitt B.R. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 471-476Google Scholar). Briefly, explants of pulmonary artery were obtained by dissection following pentobarbital euthanasia of male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats and placed intimal surface down in plastic flasks containing growth medium (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin). Cells were allowed to migrate out of the explants for 5–7 days before removal of the explants and subsequent subpassaging by trypsinization. For the studies reported here, cells were trypsinized, replated at ∼106 cells/75-cm2 flask, and grown under standard conditions of 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. Cells were used through the fifth passage. Hepatocytes were isolated from male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats using the in situ collagenase perfusion technique of Gelleret al. (41Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. DiSilvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Google Scholar). After isolation, hepatocytes were plated onto gelatin-coated Petri dishes (Corning Inc.) and grown in Williams' medium E (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the addition ofl-arginine (0.50 mm), insulin (1 μm), HEPES (15 mm), l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% low endotoxin fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in growth medium for 24 h, and then serum-free Williams' medium E with the above additives was used for all experimental conditions. This was achieved by treating cells with recombinant human IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at the concentrations indicated. After 24 h, the medium was harvested for determination of nitrite concentration, and the cells for assessment of NOS-2 RNA and protein levels. RPASMC were grown to 50% confluence (generally, 24–48 h after plating). Fresh medium was added containing either FTI-277 or GGTI-298 at the concentrations indicated. The cells were allowed to grow with inhibitors for 24 h. Stimulation of cells with IL-1β took place in basal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) with the addition of FTI-277 or GGTI-298 where indicated. To quantify the amount of NO released from cells, nitrite, its stable product in aqueous solution, was measured by the Griess reaction. Nitrite concentration was measured by mixing an aliquot of cell supernatant with an equal volume of Griess reagent (1 part 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride to 1 part 1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid) and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance at 550 nm was measured, and nitrite concentration was determined using sodium nitrite as a standard. Cell monolayers were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors antipain, pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the lysate was transferred to a conical tube. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Whole cell lysate was boiled in Laemmli buffer, and 100 μg of protein/lane was loaded on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated electrophoretically. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 90 mA in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot cell. For immunoblotting, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h. The primary antibody was a polyclonal rabbit anti-murine macrophage NOS-2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) diluted 1:1000 in 1% nonfat dry milk and applied for 2 h. After washing three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% nonfat dry milk, the secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Sigma) was applied at 1:5000 dilution. The blot was washed in PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20 and 1% nonfat dry milk three times over 30 min, and positive immunoreactivity was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and by exposure to photographic film. Cell lysates (50 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. The membrane was blocked in PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. After washing three times in PBS-T, the membrane was probed with Y13-238, an anti-Ras antibody, at 50 μg/ml in PBS-T containing 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed as described above and then incubated with the secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG) at a dilution of 1:1000. Positive immunoreactivity was visualized using ECL. Processing of Rap1A was assessed in the same manner described for Ras except that the membrane was probed with anti-Rap1A antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and the positive antibody reactions were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and ECL. Total RNA was extracted using the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (42Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 20 μg of total RNA underwent electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to a GeneScreen membrane (DuPont NEN) and UV-cross-linked. Membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with a cDNA probe to murine macrophage NOS-2 (1–2 × 106 cpm/ml) labeled with [32P]dCTP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mm; DuPont NEN) by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim). The hybridized filters were washed at 53 °C and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Recently, we have designed and synthesized small organic molecules that mimic the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide CAAX of proteins that are farnesylated or geranylgeranylated. These peptidomimetics are potent and selective inhibitors of FTase and GGTase I in vitro, respectively. The peptidomimetic FTI-276 is 100-fold more selective for FTase over GGTase I (IC50 = 0.5 and 50 nm, respectively) (24Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Google Scholar), whereas GGTI-297 is more selective for GGTase I over FTase (IC50 = 50 and 200 nm, respectively) (36Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999Google Scholar, 37McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Google Scholar). In this study, we treated RPASMC with the methyl ester prodrugs of FTI-276 and GGTI-297, FTI-277 and GGTI-298, which enter the cell more easily (24Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Google Scholar, 36Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that treatment of RPASMC with FTI-277 (0–10 μm), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Ras processing, with no effect on the processing of the geranylgeranylated protein Rap1A. In contrast, treatment of RPASMC with GGTI-298 (0–10 μm) resulted in inhibition of Rap1A processing, with no effect on Ras processing. These results demonstrate that FTI-277 and GGTI-298 are potent inhibitors of FTase and GGTase I in smooth muscle cells and are therefore efficacious in inhibiting cellular processing of farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins, respectively. To determine the role of geranylgeranylated proteins in the signal transduction pathways that mediate IL-1β induction of NOS-2, we treated RPASMC and rat hepatocytes with the GGTase I inhibitor GGTI-298 prior to treatment with IL-1β as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 B shows that in the absence of inhibitors, IL-1β (0–10 ng/ml) induced a concentration-dependent, but modest, increase in the medium levels of nitrite from 1 μm basal levels to 12 μm after treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-1β. Pretreatment with GGTI-298 (10 μm) caused a dramatic increase in IL-1β-induced nitrite formation (from 4 to 52 μm). The medium of cells treated with 1 ng/ml IL-1β alone accumulated nitrite levels of 4 μm, whereas the medium of cells treated with GGTI-298 prior to IL-1β accumulated levels of nitrites that were more than 10-fold higher (42 μm) (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of IL-1β, GGTI-298 increased basal levels of NOS-2 to levels comparable to those obtained by stimulation of cells with 1 ng/ml IL-1β alone. In contrast to the effects of GGTI-298, treatment of cells with FTI-277 inhibited IL-1β-stimulated nitrite production (Fig. 1 B). The dramatic increase in the level of nitrite brought about by GGTI-298 could be due to direct activation of NOS-2 enzymatic activity or superinduction of NOS-2 protein. To determine the effects of GGTI-298 on NOS-2 protein levels, RPASMC were treated with GGTI-298 for 24 h and then stimulated with IL-1β for a further 24 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were harvested, and the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using a specific anti-NOS-2 antibody. Fig. 2 A shows that in the absence of GGTI-298, significant induction of NOS-2 protein levels in RPASMC occurred only at 10 ng/ml IL-1β, whereas in the presence of inhibitor, NOS-2 was induced at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml. In RPASMC treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β, GGTI-298 enhanced the ability of IL-1β to induce NOS-2 protein by 5-fold. A similar effect was demonstrated in hepatocytes (Fig. 2 B). We next used an alternative method to demonstrate the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins in the regulation of NOS-2 induction by IL-1β. Recently, we have shown that treatment of NIH-3T3 cells with lovastatin inhibited the processing of both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins, with a much more pronounced effect on geranylgeranylated proteins, but that treatment of these cells with a combination of lovastatin and either geranylgeraniol or farnesol restored protein geranylgeranylation or farnesylation, respectively (43McGuire T.M. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 305-312Google Scholar). Applying this strategy, we observed that RPASMC treated with lovastatin alone were much more responsive to IL-1β in inducing NOS-2 (Fig. 3). This lovastatin-mediated superinduction of IL-1β-stimulated NOS-2 was reversed by geranylgeraniol, but not by farnesol. Lovastatin inhibition of the processing of Ras and of the geranylgeranylated protein Rap1A in RPASMC was reversed with farnesol and geranylgeraniol, respectively (Fig. 3). The above results confirmed that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation is responsible for the hypersensitivity of RPASMC to IL-1β induction of NOS-2. The results also suggest that inhibition of protein farnesylation is not involved in the superinduction of NOS-2 by IL-1β. The above results demonstrated that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation causes a superinduction of NOS-2 by IL-1β. We next determined the consequences of inhibiting protein farnesylation. RPASMC were pretreated for 24 h with FTI-277 prior to a 24-h treatment with various concentrations of IL-1β (0–10 ng/ml). The cells were then harvested, and the levels of NOS-2 protein as well as the cumulative levels of nitrites in the cell-conditioned medium were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4 A shows that pretreatment of RPASMC with FTI-277 (10 μm) blocked IL-1β induction of NOS-2 protein. Hepatocytes were treated similarly, but with slightly higher IL-1β levels (0–50 ng/ml). Fig.4 B shows a similar effect in the hepatocytes, although the effect was not as complete. We next determined whether the effects of GGTI-298 and FTI-277 on NOS-2 protein and nitrite levels were due to alterations at the mRNA level. RPASMC were treated with vehicle, IL-1β, FTI-277, GGTI-298, and IL-1β with either FTI-277 or GGTI-298, and the levels of NOS-2 mRNA were determined by Northern blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Stimulation of cells with IL-1β showed a modest induction of NOS-2 mRNA (Fig.5, lanes 1–3), whereas treatment of cells with FTI-277 or GGTI-298 alone had no detectable effect (lanes 4and 7). Treatment of cells with FTI-277 blocked the ability of IL-1β to induce NOS-2 mRNA (compare lanes 1–3with lanes 4–6). In contrast, GGTI-298 enhanced the ability of IL-1β to induce NOS-2 by 6- and 14-fold at 10 and 1 ng/ml IL-1β, respectively (compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 7–9). Cyclophilin mRNA levels were not affected by the treatments and were similar in all lanes of Fig. 5. The data presented in this report clearly demonstrate that IL-1β induction of NOS-2 in RPASMC and rat hepatocytes is under the tight control of farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins. Whereas inhibition of protein farnesylation blocked NOS-2 expression, inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation had the opposite effect of dramatically enhancing NOS-2 expression. The results suggest that a farnesylated protein mediates IL-1β induction of NOS-2, whereas a geranylgeranylated protein represses this induction. A potential candidate for mediating IL-1β induction of NOS-2 is the Ras protein. This suggestion is consistent with the recent report by Singh et al. (40Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Google Scholar) that showed that IL-1β activates the MAP kinase pathway and induces NOS-2 in cardiac myocytes and that this can be blocked by the FTase inhibitor BZA-5B. Therefore, Ras proteins that are farnesylated and are known to activate the MAP kinase pathway are good candidates for mediating IL-1β induction of NOS-2. Among geranylgeranylated proteins that can serve to antagonize IL-1β induction of NOS-2 are the small G proteins Rho and Rac. Although the involvement of these proteins in growth factor signaling is now well documented, their role in cytokine signaling is less clear. It is plausible that cytokines such as IL-1β could activate both the Ras/MAP kinase (7Ahlers A. Belka C. Gestel M. Lamping N. Scott C. Herrmann F. Brach M.A. Mol.

Integration of the MAP kinase and stress-activated protein kinase pathways in smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes would result in the net outcome of induction of NOS-2 expression. Inhibition of the stress-activated protein kinase pathway that depends on the geranylgeranylated RhoA and Rac proteins would tip the equilibrium in the direction of releasing the repressing pathways and superinducing NOS-2. On the other hand, inhibition of the MAP kinase pathways that depend on farnesylated proteins such as Ras would block NOS-2 induction. Regardless of the mechanism by which inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation causes superinduction of NOS-2, the consequences of this novel finding are of great therapeutic potential. We are presently evaluating the potential of GGTI-298 to reverse in animal models intimal hyperplasia associated with restenosis and atherosclerosis. Our ultimate goal is to prevent local hyperplasia that compromises the success of angioplasty and surgical bypass for obstructive vascular lesions.

https://openalex.org/W2060654583,"Glucose-6-phosphate transport was investigated in rat or human liver microsomal vesicles using rapid filtration and light-scattering methods. Upon addition of glucose-6-phosphate, rat liver microsomes accumulated the radioactive tracer, reaching a steady-state level of uptake. In this phase, the majority of the accumulated tracer was glucose, but a significant intraluminal glucose-6-phosphate pool could also be observed. The extent of the intravesicular glucose pool was proportional with glucose-6-phosphatase activity. The relative size of the intravesicular glucose-6-phosphate pool (irrespective of the concentration of the extravesicular concentration of added glucose-6-phosphate) expressed as the apparent intravesicular space of the hexose phosphate was inversely dependent on glucose-6-phosphatase activity. The increase of hydrolysis by elevating the extravesicular glucose-6-phosphate concentration or temperature resulted in lower apparent intravesicular glucose-6-phosphate spaces and, thus, in a higher transmembrane gradient of glucose-6-phosphate concentrations. In contrast, inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis by vanadate, inactivation of glucose-6-phosphatase by acidic pH, or genetically determined low or absent glucose-6-phosphatase activity in human hepatic microsomes of patients suffering from glycogen storage disease type 1a led to relatively high intravesicular glucose-6-phosphate levels. Glucose-6-phosphate transport investigated by light-scattering technique resulted in similar traces in control and vanadate-treated rat microsomes as well as in microsomes from human patients with glycogen storage disease type 1a. It is concluded that liver microsomes take up glucose-6-phosphate, constituting a pool directly accessible to intraluminal glucose-6-phosphatase activity. In addition, normal glucose-6-phosphate uptake can take place in the absence of the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme protein, confirming the existence of separate transport proteins."

Stimulation of the cells with a stable analog [d-Trp6]GnRH (GnRH-A) resulted in a rapid elevation of PKCε mRNA levels (1 h), while PKCδ mRNA levels were elevated only after 24 h of incubation. The rapid elevation of PKCε mRNA by GnRH-A was blocked by pretreatment with a GnRH antagonist or actinomycin D. The PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), but not the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, mimicked the rapid effect of GnRH-A upon PKCε mRNA elevation. Additionally, the rapid stimulatory effect of GnRH-A was blocked by the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X, by TPA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous PKC, or by Ca2+ removal. Interestingly, serum-starvation (24 h) advanced the stimulation of PKCδ mRNA levels by GnRH-A and the effect could be detected at 1 h of incubation. The rapid effect of GnRH-A upon PKCδ mRNA levels in serum-starved cells was mimicked by TPA, but not by ionomycin, and was abolished by down-regulation of PKC or by Ca2+ removal. Preactivation of αT3-1 cells with GnRH-A for 1 h followed by removal of ligand and serum resulted in elevation of PKCδ mRNA levels after 24 h of incubation. Western blot analysis revealed that GnRH-A and TPA stimulated (within 5 min) the activation and some degradation of PKCδ and PKCε. We conclude that Ca2+ and PKC are involved in GnRH-A elevation of PKCδ and PKCε mRNA levels, with Ca2+ being necessary but not sufficient, while PKC is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the GnRH-A response. A serum factor masks PKCδ but not PKCε mRNA elevation by GnRH-A, and its removal exposes preactivation of PKCδ mRNA by GnRH-A which can be memorized for 24 h.

Conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) are activated by Ca2+, diacylglycerol (DAG), and phospholipid such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and are tightly coupled to phosphoinositide turnover (1Kikkawa U.

Atypical PKCs (ζ and λ/ι) are Ca2+- and DAG-independent but PS-activated isoforms and are also stimulated by other lipid-derived mediators (1Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Shearman M.S. Ase K. Sekiguchi K.

Recently, while examining conventional PKC regulation, we have shown that GnRH-A increases the levels of PKCβ, but not PKCα, mRNA levels in αT3-1 cells, while PKCγ is not expressed in the cells (12Shraga-Levine Z. Ben-Menahem D. Naor Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31028-31033Google Scholar). Since PKCδ and PKCε of the novel PKC group are major subspecies in the pituitary (26Garcia-Navarro S. Marantz Y. Eyal R.

Here we demonstrate that GnRH-A directs differential autoregulation of PKCδ and PKCε gene expression, which is dependent upon growth conditions and Ca2+, and reveals a memory mechanism, which might participate in PKCδ autoregulation. αT3-1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. P.

Cells were grown in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. After 3–4 days, when cells were 70–80% confluent, the cultures were washed three times with fresh DMEM, and stimulants were added in 5 ml of DMEM at the indicated concentrations for the given length of time. For short period incubations (up to 1 h) 10 mm Hepes was added to the medium. When the stimulation period was longer than 9 h, the medium was supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. At the end of the stimulation period, total RNA was isolated from cells by extraction in guanidium thiocyanate containing 8% 2-mercaptoethanol by the LiCl method as described by Cathala et al. (28Cathala G. Savouret J.F. Bernadita M. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (15 μg) was fractionated on 1.2% denaturing agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen membranes (DuPont NEN). Alternatively, RNA samples (8 μg) were slot blotted onto GeneScreen using a slot blot manifold (Schleicher & Schüll). Following baking and prehybridization, the membranes were hybridized overnight with the specific cDNA probes labeled to high specific activity using a random primer labeling kit (Boehringer). Half of each lane was hybridized with a PKC cDNA, and the second half was hybridized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA as an internal control. Thereafter, filters were washed at high stringency and were autoradiographed at −70 °C. Steady state levels of mRNAs were quantified with densitometric scanning of autoradiograms. The data were corrected for variability in loading by calculation as a ratio to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Following ligand treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2, harvested with rubber policemen, and pelleted by short spin (1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C). Cells were resuspended in 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm iodoacetic acid, and lysed by 10 strokes of a 25-gauge syringe. Following removal of nuclei (1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C), cytosol and membrane fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C). The proteins were separated on 7.5–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 30:0.5) and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose papers in 50 mmglycine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 (100 V for 2 h at 4 °C). The papers were blocked for 60 min in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and treated overnight with the respective rabbit anti-PKC antibodies (Sigma). The signals were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and the ECL method. The hybridization signals for PKC subtypes mRNA in each group were normalized to the hybridization signals for the housekeeping gene for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. An arbitrary unit of 1 represents the control values. Statistical comparisons between control and treatment groups were performed using Student's t test; in the figures, asingle asterisk indicates p < 0.05, adouble asterisk indicates p < 0.01, and atriple asterisk indicates p < 0.001. We first studied the cellular redistribution of PKCδ and PKCε following GnRH-A and TPA stimulation, since it is a criterion for PKC activation by extracellular signals (5Hirota K. Hirota T.

Both GnRH-A and TPA stimulated an increase in the molecular weight of cytosolic PKCδ within 5 min (Fig. 1), consistent with the size shift reported for PKCδ phosphorylation by Src (29Gshhwendt M. Kielbassa K. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 85-89Google Scholar), and with our own finding that GnRH-A and TPA stimulate protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in αT3-1 cells. 2N. Reiss, D. Harris, and Z. Naor, manuscript in preparation. PKCδ in the membrane fraction is already of the high molecular weight form and is further elevated by GnRH-A and even more by TPA. In addition, translocation of PKCδ to the membrane fraction by GnRH-A and TPA is further validated by the appearance of degradation products of 70 and 42 kDa (apparently PKM; Refs. 6Naor Z. Zer J.

PKCε activation is manifested by translocation to the membrane fraction and the appearance of 50- and 42-kDa bands (apparently PKM) in the ligand-treated groups (2-fold; Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous reports that TPA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous PKC in αT3-1 cells reduced cellular PKC activity by 90% (12Shraga-Levine Z. Ben-Menahem D. Naor Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31028-31033Google Scholar, 21Ben-Menahem D. Naor Z. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3698-3704Google Scholar, 23Ben-Menahem D. Shraga-Levine Z. Mellon P.L. Naor Z. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 325-329Google Scholar), prolonged incubation with TPA (100 ng/ml, 24 h) resulted in loss of most of PKCε (60 and 90% of the membrane and soluble enzyme, respectively), and all of the detectable soluble and membrane-bound PKCδ (Fig. 1). The regulation of PKCδ and PKCε mRNA levels was determined by treatment of αT3-1 cells with [d-Trp6]GnRH, a stable GnRH analog. Addition of GnRH-A to the cells for 1 h elevated PKCε but not PKCδ mRNA levels in a dose-related fashion, with maximal response obtained at 10 nm analog (Fig. 2 A). Stimulation of PKCε mRNA levels by GnRH-A was rapid, with a peak at 1 h, declining thereafter to basal levels (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, significant elevation of PKCδ mRNA levels was detected only after 24 h of incubation with GnRH-A (3-fold, p < 0.001; Fig. 2 B). The effect of GnRH-A on PKCε mRNA levels was investigated further, since its rapid nature suggested that it more likely represents a physiological response to the neurohormone. Pretreatment of the cells with a potent GnRH antagonist (Fig.3 A) or with actinomycin D (Fig.3 B) abolished the stimulatory effect of GnRH-A upon PKCε mRNA levels, indicating a receptor-mediated effect apparently at the transcriptional level (Fig. 3). The potential role of PKC and Ca2+ in mediating the GnRH response upon PKCε mRNA levels was investigated since both messengers were implicated in GnRH action upon gonadotropin release and gonadotropin subunits gene expression (5Hirota K.

Addition of the PKC activator TPA to αT3-1 cells for 1 h resulted in elevation of PKCε but not PKCδ mRNA levels, while the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, had no effect (Fig.4, A and C, and data not shown). Elevation of PKCε mRNA levels by TPA was rapid, with a peak at 1 h and a return to basal levels (Fig. 4 B). The similar time responses elicited by GnRH-A and TPA suggest that PKC is involved in GnRH-A stimulation of PKCε gene expression. This notion was further supported by inhibition and depletion of PKC. Addition of the selective PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (27Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Maritny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinsky J.F. J. Biol.

Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). The drug alone (1 μm) reduced the basal level by about 50%, suggesting that PKC is also involved in the maintenance of basal PKCε gene expression. We also used down-regulation of endogenous PKC by prolonged incubation with TPA. Pretreatment of the cells with TPA (100 ng/ml, 24 h) reduced cellular PKC activity by 90% as measured by enzymatic activity assay and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 and Refs.12Shraga-Levine Z. Ben-Menahem D. Naor Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31028-31033Google Scholar, 21Ben-Menahem D. Naor Z. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3698-3704Google Scholar, and 23Ben-Menahem D. Shraga-Levine Z. Mellon P.L. Naor Z. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 325-329Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of GnRH-A and TPA upon PKCε mRNA levels was abolished in the down-regulated cells (Fig.5 B). In addition, we observed no additivity between GnRH-A and TPA upon PKCε mRNA levels (Fig. 6), lending further support to the role of PKC in mediating the GnRH-A effect on PKCε gene expression. The Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, had no effect on basal PKCε mRNA levels or on the stimulatory response elicited by GnRH-A or TPA (Fig. 6). On the other hand, transfer of αT3-1 cells to Ca2+ free medium, in the presence or absence of EGTA, abolished stimulation of PKCε mRNA levels by GnRH-A (Fig. 7). It therefore seems that Ca2+ is necessary but not sufficient for mediation of the GnRH-A response.Figure 6Lack of additivity between GnRH-A and TPA upon PKCε mRNA elevation. αT3-1 cells were treated with or without GnRH-A (10 nm), TPA (100 ng/ml), or ionomycin (1 μm) or in combinations, for 60 min.

We therefore examined the role of serum in PKCε and PKCδ gene expression. Transfer of the cells to medium with low serum (0.5%) for 24 h had no effect on GnRH-A-stimulation of PKCε mRNA levels (Fig. 8). On the other hand, serum starvation advanced the stimulation of PKCδ mRNA levels by GnRH-A to 1 h of incubation that could not be observed in serum-grown cells (Fig. 8). Time course of PKCδ mRNA levels in serum-starved cells revealed a rapid effect of GnRH-A at 1 h of incubation with no effect at 24 h, as seen in non-starved cells (Fig.9 A). Similarly, serum starvation exposed a rapid response (peak at 30 min) of TPA on PKCδ mRNA levels (Fig.9 B), suggesting a role for PKC in mediating PKCδ gene expression. Indeed, down-regulation of endogenous PKC by prolonged incubation with TPA abolished GnRH-A and TPA stimulation of PKCδ mRNA levels in serum-starved cells (Fig. 10). Transfer of the cells to Ca2+ free medium, in the presence or absence of EGTA, abolished the rapid stimulation of PKCδ in serum-starved cells (Fig. 11).Figure 9Effect of GnRH-A and TPA upon PKCδ mRNA levels in serum-starved cells. αT3-1 cells were serum-starved (0.5% serum) for 24 h, washed, and incubated with GnRH-A (10 nm, A) or TPA (100 ng/ml, B) for the indicated time periods.

PKCδ mRNA levels were analyzed as described under “Methods” (n = 6). ** p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown above, when cells are transferred to serum-free medium and exposed to GnRH-A, elevation of PKCδ mRNA levels is observed at 24 h, but not at 1 h of incubation (Fig. 12,columns 1–3). On the other hand, when cells are first serum- starved (24 h) and later exposed to GnRH-A, elevation of PKCδ mRNA levels is observed after 1 but not 24 h of incubation (Fig. 12, columns 4–6). We therefore exposed normal cells to GnRH-A for 1 h, washed the cells several times to remove serum and GnRH-A, and further incubated the cells for 24 h. As seen in Fig. 12 (columns 7 and 8), PKCδ mRNA levels were elevated at 24 h by pretreatment (1 h) with GnRH-A. Thus, the late effect of GnRH-A on PKCδ mRNA levels (Fig. 12, column 3) is due to generation of a rapid signal (1 h, column 5), which is “memorized” during the long starvation period (t½ ≅ 12 h) required for manifestation of the early signal by means of removal of the inhibitory effect of the serum.

Differentiation regulators of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) such as 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, retinoic acid, and dimethyl sulfoxide, were shown to increase the expression of PKCα and PKCβ mRNA levels (10Makowske M. Ballester R. Cayre Y. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3402-3410Google Scholar, 11Obeid L.M. Okazaki T. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2370-2374Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcriptional activation of PKCα and PKCβ expression was reported to result in increased PKC enzymatic activity (10Makowske M. Ballester R. Cayre Y. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3402-3410Google Scholar, 11Obeid L.M. Okazaki T. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2370-2374Google Scholar, 32Brick-Ghannam C. Ericson M.L. Schelle I. Charron D. Hum. Immunol. 1994; 41: 216-224Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that GnRH-A, which does not promote growth or differentiation, is capable of activating differential nPKC isoforms gene expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a natural ligand stimulation of PKCδ and PKCε mRNA levels. Activation of PKCδ mRNA levels, but not that of PKCε, is dependent upon growth conditions, suggesting the presence of a serum factor that is involved in regulation of PKCδ gene expression, possibly via a serum response element. The differential activation of PKCδ and PKCε mRNA levels by GnRH-A suggests that the isoforms might specialize in different functions. PKCδ is the major subspecies in the 6-day-old rat pituitary and is markedly reduced in the 3-month-old pituitary (26Garcia-Navarro S. Marantz Y. Eyal R. Kalina M. Disatnik M.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Ben-Menahem D. Reiss N. Naor Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 103: 133-138Google Scholar). The opposite is observed for pituitary PKCε, which increases with age (26Garcia-Navarro S. Marantz Y. Eyal R. Kalina M. Disatnik M.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Ben-Menahem D. Reiss N. Naor Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 103: 133-138Google Scholar). Therefore, PKCδ and PKCε might play different roles during pituitary development. It was also shown that while PKCδ is involved in exocytosis, PKCε participates in feed-back inhibition of phospholipase C activity in rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cells (33Ozawa K. Yamada K. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2280-2283Google Scholar). In a recent study, GnRH was shown to translocate PKCε and PKCζ in αT3-1 cells while PKCδ was not detected (30Kratzmeier M. Poch A. Mukhopadhyay A.K. McArdle C.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 103-111Google Scholar). We report here that both the PKCδ and PKCε isoforms are expressed in the αT3-1 cells at the mRNA and protein levels and that they are translocated to the membranes and activated in response to GnRH-A, as also validated by the apparent formation of the PKM species (6Naor Z. Zer J. Zakut H. Hermon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8203-8207Google Scholar, 7Anderson W.B. Estival A. Tapiovaara H. Gopalakrishna R. Adv.

Chem. 1989; 264: 4088-4092Google Scholar). The differences between the reports are most likely due to the use of different PKC type-specific antibodies. While overexpression of PKCδ resulted in inhibition of growth rate in NIH 3T3 cells, overexpression of PKCε increased growth rate, and the transformed cells (NIH 3T3 or Rat 6 cells) formed tumors in nude mice (27Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Maritny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinsky J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Google Scholar, 34Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104Google Scholar). Since GnRH affect differentiated responses, it is possible that PKCδ and PKCε are involved in separate functions such as gonadotropin release and gonadotropin subunit gene expression during the hormone action. Elevation of mRNA of a given PKC isoform by ligands in general and by GnRH-A in particular might be a step in the life cycle of PKCs during hormone action to replenish the enzymes after translocation and degradation as shown in Fig. 1. The rapid effect (peak at 60 min) of GnRH-A upon PKCε and PKCδ (in serum-starved cells) mRNA levels might be physiologically relevant, since GnRH is released from the hypothalamus in a pulsatile manner at intervals of 1–2 h according to the species and its half-life is about 2–4 min (35Belchetz P.E. Plant T.M. Nakai Y. Keogh E.J. Knobil E. Science. 1978; 202: 631-633Google Scholar, 36Sarkar D.K. Fink G. J. Endocrinol. 1980; 86: 511-524Google Scholar, 37Fink G. Curtis A. Lyons V. McKerns K.W. Naor Z. Hormonal Control of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis. Plenum Press, New York1984: 89-100Google Scholar). Thus, prolonged responses such as those observed in Fig. 2 (24 h) are more difficult to interpret, since it is not clear whether multiple pulses of GnRH are capable of eliciting a similar response. Hence, we investigated in more detail the rapid effects of GnRH, which prompted us to identify the second messengers involved in the neurohormone action. Indeed, the PKC activator TPA mimicked the GnRH-A rapid responses and stimulated PKCε mRNA levels in serum-grown cells and PKCδ mRNA levels in serum-starved cells with a similar time course. Additionally, the stimulatory effect of GnRH-A on PKCδ and PKCε mRNA levels was abolished in PKC-down-regulated cells or by the use of the selective PKC inhibitor GF 109203x (27Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Maritny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinsky J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Google Scholar, 31Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Google Scholar) (present results and data not shown). We therefore suggest that GnRH-A stimulation of PKCδ and PKCε gene expression is autoregulated by PKC. While we show here positive regulation of PKCδ mRNA levels by GnRH-A and TPA, others have recently reported that PKCδ mRNA is down-regulated by TPA (4 h) in the mouse B lymphoma cell line A20 (38Shih N.-Y. Floyd-Smith G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16040-16046Google Scholar). The difference between the results might be due to the presence of a soluble destabilizing factor, which specifically accelerates degradation of PKCδ mRNA in A20 cells (38Shih N.-Y. Floyd-Smith G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16040-16046Google Scholar). Removal of Ca2+ abolished the effect of GnRH-A upon PKCδ and PKCε mRNA levels, but Ca2+ ionophore had no stimulatory effect. We therefore conclude that Ca2+ is necessary but not sufficient, while PKC is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the GnRH response. Furthermore, since removal of extracellular Ca2+ per se is not sufficient to block Ca2+ mobilization in pituitary cells (39Naor Z. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Ayalon D. Limor R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 512-520Google Scholar), the data suggest that GnRH-A-induced PKCδ and PKCε gene expression is mainly mediated by Ca2+ influx, apparently via L-type voltage-sensitive channels (39Naor Z. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Ayalon D. Limor R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 512-520Google Scholar). The data also suggest that a Ca2+-dependent PKC isoform might be involved in GnRH-A action. Since PKCδ and PKCε are differentially regulated by GnRH-A, it is unlikely that one regulates the expression of the other during the neurohormone action. Furthermore, it is unlikely that PKCε is involved in the process since its membrane-bound form (the active form) was reduced only by 60% by down-regulation, whereas the effect of GnRH-A was abolished. Further studies are required to identify the PKC isoforms and the site of Ca2+ action in the GnRH-A response. In addition to mediation by Ca2+ and PKC, elevation of PKCδ but not PKCε mRNA levels by GnRH-A and TPA required removal of a serum factor. Therefore, although PKCδ and PKCε gene expression share some common mechanisms, which are mediated by Ca2+ and PKC, they differ in sensitivity to the serum factor. Changes in the concentrations of the serum factor under physiological conditions might therefore enable preferential activation by GnRH of the two isotypes. Moreover, it was possible to first stimulate the cells with GnRH-A, and remove the hormone and serum for 24 h, at the end of which elevation of PKCδ mRNA levels by GnRH-A was detected. The observation is in contrast to previous observations, in which GnRH-stimulated LH release in perifused pituitary cells was terminated immediately after removal of the neurohormone (Ref. 40Naor Z. Katikineni M. Loumage E. Carcia-Vella A. Dufau M.L. Catt K.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 27: 213-220Google Scholar and data not shown). Since PKC is the main mediator of GnRH actions (5Hirota K.

The presence of the serum factor does not block the formation of downstream effectors involved in PKCδ gene expression, but only masks the effectors activity. Since growth conditions also affected TPA stimulation of PKCδ gene expression, it seems that the site of action of the serum factor is downstream to PKC activation. Since both Ca2+ and PKC participate in GnRH-stimulated PKCδ and PKCε gene expression, it is likely that transcriptional regulation of both isotypes by GnRH-A involves similar transcription factors but different coactivators and composite response elements (41Miner J.N.

The present report demonstrates differential activation of PKCδ and PKCε mRNA levels by GnRH-A that is dependent upon growth conditions and Ca2+ influx, and is autoregulated by PKC.

https://openalex.org/W2022064841,"Stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) are stimulated by a variety of agents and conditions that also activate the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE). Activation of the exchanger results in a rapid increase in intracellular pH (pHi), raising the possibility that cytosolic alkalinization may contribute to SAPK activation. This hypothesis was tested by manipulating the pHi of U937 cells using permeant weak bases. Three different bases increased pHi and caused a 4–12-fold increase in SAPK activity with a time course that paralleled intracellular alkalinization. p38, a related stress kinase, was also stimulated by the weak bases. Stimulation of the stress kinases was not accompanied by changes in cytosolic free calcium nor was the activation of SAPK achieved when calcium was elevated by thapsigargin or calcium ionophores. Weak bases not only alter the pH of the cytosol but also alkalinize endomembrane compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes. However, the latter do not appear to mediate the stimulation of SAPK, since neither bafilomycin A1 nor desipramine, agents that neutralize acidic endomembrane compartments, activated the kinase. Because hyperosmolarity acutely activates the NHE, we considered whether the resulting cytosolic alkalinization mediates the activation of SAPK upon cell shrinkage. The addition of amiloride or the omission of Na+, which were verified to inhibit NHE, did not prevent the osmotically induced activation of SAPK. We conclude that cytosolic alkalinization increases the activity of SAPK and p38 by a calcium-independent mechanism that does not involve acidic intracellular organelles. In addition, even though cell shrinkage is accompanied by alkalinization due to the activation of NHE, the increased pHi is not the main cause of the observed stimulation of SAPK upon hyperosmotic challenge.

These kinases are members of two parallel, yet independent cascades, with distinct upstream activators and downstream targets. SAPK is activated by SEK (MKK4), which is in turn stimulated by MEKK or MLK3 (1Yan M. Dal T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Google Scholar, 2Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar, 3Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Google Scholar). Similarly, p38 MAPK is activated by MKK3 and MKK6 (4Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar, 5Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Google Scholar). The effector pathways triggered by the stress kinases also differ: the preferred substrate of SAPK is c-Jun, a component of the transcription regulator AP-1 (6Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar, 7Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar), whereas MAPKAPK-2, a serine/threonine kinase, and the transcription factor ATF-2 are main targets of p38 MAPK (8Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Google Scholar, 9Gupta S. Cambell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar). The agonists and conditions that activate SAPK and/or p38 are remarkably varied. They include hyperosmolarity, inflammatory cytokines, heat shock, ultraviolet light, and protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide and anisomycin (for review, see Refs.10Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 303-319Google Scholar and 11Pelech S.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 551-554Google Scholar). Several of these stimuli also activate the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), a ubiquitous family of transmembrane proteins involved in the regulation of cytosolic pH, cellular volume, and transepithelial ion transport (for review, see Refs. 12Grinstein S. Rotin D. Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Google Scholar and 13Noel J. Poussygeur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Google Scholar). For example, hyperosmotic exposure, in most cells, leads to the rapid activation of the NHE (14Shrode L.D. Garcia-Caboda A. Goss G.G. Grinstein S. The Na+/H+ Exchange. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 101-122Google Scholar). Heat shock, another activator of SAPK, also increases NHE activity in Vero cells (15Ludt J. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 134: 143-153Google Scholar). Moreover, cytokines, including interleukin-1 and TNFα, activate NHE in myocytes (16Rozanski G.J. Witt R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1361-H1367Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (17Lee Y.Y. Kurtz I. Yamato K. el-Hajjoui Z. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1992; 79: 2262-2266Google Scholar), respectively. Ischemia/reperfusion, which activates SAPK (18Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26546-26551Google Scholar) and enhances binding of ATF-2 and c-Jun to DNA (19Morooka H. Bonventre J.V. Pombo C.M. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30084-30092Google Scholar), has likewise been associated with increased transport by the NHE (20Klein H.H. Pich S. Bohle R.M. Wollenweber J. Nebendahl K. Circulation. 1995; 92: 912-917Google Scholar). Finally, cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor that stimulates SAPK, has been shown to increase NHE activity as well (21Miller R.T. Pollock A.S. Warnock D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 157-159Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the activation of the stress kinases and the stimulation of the ion exchanger are related. The kinases may mediate the stimulation of the antiporter, although direct phosphorylation has been ruled out as the mechanism of NHE activation (22Grinstein S. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23823-23828Google Scholar). Conversely, the ionic changes initiated by the exchanger may trigger kinase activation. Enhanced NHE activity is expected to increase the intracellular Na+ concentration and elevate the cytosolic pH (pHi). These parameters could in turn activate SAPK and/or p38 MAPK. In this work, we examined the relationship between the cytosolic pH and the activation of the stress kinases. In particular, we analyzed the effects of alkalinization on SAPK and p38 MAPK and considered the possibility that shrinkage-induced activation of NHE is required for activation of the kinases. Radiolabeled ATP was purchased from Mandel/Dupont (Guelph, Ontario, Canada). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and the cell culture medium was prepared by the Media Department at Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). BCECF, indo-1, nigericin, and ionomycin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other materials were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies to SAPK and p38 MAPK were raised in rabbit against a pGEX vector containing full-length p54α SAPK or full-length p38, respectively. U937 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified environment under 5% CO2. For kinase assays, U937 cells were preincubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with only 0.5% fetal calf serum. To measure pHi, U937 cells were sedimented and resuspended in a Na-HEPES-buffered solution (NHB) containing (in mm): 117 NaCl, 25 Na-HEPES, 5.36 KCl, 1.66 MgSO4, 1.36 CaCl2, and 25 glucose, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. This suspension was then incubated with 1 μm acetoxymethyl ester form of BCECF for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were sedimented, resuspended in fresh NHB, placed into a polystyrene cuvette, and inserted into the thermally regulated (37 °C) holder of a Perkin-Elmer 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer. BCECF was continually excited at 495 nm, and emission was recorded at 525 nm. For each experiment, fluorescence emission was calibrated internallyversus pHi by using the high KCl/nigericin technique (23Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochem. J. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Google Scholar). U937 cells at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml were sedimented, resuspended in NHB, and incubated with 2 μm acetoxymethyl ester precursor of indo-1 for 25 min at room temperature. Cells were once again sedimented, resuspended in NHB, and incubated for an additional 15 min in NHB at 37 °C. Indo-1 fluorescence was monitored as described above, with the excitation at 331 nm and the emission recorded at 410 nm. Free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) was calculated as described previously (24MacDougall S.L. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. Cell. 1988; 54: 229-234Google Scholar). Briefly, Fmax and Fauto were obtained by adding 5 μm ionomycin and 1 mm MnCl2, respectively, and a dissociation constant of 250 nm for the indo-1-Ca2+ complex (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar) was used to calculate [Ca2+]i. Following incubation under the conditions specified in the text, aliquots of 5 × 106 U937 cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μmNa3VO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mmNaF2, and 1 mm benzamidine. After 20 min, the lysate was sheared through a 23-gauge needle, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 10 min. Samples were normalized for the amount of protein, and SAPK and p38 were immunoprecipitated from the lysates by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-SAPK (1:500 dilution) or anti-p38 (1:250) antibodies, respectively. Immune complexes were collected by adding 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads to the lysate and incubating for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with an ice-cold solution which contained 150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were sedimented and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, and 100 μm (800 nCi) [γ-32P]ATP, pH 7.5. For SAPK kinase assays we added 5 μg of a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase with residues 5–89 of c-Jun and incubated the samples at 30 °C for 30 min. The kinase reaction was terminated by adding 40 μl of 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and dried. Autoradiography was performed using Mandel/Dupont Reflection film, and radioactivity was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Kinase assays for p38 were performed similarly, except that a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein comprising the 178 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the NHE-1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger was used as a substrate. The construct encoding this fusion protein was the kind gift of Dr. L. Fliegel (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Equal loading of the immunoprecipitated kinases was confirmed in some of the experiments by immunoblotting with either anti-SAPK or anti-p38 antibodies. To resolve SAPK, which co-migrates with the heavy immunoglobulin chain, the samples were not reduced to avoid dissociation of the IgG complex. All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. of the number of experiments specified. Statistical differences between the control and individual experimental conditions were evaluated using Student's t test. Levels of significance are indicated in the figures (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001). Many of the substances and conditions that increase SAPK activity, can also lead to an increase in pHi by activating NHE (see the introduction). It was therefore of interest to establish whether these events are causally related. To this end, we studied the effects of cytosolic alkalinization on SAPK activity. pHi was manipulated by means of weak electrolytes, and the imposed changes were monitored fluorimetrically using BCECF. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, the pHi of suspended U937 cells increased rapidly upon addition of 30 mm NH4Cl. In six similar experiments, pHi rose from a resting value of 7.36 ± 0.04 to 7.76 ± 0.03 within 10 s. The alkalinization was transient with pHi returning to near-basal levels within 10 min 7.42 ± 0.03 (Fig. 1, A andB). This recovery likely reflects gradual entry of NH4+ via K+ channels and/or the Na+/K+ pump. We next determined the effect of this alkalinization on SAPK activity. A comparable exposure of the cells to 30 mm NH4Cl resulted in a reproducible 4-fold increase in SAPK activity (Fig. 1 C), which was noticeable as early as 5 min and was sustained for up to 30 min (Fig.1, C and D). Treatment with the weak base did not alter the efficiency of SAPK immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 C,lower panel). The data described above cannot discern whether NH4Cl exerts its stimulatory effect on SAPK by alkalinizing the cytosol or by other means. To ascertain the mechanism of activation, we compared the effects of two other weak bases, namely trimethylamine (TMA) and triethylamine (TrEA). As shown in Fig. 1, A andB, these bases also induced a brisk increase in pHifrom 7.43 ± 0.01 to 7.85 ± 0.06 and from 7.41 ± 0.01 to 7.86 ± 0.04 (n = 3), respectively. Unlike the effects of NH4Cl, however, the alkalinization induced by TMA and TrEA persisted after 10 min (Fig. 1, A andB). The much slower decay of the alkalinization reflects the slower permeation of the protonated forms of the organic amines. Both TMA and TrEA also activated SAPK (Fig. 1 C). In fact, the stimulation of the kinase was greater and progressed over the course of the experiment. After a 5-min incubation in either TMA or TrEA, SAPK activity increased 6-fold (Fig. 1 D). By 10 min, the stimulation was 8-fold, and it was nearly 10-fold by 30 min. The more pronounced activation of the kinase parallels the sustained alkalinization of the cytosol. Jointly, these results suggest that SAPK is responsive to changes in the cytosolic pH, regardless of the agent used to impose them. The effect of the weak bases was not osmotic in nature, since care was taken to maintain the total osmolarity constant by reducing the content of NaCl when the bases were added. In fact, the cell volume (measured electronically using the Coulter Channelyzer) was not detectably reduced even when the bases were added on top of the normal osmotic complement of the medium, likely because the permeation of the weak base increased the osmotic content of the cells, which compensated at least in part for the increased extracellular osmolarity. Changes in intracellular pH are often accompanied by an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Because it has been previously shown in T lymphocytes that elevated [Ca2+]i in conjunction with TPA stimulation activates SAPK (26Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 236-727Google Scholar), we evaluated the role of this divalent cation in SAPK activation by alkalosis. For this purpose, we compared the effects of NH4Cl to those of calcium ionophores and of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endomembrane Ca2+ATPases. By inhibiting pumping into the endoplasmic reticulum, thapsigargin unmasks an endogenous calcium “leak” which results in a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i. The capacitative coupling between depleted stores and the plasmalemmal calcium channels facilitates calcium influx, inducing a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i when cells are suspended in calcium-containing media (27Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar). These phenomena were readily reproduced in U937, as shown in Fig. 2 A. When exposed to 30 nm thapsigargin, U937 cells responded with a large and sustained rise in [Ca2+]i from a steady-state level of 375 ± 30 (n = 10) to 1040 ± 104 nm (n = 5) (Fig. 2, A andB). Even higher levels of [Ca2+]i were attained by exposure to 1 μm ionomycin, a non-fluorescent calcium ionophore. The precise [Ca2+]i levels attained with ionomycin could not be defined, because they exceeded the dynamic range of the probe used (indo-1, Kd 250 nm). By contrast, [Ca2+]i did not significantly increase at any time after addition of 30 mmNH4Cl (after 5 min [Ca2+]i was 238 ± 8 nm (n = 5) (Fig. 2,A and B)). In fact, exposure to NH4Cl after [Ca2+]i had been elevated by thapsigargin resulted in a sizable decrease in the cytosolic concentration of the cation. After 5 min of incubation with TMA or TrEA [Ca2+]i averaged 260 ± 1 and 343 ± 4 nm, respectively. It therefore appears unlikely that alkalinization-induced activation of SAPK is mediated by an increase in [Ca2+]i. This notion was confirmed by comparing the effects of the weak base on SAPK with those elicited by thapsigargin or the calcium ionophores. Thapsigargin, ionomycin, and A23187 produced only a modest stimulation of SAPK up to 10 min after addition, much smaller than that induced by anisomycin (Fig. 1,C and D). The effects of these calcium mobilizing agents are considerably smaller than those of the weak bases (cf. Fig. 1), despite the much greater effects of the former on [Ca2+]i. Thus, an increase in [Ca2+]i cannot explain the stimulatory effects of weak bases on SAPK. Exposure of cells to permeating weak bases will alkalinize not only the cytoplasm but also intracellular compartments, particularly those that are maintained at an acidic pH by vacuolar H+-ATPases. It is therefore possible that the stimulatory effect of the weak bases on SAPK is mediated by a pH change within an endomembrane compartment. This is particularly relevant since Verheijet al. (28Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Google Scholar) showed that TNFα activates SAPK via ceramide, which is generated by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin within both neutral and acidic compartments. Therefore, it was conceivable that NH4Cl induced activation of SAPK through modulation of sphingomyelinase activity in an acidic compartment. Two approaches were used to test this possibility. First, we preincubated cells with desipramine, which has previously been shown to inhibit acidic sphingomyelinase by neutralizing the acidic compartment (29Andieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B, preincubation with 10 μm desipramine for 1 h had no effect on SAPK activity, but obliterated the ability of TNFα to activate SAPK. In contrast, desipramine had no effect on the ability of NH4Cl to activate SAPK. The role of endomembrane acidic compartments was also evaluated using bafilomycin A1, a potent and very selective inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPases. This inhibitor permeates into the cells, reaches the ATPases of intracellular compartments, and thereby dissipates their pH gradients, while affecting the cytosolic pH minimally. Unlike the weak bases, treatment with 100 nmbafilomycin for up to 1 h had only a marginal statistically insignificant (p > 0.1) effect on SAPK activity (Fig.3, C and D). In addition, pretreatment with bafilomycin did not preclude the ability of NH4Cl to activate SAPK. Therefore, neutralization of acidic endomembrane compartments is not likely the mechanism whereby weak bases activate SAPK. Changes in the pH of intracellular compartments are similarly unlikely to play a role in the activation of SAPK effected osmotically or by anisomycin. This conclusion was derived from the experiments in Fig.4. Neither desipramine nor bafilomycin, at concentrations known to inhibit acidic sphingomyelinase and the H+ pump, respectively, had a significant inhibitory effect on the activation of SAPK by anisomycin or by hypertonic sorbitol (Fig.4, A–D). p38 MAPK, a homolog of the yeast Hog1 protein, is also a member of the stress-activated protein kinase family (30Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Google Scholar). Like SAPK, p38 MAPK is activated by anisomycin, hyperosmolarity, and the cytokines interleukin-1 and TNFα (10Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 303-319Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that, like SAPK, p38 MAPK could also be activated by changes in cytosolic pH. Thus, U937 cells were exposed to either NH4Cl or TMA, and the activity of immunoprecipitated p38 MAPK was assessedin vitro using as a substrate the carboxyl-terminal domain of NHE-1, which we had found earlier to be effectively phosphorylated by this kinase. 2L. D. Shrode, E. A. Rubie, J. R. Woodgett, and S. Grinstein, unpublished observations. As illustrated in Fig.5, exposure to NH4Cl resulted in a 5-fold increase in p38 MAPK activity detectable within 5 min and maintained through 30 min. Similar results were obtained with the organic base TMA, suggesting that, like SAPK, p38 MAPK is responsive to changes in pHi. As in the case of SAPK, the weak bases did not affect the efficiency of p38 immunoprecipitation (lower panel in Fig.5 A). In addition to activating SAPK and p38 MAPK, hyperosmotic treatment also increases pHi. This cytosolic alkalinization in most cells is mediated by the shrinkage-induced activation of the Na+/H+exchanger (NHE). Since our present data show that alkalinization suffices to activate SAPK as well as p38 MAPK, we entertained the possibility that shrinkage-induced alkalinization, mediated by the NHE, is responsible for the observed activation of the kinases. When exposed to a hyperosmotic solution, U937 cells underwent a rapid intracellular alkalinization (Fig. 6 A). pH increased at a rate of 0.05 ± 0.007 pH unit/min to a new steady-state pHi of 7.58 ± 0.05 (n = 6). As reported for other cell types, this shrinkage-induced alkalinization in U937 cells was Na+-dependent and inhibited by amiloride (Fig. 6 A). Indeed, in the absence of external Na+ or in the presence of the diuretic, pHi became more acidic, at a rate of −0.02 ± 0.005 (n = 3) and −0.06 ± 0.05 pH units/min (n = 3), respectively. These findings confirm that cell shrinkage activates the NHE in U937 cells. We then tested whether the alkalinization generated by the antiporter is responsible for stimulation of SAPK. Cells were stimulated with hypertonic sorbitol, and the extent of SAPK activation was tested in otherwise untreated cells or under conditions shown above to preclude antiporter-mediated alkalinization of the cytosol. As shown in Fig.6 B, SAPK was comparably activated in Na+-containing and Na+-free media, in the presence and absence of amiloride. Summarized data from multiple experiments are presented in Fig. 6 C. We conclude that, while alkalinization alone can activate SAPK and p38 MAPK, osmotic stimulation of the NHE is not responsible for the activation of SAPK. Because a variety of stimuli concomitantly activate SAPK and the NHE, we considered the possibility that these events are related. Our data indicate that a cytosolic alkalinization of a magnitude comparable to that attained by stimulating the antiport suffices to activate SAPK and p38 MAPK. While these data are suggestive of a causal relationship, subsequent experiments demonstrated that activation of the kinases occurs even when NHE-induced alkalinization is precluded pharmacologically or by ionic substitution. These findings rule out that the activation of SAPK and p38 MAPK is secondary to the activation of Na+/H+ exchange. The converse relationship, namely that the NHE is stimulated by a pathway involving the stress kinases, remains a viable possibility. Alternatively, the two events may lie on parallel pathways, which could conceivably share common upstream elements. In this regard, independent studies have shown that members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins can stimulate SAPK (2Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar, 31Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Google Scholar) as well as NHE activity (32Hooley R. Yu C.-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Google Scholar). Cdc42 has been found to activate Rac which in turn can activate Rho (33Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar). These GTP-binding proteins regulate the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fibers, and it is noteworthy that NHE-1, the “housekeeping” isoform of the antiporter, has been reported to accumulate at or near these structures (34Grinstein S. Woodside M. Waddell T.K. Downey G.P. Orlowski J. Pouyssegur J. Wong D.C.P. Foskett J.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5209-5218Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that activation of Cdc42, Rac, and/or Rho promotes the interaction between the NHE and the cytoskeleton, thereby increasing antiport activity, as well as activating SAPK pathways. Alternatively, heterotrimeric G proteins could be the common step leading to the parallel activation of NHE and the stress kinases. Prasad et al. (35Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.E. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Google Scholar) demonstrated that constitutively active GTPase-deficient mutants of Gα12 and Gα13promote the activation of SAPK. Interestingly, Gα13 has also been shown to activate the NHE (36Kitamura K. Singer W.D. Cano A. Miller R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C101-C110Google Scholar), seemingly via pathways involving small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family and MEKK1 (32Hooley R. Yu C.-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Google Scholar). Thus, Gα13 may give rise to the coordinate, yet independent activation of SAPK and NHE by cell shrinkage or other stimulants. Parallel yet independent activation of the stress kinases and of the NHE is also suggested by the diverging time courses of these events in cells challenged with hypertonic solutions: cation exchange is noticeable and attains maximal rate within seconds, while full osmotic activation of SAPK or p38 MAPK is delayed, reaching maximal level tens of minutes after cell shrinkage (see Ref. 37Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Google Scholar). This temporal disparity suggests that the two responses may have different functional roles in cell volume homeostasis. We speculate that the early response of the antiporter is intended to accomplish the acute phase of regulatory volume increase, an immediate defense against osmotic perturbation. In addition, however, chronic exposure of cells to hyperosmolarity is known to be counterbalanced by a slower accumulation of organic osmolytes (38Chamberlin M.E. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C159-C173Google Scholar). The latter process depends on an increase in biosynthetic enzymes (39Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1018-1115Google Scholar) and in the abundance of organic osmolyte transporters (40Kwon, H. M., Cellular and Molecular Physiology of Cell Volume Regulation, 1994, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL.Google Scholar), which are in turn associated with elevated mRNA levels (41Paredes A. McManus M. Kwon H.M. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1282-C1288Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that activation of the stress kinases signals an increase in transcription via activation of c-Jun or ATF-2, to prepare the cell for a prolonged period of hyperosmotic exposure. In summary, stressful situations seemingly activate both NHE as well as SAPK and p38 MAPK. While alkalinization such as that generated by Na+/H+ exchange is capable of stimulating the stress kinases, neither chemical (anisomycin) nor physical stresses (hypertonicity) require a pH change to exert their stimulatory effect on the kinases. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that other situations leading to stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange may secondarily lead to activation of the stress kinases. Stimulation of the exchanger can be induced by integrin engagement, activation of mitogenic receptors, and by some hormones, and some of these treatments also result in activation of stress kinases. Because upon osmotic cell shrinkage stimulation of NHE precedes activation of the kinases, we find it unlikely that SAPK and/or p38 MAPK mediates the stimulation of the antiporter. Instead, we favor the hypothesis that the two events are parallel yet independent responses, perhaps triggered by a common early event such as activation of small or heterotrimeric G proteins. The divergent activation of these pathways may provide the cell with separate complementary responses to the early and sustained phases of stressful perturbations."

At the carboxyl-terminal end of the propeptide, XMMP has a 37-amino acid-long insertion domain containing a segment that is 38% identical with a rat vitronectin sequence between residues 108–135.

Many MMPs are expressed widely during embryogenesis but not in adult life, suggesting that MMPs and the degradation and remodeling of ECM play an important role in growth and development. Thus far, 14 genetically distinct MMPs have been cloned and characterized from humans. They include three different collagenases, which are the only enzymes that can cleave fibril-forming collagens such as collagen types I, II, and III, the most abundant proteins in the body. Gelatinases A and B, also known as 72- and 92-kDa type IV collagenases, digest denatured collagen (gelatin) and basement membranes, a special type of ECM of epithelial, endothelial, fat, muscle, and peripheral nerve cells (8Martin G.R. Timpl R. Kuhn K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 1-50Google Scholar). Stromelysins are three different MMPs with wide substrate specificity, and stromelysin-1 degrades almost any ECM component including cartilage proteoglycans (9Bonassar L.J. Frank E.H. Murray J.C. Paguio C.G. Moore V.L. Lark M.W. Sandy J.D. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Grodzinsky A.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 173-183Google Scholar).All MMPs are produced as inactive proenzymes, which are activated by proteolytic removal of their NH2-terminal domain (10Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Google Scholar, 11Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Google Scholar, 12Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is significant that stromelysin-1 (MMP3) proteolytically activates other MMPs such as interstitial collagenase-1 (MMP1), matrilysin (MMP7), and 92 kDa type IV collagenase (MMP9), suggesting that stromelysin-1 plays a special “upstream” role in ECM degradation and remodeling (14Murphy G. Cockett M.I. Stephens P.E. Smith B.J. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 265-268Google Scholar, 15Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Google Scholar, 16Imai K,.

Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25548-25554Google Scholar). These new MMPs are not secreted but remain anchored to the cell surface through their COOH-terminal transmembrane domain, and accordingly, they were named membrane type-MMPs (MT-MMPs). Studies on the human MT1-MMP indicate that it activates gelatinase A (MMP2), suggesting that MT-MMPs may facilitate pericellular matrix degradation at the cell surface and promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis (12Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Google Scholar,17Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Google Scholar). Our in situ mRNA hybridization studies on the developmental expression of the chicken MT3-MMP gene show that it is expressed at high levels in several embryonic tissues such as neural tube, dorsal root ganglia, respiratory epithelium, and developing cartilage and muscle (22Yang M. Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Fujii J.T. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25548-25554Google Scholar).To gain insight on the role of MMPs in early vertebrate development, we used two “universal” MMP primers (22Yang M. Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Fujii J.T. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25548-25554Google Scholar) and RT-PCR to clone cDNAs for six different MMPs from Xenopus laevis embryos of different developmental stages. Here we describe the cloning and developmental expression of a novel MMP called XMMP. XenopusXMMP contains 604 amino acids including a putative 22-residue signal peptide, suggesting that XMMP is a secretory protein. XMMP contains an RRKR motif at the carboxyl-terminal end of the propeptide, suggesting that it is proteolytically activated intracellularly by furin proteinases. In the propeptide, XMMP also has a 37-amino acid-long insertion domain (ID) not found in other MMPs. XMMP lacks a proline-rich hinge region typically found in other MMPs between the catalytic domain and carboxyl-terminal hemopexin/vitronectin-like domain. Interestingly, the XMMP gene is transiently expressed in gastrula and neurula stage embryos. In comparison, otherXenopus MMPs that we have cloned show a different pattern of gene expression. The 92-kDa type collagenase (MMP9) mRNA is inherited as a maternal mRNA in the blastula stage embryo and expressed throughout the later developmental stages. Stromelysin-1, stromelysin-3, and two different MT-MMP genes (MT2-MMP and MT3-MMP) are first abundantly expressed in pretailbud embryo.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAll MMPs, from a variety of species including a collagenase-like hatching enzyme from sea urchin (33Lepage T. Gache C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3003-3012Google Scholar), have two highly conserved sequence domains. The first domain is at the carboxyl-terminal end of the propeptide: PRCG(N/V)D, and the second is in the zinc binding site: VA(A/V)HE(F/I/L)GH. We synthesized two universal MMP primers for these domains (22Yang M. Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Fujii J.T. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25548-25554Google Scholar) and used RT-PCR to clone cDNAs for six different MMPs from Xenopus embryos at different stages of development. From the blastula embryos (stage 8), only one major PCR product of about 900-bp was detected (Fig. 1 A,top). This was cloned, sequenced, and identified as theXenopus homologue of 92-kDa type IV collagenase (data not shown). Using the universal MMP primers, the 900-bp product was barely detectable (yet visible in the original gel) in later developmental stages of gastrula, neurula, and pretailbud embryos. However, using RT-PCR and specific primers for the Xenopus 92-kDa type IV collagenase, it was detected at similar levels in all developmental stages (Fig. 1 A, bottom). Apparently, in later stages other more abundant MMP mRNA templates compete for the same universal MMP primers in PCR. In a control experiment, we also found throughout the development comparable levels of expression of rpL8 mRNA encoding a Xenopus ribosomal protein (Fig.1 A, middle).From the Xenopus embryos of gastrula (stage 13), neurula (stage 15), and pre-tailbud (stage 24) stages, a prominent PCR product of about 550 bp was detected (Fig. 1 A, top). Cloning and sequencing of this product showed that it contained several different MMP-related sequences. From gastrula and neurula embryos, this product contained a sequence derived from a novel member of the MMP family (called XMMP) that was further characterized as described below. From pretailbud embryos, this product contained two different sequences derived from two different Xenopus MT-MMPs that are, respectively, similar to MT2-MMP and MT3-MMP from human and chicken (Refs. 19Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Google Scholar, 20Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23013-23020Google Scholar, and 22Yang M. Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Fujii J.T. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25548-25554Google Scholar; data not shown).A second prominent PCR product of 350 bp from pretailbud embryos, visible also from neurula embryos (Fig. 1, top), was found to contain two additional MMP-related sequences. One sequence represents a Xenopus homologue for stromelysin-1 (data not shown), and the other is identical to the Xenopusstromelysin-3 sequence (data not shown) as described previously by Patterton et al. (28Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Google Scholar).In Northern blotting, the novel Xenopus XMMP gene was found to encode a single 3.0-kilobase pair mRNA. It is particularly striking that this transcript, which was undetected in blastula stage embryo, is first induced at gastrula and continues to be expressed at high level at neurula stage. In comparison, this transcript almost completely disappears in pretailbud embryo, suggesting that XMMP gene is down-regulated in later Xenopus development (Fig.1 B).Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends, a 5′ and 3′ end RT-PCR strategy of cDNA cloning (see “Materials and Methods”), allowed us to determine 3217 nucleotides and the complete 604-amino acid sequence for the novel Xenopus XMMP (Fig. 2, deposited as GenBankTM accession number U82541). XMMP contains a putative signal peptide of 22 amino acids with a characteristic hydropathy profile (30von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Google Scholar), and no other significant hydrophobic seqments, suggesting that it is a secretory protein. The sequence contains five potential sites for N-linked sugars (Asn173, Asn267, Asn419, Asn422, and Asn588) and nine Cys residues, four of them in the putative signal peptide. Of note is that Cys273 (circled in Fig. 2), which is an insertion, is not found in any other MMPs except NMMP, another novel MMP that we recently cloned from cultured primary chicken embryo fibroblasts. 3M. Yang and M. Kurkinen, manuscript in preparation. Excluding the signal peptide and any post-translational modifications, Xenopus XMMP has a calculated molecular weight of 70,115.In comparison with the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana tadpole collagenase (34Oofusa K. Yomori S. Yoshizato K. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 345-350Google Scholar), Xenopus collagenase-3 (MMP13, GenBank™ accession number L49412), and Xenopus stromelysin-3 (28Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Google Scholar), XMMP is most related to stromelysin-3 (20% identical amino acids). As shown in Fig. 3, a sequence alignment reveals 21% (131/635) identical residues between all four frog MMPs. One conspicuous feature of the Xenopus XMMP that makes it different from all other MMPs is a 37-amino acid-long ID, related to vitronectin (see below), that is situated at the end of the propeptide after the conserved PRCGVPD domain. In stromelysin-3 and MT-MMPs, a similarly located insertion is 8–13 residues long (19Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Google Scholar, 20Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23013-23020Google Scholar, 21Puente X.S. Pendas A.M. Liano E. Velasco G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949Google Scholar, 22Yang M. Hayashi K. Hayashi M.

After the insertion domain there is an RRKR motif (Fig. 3), which is a putative cleavage site for intracellular furin, a Golgi-associated proteinase family. This and a related motif are also found in stromelysin-3 (RQKR) and MT-MMPs (RRKR or RRRR). Pei and Weiss (11Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Google Scholar, 12Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Google Scholar) recently showed that this motif leads to an unusual intracellular activation of the human stromelysin-3 and MT1-MMP by a furin-dependent mechanism. Accordingly, XenopusXMMP may be proteolytically activated by a similar intracellular mechanism.Another conspicuous feature of XMMP is that it lacks a proline-rich linker peptide or hinge region typically found in all other MMPs between the catalytic domain and COOH-terminal hemopexin/vitronectin-like domain (6Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Google Scholar, 7Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair.2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 427-474Google Scholar). Matrilysin (MMP7) lacks the linker peptide and the carboxyl-terminal domain altogether. A recent crystal structure study of porcine interstitial collagenase (MMP1) revealed that the hinge region is a highly exposed 17-residue peptide IYGPSENPVQPSGPQTPQVCD (residues 261–277 underlined) with no secondary structure (35Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Blow D.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, we suggest that in other MMPs, a homologously placed hinge region is 17–72 residues long and most pronounced in the 92-kDa type IV collagenase. We also note that a common feature of the hinge region is that it begins with glycine and ends with proline three residues upstream of the conserved cysteine residue. The hinge region, which appears to be the most variable region of MMPs, plays a role in MMP activity and substrate selection (for references, see Ref. 35Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Blow D.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Google Scholar).Similar to other MMPs, the COOH-terminal domain of XMMP contains four tandem repeats of a motif similar to that in vitronectin, an abundant cell adhesion protein in plasma and tissues (36Otter M. Kuiper J. Rijken D. van Zonneveld A.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 563-572Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain plays a role in the substrate specificity and possibly other protein-protein interactions of MMPs (6Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Google Scholar, 7Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair.2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 427-474Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of porcine collagenase this domain is folded as a four-bladed β-propeller (35Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Blow D.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, we have discovered that XMMP repeats 2, 3, and 4 are 21–33% identical to a sequence encoded by vitronectin exon-5 (residues 213–264), whereas repeat 1 is more related to a sequence encoded by vitronectin exon-4 (residues 166–212). The similarity of the four tandem repeats is also obvious in the consensus MMP sequence (49Sang Q.A. Douglas D.A. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 137-160Google Scholar); they are 24–39% identical with the sequence encoded by vitronectin exon-5. We note that vitronectin exons 4 and 5 code for related sequences (30% identical), suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestral exon (50Jenne D. Stanley K.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6735-6742Google Scholar). Furthermore, we find that the ID sequence of XMMP (residues 146–173) is 38% identical and 62% chemically similar with a rat vitronectin sequence between residues 108–135. The biological significance, if any, of the ID of XMMP is not known at present. In comparison with the sequences encoded by vitronectin exons 4 and 5, which are highly conserved in evolution, the vitronectin sequence of residues 108–135 is not conserved between rat, rabbit, mouse, and human (36Otter M. Kuiper J. Rijken D. van Zonneveld A.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 563-572Google Scholar). It is also of interest that the COOH-terminal hemopexin/vitronectin-like domain of MMPs is highly conserved in the COOH-terminal end of nectinepsin from quail. Nectinepsin is a novel ECM protein with an RGD cell binding motif and an aspartyl proteinase domain (37Blancher C. Omri B. Bidou L. Pessac B. Crisanti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26220-26226Google Scholar).Figure 5Evolutionary conservation of XMMP and vitronectin. A, alignment of ID sequence with a rat vitronectin sequence between residues 108–135.

B, four tandem XMMP repeats (see Fig. 2) are aligned with sequences encoded by rat vitronectin exons 4 and 5.Bold residues are identical between XMMP and vitronectin.C, rat vitronectin exons 4 and 5 encode sequences with 30% (16 of 53) identical amino acids shown in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When we searched the 3217-nucleotide sequence of XMMP for human and mouse ESTs in data bases, we could not find any significant matches by these analyses. This is interesting, especially because there are already 465,858 ESTs from human and 63,404 ESTs from mouse (August, 1996). Because these ESTs are derived from a variety of tissues, mainly from adult tissues, it is reasonable to propose that the XMMP gene is expressed specifically during early vertebrate development. This is in line with our recent results by Northern blotting and RT-PCR indicating only low levels of XMMP transcript in select adult Xenopustissues such as heart, liver, and ovaries. 4M. Yang, M. T. Murray, and M. Kurkinen, unpublished data. Thirty-five years ago Jerry Gross described the first evidence for MMPs as “a diffusible collagenolytic factor” from bullfrog tadpole tissues in culture (38Gross J. Lapiere C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 1014-1022Google Scholar), and then asked how tadpoles lose their tails. (39Gross J. J. Invest. Dermat. 1966; 47: 274-277Google Scholar). Part of the answer may involve collagenase-1 (MMP1) that Oofusaet al. (34Oofusa K. Yomori S. Yoshizato K. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 345-350Google Scholar) recently cloned from metamorphosing bullfrog tadpoles. During frog metamorphosis, also the small intestine of tadpoles goes through a rapid tissue remodeling, epithelial cell death and renewal by adult-like epithelial cells. When Shi and colleagues (28Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Google Scholar) studied this in more detail by in situ hybridization, they found that stromelysin-3 mRNA was abundantly expressed in several stromal cells surrounding the dying intestinal epithelial cells. These data, as well as studies by Werb and Bissell and their colleagues on the role of stromelysin-1 expression during the involution of mouse mammary glands (40Sympson C.J. Talhouk R.S. Alexander C.M. Chin J.R. Clift S.M. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 681-693Google Scholar, 41Boudreau N. Sympson C.J. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Science. 1995; 267: 891-893Google Scholar), suggest that proteolytic degradation of the ECM by MMPs plays an important morphogenetic role in vertebrate development and tissue remodeling.In conclusion, we have studied here only a few early stages ofXenopus embryo development for the expression of MMP genes (blastula, gastrula, neurula, and pretailbud) and cloned cDNAs for six different MMPs, including a novel MMP called XMMP. Using the universal MMP primers (22Yang M. Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Fujii J.T. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25548-25554Google Scholar) and RT-PCR we expect to clone other members of the MMP family from other stages of Xenopus development, morphogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Our results make it clear that MMPs are an evolutionary conserved family of ECM degrading enzymes inXenopus. Future experiments will explore in more detail the role of MMPs in early vertebrate development.AddendumThree novel MMPs were recently cloned, Xenopus collagenase-4 by Stolow et al. (46Stolow M.A. Bauzon D.D. Li J. Sedgwick T. Liang V., C.-T. Sang Q.A. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1471-1483Google Scholar), human MMP18 by Cossins et al. (47Cossins J. Dudgeon T.J. Catlin G. Gearing A.J.H. Clements J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 494-498Google Scholar)and porcine enamelysin by Bartlett et al. (48Bartlett J.D. Simmer J.P. Xue J. Margolis H.C. Moreno E.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 183: 123-128Google Scholar). The XMMP described here is distinct from these MMPs. Proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; EST, expressed sequence tag; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MT-MMP, membrane-type MMP; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-coupled PCR; bp, base pair(s); ID, insertion domain. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; EST, expressed sequence tag; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MT-MMP, membrane-type MMP; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-coupled PCR; bp, base pair(s); ID, insertion domain. of cells and tissues is largely controlled by a superfamily of enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs; Refs. 1Brenner C.A.

Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair.2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 427-474Google Scholar). Many MMPs are expressed widely during embryogenesis but not in adult life, suggesting that MMPs and the degradation and remodeling of ECM play an important role in growth and development. Thus far, 14 genetically distinct MMPs have been cloned and characterized from humans. They include three different collagenases, which are the only enzymes that can cleave fibril-forming collagens such as collagen types I, II, and III, the most abundant proteins in the body. Gelatinases A and B, also known as 72- and 92-kDa type IV collagenases, digest denatured collagen (gelatin) and basement membranes, a special type of ECM of epithelial, endothelial, fat, muscle, and peripheral nerve cells (8Martin G.R. Timpl R. Kuhn K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 1-50Google Scholar). Stromelysins are three different MMPs with wide substrate specificity, and stromelysin-1 degrades almost any ECM component including cartilage proteoglycans (9Bonassar L.J. Frank E.H. Murray J.C. Paguio C.G. Moore V.L. Lark M.W. Sandy J.D. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Grodzinsky A.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 173-183Google Scholar). All MMPs are produced as inactive proenzymes, which are activated by proteolytic removal of their NH2-terminal domain (10Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Google Scholar, 11Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Google Scholar, 12Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Google Scholar, 13Benbow U. Butticè G. Nagase H. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10715-10722Google Scholar). Therefore, it is significant that stromelysin-1 (MMP3) proteolytically activates other MMPs such as interstitial collagenase-1 (MMP1), matrilysin (MMP7), and 92 kDa type IV collagenase (MMP9), suggesting that stromelysin-1 plays a special “upstream” role in ECM degradation and remodeling (14Murphy G. Cockett M.I. Stephens P.E. Smith B.J. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 265-268Google Scholar, 15Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Google Scholar, 16Imai K,. Yokohama Y. Nakanishi I. Ohuchi E. Fujii Y. Nakai N. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6691-6697Google Scholar). Recently, five groups have described four new members of the MMP family (17Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Google Scholar, 18Okada A. Bellocq J.-P. Royer N. Chenard M.-P. Rio M.-C. Chambon P. Basset P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25548-25554Google Scholar). These new MMPs are not secreted but remain anchored to the cell surface through their COOH-terminal transmembrane domain, and accordingly, they were named membrane type-MMPs (MT-MMPs). Studies on the human MT1-MMP indicate that it activates gelatinase A (MMP2), suggesting that MT-MMPs may facilitate pericellular matrix degradation at the cell surface and promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis (12Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Google Scholar,17Sat"

The genomic sequencing method was used here to describe, in leaf and endosperm, the methylation pattern of a 390-base pair region of the o2 promoter. In leaf, 96% of the C residues are methylated, whereas in endosperm the 5-methylcytosine content is 84%. Comparison of these methylation patterns indicates that the o2 tissue-specific expression does not result from the demethylation of any specific C residue and that, in vivo, O2 interacts with a methylated target sequence. Consistently, gel-shift experiments using a CpG-methylated, partially methylated, and hemimethylated o2 promoter fragments showed that, in vitro, the O2 protein binds to the major groove of a methylated target sequence, although its binding activity decreases at increasing levels of C-methylation and is more effectively reduced by methylation of the lower strand than of the upper strand of the DNA. Using partially purified endosperm cell extracts, we also show that, besides the O2 protein, other proteins specifically bind to a partially methylated o2 promoter fragment, therefore indicating that in plants a subset of different proteins may mediate the expression of a naturally occurring methylated o2 promoter.

DNA methylation has been implicated in mediating several fundamental cellular processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In higher plants, 5-methylcytosine (m5C) 1The abbreviations used are: m5C, 5-methylcytosine; CREB, cAMP response element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; wt, wild-type; mt, mutagenized. can constitute as much as one-third of the cytosine residues of nuclear DNA and has been found to control transposable element activity (1Fedoroff N.V. Chandler V. Paszkowski J. Homologous Recombination and Gene Silencing in Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1994: 349-385Google Scholar), genomic imprinting (2Matzke M.A. Matzke A.J.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 53-76Google Scholar), gene silencing (3Matzke M.A. Matzke A.J.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 679-685Google Scholar, 4Flavell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3490-3496Google Scholar), inhibition of transcription (3Matzke M.A. Matzke A.J.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 679-685Google Scholar), and inheritance of a variety of epigenetic phenomena (5Martienssen R.A. Richards E.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 234-242Google Scholar). More recently, Ronemuset al. (6Ronemus M.J. Galbiati M. Ticknor C. Chen J. Dellaporta S.L. Science. 1996; 273: 654-657Google Scholar) showed that DNA methylation is an essential component in establishing or maintaining cellular processes resulting in phase transition and meristem determinacy in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing an antisense cytosine methyltransferase gene. In animals, DNA methylation appears to influence the tissue-specific expression of developmentally regulated genes by affecting the interactions of DNA with chromatin proteins and transcription factors (4Flavell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3490-3496Google Scholar). In plants, methylation of the C residue embedded within the consensus sequence for mammalian CREB factors (cAMP response element, TGACGTCA) was found to inhibit in vitro DNA binding activity of CREB-like factors present in nuclear extracts of pea, wheat, soybean, and cauliflower (7Inamdar N.M. Ehrich K.C. Ehrlich M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 111-123Google Scholar). However, binding of plant nuclear proteins to hemimethylated target sequences has been reported for the tobacco CG-1 nuclear factor(s) (8Staiger D. Kaulen H. Schell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6930-6934Google Scholar) and the maize ac-encoded transposase (9Kunze R. Starlinger P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3177-3185Google Scholar). Interestingly, binding of the actransposase occurs only to hemimethylated sequences with a methylated lower strand and not vice versa. A method based upon chemical treatment of genomic DNA (10Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Google Scholar) has allowed detailed analysis of the methylation state of several genes in mammals, fungi, and plants and has led to the discovery of m5C outside the canonical symmetrical CpG and CpNpG sites (11Selker E.U. Fritz D.E. Singer M.J. Science. 1993; 262: 1724-1728Google Scholar, 12Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Google Scholar, 13Meyer P. Niedenhof I. ten Lohuis M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2084-2088Google Scholar). In transgenic plants, the application of this method clearly revealed the association between a high level of m5C observed within a silenced CaMV35S promoter and the transcriptional inactivation of the transgene (13Meyer P. Niedenhof I. ten Lohuis M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2084-2088Google Scholar, 14Park Y.-D. Papp I. Moscone E.A. Iglesias V.A. Vaucheret H. Matzke A.J.M. Matzke M.A. Plant J. 1996; 9: 183-194Google Scholar). In maize, analysis of the methylation pattern ofac transposable element ends suggested a model to explain the association of element transposition with replication (15Wang L. Heinlein M. Kunze R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 747-758Google Scholar). However, at present little is known about the methylation state of endogenous plant promoters, thus correlations between their methylation pattern and gene activity can not be clearly asserted. Although a positive correlation between the expression level of the maize Scutellar node (sn) gene and the methylation content of its promoter has been observed (16Ronchi A. Petroni K. Tonelli C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5318-5328Google Scholar), no information is available about whether the methylation pattern of a plant promoter may mediate its tissue-specific expression. Similarly, the exact degree of C-methylation of an endogenous plant promoter has never been estimated in a statistically significant manner. To address these questions we have detailed the methylation pattern of the maizeopaque-2 (o2) locus in an expressing and non-expressing tissue, endosperm and leaf, respectively. In maize, o2 regulates the expression of b-32,cyppdk1, and the 22- and 14-kDa zein gene families (17Motto, M., Thompson, R. D., Salamini, F., Cellular and Molecular Biology of Plant Seed Development, Larkins, B. A., Vasil, I. A., 1997, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). Theo2 locus has been cloned and found to be expressed only in developing endosperm (18Schmidt R.J. Burr F.A. Burr B. Science. 1987; 238: 960-963Google Scholar, 19Motto M. Maddaloni M. Ponziani G. Brembilla M. Marotta R. Di Fonzo N. Soave C. Thompson R.D. Salamini F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 212: 488-494Google Scholar). o2 encodes for a member of the basic domain/leucine zipper (b-Zip) class of transcriptional activators (20Hartings H. Maddaloni M. Lazzaroni N. Di Fonzo N. Motto M. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2795-2801Google Scholar, 21Schmidt R.J. Burr F.A. Aukerman M.J. Burr B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 46-50Google Scholar). Similarly to other plant b-Zip factors (22Ramachandran S. Hiratsuka K. Chua N.-H. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 642-646Google Scholar), the O2 protein target sequence, TGACGTTG, contains an ACGT core. Multiple copies of this sequence are present in the promoter region of the genes that are under o2 transcriptional control. Interestingly, strong in vitro binding of the O2 protein to the odd base palindromic C-box sequence, ATGAGTCAT, found in the pea lectin promoter has been reported (23de Pater S. Katagiri F. Kijne J. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1994; 6: 133-140Google Scholar). The O2 protein can also transiently activate the expression of its own promoter, indicating that it is positively autoregulated (24Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Di Fonzo N. Hartings H. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 617-624Google Scholar). Furthermore, O2 binds in vitro to an o2 promoter fragment and protects from DNaseI treatment a single region encompassing its consensus binding sequence (24Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Di Fonzo N. Hartings H. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 617-624Google Scholar). In this study we used the genomic sequencing method to determine the methylation state of the o2 promoter in endosperm and leaf cells. Our data show a different methylation content of the o2 promoter in these tissues, less methylated in endosperm than in leaf. However, in endosperm the high m5C level observed, 84%, correlates with a low level of expression of the o2 gene in this tissue (25Hartings H. Lazzaroni N. Rossi V. Riboldi G.R. Thompson R.D. Salamini F. Motto M. Genet. Res. Camb. 1995; 65: 11-19Google Scholar). Comparison of the two methylation patterns also revealed that endosperm-specific expression of the o2 promoter is not mediated by the demethylation of a specific C residue. Because the methylation pattern of the o2 promoter in endosperm indicates the occurrence of m5C within the O2 protein binding site and its flanking sequences, gel-shift experiments were performed to investigate the DNA binding activity of O2 protein to DNA fragments whose methylation state mimics the o2 promoter methylation pattern. Results show that unlike the plant transcriptional activators analyzed so far, O2 binding activity is not impaired by CpG methylation. However, we have observed that the pattern and average level of C-methylation can modulate DNA binding affinity of the O2 protein to the tested substrates. Finally, we provide evidence showing that other proteins isolated from immature endosperm can specifically bind to a partially methylated o2 promoter, indicating that factors other than O2 may bind to methylated DNA. Taken together these data suggest the possibility that in plants DNA methylation may control plant gene expression level by modulating transcription factor's DNA binding affinity to their cognate sequences. The maize line used throughout this study is the same line used for cloning and sequencing the o2 gene (20Hartings H. Maddaloni M. Lazzaroni N. Di Fonzo N. Motto M. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2795-2801Google Scholar). From a single selfed plant, young leaves and immature endosperm (20 days after pollination) were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Maize nuclear genomic DNA was purified from 10 g of leaves or endosperm using a previously described method (26Pellegrini L. Rohfritsch O. Fritig B. Legrand M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 877-886Google Scholar). DNA was cleaved with EcoRI and then subjected to bisulfite treatment as described by Frommer et al. (10Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S.

A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 2 μg of DNA were denatured with 50 mmNaOH, neutralized by addition of 1 volume of 1 m Tris pH 7.5, and desalted on a Sephadex G-50 spin column. Eluted DNA was immediately denatured at 98 °C for 10 min and processed as described by Meyer et al. (13Meyer P. Niedenhof I. ten Lohuis M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2084-2088Google Scholar). At the end of the bisulfite treatment, DNA was recovered using a QIAEX II extraction kit (QIAGEN). In the control reaction, 20 pg of linearized plasmid (pLPO2) containing the −1020, +58 region of the o2 promoter was methylated in vitro with SssI CpG-methylase (New England Biolabs) and mixed with 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA. In 50 μl total volume, the first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications contained 100 ng of bisulfite-treated DNA, 25 pmol of each external primer, 200 μm of each dNTP, 1 × Promega PCR buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 0.1% Triton X-100), 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). One μl of first PCR amplification was then used as template in a second round of PCR that differed for the sets of internal primers and magnesium concentration (2.5 mm MgCl2). For the top strand a 30-mer LP18-A2E (5′-gttgagatttttgtttatgttttttttttg-3′) and a 33-mer LP19-A1E (5′-cccaataataaataactatcaatcaataattcc-3′) were used as external primers, and a 33-mer LP3-A2 (5′-cgggatccgtttaatttggatgtagattatttg-3′) and a 37-mer LP4-A1 (5′-gcggtaccatcaaccttacactcaatataaacctaca-3′) were used as internal primers. For the bottom strand a 34-mer LP9-B1E (5′-aacatataaactaaaatttctatttatactttcC-3′) and a 28-mer LP10-B2E (5′-tgagttaattatgttagttgtttgaagg-3′) were used as external primers and a 35-mer LP5B1 (5′-cgggtacctaatttcaaacaacaaattacttatac-3′) and a 34-mer LP6B2 (5′-cgggatccgtatttaatgtgaatttgtagggtag-3′) were used as internal primers. PCR reactions consisted of an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 46 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The annealing temperature of the second PCR amplification was 50 °C. Amplified fragments were digested with KpnI and BamHI, gel-purified, and cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was purified, and individual clones were sequenced using an ABI373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystem). Data were analyzed by standard analysis of variance and Student's t significant difference was used to compare means. All statistic analyses were performed using the “Statistica Software Package” (Stat Soft Inc., 1995). O2 protein was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21/lDE3 harboring pLys and pET3cO2 (27Izawa T. Foster R. Chua N.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1131-1144Google Scholar), which contains the O2 cDNA fused to the T7 promoter. An overnight culture was grown at 37 °C in LB media containing chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were diluted into 50 ml of fresh medium and grown till theA600 = 0.5, and O2 expression was then induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. After 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in water, and resuspended in 0.1 volume of 1 × binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 88 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol). The cell suspension was aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. For experiments, cells were thawed and centrifuged, and then the supernatant was recovered and filtered with disposable 0.45-μm filters. Filtered protein extracts were concentrated with Ultrafree-15 (50,000 MW; Millipore), to obtain a final protein concentration, estimated by the Bradford assay, of approximately 1.5 μg/μl. For the band shift experiments, the control extract consisted of E. coli cells transformed with the pET3c plasmid lacking of the O2 cDNA insert. Immatureo2-m(r) kernels were harvested at 16 days after pollination and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pericarps and embryos were eliminated, and 15 g of endosperm was ground in 10 ml of extraction buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 88 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant filtered onto disposable 0.45-μm filters. Endosperm protein extract was applied onto a pre-equilibrated HiTrap SP column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), using a peristaltic pump, and washed with 5 column volumes of extraction buffer. Four fractions were eluted by applying 6 ml of extraction buffer containing increasing KCl concentrations (75, 150, 225, and 300 mm KCl). Eluted fractions were concentrated with Ultrafree-15 (50,000 MW; Millipore), to obtain a final protein concentration, estimated by the Bradford assay, of approximately 1 μg/μl. A 188-bp long o2 promoter fragment spanning from −399 to −211 relative to the transcription initiation site of the o2 locus was cloned in the EcoRV site of pBluescript KS(+) to make pLP190. The P188 DNA fragment was excised from pLP190 with HindIII andPstI, gel-purified, recovered by electroelution, and end-labeled. The P188-CG probe was prepared by methylating the P188 probe with SssI CpG DNA methylase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Completeness of CpG-methylation was assessed by restriction digestion analysis of the P188-CG probe with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymeHhaI. The P188–50% probe was prepared by PCR amplification of the P188 DNA fragment cloned in pLP190 using KS and SK primers. PCR reaction mix consisted of 10 ng of pLP190, 1 × Promega buffer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dATP, 200 μm dGTP, 200 μm dTTP, 100 μmdCTP, 100 μm m5-dCTP, 1 μm each oligonucleotide primer, and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). PCR products were digested with XbaI, gel-purified, and spectrophotometrically quantified. Thirty ng of DNA was labeled at one end by end-filling using Klenow DNA polymerase and [32P]dCTP; probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides with Sephadex-G50 spin columns. The P188–100%, P188–30%, and P188–70% probes were produced the same as for P188–50% except that the molar ratios of m5-dCTP:dCTP were 1:0, 3:7, and 7:3 respectively, in the PCR reaction. Each hemimethylated fragment was prepared by combining methylated and unmethylated single-stranded complementary DNA. Annealing was achieved by heating the DNA mix at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Annealed DNA was gel-purified and labeled as indicated above. Single-stranded DNA was prepared as follows. For the upper strand, SstI-digested pLP190 was subjected to two rounds of 50 elongation steps using the KS primer, 1 × Promega buffer, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 1 unit of Taqpolymerase. For the lower strand, KpnI-digested pLP190 was used in combination with the SK primer. A methylated strand was obtained by including m5-dCTP in the reaction mix. p36wt and p36mt probes were made by annealing 1 μg of primers (p36wt: 5′-atacaatacatgttgacgttggtaaggca-3′; 5′-gacaccatgccttaccaacgtcaacatg-3′. p36mt: 5′-atacaatacatgttgatgttggtaaggca-3′; 5′-gacaccatgccttaccaacatcaacatg-3′), and end-filling of 3 ng of oligonucleotide duplexes with Klenow enzyme in the presence of [32P]dCTP. The radiolabeled probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides with Sephadex-G50 spin columns. p61wt primers (5′-cagaaagtgcaatacaatacatgttgacgttgg-3′; 5′-ggctttgtgtgctagacaccatgccttaccaacgtcaacatg-3′), and p61mt primers (5′-cagaaagtgcaatacaatacatgttgatgttgg-3′; 5′-ggctttgtgtgctagacaccatgccttaccaacatcaacatg-3′) were labeled at their 5′ ends with T4 kinase. P61wt and P61mt probes were made by annealing equimolar amounts (1 pmol) of labeled primers and then extended with Klenow enzyme in the presence of cold dNTPs. Radiolabeled probes were purified with Sephadex-G50 spin columns. All oligonucleotides used throughout this study were designed from the genomic sequence of the o2 gene (20Hartings H. Maddaloni M. Lazzaroni N. Di Fonzo N. Motto M. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2795-2801Google Scholar) and synthesized by Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Their integrity was verified by gel electrophoresis on acrylamide gels. Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer containing 100 ng/μl poly[d(I-C)]. The amount of E. colipET3cO2 or endosperm cell extract employed varied from 2.5 to 4 μg, whereas 3.2 × 104 cpm of end-labeled probe were routinely used. The binding reaction was incubated at 20 °C for 10 min, and 10 μl was then loaded onto a 4–7% Tris borate/EDTA acrylamide gel (29:1). Gels were run at 8 °C at 15 V/cm, dried, and autoradiographed. Previous analysis of the methylation state of the o2 promoter region in immature endosperm and young leaf tissue with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes indicated the occurrence of different methylation patterns within the −510, −990 region. Also, in both tissues we observed the presence of m5C residues close the O2 binding site. 2V. Rossi and L. Pellegrini, unpublished observations. To gain more insight into the methylation status of the o2 promoter in these tissues, we undertook a strategy aimed to detail the m5C distribution by means of the bisulfite treatment of maize genomic DNA (10Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Google Scholar). This method is based upon a chemical treatment that converts unmethylated C residues into U residues that appear as T residues after PCR of specific, single-stranded DNA. Conversely, all m5C residues remain unmodified. Separate PCR amplifications were performed for the upper and lower strands to produce DNA fragments that were subsequently cloned and sequenced. CpG-methylated plasmid DNA bearing the o2 promoter was used as a control for complete conversion of unmethylated C residues into U residues (data not shown). Fig. 1 A shows the methylation pattern of a 390-bp region of the o2 promoter (from −436 to −46) in endosperm. We cloned and sequenced 13 upper strand and 16 lower strand PCR products. All clones displayed different methylation patterns and thus were derived from individual genomic O2 sequences. Noteworthy is the considerable level of C-methylation (84%) present in the o2 promoter at the time and place where it leads to gene expression. Moreover, all the C residues embedded within the O2 binding site (boxed in Fig. 1 A), were methylated. The methylation pattern of the lower strand differed markedly from that of the upper strand. Statistical analysis (Student's t test) of the mean methylation values obtained from the collected data indicated that, with p = 1%, the lower strand was significantly less methylated than the upper strand (80% m5Cversus 89%). Interestingly, an unequal m5C distribution was observed, and the lower strand was less methylated at the most distal part of the region analyzed. We have also applied the Student's t analysis to compare the methylation level of each C residue within their sequence context. Accordingly, we found that in endosperm, for both strands, CpT and CpG dinucleotides were significantly less methylated than CpA and CpC (p= 1 and 5%, respectively). The methylation pattern of the −436, −46 o2 promoter region was also analyzed in leaf by sequencing 10 upper strand and 10 lower strand clones (Fig. 1 B). Again, different methylation patterns were observed, indicating that the clones were derived from individual genomic O2 sequences. Analysis (Student's t test) was again used to compare the mean methylation values of DNA obtained from leaf and endosperm. Data indicated that with p = 1% the level of C-methylation in leaf was significantly higher than in endosperm (96% m5C versus 84%). An unequal m5C distribution was also observed in the lower strand of the most distal part (−436, −370) of DNA from leaves. Taken together these findings indicate that the endosperm-specific expression of theo2 gene is not associated with the specific and complete demethylation of any C residue present within the promoter region analyzed. The expression of the o2 gene appears to be positively autoregulated by its gene product, possibly by binding to the target sequence, TGACGTTG, which is found in its own promoter and in the promoter of several o2-controlled genes (24Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Di Fonzo N. Hartings H. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 617-624Google Scholar, 17Motto, M., Thompson, R. D., Salamini, F., Cellular and Molecular Biology of Plant Seed Development, Larkins, B. A., Vasil, I. A., 1997, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). In immature endosperm, genomic sequencing revealed the occurrence of m5C within the CpG site embedded in the ACGT core. Thus, unlike CG-1 and the CREB-like MIB-1 transcription factor (8Staiger D. Kaulen H. Schell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6930-6934Google Scholar, 7Inamdar N.M. Ehrich K.C. Ehrlich M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 111-123Google Scholar), the O2 protein is likely to bind in vivo to its cognate sequence even if, in both strands, the CpG dinucleotide is methylated. To further confirm this possibility, we performed in vitro gel-shift assays using extracts from E. colicells expressing a full-length O2 cDNA (pET3cO2; Ref. 27Izawa T. Foster R. Chua N.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1131-1144Google Scholar) and anin vitro CpG-methylated o2 promoter fragment (P188-CG; spanning from −399 to −211). For the gel-shift analysis a negative control consisted of E. coli cell extracts from cells transformed with pET3c (not expressing O2). Consistent with earlier data (27Izawa T. Foster R. Chua N.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1131-1144Google Scholar), the control extracts never resulted in a band shift when tested with the P188-CG probe (not shown). A total of seven methylated CpG sequences are present in the P188-CG probe, one within the O2 target sequence (see Fig. 1). Under the conditions used, the P188-CG probe resulted in a single retarded band (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), and at higher extract concentrations all the probe was shifted (data not shown). Consistently, a 100:1 molar excess of unlabeled P188-CG was needed to compete with the unmethylated P188 probe and abolish the O2·P188 retarded complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Addition of distamycin A, a transcriptional inhibitor that binds to the minor groove of DNA (28Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar), did not impair O2 binding to the P188-CG probe; this indicated that the interaction of O2 protein occurs to the major groove of the DNA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–5). Formation of the O2·P188-CG complex indicated that neither the methylation pattern generated by the SssI DNA methylase nor the methylation at the C residue located within the O2 binding site were able to impair the in vitro binding activity of the O2 protein to its cognate DNA. Because the pattern and level of C-methylation generated by SssI DNA methylase on the P188 promoter fragment were different from that found in endosperm, we investigated the highest methylation content resulting in a detectable O2 in vitrobinding activity. EMSA experiments were performed using o2 promoter fragments generated with different m5C contents. Briefly, partially methylated DNA was prepared by PCR amplification of the P188 promoter fragment by addition of appropriate molar ratios of m5-dCTP and dCTP in the reaction mix. Probes with an average m5C content of 30, 50, 70, and 100% were generated (named P188–30%, P188–50%, P188–70%, and P188–100%) and used in gel shift and competition experiments with the O2 protein. Assuming an equal rate of nucleotide incorporation, each PCR reaction generates DNA fragments with a C-methylation content that can be plotted as a Gaussian distribution. Accordingly, restriction digestion analyses of the P188–50% probe with a methylation-sensitive enzyme resulted in the digestion of approximately 50% of a labeled PCR product (data not shown). Thus, it is conceivable to assume that, for each partially methylated probe, the most abundant fraction of labeled DNA fragments has an average C-methylation content of 30, 50, and 70%, respectively. However, among these DNA fragments the methylation pattern is stochastically represented. First, we tested O2 binding activity using a fully methylated DNA. Under the conditions tested, no band shift was observed (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Even after the addition of twice the amount of pET3cO2 extract and longer autoradiogram exposures, no band shift was detected (data not shown). As an additional test, we performed competition experiments between a fully methylated probe and a labeled, unmethylated one. A 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled P188–100% did not eliminate formation of the O2 protein-P188 complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), indicating that, in vitro, complete C-methylation inhibits O2 binding to its cognate DNA. Similar results were obtained using the P188–70% probe (data not shown). In addition, we tested O2 binding to the P188–30% and P188–50% probes using several different O2 protein concentrations in the binding reaction. As shown in Fig. 3, at high O2 concentrations the P188–30% and P188–50% probes were retarded (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 5); this indicated that DNA fragments with this methylation content and pattern are suitable substrates for O2 binding activity. Consistently, excess of unlabeled competitor eliminated the band shift (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 6). It is noteworthy that we have never observed retardation of the O2·P188–50% complex as a sharp band but rather as a limited smear (Fig. 3, lane 5). Similar results have also been observed using a P188"

We performed capping experiments to determine whether P1, PC, or P2 promoters are employed for rrn transcription start sites in cotyledon and root tissues. By using a new method of analysis of capped RNA we demonstrate for the first time that 1) in both organs the rrn operon is expressed in a constitutive manner by cotranscription with the preceding tRNA(GAC)Val gene, and 2) the PC transcription start site is used only in cotyledons and leaves, i.e. we demonstrate the organ-specific usage of a plastid promoter. Both start sites, PC and that of the tRNA(GAC)Val cotranscript, lackEscherichia coli-like consensus sequences. The cotranscript is initiated 457 base pairs upstream of the tRNA(GAC)Valgene. The PC-specific DNA-binding factor, CDF2, is not detectable in root tissues confirming its regulatory role in PC-initiatedrrn expression and the organ specificity of PC expression. Furthermore, our results show that rrn operon expression patterns differ in spinach and tobacco indicating species-specific transcriptional regulation of plant plastid gene expression.

Furthermore, our results show that rrn operon expression patterns differ in spinach and tobacco indicating species-specific transcriptional regulation of plant plastid gene expression. In accordance with the hypothesis that plastids are of endosymbiotic origin most plastid genes are organized into polycistronic transcription units reminiscent of bacterial operons. Plastid rRNA operons show the typical procaryotic gene order of 16 S, 23 S, and 5 S rDNA. These genes are transcribed as large precursor RNAs that are subsequently processed into the various mature rRNA species (1Strittmatter G. Kössel H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7633-7647Google Scholar, 2Dormann-Przybyl D. Strittmatter G. Kössel H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 7: 419-431Google Scholar). The promoter regions of plastid rrn operons harborEscherichia coli-like “-10” and “-35” consensus sequences, like most of the plastid transcription units. These E. coli-like consensus sequences serve as promoter structures (3Strittmatter G. Gozdzicka-Jozefiak A. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 599-604Google Scholar, 4Sun E. Wu B.-W. Tewari K.K. Mol. Cell.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 557-662Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of results on studies of transcriptional regulation in plastids is complicated by the existence of different types of RNA polymerases. One is nuclear encoded (8dePamphilis C.W. Palmer J.D. Nature. 1990; 348: 337-339Google Scholar, 9Morden C.W. Wolfe K.H. de Pamphilis C.W. Palmer J.D.

A. 1993; 90: 5509-5513Google Scholar) and the other one is encoded on the plastid genome (12Sijben-Müller G. Hallick R.B. Alt J. Westhoff P. Herrmann R.G.

The plastid-encoded enzyme can be considered as “E. coli-like” with respect to its subunit composition (16Lerbs S. Bräutigam E. Parthier B. EMBO J. 1985; 7: 1661-1666Google Scholar, 17Lerbs S. Bräutigam E. Mache R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 459-464Google Scholar) and promoter usage (6Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S.

Tiller K. Link G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3981-3987Google Scholar). The composition of the nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase and the promoter structures that are used by this enzyme are not yet clear although several potential transcription start sites for this enzyme have been mapped (5Vera A. Sugiura M. Curr Genet. 1995; 27: 280-284Google Scholar, 21Allison L.A. Simon L.D. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2802-2809Google Scholar,22Vera A. Hirose T. Sugiura M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 518-525Google Scholar). In spinach, the rrn operon upstream region contains three different promoter elements (P1, PC, P2), and transcription is thought to be regulated by the transcription factor CDF2 (23Baeza L. Bertrand A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3577-3581Google Scholar). CDF2 acts as a repressor of rRNA transcription by the E. coli-like plastid RNA polymerase and probably as an activator of rRNA transcription by the nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase (6Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Google Scholar), i.e. rRNA transcription could be regulated exclusively by CDF2. On the other hand, up to now correct initiation at the putative PC start site could not be demonstrated in vitro raising the question whether PC is indeed an initiation site. In addition, two transcription start sites that are different from the three of spinach have recently been reported for the tobacco rrn operon (5Vera A. Sugiura M. Curr Genet. 1995; 27: 280-284Google Scholar). They are differentially used in leaf chloroplasts or in amyloplasts of cultured cells. Considering the high sequence homology of the tobacco and the spinach rrn operon promoter regions, it is very surprising to find differences in rrn expression patterns between two closely related plants. Therefore, we analyzed the rrnexpression patterns in both plants in parallel under the same experimental conditions. Also, we analyzed rrn expression of different plastid types in intact plants, because gene expression in cultured cells (in particular in BY2 cells, which are not competent for regeneration) might differ from that in intact tissues of plants. In general, the rate of ribosome formation (including rRNA synthesis) is adapted to the individual cellular requirement for protein biosynthesis. Correspondingly, overall transcription rates ofrrn operons change drastically in accordance with changes of cellular metabolic activities. For instance, in E. coli the rRNA transcription is subject to stringent and growth-rate control (for review see Ref. 24Condon C. Squires C. Squires C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 623-645Google Scholar). In higher plants, overall transcription rates of the plastid genome change drastically in a developmental and organ-specific manner (25Mullet J.E. Klein R.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1571-1579Google Scholar, 26Baumgartner B.J. Rapp J.C. Mullet J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 781-791Google Scholar, 27Deng X.-W. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3301-3308Google Scholar). The transcription rate is about 30 times higher in leaf chloroplasts than in root amyloplasts (27Deng X.-W. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3301-3308Google Scholar). This difference in gene expression is related to the photosynthetic activities of chloroplasts and correlates with the number of plastid ribosomes. Consequently, rRNA expression should be regulated on the transcriptional level to respond to changes in plastid metabolic activities. To learn more about the regulation of rrn transcription in different plastid types of intact plants, we have analyzedrrn expression in spinach root and cotyledon tissues by capping and primer extension experiments to determine and compare transcription start sites and transcript quantities. We also analyzed protein/rrn promoter interactions using different protein extracts. Results are interpreted with respect to the presence of multiple RNA polymerases in plastids (for recent review see Ref. 28Sugita M. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 315-326Google Scholar), and the rrn transcription patterns obtained from plastids of intact plants are compared with transcription patterns observed using cell cultures. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. var. Geant d'hiver) was grown either in vermiculite at 15 and 22 °C (night/day) in a 10-h light/14-h dark cycle or in darkness or kept on moistened filter paper in darkness for 7 days and subsequently illuminated for 2–8 h. After 1 week, cotyledons and roots were collected, washed extensively (three times with sterile water), and homogenized for plastid purification. For nucleic acid analysis, the plant material was immediately frozen in aliquots of 2 g in liquid nitrogen. Tobacco leaves were taken from 45-day-old plants. Frozen tissue (2 g) was ground in liquid nitrogen until a very fine powder was obtained. The powder was poured immediately into an ice-cold mixture of phenol/chloroform/buffer (1:1:2; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS) for nucleic acid extraction. DNA was removed by two successive LiCl precipitations. RNA was dissolved in sterile water to a final concentration of 2 μg/μl and stored at −20 °C in 15-μg or 1-μg aliquots until usage. Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The primer (105 cpm, 1–10 ng) was annealed to 1 or 15 μg of the total RNA, and cDNA synthesis was performed using 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction products were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Dideoxy-sequencing reactions were performed on double-stranded plasmid DNA using α-35S-ATP and the T7 sequencing kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Each primer extension series was performed in parallel using different primer/RNA ratios to verify linearity of signal responses. For S1 nuclease mapping of capped RNA, 300 ng of single-stranded DNA were hybridized to 15 μg of capped RNA and digested with 100 units of S1 nuclease at 20 °C for 2 h if not otherwise indicated. Capping reactions were performed in 30-μl aliquots containing 15 μg of total RNA, 150 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 25 units of guanylyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.25 mmMgCl2, 6 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. The 831-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. BglII-PvuII plastid DNA fragment (30Briat J.-F. Dron M. Loiseaux S. Mache R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6865-6877Google Scholar) was recloned into Bluescript KS+ after excision by EcoRI from the PHp 34 plasmid. Clones were selected containing the 16 S rRNA 5′-end oriented in the opposite direction of the β-galactosidase gene. The 831-bp EcoRI fragment was further cleaved by HinPI and inserted into Bluescript KS+ cleaved by EcoRI and AccI. Plastid DNA was amplified using primers e and f(primer e, 5′-AAGATTTGGCTCGGCATG-3′; primerf, 5′-CCATAGGTACAGCGTTTG-3′), and the corresponding fragment was cloned into pCRTMII (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 50 ng of primer were annealed to 3 μg of capped RNA in a final volume of 10 μl (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min at the melting temperature for the primer. 1 μl of RNase H (5 units) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of loading buffer and was directly run on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Control reactions are incubated for the same time without primer or without RNase H. Purification of root plastids was done according to Deng and Gruissem (27Deng X.-W. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3301-3308Google Scholar). Isolation of chloroplasts, preparation of protein extracts, and gel shift assays were performed as described (6Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Google Scholar). Primer extension assays were optimized to give quantitative results. Fig.1 A shows the analysis of cotyledon and root RNA using a primer that anneals within the mature 16 S rRNA (primera, 5′-GGGCAGGTTCTTACGCGT-3′, for primer localization see scheme of Fig. 2 A). Radioactivity incorporated into the cDNA that corresponds to mature 16 S rRNA was counted. The obtained values indicated a 77-fold difference in rRNA content in root and cotyledon tissues, which corresponds well to previously reported results (27Deng X.-W. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3301-3308Google Scholar), and thus confirms that our assay conditions are quantitative. In addition to the mature rRNA, two other RNAs are revealed in cotyledon tissues (Fig. 1 A, lane C). The band named Pro2 corresponds in size to the processing intermediate, which was previously characterized in maize and tobacco chloroplasts (3Strittmatter G. Gozdzicka-Jozefiak A. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 599-604Google Scholar, 29Vera A. Yokoi F. Sugiura M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 29-31Google Scholar), suggesting that this processing site is universal in plastids of different plant species. The band named PC corresponds to the previously characterized putative transcription start site of the spinach rrn operon (23Baeza L. Bertrand A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3577-3581Google Scholar). Interestingly, PC is not detected in root tissues (lane R). Pro2 appears as a very faint band. The intermediate sized transcript that is marked with an asterisk is probably an artifact since it is not revealed with another primer (compare with Fig. 1 B, lane R). The cDNA of about 900 bases indicates the presence of very long precursor transcripts in root tissues. Such a long transcript should include the tRNA(GAC)Val that is encoded upstream of therrn operon. Therefore, we named this site PtRNA. The band corresponding to PtRNA is also detectable in cotyledon tissues after longer exposure (not shown).Figure 2Analysis of tRNAVal(GAC)-rrn cotranscription by RT-PCR. A, the localization of the primers and hybridization probes that are used in experiments of Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 is diagrammed. B,RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg of root RNA (lanes 1–3) and 1 μg of cotyledon RNA (lanes 4–6) using primersa and b. Control reactions were done without reverse transcription (lanes 2 and 5) and without primer b (lanes 3 and 6). The sequence of the amplified cDNA is shown on the right side.C, RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg of root RNA (lanes 1and 3) and 1 μg of cotyledon RNA (lanes 2and 4) using primers c and b(lanes 1 and 2) or c and d(lanes 3 and 4). M, 1 Kb DNA Ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The quantitative difference of the PC transcripts in cotyledon and root tissues was re-analyzed with the same RNA preparations using primerg (5′-TTCATAGTTGCATTACT-3′). The sequence of primerg is complementary to the rrn precursor region immediately upstream of mature 16 S rRNA. Therefore, the majority of the radiolabeled primer is not trapped by mature rRNA, and the sensitivity of the method is amplified by more than 100 times. Also under this condition, cDNA corresponding to PC initiation is not detectable in root tissues (Fig. 1 B, lane R). RNA corresponding to Pro2 cannot be detected since the primer is positioned too close to it. No other intermediate sized RNA is revealed, including that corresponding to the product from the promoter for rrntranscription in cultured tobacco cells (Ptobacco, see Ref.5Vera A. Sugiura M. Curr Genet. 1995; 27: 280-284Google Scholar). Pro2-cleaved precursor transcripts are abundant in cotyledon/leaf tissues (Fig. 1 A) and are present in newly assembled plastid ribosomes (29Vera A. Yokoi F. Sugiura M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 29-31Google Scholar). To analyze the fate of the supposed tRNA(GAC)Val-containing precursor transcript (PtRNA, Fig.1 A) after Pro2 cleavage, we used a primer that is located upstream of processing site Pro2 for primer extension (Fig.1 C; primer c, 5′-TCTTTCATTCCAAGGCATAACTTGT-3′). Again, PC is observed only in cotyledon tissues but not in root tissues (lanes L, D, and R). In addition, a higher molecular weight cDNA is revealed in roots and cotyledons (Pro1). Fine mapping localizes the 5′-end of this transcript 125 nucleotides upstream of the tRNA(GAC)Val gene (Fig. 1, D andE, for sequence see Ref. 30Briat J.-F. Dron M. Loiseaux S. Mache R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6865-6877Google Scholar). The amount of these transcripts does not differ considerably in cotyledon tissues of light-grown or dark-grown plantlets (Fig. 1 C, lanes L and D) and in root tissues (lane R). Next we addressed three questions. 1) Is the rrn operon indeed cotranscribed with the tRNAVal(GAC) gene, and is PtRNA the transcription start site for this large transcript? 2) If so, is PC a cotyledon/leaf-specific transcription start site or a cotyledon/leaf-specific processing site of the large transcript that starts at PtRNA? 3) Is Pro1 a processing site of the PtRNA-initiated precursor RNA or another transcription initiation start site that produces a transcript that is terminated upstream of Pro2? To ensure that PtRNA corresponds to cotranscription of the tRNA(GAC)Val gene with the rrn operon we analyzed root and cotyledon RNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 2 B). The cDNA was primed within the sequence of mature 16 S rRNA (primera), and for amplification a second primer was used that anneals within the tRNA(GAC)Val gene (primer b, 5′-GGTATAACTCAGCGGTAG-3′). RNA corresponding to cotranscription of the tRNA(GAC)Val gene, and the rrn operon is detected in roots and in cotyledons (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and4). Controls were made omitting reverse transcription prior to PCR amplification (lanes 2 and 5) or omitting primer b during amplification (lanes 3 and6). The corresponding 417-bp product was cloned and sequenced. The 5′ and 3′ parts of the sequence are shown in Fig. 2 B on the right-hand side. RT-PCR was also performed with primer pairs b/c andd/c (Fig. 2 C; primer d, 5′-GGGGTTGATCCGTATCAT-3′). Transcripts covering the sequences between primers c and b are more abundant than transcripts extending between primers c and d(Fig. 2 C) or a and b (Fig.2 B). This difference could be explained by a processing event that takes place at Pro1. Pro2 has already been determined as a processing site (3Strittmatter G. Gozdzicka-Jozefiak A. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 599-604Google Scholar, 29Vera A. Yokoi F. Sugiura M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 29-31Google Scholar). Having confirmed the existence of transcripts extending from tRNA(GAC)Val downstream into the rrn precursor region, it is necessary to distinguish between transcription initiation and RNA-processing sites. With the method of primer extension, it is not possible to distinguish whether the revealed RNA results from transcription initiation or from processing (see above and also Ref. 23Baeza L. Bertrand A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3577-3581Google Scholar). Transcription initiation can only be shown by in vitrocapping of RNA that contains a 5′-triphosphate followed by positioning of the capped 5′-end of the RNA by S1 nuclease mapping. Therefore, we analyzed cotyledon and root RNA after in vitro capping. Complementary single-stranded DNA was produced from a cloned DNA fragment that comprises 140 bp of the mature 16 S rRNA gene and 691 bp of the upstream region (831-base probe in Fig. 2 A; for sequence see Ref. 30Briat J.-F. Dron M. Loiseaux S. Mache R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6865-6877Google Scholar). We observe only one transcript in cotyledons that contains a 5′-triphosphate (Fig. 3A, lane 1). This transcript corresponds from its size to initiation at PC. In roots, we could not detect any transcript under the same experimental conditions (lane 2). To analyze the Pro1-corresponding transcript we cloned a 603-bp DNA fragment that comprises the Pro1 site and the tRNA(GAC)Valgene but does not extend to the Pro2-processing site (see Fig.2 A). The analysis of capped root (lane 1) and cotyledon (lane 2) RNA is shown in Fig. 3 B. The two bands that resist S1 nuclease digestion (lane 2) correspond to the A and G nucleotides located 3 and 4 bases upstream of the primer extension signal (23Baeza L. Bertrand A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3577-3581Google Scholar). This difference of 3 and 4 bases can be explained by the addition of GTP to the analyzed RNA in the capping reaction and to the fact that cDNA (primer extension) and RNA (capping) migrate differently in polyacrylamide gels (31Mullet J.E. Orozco Jr., E.M. Chua N.-H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1985; 4: 39-54Google Scholar). Lane 3 shows the profile of the capped RNA without hybrid selection. These results show that PC is a transcription start site of the 16 S rRNA in cotyledon/leaf plastids of spinach plantlets. In root amyloplasts, the 16 S rRNA is cotranscribed with the tRNA(GAC)Val gene. In cotyledon/leaf tissues, both types of transcription exist (cotranscription with tRNA(GAC)Val and transcription initiation at PC). The transcript corresponding to Pro1 seems to result from processing since no capping could be demonstrated (Fig. 3 B). The start of the primary rrntranscript, which includes the tRNA(GAC)Val, could not be determined by capping and S1 nuclease mapping because it starts upstream of the DNA fragment that was used for hybridization,i.e. more than 691 bp upstream from the sequence coding for mature 16 S rRNA. To localize the transcription start site of the tRNA(GAC)Val gene and to ensure that this transcript in fact extends into the mature 16 S rRNA we had to develop a new method. If the large transcript stops before the mature 16 S rRNA-coding region, S1 nuclease mapping would give wrong results as we cannot determine the 3′-end of the hybrid since the labeling by capping is at the 5′-end of the transcript. (Usually the 3′-end of the single-stranded DNA is labeled.) Therefore, we developed a method that is based on the enzymatic property of RNase H to digest RNA in DNA-RNA hybrids. After the capping reaction, one part of the RNA is annealed to primer a (which anneals within mature 16 S rRNA) and digested with RNase H. The ribosomal precursor RNA should be cleaved at the position of the primer. The product(s) of this reaction is (are) analyzed concomitantly with two control reactions, one which contains only the primer and another one that is treated with RNase H but in the absence of primer. What we are looking for now is the appearance of an additional band within the pattern of capped total RNAs that is not seen in the two control reactions. The size of this band corresponds to the distance of the transcription start site(s) upstream from the position of the primer. First of all, we analyzed whether capping reactions are reasonably reproducible. This is essential to identify newly appearing bands in total capping patterns. Fig. 4 A shows results with total capped RNAs (lanes 1–4). Spinach seeds were germinated in darkness for 7 days (lane 1), and seedlings were subsequently illuminated for 2 (lane 2), 4 (lane 3), or 8 (lane 4) h. Total RNA was isolated from cotyledons and labeled by capping. The most strongly labeled band of about 120 bases was isolated and sequenced. It corresponds to cytoplasmic 5 S RNA (not shown). To avoid the high background of this band the following gels were run long enough to elute it from the gel. RNase H mapping of capped cotyledon RNA using primer aproduces two different supplementary bands of about 250 and 900 bases (marked by arrows in Fig. 4 B, lane 2). The 250-base RNA corresponds to PC. The 900-base transcript confirms the existence of a very long rrn precursor transcript that comprises the tRNA(GAC)Val and corresponds well in size to the large transcript revealed by primer extension using the same primer (see Fig. 1). The asterisk (Fig. 4 B) indicates the position predicted for the second rrn promoter that was observed in tobacco plastids (5Vera A. Sugiura M. Curr Genet. 1995; 27: 280-284Google Scholar, 21Allison L.A. Simon L.D. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2802-2809Google Scholar). For fine mapping of the 900-base RNA, we hybrid-selected capped RNA using complementary single-stranded DNA with the 5′-end localized about 200 nucleotides downstream of PtRNA. The S1 nuclease-protected RNA is shown in Fig. 4 C. It localizes the transcription start site (PtRNA) 457 bp upstream of the tRNA(GAC)Val gene. This coincides well with the 870-base RNA found by cleavage with primera in the RNase H mapping experiment. PtRNA is not preceded by E. coli-like consensus sequences (Fig. 4 D) suggesting transcription by the nuclear-encoded plastid RNA polymerase. If we compare PtRNA with the main rrn transcription start site in rpoB-depleted tobacco plastids (21Allison L.A. Simon L.D. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2802-2809Google Scholar) we notice that 7 of 8 bases are identical (Fig. 4 D, bold letters). A comparison of spinach and tobacco rrn promoter regions is shown in Fig. 5. Differences in base composition are marked by open boxes, transcription start sites are indicated by bent arrows. The fact that PC is obviously not used in spinach root tissues and that transcription start sites in this region are different in spinach (PC) and tobacco (P1 and P2) plastids prompted us to analyze and compare DNA/protein interactions by gel retardation. The rrn promoter fragment (WT) and the promoter mutation (M1) on which CDF2 does not bind (6Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Google Scholar) were analyzed in the presence of plastid extracts obtained from spinach cotyledon (Fig.6 B, lanes 1–6) or root tissues (Fig. 6 B, lanes 7–12). Taking into account thatrrn transcription is 50 to 80 times lower in root than in leaf tissues we used much higher protein concentrations to analyze root extracts compared with leaf extracts. The formation of the CDF2-promoter complex is detectable using leaf extracts (lanes 1–6). No protein/promoter interaction is detected with root plastid extracts even if the protein concentration was scaled up to 52 times that of cotyledon extracts (lanes 9 and12).Figure 6Organ-specific and species-specific differences in plastid rrn promoter/protein interactions. A, schematic representation of the spinach plastidrrn promoter region. Base changes in mutations are indicated in bold letters. B, organ-specific formation of CDF2-rrn promoter complexes. 80,000 × gsupernatants of lysed spinach leaf chloroplasts (lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6) or lysed spinach root amyloplasts (lanes 8, 9, 11, and 12) were incubated with DNA corresponding to the wild-type rrn promoter region (lanes 2, 3, 8, and 9) or with mutation 1 (lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12) and analyzed in gel shift assays. Lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10 correspond to the labeled DNA fragments without protein extracts. Protein concentrations were 380 ng (lanes 2 and 5) and 760 ng (lanes 3 and 6) for chloroplast extracts, 12 μg (lanes 8 and 11) and 20 μg (lanes 9 and 12) for amyloplast extracts. C,species-specific DNA/protein interactions. 4 μl (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11) and 8 μl (lanes 3, 6, 9,and 12) of 80,000 × g supernatant of lysed tobacco leaf chloroplasts were incubated with the wild-type spinach plastid rrn promoter region (lanes 2 and3), mutation 3 (lanes 5 and 6), mutation 2 (lanes 8 and 9), and mutation 1 (lanes 11 and 12). Lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10represent the labeled DNA fragments without protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 6 C shows DNA/protein interactions among the spinachrrn promoter DNA fragment, three mutated fragments (see Fig.6 A), and tobacco leaf plastid extract. The complex that is formed with the wild-type promoter fragment (lanes 1–3) is highly sensitive to M2 and M3, i.e. to modifications in the “-35” and “-10” sequence elements of the E. coli-like spinach P2 promoter. Using M1, the mutation of the CDF2-binding site, DNA/protein interactions are only moderately reduced (lanes 11 and 12) in contrast to results obtained with spinach plastid extracts (compare with Fig. 6 B). This experiment suggests that the differences in spinach and tobacco chloroplast rrn initiation (Fig. 5) are due to differences in protein/promoter interactions in the two plant species. If we compare root and leaf RNA from spinach and tobacco directly by primer extension analysis using primer c (Fig.7 A), we find that cotranscription of therrn operon with the tRNA(GAC)Val gene seems also to exist in tobacco plastids (lane C Spinach and lanes C and R Tobacco, Pro1). The differential localization of the transcription start sites (PC in spinach, P1 in tobacco) is evident (compare lane C Spinach to lane C Tobacco). Analysis of rRNA from tobacco cell cultures (BY2) shows the two reported transcription start sites P1 and P2 (Fig.7 B, lane 2). In contrast, in plastids of spinach cell cultures we determine only transcripts corresponding to PC (lane 1). Regulation of transcription in plastids is not yet well understood, and results on the expression of higher plant rDNA transcription seem to be contradictory. (i) The spinach plastid 16 S rDNA upstream region contains two tandem E. coli-like promoters, P1 and P2, which are efficiently used in vitro byE. coli RNA polymerase (Ref. 32Lescure A.-M. Bisanz-Seyer C. Pesey H. Mache R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8787-8796Google Scholar and Fig. 5). However,in vivo, we could not find products that correspond to these two initiation sites in photosynthetically active organs (7Lerbs-Mache S. Baeza L. Diederich L. Iratni R. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 557-662Google Scholar, 23Baeza L. Bertrand A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3577-3581Google Scholar). On the other hand, tobacco plastid rDNA transcription starts mainly at anE. coli-like promoter (P1), which corresponds to the spinach P2 promoter (Refs. 3Strittmatter G. Gozdzicka-Jozefiak A. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 599-604Google Scholar and 5Vera A. Sugiura M. Curr Genet. 1995; 27: 280-284Google Scholar and Fig. 5). (ii) The higher plant plastid genome is transcribed by at least two different types of RNA polymerase (for recent review see Ref. 28Sugita M. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 315-326Google Scholar). In spinach, plastid rDNA is probably transcribed by the nuclear-encoded enzyme as suggested by in vitro transcription studies (6Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Google Scholar) and the results presented here. On the other hand, transcription at the P1 promoter of tobacco plastid rDNA is likely to be initiated by the E. coli-like plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (21Allison L.A. Simon L.D. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2802-2809Google Scholar). (iii) A second minor transcription start site that is not preceded by E. coli-like promoter elements has been demonstrated recently in tobacco plastids. The steady-state level of the corresponding transcript is higher in BY2 plastids than in leaf chloroplasts (5Vera A. Sugiura M. Curr Genet. 1995; 27: 280-284Google Scholar). When the plastidrpoB gene is deleted by plastid transformation only this non-E. coli-like promoter is active suggesting that the minor transcription start site is used by the nuclear-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (21Allison L.A. Simon L.D. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2802-2809Google Scholar). In spinach leaf chloroplasts, this start site has not been reported so far. These contradictions prompted us to analyze rrn expression in spinach plastids. We found that transcription of the rrnoperon in intact spinach plants is regulated by usage of two promoters. In photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs (cotyledons and roots), the rrn operon is cotranscribed with the preceding tRNA(GAC)Val gene (Figs. 1 and 2). The transcription start site of the tRNA(GAC)Val-including precursor RNA (PtRNA) does not employ E. coli-like consensus sequences (Fig. 4). Instead, there is some upstream sequence homology to the recently reported rrn promoter that is active inrpoB-depleted plants (Ref. 21Allison L.A. Simon L.D. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2802-2809Google Scholar, P2 in Fig. 5, and see also Fig. 4 C). This suggests that PtRNA is transcribed by the nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase. To compare our results with tobacco we performed primer extension analysis also with tobacco leaf and root RNA. The results indicate that cotranscription of the rrnoperon with tRNA(GAC)Val exists also in tobacco (Fig.7 A). The enhancement of rrn transcription in photosynthetically active cotyledon/leaf tissues is due to the organ-specific activation of the PC promoter in spinach (Figs. 1 and 3). This transcription start site is different from the main transcription start site of tobacco leaf plastids (Fig. 7 A, compare also spinach PC and tobacco P1 in Fig. 5). Also, the analysis of RNA isolated from spinach cell cultures in parallel with tobacco BY2 cells shows differences inrrn expression patterns. The tobacco P2 transcript is only detectable in tobacco BY2 cells but not in spinach cell cultures (Fig.7 B). The reasons for these differences remain unclear. It seems, however, that the spinach PC and the tobacco P1 transcription start sites are recognized by different RNA polymerases and/or transcription factors (6Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Google Scholar, 21Allison L.A. Simon L.D. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2802-2809Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The evolutionary transfer of genes coding for components of the plastid transcriptional machinery to the nucleus and the existence of multiple RNA polymerases in plastids provide a large background for species-specific rearrangements of the plastid transcriptional apparatus. Nevertheless, the difference in transcription initiation between tobacco and spinach remains surprising. Full understanding of these differences will require the purification of transcriptional components and in vitroreconstitution of initiation events in both systems. The tRNA(GAC)Val-including precursor RNA is probably processed at the Pro1 site. This can be concluded from the negative capping result (Figs. 4 and 6) and from the quantitative differences of RT-PCR products which start upstream or downstream from Pro1 (Fig.2 C). The hypothetical secondary structure of the Pro1-processing site, as shown in Fig. 1 E, locates the cleavage site within the loop of a hairpin structure. It was demonstrated that chloroplasts contain an endonuclease activity that cleaves within loop structures of inverted repeats (33Adams C.C. Stern D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6003-6010Google Scholar). An enzyme of this type might be implicated in the processing mechanism occurring at Pro1. Altogether, our results show species-specific assembly of the plastid transcriptional complexes and the existence of novel mechanisms of gene expression in plastids, i.e. the organ-specific usage of different promoter structures. Fig. 8 summarizes the results obtained for spinach plastid rrn transcription. We thank M. Rocipon for photographical work, H. Pesey for technical assistance and cell culture maintenance, and Dr. J.-G. Valay for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2048354057,"We have studied the ability of histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) to neutralize the anticoagulant activity of heparin in plasma and in a purified component clotting assay. Addition of HRG to plasma or to the purified component assay did not neutralize the anticoagulant activity of heparin unless micromolar concentrations of zinc were present. Higher zinc concentrations were required for citrated than for heparinized plasmas due to competition of citrate with HRG for zinc binding. Zinc concentrations as low as 1.25 μm revealed HRG to be a powerful competitor of antithrombin for heparin in the purified component assays. HRG binding of heparin also was shown by affinity chromatography of HRG from immobilized heparin in the presence and absence of zinc. In the absence of zinc, HRG was eluted by 0.1 m NaCl, but, in the presence of zinc, elution of HRG required 1.0 m NaCl. Investigation of other divalent cations (copper and magnesium) indicated that augmentation of heparin binding by HRG in the presence of antithrombin was restricted to zinc. The HRG·Zn complex effectively competes with antithrombin for heparin, which restricts the availability of heparin to bind antithrombin and allows thrombin-mediated fibrinogenesis to proceed unimpeded.

Selection for mutations that restored growth of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells on low pH (3.0) medium led to the isolation of a dominant suppressor that also partially suppressed the increased K+ requirement of these cells. Molecular analysis revealed the suppressor to be an allele of BAP2 that encodes a permease for branched chain amino acids. The suppressor mutation (BAP2-1) converts a phenylalanine codon, highly conserved among the amino acid permease genes, to a serine codon in a region predicted to lie within the sixth membrane-spanning domain. Generation of the analogous mutation in the histidine permease produced an allele,HIP1-293, that similarly suppressed the low pH sensitivity of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells. Suppression of trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotypes by BAP2-1 or HIP1-293was correlated with increased Rb+ uptake. The presence of the substrate amino acids enhanced but was not essential for suppression of trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotypes and increased Rb+ uptake. The conserved site altered by the suppressor mutations appears to be important; his4 HIP1-293 cells show an increased requirement for histidine compared with his4 HIP1 cells.

Potassium transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeis primarily dependent on the product of the TRK1 gene. Mutations in TRK1 lead to a significant increase in the requirement for potassium due to decreased uptake of the ion (1Ramos J. Contreras P. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 143: 88-93Google Scholar, 2Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Google Scholar). Cells in which TRK1 is deleted lose the ability to grow on medium containing micromolar concentrations of potassium but readily grow on medium containing millimolar concentrations of the ion due to the presence of a second, highly related transporter encoded byTRK2 (3Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Google Scholar, 4Ko C.H. Buckley A.M. Gaber R.F. Genetics. 1990; 125: 305-312Google Scholar). Under conditions where transcription ofTRK2 is genetically derepressed, trk1Δ TRK2cells regain the ability to grow on micromolar potassium (5Vidal M. Buckley A.M. Yohn C. Hoeppner D.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2370-2374Google Scholar, 6Vidal M. Buckley A.M. Hilger F. Gaber R.F. Genetics. 1990; 125: 313-320Google Scholar). Consistent with the ability of Trk2 under these conditions to suppress the trk1Δ phenotype, kinetic analysis showed that cells expressing either TRK1 or TRK2 exhibit high affinity K+ uptake compared with trk1Δ trk2Δcells (7Ramos J. Alijo R. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 249-252Google Scholar). Thus, the dual affinity potassium uptake activities inS. cerevisiae identified by Rodriguez-Navarro and Ramos (8Rodriguez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Google Scholar) appear to require Trk1 and Trk2 for high affinity transport and other, unidentified pathways for low affinity transport. Proteins highly related to Trk1 have been identified inSaccharomyces uvarum (9Anderson J.A. Best L.A. Gaber R.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 99: 39-46Google Scholar), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (10Soldatenkov V.A. Velasco J.A. Avila M.A. Dritschilo A. Notario V. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 161: 97-101Google Scholar), andNeurospora, 1A. Rodriguez-Navarro, personal communication. but few details have been discerned regarding their mechanism of transport. The Trk proteins do not contain sequences that are conserved in ion-transporting ATPases, nor do they contain the signature sequences of K+ channels. Recent electrophysiological analysis has addressed the participation of Trk proteins in K+ transport more directly. Whole cell patch-clamp experiments with wild-typeS. cerevisiae cells detected Trk-dependent inward K+ currents in response to hyperpolarizing membrane potentials (11Bertl A. Anderson J.A. Slayman C.L. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2701-2705Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that K+transport via the Trk system is a passive process driven by the membrane potential. Trk-dependent K+ currents were not detected until the membrane potential was increased beyond −100 mV (11Bertl A. Anderson J.A. Slayman C.L. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2701-2705Google Scholar), which is consistent with previous estimates of the membrane potential in S. cerevisiae (12Calahorra M. Ramı́rez J. Clemente M. Peña A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 899: 229-238Google Scholar, 13Borst-Pauwels G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 88-127Google Scholar). Disruption of TRK1 and TRK2 significantly impairs the ability of the cell to take up K+, resulting in a 1,000-fold increase in the K+ requirement for growth (3Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Google Scholar). The hyperpolarization-dependent inward K+currents observed with wild-type cells by whole cell patch clamp analysis were essentially abolished in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells (11Bertl A. Anderson J.A. Slayman C.L. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2701-2705Google Scholar). However, the membrane potential that appears to be the driving force for K+ uptake is intact. This is supported by the functional expression of Arabidopsis K+ channels in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells. Expression of Kat1 restores the ability of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells to grow on very low concentrations of potassium (14Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3736-3740Google Scholar). Because the inward Kat1-dependent K+ channels are also activated by hyperpolarization beyond −100 mV (11Bertl A. Anderson J.A. Slayman C.L. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2701-2705Google Scholar, 15Schachtman D.P. Schroeder J.I. Lucas W.J. Anderson J.A. Gaber R.F. Science. 1992; 258: 1654-1658Google Scholar), the membrane potential in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells is probably at least of this magnitude and thus can provide sufficient driving force for the uptake of K+ ions provided a portal of entry is available. Such routes of monovalent cation transport have been previously described for bacterial systems. Dosch et al. (16Dosch D.C. Salvacion F.F. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1188-1190Google Scholar) showed that expression of the wild-type tetracycline/H+ antiporter resulted in partial suppression of a K+ transport-defectiveEscherichia coli mutant by increasing K+ uptake. More recently, it was shown that expression of the wild-type Ca2+/H+ antiporter gene chaA fromE. coli and the wild-type tetracycline/H+antiporter gene tetA(L) from Bacillus subtilisrestore Na+ transport activity in Na+/H+ antiport-defective mutants of E. coli (17Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4557-4561Google Scholar, 18Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11296-11303Google Scholar). By selecting for suppressors in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells that restore the ability to grow on low potassium medium, we have obtained dominant mutations in genes encoding glucose transporters (19Ko C.H. Liang H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 638-648Google Scholar), the galactose transporter, 2T. Herman and R. F. Gaber, unpublished results. and one of the inositol transporters 3R. Alijo, S. Grove, C. Ko, A. Dalcanto, and R. F. Gaber, manuscript in preparation. among such revertants. A second phenotype of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells is their hypersensivity to low pH. Whereas wild-type cells can grow quite well on medium adjusted below pH 3.0, growth of trk1Δ trk2Δcells is severely inhibited below pH 4.5. This phenotype appears to be the consequence of the impaired potassium uptake because high concentrations of K+, but not sodium or sorbitol, restore growth of trk1Δ trk2Δ at low pH (4Ko C.H. Buckley A.M. Gaber R.F. Genetics. 1990; 125: 305-312Google Scholar). Further support of this interpretation is provided by the observation that K+uptake by the K+-selective channel Kat1 fully suppresses the low pH sensitivity of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells (14Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3736-3740Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the isolation and analysis of mutations at a highly conserved site in the amino acid permease genes BAP2and HIP1 that suppress the low pH hypersensitivity and, to a lesser degree, the potassium requirement of trk1Δ trk2Δcells by conferring increased K+ (Rb+) uptake. We present evidence that suggests wild-type amino acid permeases are also somewhat permeable to K+ ions. S. cerevisiae and E. coli strains used in this study are listed in Table I. YPD, YNB, sporulation medium, and routine genetic manipulations are described by Sherman et al. (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). LS medium was made as described previously (1Ramos J. Contreras P. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 143: 88-93Google Scholar, 2Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Google Scholar). YNB media containing amino acids as nitrogen sources were made by omitting ammonium sulfate from the recipe and adding the appropriate amount of filter-sterilized amino acid stock solution to medium after sterilization. Yeast and bacterial transformations were performed by electroporation (21Becker D.M. Guarente L.

Open table in a new tab Yeast genomic DNA, miniprep DNA, restriction endonuclease analysis, and gel electrophoresis were prepared or performed as described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA hybridization analysis was performed using Quikhyb (Stratagene) according to the directions of the manufacturer. DNA probes were prepared by incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP by random priming of denatured DNA fragments isolated by gel electrophoresis (23Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar). Random hexamers were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from DuPont NEN. A S. cerevisiae genomic library was constructed by methods previously described (24Gaber R.F. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 643-652Google Scholar) from a trk1Δ trk2Δ RPD4-1 (BAP2-1) mutant strain (MS40). Basically, size-selected (10–15-kb), 4The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. partially Sau3AI-digested genomic DNA fragments were cloned into the yeast centromeric shuttle vector pRS316 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar), and the ligation reaction was transformed directly into a trk1Δ trk2Δrecipient strain (CY152; Table I). Transformants were selected on permissive medium (pH 5.9) lacking uracil and then replica-plated to identify potential RPD4-1 (BAP2-1) clones by their ability to suppress the negative growth phenotype oftrk1Δ trk2Δ cells on low pH medium (pH 4.0). A single plasmid, pGM200, was obtained that conferred suppression of the low pH sensitivity of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells. pGM200 was rescued by transformation in E. coli and was tested to confirm that its reintroduction into trk1Δ trk2Δ cells by transformation led to suppression of the low pH sensitivity. A 2.6-kbEcoRV-HindIII fragment from pGM200 was subcloned into pRS316 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) producing pKM19-1, which was capable of suppressing the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotype. The sequence of both strands of this cloned fragment was determined using synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer) and the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The wild-type allele of the suppressor gene was recovered by an integration and excision experiment with plasmid pMW131. pMW131 was constructed by subcloning a 745-bp HindIII-ClaI fragment that encompassed the 5′ end of RPD4(BAP2) from pKM22-1 into the integrative plasmid pRS306 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). Only about 60 bp of the subcloned fragment overlapped with the coding region of RPD4 (BAP2). pMW131 was linearized with SphI and used to transform strain CY152 to Ura+. Genomic DNA from one transformant was prepared, digested with XhoI, recircularizd with T4 DNA ligase, and used to transform E. coli to ampicillin resistance. The DNA sequence of the 2.6-kb EcoRV-HindIII region of the cloned fragment in the resulting plasmid (pMW243) was determined using the same panel of oligonucleotide primers used for theRPD4-1 (BAP2-1) allele. DNA sequence analyses and comparisons were performed with the DNA Inspector IIe software program (Textco), Geneworks (Intelligenetics), and the package of programs of the Genetics Computer Group (26Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). A deletion of 1.25 kb of the BAP2 coding region was made by the integration-replacement method (gamma deletion) (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). A plasmid capable of disrupting BAP2 (pMW133) was created by subcloning the 745-bp HindIII-ClaI fragment described above and a 450-bp XbaI-HindIII fragment corresponding to the region immediately 3′ to theBAP2 coding region into the yeast integrative vector pRS306 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). Plasmid pMW133 was linearized by HindIII digestion and used to transform both diploid (MW156) and haploid (CY152 and MS40) recipient strains to Ura+. About half of the trk1Δ trk2Δ BAP2-1 Ura+ transformants lost the suppressor phenotype, indicating that they contained a disruption of theBAP2 locus. The other half had become His−evidently due to recombination between pMW133 and the resident plasmid at the trk2Δ::HIS3 locus resulting in replacement of the HIS3 marker with URA3. The presence of the bap2Δ deletion in individual transformants was verified by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Thebap2Δ::URA3 haploid strains MW158 and MW159 are pMW133 integrants of strains CY152 and MS40, respectively (TableI). To determine if suppression of the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotypes byRPD4-1 (BAP2-1) required amino acids in the growth medium ura3-52 trk1Δ trk2Δ bap2Δ strains lacking further auxotrophic requirements were generated. Briefly, strain MW158 was crossed with strain CY152, and meiotic segregants were dissected yielding strains MW79A-2D and MW79A-3B, which require only tryptophan (Table I). Selectable marker replacement (27Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1994; 10: 141-149Google Scholar) was performed to convert bap2Δ:URA3 alleles tobap2Δ:TRP1 alleles by transformation of MW79A-2D and MW79A-3B with HindIII-digested plasmid pRS304 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). All Trp+ transformants were tested to identify those that had become Ura− by marker replacement at the BAP2locus. This strategy yielded strains MW178 and MW179 that are able to grow on yeast minimal medium after transformation withURA3-containing plasmids. MW178 and MW179 were transformed with BAP2 and BAP2-1 alleles carried by centromeric (pKM22-1 and pMW136) and multicopy (pMW137 and pMW138) plasmids. The 2.2-kbHindIII-XbaI fragment of plasmid pPL241 containing the functional HIP1 gene (kindly provided by P. Ljundahl and G. Fink) was subcloned into plasmid pSelect1 (Promega), and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the suggested protocol. The oligonucleotide 5′-CGGAATAAGAAGAGGCAGCGGT-3′, which is complementary to the HIP1 coding strand, was used to introduce a single T to C transition in the second nucleotide of amino acid codon 293. The presence of the mutation was verified by determining the DNA sequence in this region. Both the wild-typeHIP1 allele and the mutant HIP1-293 allele were recovered as 2.2-kb HindIII-XbaI fragments from plasmid pSelect1 and subcloned into the yeast centromeric and multicopy plasmids pRS316 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) and pRS426 (28Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 110: 119-122Google Scholar). Cells were grown in either YNB and uracil or YNB and uracil with all amino acids supplemented with 30 mm KCl. After 20 h of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in uptake buffer (10 mm MES adjusted to pH 5.8–6.0 with Ca(OH)2, containing 0.1 mm MgCl2, 2% glucose, and either uracil alone or uracil with a mixture of all amino acids (totaling 2%)). After 2–3 min of incubation in uptake buffer, RbCl (100 mm) was added, and the velocity of uptake was determined during the first 7–10 min. Samples of cells were harvested by filtration, washed with 20 mm MgCl2, and solubilized in HCl. The rubidium content of each sample was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Mutations that suppress the low pH hypersensitivity of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells were isolated by selecting for spontaneous revertants able to grow on YPD medium supplemented with 100 mm KCl but adjusted to pH 4.0. Genetic analysis of these mutants indicated the presence of both recessive (to be reported elsewhere) and dominant suppressors. The dominant suppressors also partially suppressed the increased potassium requirement conferred by the trk1Δ trk2Δ mutations and were thus designated RPD for their reduced potassium requirement. Recombination tests between the dominant suppressors revealed a single representative, RPD4-1, of the locus described here. Tetrad analysis of meiotic segregants from a cross between the trk1Δ trk2Δ RPD4-1 mutant and a compatibletrk1Δ trk2Δ strain revealed that the suppressor mutation segregated as a single Mendelian factor (not shown). To identify the RPD4gene, a library of genomic DNA fragments made from the dominantRPD4-1 strain MS40 was screened for clones that could suppress the low pH sensitivity and potassium requirement oftrk1Δ trk2Δ cells. A single suppressor clone was obtained, and a smaller subclone (pKM22-1) that conferred suppression of the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotypes was chosen for molecular analysis. The wild-type RPD4 gene, recovered on a 2.6-kbHindIII fragment by an integration and excision experiment (see “Materials and Methods”), was subcloned onto both single copy and multi-copy plasmids (pMW136 and pMW137) and transformed into atrk1Δ trk2Δ recipient (CY152). Both plasmids failed to suppress the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotypes, confirming that the cloned fragment contained the wild-type allele of the suppressor locus. DNA sequence analysis of the 2.6-kb HindIII-EcoRV fragment that contained the functional suppressor revealed a single long open reading frame of 609 amino acid codons, which predicts a protein of 67 kDa. Hydropathy analysis (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) of the protein sequence revealed 12 putative membrane-spanning domains (M1–M12). A search of the S. cerevisiae genome revealed that the open reading frame encoding the RPD4-1 allele was essentially identical to open reading frame YBR068c discovered through the genomic sequencing project (30Feldmann H. Aigle M. Aljinovic G. Andre B. Baclet M.C. Barthe C. Baur A. Becam A.M. Biteau N. Boles E. et al.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5795-5809Google Scholar) and independently identified as BAP2, an amino acid permease capable of transporting branched chain amino acids (31Grauslund M. Didion T. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Andersen H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 275-280Google Scholar). A comparison with related sequences revealed that Rpd4, henceforth referred to as Bap2, shares greatest sequence identity with the putative amino acid permease Pap1 (78%) (32Mai B. Lipp M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 143: 129-133Google Scholar) and least sequence identity (32%) with the proline permease, Put4 (33Vandebol M. Jauniaux J.-C. Grenson M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 83: 153-159Google Scholar). The ability of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells to grow on K+-supplemented medium suggests that plasma membrane proteins other than Trk1 or Trk2 must be capable of mediating K+ uptake. To determine if Bap2 plays a major role in non-Trk-mediated potassium uptake, a null allele ofBAP2 containing a 1.25-kb deletion of the open reading frame (bap2Δ) was generated in trk1Δ trk2Δ ura3-52 BAP2 and trk1Δ trk2Δ ura3-52 BAP2-1 recipient cells (strains CY152 and MS40; see “Materials and Methods” for details). As predicted, deletion of the BAP2 sequences in thetrk1Δ trk2Δ BAP2-1 host abolished suppression of thetrk1Δ trk2Δ phenotype. The trk1Δ trk2Δ bap2Δ cells exhibited no apparent growth defects compared with the pretransformed cells confirming that BAP2 is nonessential (31Grauslund M. Didion T. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Andersen H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 275-280Google Scholar). In addition, the potassium requirement oftrk1Δ trk2Δ bap2Δ cells, assessed by testing for growth on medium containing various concentrations of the ion, was not increased compared with the isogenic trk1Δ trk2Δ BAP2cells (data not shown). Thus, wild-type Bap2 does not provide a major avenue of K+ uptake in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells and is not responsible for their ability to grow on 100 mmK+. The product of theSHR3 gene has been shown to be localized within the endoplasmic reticulum and is believed to be required for the processing of most, if not all, newly synthesized amino acid permeases in S. cerevisiae (34Ljundahl P.O. Gimeno C.J. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 463-478Google Scholar). Although amino acid permeases are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in shr3 mutants, other membrane proteins, including the H+-ATPase are apparently unaffected. Thus, the role of Shr3 appears to be specific for the processing and/or targeting of amino acid permeases. To assess whether or not processing of Bap2 is dependent on SHR3, anshr3 null allele was generated in a trk1Δ trk2Δ BAP2-1 strain to test for epistasis, i.e. loss of theBAP2-1 suppressor phenotype. The shr3Δ mutation abolished the ability of trk1Δ trk2Δ BAP2-1 cells (strain MW210) to grow on low pH and on low potassium medium but only modestly increased the K+ requirement of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells expressing the wild-type BAP2 allele (strain MW211; data not shown). In addition, the K+requirement of TRK1 trk2Δ cells containing theshr3Δ mutation (strain MW236) was indistinguishable from that of TRK1 trk2Δ cells harboring the wild-typeSHR3 gene (strain MW235; data not shown), suggesting that the activity of Shr3 is not required for maturation of Trk-related proteins. In S. cerevisiaeamino acid permeases apparently function as H+/amino acid-coupled symporters. To test whether or not the BAP2-1mutation might have altered the specificity of an ion-binding site while leaving the amino acid transport coupling mechanism unaffected, the ability of BAP2-1 to suppress trk1Δ trk2Δphenotypes was assessed in the absence of amino acids in the growth medium. A ura3-52 trk1Δ trk2Δ strain containing the dominant BAP2-1 suppressor on a centromeric plasmid exhibited growth on low potassium or low pH medium both in the presence and the absence of amino acids (Fig. 1), indicating that suppression of the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotypes is not dependent on the uptake of amino acids. Thus, if the suppressor mutation in BAP2-1 alters the putative proton translocation capability of the permease to allow potassium uptake, this new capability is not obligatorily coupled to amino acid symport. The DNA sequence of the 2.6-kb HindIII fragment of pMW243 containing the wild-type BAP2 gene was determined and compared with the BAP2-1 sequence. A single difference between the two sequences was found: a T (BAP2) to C (BAP2-1) transition of the second nucleotide of codon 299 resulting in a phenylalanine to serine substitution in the deduced amino acid sequence. This site is located within the putative sixth transmembrane domain of the transporter and occurs at a site highly conserved among S. cerevisiae amino acid permeases. All but one of the members of the amino acid permease gene family in S. cerevisiae contain phenylalanine at this site (Fig.2). In the case of Tat2, the tyrosine permease, a conservative substitution to tyrosine is present at this position. The conservation of this site suggests that it plays an important role in the structure/function of amino acid permeases. If the conserved phenylalanine residue that is changed to serine in BAP2-1 plays an important role in transport, an equivalent mutation in another amino acid permease might also suppress the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, the analogous mutation was made in the histidine permease gene,HIP1 (Fig. 2). Codon 293 was converted from a phenylalanine to a serine codon by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting allele (HIP1-293) was subcloned onto both centromeric and multi-copy plasmids (pRS316 and pRS426). The HIP1-293plasmids were able to suppress both the sensitivity to low pH and the potassium requirement of a trk1Δ trk2Δ recipient (Fig.3 A). Like BAP2-1, suppression of the trk1Δ trk2Δ low potassium and low pH phenotypes could be detected on medium lacking amino acids, indicating that suppression could occur independently of histidine transport. Cells harboring the HIP1-293 allele on the multi-copy plasmid exhibited slightly stronger suppression of the trk1Δ trk2Δ potassium requirement compared with cells that expressed the suppressor from the centromeric plasmid (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that transport of K+ by Hip1-293 was rate-limiting for growth when expressed as a single copy gene. Although expression of the wild-type HIP1 allele from a centromeric plasmid did not suppress either of the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotypes, expression from a multi-copy plasmid modestly suppressed the low pH phenotype (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that wild-type amino acid permeases may transport small amounts of potassium. In further support of this hypothesis, deletion ofSHR3 in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells resulted in slightly weaker growth on medium containing 100 mmpotassium compared with congenic trk1Δ trk2Δ SHR3cells.5 This was not due to a K+transport-independent effect on growth because deletion ofSHR3 in TRK1 cells had no effect on growth even under potassium-limiting conditions. 5M. B. Wright and R. F. Gaber, unpublished results. To determine if BAP2-1 andHIP1-293 increase potassium uptake, Rb+ uptake assays were performed using the trk1Δ trk2Δ recipient strain that was transformed with either the vector (pRS316) or plasmids expressing the wild-type or suppressor alleles of the amino acid permeases. Because Bap2 transports branched-chain amino acids and the presence of these substrates in the growth medium results in greatly increased BAP2 transcription (35Didion T. Grausland M. Kielland-Brandt C. Andersen H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2025-2029Google Scholar), Rb+ uptake assays were performed using cells grown either in the presence or the absence of amino acids in the growth medium and in the uptake assay bath. The velocity of Rb+ uptake in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells expressing the BAP2-1 allele was indistinguishable from"

The purpose of this study was to localize signals for homooligomeric assembly of ρ1 subunits and to investigate whether the same region contained signals for heterooligomeric interaction with ρ2 subunits. In vitrotranslated human ρ1 was shown to be membrane-associated, and proteinase K susceptibility studies indicated that the N terminus was oriented in the lumen of ER-derived microsomal vesicles. This orientation suggested the involvement of the N terminus of ρ1 in the initial steps of subunit assembly. To test this hypothesis, mutants were created containing only N-terminal sequences (N-ρ1) or C-terminal sequences (C-ρ1) of ρ1. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that N-ρ1, but not C-ρ1, interacted with ρ1 in vitro. When coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, N-ρ1 interfered with ρ1 receptor formation. Together, these data suggested that signals for ρ1 homooligomeric assembly reside in the N-terminal half of the subunit. Sequential immunoprecipitations were then performed upon cotranslated ρ1 and ρ2 subunits which demonstrated that ρ1 and ρ2 interacted in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that N-ρ1 specifically associated with ρ2. Therefore, the N-terminal regions of ρ subunits contain the initial signals for both homooligomeric and heterooligomeric assembly into receptors with GABAC properties. γ-Aminobutyric acid type C (GABAC) receptors identified in retina appear to be composed of GABA ρ subunits.

(1Sivilotti L. Nistri A. Prog. Neurobiol. ( New York ). 1991; 36: 35-92Google Scholar). A novel class of receptors for GABA, termed type C or GABAC, has been identified in the retinae of a variety of species including white perch, catfish, hybrid bass, salamander, rat, and cow (2Polenzani L.

GABAC receptors share a number of similarities with the well-characterized GABAA receptors including an integral Cl−channel that can be inhibited by picrotoxin and sensitivity to divalent metal cations such as Zn2+ (2Polenzani L. Woodward R.M. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4318-4322Google Scholar, 3Feigenspan A. Wassle H. Bormann J. Nature. 1993; 361: 159-161Google Scholar, 4Qian H. Dowling J.E. Nature. 1993; 361: 162-164Google Scholar). However, these novel receptors are insensitive to compounds that have classically been used to define GABA receptor types (2Polenzani L. Woodward R.M. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4318-4322Google Scholar, 3Feigenspan A. Wassle H. Bormann J. Nature. 1993; 361: 159-161Google Scholar, 8Woodward R.W. Polenzani L. Miledi R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 165-173Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ligand-binding site of GABAC receptors is distinguished from GABAA and GABAB receptors in its apparent preference for GABA analogues that can adopt a folded conformation, such as cis-4-aminocrotonic acid, over those that are locked in an extended conformation (9Woodward R.W. Polenzani L. Miledi R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 609-625Google Scholar, 10Qian H. Dowling J.E. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4299-4307Google Scholar, 11Feigenspan A. Bormann J. Eur. J.

These observations indicate that GABAC receptors may have a molecular structure similar to their closest relative, GABAA receptors, but with distinct physical differences that confer unique biophysical and pharmacologic properties. Two GABA receptor subunits, ρ1 and ρ2, have been isolated from a human retina library that have amino acid and structural similarity to members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and to the GABAA receptor subunits in particular (13Cutting G.R. Lu L. O'Hara B.F. Kasch L.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Donovan D.M. Shimada S. Antonarakis S.E. Guggino W.B. Uhl G.R. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, human ρ subunits form homooligomeric receptors in Xenopusoocytes that are insensitive to bicuculline, barbiturates, and benzodiazepine (13Cutting G.R. Lu L. O'Hara B.F. Kasch L.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Donovan D.M. Shimada S. Antonarakis S.E. Guggino W.B. Uhl G.R. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2673-2677Google Scholar, 15Shimada S. Cutting G.R.

Also, ρ receptors have a higher affinity for GABA and little desensitization compared with GABAAreceptors (16Wang T.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6524-6531Google Scholar). The pharmacologic similarities between GABAC receptors and ρ subunits lead to the suggestion that ρ subunits are the molecular components of GABACreceptors (12Bormann J. Feigenspan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 515-519Google Scholar, 15Shimada S. Cutting G.R. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 683-687Google Scholar). The localization of both ρ subunits by in situ hybridization and immunochemistry to rat rod bipolar cells where GABAC responses have been detected further supports the inclusion of ρ subunits in GABAC receptors (17Enz R. Brandstätter J.J. Hartveit E. Wassle H. Bormann J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1495-1501Google Scholar, 18Enz R. Brandstätter H. Wässle H. Bormann J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4479-4490Google Scholar). Although human ρ1 and ρ2 are each capable of forming homooligomeric receptors, there is functional evidence suggesting rat ρ1 and ρ2 may form heterooligomeric receptors (19Zhang D. Pan Z. Zhang X. Brideau A.D. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11756-11760Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that GABAC receptors in vivo are homooligomeric or heterooligomeric combinations of ρ1 and ρ2 subunits. In this study, in vitro translated protein andXenopus oocyte expression were used to identify sequences involved in ρ subunit assembly. The in vitro translation system was chosen for two reasons: the ability of protein interaction from signals in the primary amino acid sequence can be examined independent of cell-specific factors, and the availability of each protein for interaction can be verified. A critical question was the orientation of the in vitro translated subunit protein relative to the membrane. Using protease-susceptibility studies, we demonstrated that the orientation of ρ1 is consistent with the predicted topology of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, with an extracellular N-terminal domain and a membrane-associated C-terminal domain. Specific antibodies were developed to test the interaction of ρ1 with truncated forms of ρ1 and with ρ2. Our results demonstrate that ρ1 assembles with ρ2 in vitro, implying that they are capable of forming a single receptor in vivo, and that the N terminus of ρ1 contains signals for homooligomeric and heterooligomeric assembly. An 8-residue synthetic epitope (FLAG: DYKDDDDK) recognized by the mouse monoclonal M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak) was inserted in-frame at the C terminus of ρ1 by a three-way ligation of two annealed oligonucleotides with MaeI and NcoI sites (sense: 5′-TACGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAACAAGTAGC-3′; antisense: 5′-CATGGCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCG-3′), aKpnI/MaeI fragment containing the ρ1 cDNA, and a KpnI/NcoI-digested pBluescript vector (Stratagene). The amber termination codon of ρ1 was replaced by an amber codon in the oligonucleotides. Oocyte injection and current recordings demonstrated that ρ1FLAG formed homooligomeric GABA-gated receptors with properties indistinguishable from native ρ1 (22Cutting, G. R., Mickle, J., Blaschak, C. J., and Hackam, A. S. (1996)Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. , 37, (suppl.) S138.Google Scholar). A triplicated 9-residue epitope of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA tag: TPYDVPDYA) recognized by the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (20Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.I. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P. BioTechnology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Google Scholar) was ligated into either the N terminus or C terminus of the human ρ2 subunit. Kpn2I recognition sites were included in PCR primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the HA tag (5′HA-Kpn2I 5′-ATCCGGATCTTTTACCCATAC-3′, restriction site is underlined; 3′HA-Kpn 2I 5′-TTCCGGAGAGCAGCGTAATCTGG-3′). Following PCR and subcloning into pCRII (Invitrogen), a 120-bp Kpn2I fragment with the correct HA tag sequence was ligated into the Kpn2I site of ρ2 at nucleotide 229 in the N terminus of ρ2, 30 residues downstream from the predicted signal peptide cleavage site. Inserting the tag at this position was predicted to not alter ρ2 channel function on the basis of a chimera domain-swapping strategy which excluded this region from being necessary for robust homooligomeric expression (21Hackam, A. S., Wang, T. L., Guggino, W. B., and Cutting, G. R. (1995)Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual. Sci. , 36, (suppl.) S285.Google Scholar). To introduce the HA epitope to the C terminus of ρ2,StyI sites were included in PCR primers HA-forward (5′-TTCCAAGGGCCGCATCTTTTAC-3′) and HA-reverse (5′-ATCCTTGGCTAGCACTGAGCAGCGTAATC-3′). The 118-bp PCR product was subcloned into the StyI site at the ρ2 termination codon (nucleotide 1474). The resulting construct was sequenced in entirety. Both ρ2–5′HA and ρ2–3′HA were tested for interaction with ρ1 and will be referred to as ρ2HA for simplicity. N-ρ1 was created by replacing the tyrosine residue of ρ1 at codon 256 with an amber termination codon (TAG) using the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5-CTGTGCTGCTCTAGAAAGCCA-3′. The resulting mutant ρ1 is truncated 18 residues prior to the predicted first transmembrane domain (TM) and represents the N-terminal half of ρ1. C-ρ1 was created by deleting the 700-bp NlaIV-RsaI fragment containing the entire N terminus of ρ1, leaving the four putative hydrophobic segments and the sequences between each. This strategy retained the native canonical methionine and the putative signal peptide of ρ1. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. cRNA was synthesized from linearized ρ1 and ρ2 cDNA using the appropriate RNA polymerase and the Megascript In Vitro Transcription Kit (Ambion). The cRNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated by ethanol, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The integrity of the cRNA was verified on a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel. GABA ρ subunits were synthesized using the Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Translation System (Promega), in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega, Boehringer Mannheim). Synthesized protein was detected by incorporation of 4 mCi/ml (specific activity, 1180 mCi/mmol) [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (DuPont NEN), and resolved on SDS-PAGE (10%) gels using one-fifth of each translation reaction mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (15% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 4.5% SDS, 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.03% bromphenol blue). Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to Hyper-film (Amersham Corp.) for 16 h to 4 days. The molecular masses (in kDa) of the translated proteins were derived using standard curves generated from protein size standards (Amersham Corp.). In vitro translated ρ1 was transferred to polycarbonate tubes and centrifuged at 80,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C to pellet the microsomal membranes. The pellet and an aliquot of the supernatant were resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis. As a control for membrane association the hydrophobic water channel aquaporin-1 (cRNA provided by Dr. J. Reeves, Johns Hopkins University) was translated and centrifuged in parallel. One-half of the translate was incubated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) alone, and the other half was incubated with proteinase K and 1% Triton X-100. Both digestions were carried out for 60 min at 0 °C and then terminated by the addition of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1.0 mm) for 10 min. The reactions were mixed with sample buffer and loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The ρ1-specific peptide (QRQRREVHEDAHK) representing a 13-residue epitope at the N terminus of ρ1 was conjugated at its C terminus to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin prior to emulsification and injection. Peptide synthesis, keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugation, and rabbit handling were performed by Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL. All experiments described here were performed with 10-week bleed antisera. PCR primers 5′ TM3-TM4-BamHI (5′-ACGGATCCGTCAACTACCTGACC-3′) and 3′ TM3-TM4-EcoRI (5′-CAGAATTCAATGGCGTGGGTGTC-3′) were used to amplify the TM3-TM4 loop of ρ1 from residues 358 to 445. The 280-bp product was subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and sequenced and then shuttled into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech) usingBamHI and EcoRI sites to create a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. A 200-ml HB 101 bacterial culture (Life Technologies, Inc.) expressing the fusion protein was pelleted and lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS) with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The lysate was sonicated with a 5-mm diameter probe for 4 × 10 s and then clarified by centrifugation. The clarified sonicate was mixed overnight with 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The fusion protein bound to Sepharose beads was pelleted at 500 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C, washed four times with cold 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then washed three times with cold PBS. The fusion protein was eluted from the beads using an equal volume of 15 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, for 1 h at room temperature or with sample buffer for 10 min at 100 °C. The eluted product was cut from a preparative 15% SDS-PAGE gel and sent to Research Genetics for purification and injection of rabbits. Antisera obtained 10 weeks post-immunization were used in all experiments. The specificity of the anti-ρ1 antibodies was tested by cell staining. A mammalian cell line (HEK 293) that stably expresses human ρ1 (22Cutting, G. R., Mickle, J., Blaschak, C. J., and Hackam, A. S. (1996)Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. , 37, (suppl.) S138.Google Scholar) was used as the protein source. Wild-type HEK 293 cells and ρ1-expressing cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (VWR) coated with purified collagen (Collagen Corp.) and grown to approximately 75% confluency. The cells were washed 2 or 3 times with PBS and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min at room temperature. The fix was removed, and the cells were rinsed in PBS and then permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min. The cells were immunostained with the polyclonal antisera, and ρ1 protein was detected using a horseradish peroxidase staining method. In the first method, endogenous horseradish peroxidase was inhibited by incubating the cells in 1 × blocking solution for 10 min at room temperature and removed by washing in two changes of PBS. The primary antibody (hASH-1 or hASH-2) diluted 1:50–1:500 was added to the cells for 20 min and then the cells were washed three times in PBS. The secondary antibody, biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim), was added at 1:100–1:1000 dilution for 20 min and then washed as above. A 1:1000 dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) was added for 20 min, followed by the True-Blue substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) for 10 min. The cells were washed in water and then air-dried before being analyzed. In vitro translation reactions were diluted to 200 μl with buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and 10 μl of a 50% slurry of protein-A Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) was added. The resulting solution was mixed for 3 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged; antibody was added to the clarified supernatant at the following concentrations: 2 μg of anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody M2 (Eastman Kodak), 1:40 dilution of polyclonal antisera hASH-1 or hASH-2, or 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim). The solution was mixed for 16 h at 4 °C and then 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose was added. The antibody-antigen complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 200 ×g, and the supernatant containing unbound proteins was saved. The pellet was washed twice with buffer A, twice with buffer B (10 mm Tris-Cl, 140 mm NaCl), and once with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8. The proteins were eluted in sample buffer by heating at 56 °C for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. To evaluate the synthesis reaction, aliquots of the supernatant, or the translate prior to precipitation, were included for each immunoprecipitation. For sequential immunoprecipitations, the immunoprecipitation pellet was washed as above and then eluted in 0.1m glycine, pH 3.0, neutralized by 0.25 volume of 1m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and brought up to a volume of 200 μl with buffer A. The second antibody was added to precipitate complexed proteins by the standard protocol described above. Cytoplasmic injection of cRNA and the protocol for electrophysiologic studies were as previously published (16Wang T.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6524-6531Google Scholar). For assembly studies, oocytes were co-injected with 5 ng of wild-type ρ1 cRNA and an equimolar amount or a 2- and 5-fold molar excess of N-ρ1 or C-ρ1 cRNA. Seventy-two hours after injection, whole-cell current in response to 5 μm GABA was measured by two microelectrode voltage clamp in ND96 solution and compared with maximum currents obtained in oocytes injected with ρ1 alone. ND96 solution contains 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significant difference between two sample groups. Independent sampling and comparison were used, andp < 0.01 was set as a significant level. -A cell-free synthesis system was utilized to produce sufficient levels of subunit protein for study. The predominant in vitro translated ρ1 protein resolved at approximately 62 kDa (range 52–65 kDa), which is 10 kDa larger than the size predicted from amino acid composition (Fig.1). In addition to the major ρ1 62-kDa polypeptide, less intense bands of 58, 56, and 48 kDa were occasionally present (see Fig. 5). In vitro translated ρ2 protein resolved at approximately 58 kDa (range 50–60 kDa), which is 7 kDa larger than the predicted size for this protein. A second, less intense, band at 54 kDa was occasionally observed. To aid in the analysis of the subunits, ρ1 and ρ2 were tagged with epitopes: ρ1 was tagged with FLAG at the C terminus (20Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.I. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P. BioTechnology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Google Scholar), and two ρ2 constructs were made with the influenza hemagglutinin antigen tag (HA) (23Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Google Scholar) at either the N or C termini. The electrophoretic migration patterns of in vitro translated ρ1FLAG and ρ2HA were indistinguishable from ρ1 and ρ2, respectively. Two ρ1 mutants were used in this study. N-ρ1 included the ρ1 N terminus sequence up to residue 256, and C-ρ1 contained the signal peptide, the native initiating methionine, and the four hydrophobic domains (Fig. 2). N-ρ1 and C-ρ1 synthesized in vitro migrated as single bands close to their predicted sizes of 30 and 26 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1).Figure 5N-ρ1 physically interacts with ρ1FLAG. Autoradiogram of co-immunoprecipitated truncated and full-length ρ1 protein. N-ρ1 (left panel) and C-ρ1 (right panel) were cotranslated (Cotrans) or translated separately, then mixed (Mixed) with ρ1FLAG, and then incubated with M2-antiFLAG antibody. The non-precipitated proteins are in the supernatant lanes marked S, precipitated proteins are in the lanes marked P. The arrows indicate the positions of the full-length ρ1 and the truncated subunits. The migration of ρ1FLAG as a doublet in this figure represents an electrophoretic phenomenon occasionally observed.

This structure is based upon hydropathy analysis of ρ1 and by analogy to the ligand-gated ion-channel superfamily. The ρ2 subunit, with 74% amino acid identity to ρ1, is predicted to have a very similar structure (14Cutting G.R. Curristin S. Zoghbi H. O'Hara B. Seldin M.F. Uhl G.R. Genomics. 1992; 12: 801-806Google Scholar). Both the N and C termini are extracellular; the N-terminal domain is predicted to contain the ligand binding site, a disulfide bridge (two Cs), and four putative asparagine-linked glycosylation sites (asterisks). The four hydrophobic domains (represented byrectangles 1–4) in the C-terminal domain are predicted to be inserted into the cell membrane. The bracketed regions indicate the extent of the ρ1 truncation mutants. The regions used to create the ρ1-specific antibodies hASH-1 and hASH-2 areshaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) By analogy to other members of the ligand-gated neurotransmitter receptor family, GABA ρ subunits are predicted to have four hydrophobic domains that are associated with membranes (Fig. 2). We evaluated membrane association of the ρ1 subunit in vitroby translating proteins in the presence of microsomal vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum of canine pancreatic cells. Microsomal membranes and their associated proteins were then pelleted by high-speed centrifugation. The water channel aquaporin-1, which is heavily hydrophobic and has been shown to be membrane-associated (24Smith B.L. Agre P. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 266: 6407-6417Google Scholar), was used as a control in this study. As expected, in vitrotranslated aquaporin-1 was found predominantly in the membranous pellet fraction (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, in vitro translated ρ1FLAG partitioned predominantly in the membrane fraction, with a minor portion in the soluble fraction (Fig.3 A). To assess the topology of ρ1FLAG relative to the microsomal vesicle membranes, proteinase K susceptibility studies were performed. The lipid bilayer of the vesicle membrane acts as a physical barrier, protecting portions of polypeptides translocated into the vesicle lumen from digestion by proteinase K. Regions of a protein that have an extracellular orientation in vivo will be enclosed within the lumen of the microsomal vesicle in this in vitro assay. ρ1FLAG was reduced in size to about 32 kDa following treatment with proteinase K (Fig. 3 B, 2nd lane). Upon disruption of the microsomal membrane, ρ1FLAG was completely degraded (3rd lane). Thus, about half of the ρ1 protein was protected by the membrane of the microsomal vesicle. To determine which part of ρ1FLAG was protected from degradation, protease susceptibility studies were performed upon the N-ρ1 and C-ρ1 mutants. In the presence of microsomal vesicles, N-ρ1 was completely protected from proteinase K degradation (Fig. 3 B, 5th lane). Disruption of membranes with detergent resulted in degradation of N-ρ1 (6th lane) indicating that the protease was able to cleave N-ρ1. Conversely, microsomal membranes did not protect C-ρ1 from digestion (Fig.3 B, 8th lane). Together, these results indicate that the N-terminal half of full-length ρ1 is located in the lumen of the microsome and predicts that this region will have an extracellular orientation in vivo. The nucleic analysis software program PCGene (IntelliGenetics, Inc.) was used to identify the most antigenic region specific to ρ1 in the N terminus of the protein (see Fig. 2). A 13-residue peptide corresponding to amino acids 37 to 49 of ρ1 was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into rabbits to produce the polyclonal antisera hASH-1. A second polyclonal antisera, hASH-2, was obtained from rabbits injected with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the putative intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 of ρ1 (Fig. 2). The specificity of both antisera was tested by immunodetection of ρ1 protein expressed in a mammalian cell line. An HEK 293 cell line transformed with an expression vector containing the human ρ1 cDNA (293-ρ1) (22Cutting, G. R., Mickle, J., Blaschak, C. J., and Hackam, A. S. (1996)Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. , 37, (suppl.) S138.Google Scholar) was incubated with an antibody specific for ρ subunits of several vertebrate and invertebrate species (18Enz R. Brandstätter H. Wässle H. Bormann J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4479-4490Google Scholar). The ρ1-expressing cells, and not the parental HEK 293 cells, were immunostained (Fig. 4 A, left panel). Next, the polyclonal anti-ρ1 antibodies were tested for their ability to detect ρ1 protein in the 293-ρ1 cells. The hASH-1 and hASH-2 antisera specifically immunostained 293-ρ1 cells but not the parental HEK 293 cells (Fig. 4 A, middle and right panels). The signal was distributed mainly at the periphery of the cells; perinuclear staining observed in some cells may represent protein within the ER. Incubation with primary antibody alone or secondary antibody alone did not immunostain 293-ρ1 cells. Furthermore, immunostaining was markedly reduced by preabsorbing hASH-1 with 10 μg/ml peptide used to create the antisera or by preabsorbing hASH-2 with in vitro translated ρ1 protein (data not shown). When tested against in vitro translated proteins, hASH-1 immunoprecipitated ρ1 (Fig. 4 B, 2nd lane). The N terminus mutant N-ρ1, which contains the hASH-1 epitope, was also precipitated (Fig. 4 B, 6th lane). Proteins that did not contain the hASH-1 epitope, ρ2 and C-ρ1, were not immunoprecipitated by hASH-1 (4th and 8th lanes). Furthermore, precipitation could be blocked by preabsorbing the hASH-1 antisera with 2 μg/ml of the 13-residue peptide. As expected, hASH-2 antisera immunoprecipitated ρ1 and C-ρ1 but not N-ρ1 or ρ2 (Fig. 4 B). Preimmune sera did not immunoprecipitate any of the ρ proteins. We also confirmed that the epitope-tagged ρ subunits, ρ1FLAG and ρ2HA, were immunoprecipitable by the appropriate monoclonal antibodies, M2-antiFLAG and 12CA5-antiHA, respectively. As noted above, in vitro translated ρ1 occasionally had minor electrophoretic forms (58, 56, and 48 kDa) in addition to the major form at 62 kDa. The two ρ1-specific polyclonal antibodies and the M2-antiFLAG monoclonal antibody precipitated all electrophoretic variants. To localize the sequences that specify ρ1 subunit homooligomeric assembly, ρ1 mutants were tested for interaction with full-length ρ1 subunits by immunoprecipitation of cotranslated proteins and by recordings of GABA-gated currents of co-injected Xenopus oocytes. The initial interaction between most proteins occurs in the lumen of the ER (25Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Google Scholar). Thus, the localization of the N terminus of in vitro translated ρ1 to the lumen of microsomal vesicles, a region analogous to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggested th"

The widespread occurrence of different soluble glycosyltransferases secreted by cells suggests that normal glycoconjugate biosynthesis may involve cooperation between membrane-bound and soluble enzymes. The synthesis of the carbohydrate groups in secreted and membrane-bound glycoconjugates occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and involves glycosyltransferases, which utilize sugar nucleotides imported into the lumen of these organelles by specific import proteins (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Google Scholar, 2Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-88Google Scholar, 3Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol.

Most of the cloned mammalian glycosyltransferases share many features in common, although their primary structures are often unrelated. The deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNA clones encoding many glycosyltransferases reveal that they are type 2 transmembrane proteins containing a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail consisting of 4–24 amino acids, a membrane-spanning domain, and an extended stem region in the lumen that precedes the large C-terminal catalytic domain (4Kleene R.

The transmembrane domain and flanking sequences of many glycosyltransferases may be important in retaining/targeting the enzymes in the Golgi apparatus (6Teasdale R.D. D'Agostaro G. Gleeson P.A. J.

Because of their transmembrane nature, it has been presumed that Golgi glycosyltransferases function in the membrane-anchored form. Numerous glycosyltransferases have been detected, however, as soluble forms in serum, milk, colostrum, and/or growth media from normal and transformed cell lines (18Berger E.G. Kozdrowski I.

Cummings R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 109-117Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) of formation and secretion of soluble and active glycosyltransferases are not understood. N-terminal sequence analyses of soluble forms of the α2,6-sialyltransferase and β1,4-galactosyltransferase demonstrate that they arise through proteolysis within the stem region, thereby releasing the catalytic domain from the membrane (24D'Agostaro G. Bendiak B. Tropak M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 211-217Google Scholar, 25Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.-H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Google Scholar). The proteases responsible for cleaving the enzymes are not defined, although evidence suggests that a cathepsin D-like protease may be responsible for the cleavage of α2,6-sialyltransferase (26Lammers G. Jamieson J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 389-393Google Scholar). The functions of the soluble glycosyltransferases are not known. One enzyme that has recently been shown to be secreted from cultured cells is the murine α1,3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GT) 1The abbreviations used are: α1,3GT, UDP-Gal:β-d-Gal α1,3-galactosyltransferase; HA, influenza hemagglutinin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GS-I-B4, Griffonia simplicifoliaI-B4 isolectin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 192-201Google Scholar) cDNA encoding for α1,3GT have been identified. The α1,3GT is expressed in a variety of mammalian species, but it is not expressed in Old World monkeys, apes, and humans (34Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9858-9866Google Scholar, 35Galili U. Shohet S.B. Korbin E. Stults C.L.M. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17755-17762Google Scholar). The expression of the α1,3GT in murine F9 teratocarcinoma cells is transcriptionally up-regulated by retinoic acid induction, but most of the newly synthesized enzyme is eventually secreted into the culture media of the cells (27Cho S.K Yeh J. Cho M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3238-3246Google Scholar). The α1,3GT is secreted by many cell types, since we have detected soluble forms of the α1,3GT in the culture media of all cell lines expressing the enzyme, and we have found enzyme activity in the sera of different animals expressing the functional α1,3GT gene (28Cho, S. K., Yeh, J.-C., and Cummings, R. D. (1997) Glycoconj. J. in press.Google Scholar). The common occurrence of the α1,3GT in a soluble form led us to question whether it may have a function. One possibility is that the soluble enzyme may have a biosynthetic role within the Golgi apparatus. In this report we describe experiments showing that a truncated, soluble recombinant form of α1,3GT expressed in human 293 cells is highly efficient in α-galactosylating both newly synthesized membrane-associated and secreted glycoproteins and that it is comparable to the wild-type enzyme in its efficiency. Interestingly, both the truncated and full-length enzymes are secreted from 293 cells and both are cleaved by endogenous protease(s) at two primary sites in the stem region. These results demonstrate that a soluble glycosyltransferase can function within cells and suggest that normal proteolysis of membrane-bound glycosyltransferases may be important in generating enzymes that participate in glycoconjugate biosynthesis.

Mouse teratocarcinoma F9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates as described (36Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Google Scholar). For induction of differentiation, cells were grown under identical conditions in media supplemented with 10−7mall-trans-retinoic acid for 3 days. Human 293 kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. CHO-Tag cells, expressing the large T antigen, were cultured in α-minimal essential media containing 10% fetal calf serum, ribonucleosides, and G418 (400 μg/ml). CHO-Tag cells were a generous gift of Dr. John B. Lowe (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). A C-terminal fusion of the murine α1,3GT to a 9-amino acid peptide tag from influenza hemagglutinin (HA) was generated by PCR using the 5′ primer 5′-GGGGAGCACATCCTGGCCCACATCCAG-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-ATGCTCTAGATCAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAGACATTATTTCTAACCAAATTATACT-3′ as described. 2C. A. Rivera-Marrero, S. A. Tonon, R. D. Cummings, and K. W. Moremen, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the plasmid pCDM7-αGT, which contains the cDNA of the murine α1,3GT (29Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Ruff M.M. Kukowska-Latallo J. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8227-8231Google Scholar), was used as the template for the PCR reaction. The resulting PCR fragment (490 base pairs), containing a SalI restriction site at the 5′-end and a XbaI restriction site at the 3′-end, was subcloned into the vector pCR II and sequenced. Wild-type α1,3GT cDNA in pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was excised with SalI and XbaI, and the excised fragment was replaced with the 490-base pairSalI/XbaI PCR fragment encoding the epitope tag. The 9-amino acid HA epitope tag is specifically recognized by the mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (37Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 505-519Google Scholar). This full-length construct, designated α1,3GT-HA, was co-transfected into 293 cells, along with the G418 selection plasmid PBKEF (a gift from Dr. Kinji Fukudome, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK), in a 4:1 molar ratio, using lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the procedure recommended by the supplier. Clonal cell lines were derived from the G418 (400 μg/ml)-resistant transfectant population using cloning cylinders. Flow cytometric analyses were performed (27Cho S.K Yeh J. Cho M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3238-3246Google Scholar), and a representative clonal line that stably expresses cell surface α-galactosylated glycoconjugates was selected and designated fl-α1,3GT-1. A mutated form of the full-length α1,3GT was generated in which the stem sequence was mutated to contain Asp residues at three potentially critical sites for cleavage (see Fig. 1 C). This construct was generated by PCR using the 5′ primer (HindIII primer) 5′-GGAAGCTTATGATCACTATGCTTCAAGAT-3′ and the 3′ primer (mutagenic primer) 5′-ACTGTGGGTCCCATTTTTAAACCAGCTTGGGAACCACCAGTC-3′ with aDraII site. Specifically, the 3′ primer was designed to convert amino acid residues 76, 80, and 81 to Asp (see Fig.1 C). The plasmid pcDNAI/Amp, which contains the full-length construct α1,3GT-HA, was used as the template for the PCR reaction. The resulting PCR fragment (260 base pairs) was digested withHindIII and DraII and then ligated into theDraII/XbaI excised fragment of α1,3GT-HA, followed by ligation into the HindIII/XbaI linearized pcDNAI/Amp vector. This mutant construct, designated st-1-α1,3GT-HA, was sequenced to confirm the mutations. The plasmid containing the mutated gene was co-transfected into 293 cells along with the G418 selection plasmid PBKEF. Clonal selection was carried out in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml) as described above. Western blot analysis was performed using microsomes and culture media of transfectants as described below, and a representative clonal line that stably expressed the mutated α1,3GT was selected and designated st-1-α1,3GT-HA-1. To produce a soluble form of murine α1,3-galactosyltransferase, a fusion protein containing a 12-residue Ca2+-dependent peptide epitope for the monoclonal antibody, HPC4, and the putative lumenal catalytic domain of the enzyme was constructed in the mammalian expression vector RSV-PL4 (38Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Google Scholar). Specifically, the lumenal domain of the α1,3GT was amplified by PCR using the 5′ primer 5′-CCAACCCGGGATTCCAGAGGTTGGTGAGAACAGATGGCAG-3′ with a SmaI site and the 3′ primer 5′-CGGCTCTAGAGCCTTCAGACATTATTTCTAACCAAATT-3′ with a XbaI site. The plasmid pCDM7-αGT, which contains the cDNA of the murine α1,3GT (28Cho, S. K., Yeh, J.-C., and Cummings, R. D. (1997) Glycoconj. J. in press.Google Scholar), was used as the template for the PCR reaction. The PCR product was digested withSmaI and XbaI and then ligated into theStuI/XbaI site of RSV-PL4 vector, resulting in a fusion protein of the soluble α1,3GT in-frame to the transferrin signal sequence present in the vector. This construct was transfected into human 293 cells using lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and clonal selection was carried out in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml) as described above. Enzyme assays were performed (27Cho S.K Yeh J. Cho M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3238-3246Google Scholar), and representative clonal lines that stably secreted enzyme into media were selected and designated s-α1,3GT-1, s-α1,3GT-2, and s-α1,3GT-3. The HPC4-NKR-P1 was constructed in the mammalian expression vector RSV-PL4 (38Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Google Scholar). Specifically, both the N-terminal cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domain of NKR-P1 were removed, and the extracellular domain of the NKR-P1 was amplified by PCR using the 5′ primer 5′-CAAAAACCATCAAGAGAAAA-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-GGATTCTAGATCAGGAGTCATTACTCGGGG-3′. The cDNA encoding the murine NKR-P1 used as the template for the PCR reaction was a kind gift of Drs. Massimo Trucco and Roberto Giorda (Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). The PCR product was phosphorylated and digested with XbaI and then ligated into theStuI/XbaI site of RSV-PL4 vector, resulting in a fusion protein of the soluble NKR-P1 in-frame to the transferrin signal sequence present in the vector. This construct was transfected into human 293 cells using lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and clonal selection was carried out in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml) as described above. Western blot analysis was performed using culture media of transfectants, and representative clonal lines that stably secreted NKR-P1 into media were selected. Cell extracts were prepared in the presence of the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and microsomes were prepared as described previously (27Cho S.K Yeh J. Cho M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3238-3246Google Scholar, 39Cummings R.D. Mattox S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 511-519Google Scholar). To prepare cell culture media for enzyme assays and immunoblot or lectin blot analyses, cells were grown in complete media until they reached ∼80% confluency and were then shifted to serum-free media. The media were harvested after 24 h of culture and subjected to low speed centrifugation (300 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant was centrifuged at high speed (100,000 × gfor 1 h). Media were concentrated in a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-HA (clone 16B12) ascites fluid was purchased from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Berkeley, CA) and was used at a dilution of 1:500. Monoclonal anti-HPC4 antibody was a gift from Dr. Charles Esmon (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) and was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. To prepare rabbit α1,3GT antiserum against the murine α1,3GT, a fusion protein was constructed that contains the putative lumenal domain of the murine α1,3GT and a 6-histidine tag at the N terminus. Specifically, the lumenal domain of the α1,3GT, comprising amino acid residues 61–326, was amplified by PCR using the 5′ primer 5′-ACCGGATCCCAACAGAATTCCAGAGGT-3′ with aBamHI site and the 3′ primer 5′-AGCCTGCAGTTAAAGCACTCCCTGGTG-3′ with a PstI site. The plasmid pCDM7-αGT, which contains the cDNA of the murine α1,3GT (28Cho, S. K., Yeh, J.-C., and Cummings, R. D. (1997) Glycoconj. J. in press.Google Scholar), was used as the template for the PCR reaction. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and PstI and then ligated into the BamHI/PstI site of PQE-10 vector (QIA express, Qiagen), resulting in a 6-His-tagged fusion protein of truncated α1,3GT. The resulting PCR fragment containing aBamHI restriction site at the 5′-end and a PstI restriction site at the 3′-end was subcloned into the vector pBS II SK− and sequenced. This construct was used to transform into Escherichia coli strain M15 (pREP4), and the expressed 6-His-α1,3GT was purified using a nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column according to the procedure recommended by the supplier. The rabbit α1,3GT antiserum was raised by injecting an animal three times (in 10-day intervals) with the nickel affinity-purified, bacterial 6-His-tagged fusion protein of the truncated α1,3GT. Sera were collected and used at a dilution of 1:500. The secondary antibody conjugates, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody, were used at dilutions of 1:500. The catalytically active, secreted form of α1,3GT was purified from culture media of human 293 transfectants by affinity chromatography on a column of UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose with some modification (40Elices M.J. Blake D.A. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6064-6072Google Scholar). Culture media from fl-α1,3GT-1 and s-α1,3GT-2 cells were harvested when the cells were ∼90% confluent and then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MnCl2, pH 7.0 (buffer A) with several changes of buffer. The dialyzed material was applied to a column containing UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose (4 μmol/ml resin) and washed with buffer A. This was followed by additional washing with buffer A containing 0.75 m NaCl until the absorbance of each fraction at 280 nm reached background levels. The bound enzyme was eluted with 5 mm UDP in buffer A, and enzyme was concentrated in Centricon-10. The purified enzyme was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The spot corresponding to the α1,3GT was located on the paper by Ponceau staining and then excised and subjected to N-terminal amino sequence analysis by Edman degradation, using the Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequencer (The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Molecular Biology Facility, Oklahoma City, OK). Cells were harvested and washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Approximately 5 × 105cells were incubated with FITC-GS-I-B4 at 10 μg/ml in 100 μl of staining buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 1% heat-inactivated goat serum) on ice for 30 min and then analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described previously (27Cho S.K Yeh J. Cho M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3238-3246Google Scholar). The α1,3GT was purified by UDP-hexanolamine affinity chromatography from s-α1,3GT-2 culture media as described above. NKR-P1 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on immobilized anti-HPC4. The purified proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred (42Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) onto nitrocellulose membranes and then stained by standard immunoblot analysis. The standard ECL immunoblotting procedures are as follows. Blots were blocked with TBS (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h, and they were incubated with primary antibodies in dilution buffer (TBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. Following three 15-min washes in TTBS (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20), the immunoblots were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in dilution buffer. Blots were washed three times (15 min each) in TTBS followed by one wash in TBS and developed using the ECL Western blotting kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the detection of α1,3GT derived from fl-α1,3GT-1 cells, the microsomes and soluble protein in the culture media were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by standard ECL immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-HA antibody. For the detection of α-galactosylated glycoproteins, 30 μg of the microsomal fraction and 100 μg of soluble proteins in culture media were prepared as described previously (27Cho S.K Yeh J. Cho M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3238-3246Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL Western, Amersham Corp.) and followed by lectin blot analysis. The ECL lectin blotting was performed as described previously (27Cho S.K Yeh J. Cho M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3238-3246Google Scholar) except that the α-galactosylated glycoproteins were detected using 10 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated GS-I-B4. To test the functionality of the soluble form of murine α1,3GT and to compare it to the full-length enzyme, fusion proteins were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and illustrated in Fig. 1. A full-length chimeric α1,3GT was constructed in which the 9-amino acid influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (37Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 505-519Google Scholar) was fused to the C-terminal end of full-length α1,3GT. This chimera is shown in Fig. 1 A and is designated the α1,3GT-HA construct. A soluble form of the α1,3GT was constructed in which the fusion protein consists of the transferrin signal peptide preceding an HPC4 epitope (38Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Google Scholar) and followed by amino acids 63–394 of the murine α1,3GT encoding the C-terminal catalytic domain. This chimera is shown in Fig. 1 B and is designated the HPC4-αGT construct. Human kidney 293 cells were transfected with either the α1,3GT-HA or HPC4-αGT, and stably expressing 293 cell lines were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One clone stably expressing α1,3GT-HA was designated fl-α1,3GT-1. Three clones stably expressing the HPC4-αGT were identified, and these were designated s-α1,3GT-1, s-α1,3GT-2, and s-α1,3GT-3. Cell surface expression of terminal Galα1 → 3Gal determinants requires expression of the cognate α1,3GT (29Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Ruff M.M. Kukowska-Latallo J. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8227-8231Google Scholar). The stably expressing cell lines were tested for their ability to display cell surface-localized oligosaccharide product of enzyme using flow cytometry and FITC-GS-I-B4. GS-I-B4 is a plant lectin that specifically binds terminal Galα1 → 3Gal linkages (43Goldstein I.J. Blake D.A. Ebisu S. Williams T.J. Murphy L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3890-3893Google Scholar). As expected, the parental 293 cell line does not display surface Galα1 → 3Gal determinants (Fig.2). In contrast, 293 cells transfected with either α1,3GT-HA or HPC4-αGT stained brightly with FITC-GS-I-B4 (Fig. 2). The levels of expression of surface Galα1 → 3Gal determinants in the stably expressing clones were comparable to the normal level observed in retinoic acid-differentiated F9 cells cells (Fig. 2). These observations demonstrate that the soluble α1,3GT can participate in biosynthesis of surface-localized glycoconjugates containing the Galα1 → 3Gal determinant. Based on these flow cytometric analyses and the level of staining with GS-I-B4, the soluble α1,3GT appears to be comparable to the full-length enzyme in generating surface Galα1 → 3Gal determinants. To assess whether there are quantitative and/or qualitative differences between the full-length or soluble forms of the enzyme in the way they glycosylate proteins, the microsome and serum-free media prepared from the clones were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and glycoproteins were probed with peroxidase-conjugated GS-I-B4. As expected, the glycoproteins from parental 293 cell microsomes and serum-free media were not reactive with GS-I-B4 (Fig. 3, A andB). In contrast, significant amounts of GS-I-B4-reactive membrane-associated glycoprotein was present in microsomes of fl-α1,3GT-1, s-α1,3GT-1, and s-α1,3GT-2 cells, although the levels of expression appear somewhat higher in fl-α1,3GT-1 microsomes. However, no appreciable differences were observed in the overall patterns of α-galactosylated membrane-associated glycoproteins in microsomes between the clones expressing either full-length or truncated enzyme (Fig. 3 A). In addition, both the levels and the pattern of GS-I-B4-reactive material in the serum-free media of all the clones were similar (Fig. 3 B). In all cases the binding of GS-I-B4 to glycoproteins was specific, since inclusion of hapten sugar raffinose (200 mm) blocked binding (Fig. 3,A and B). In control experiments, GS-I-B4 bound well, as expected, to a commercial preparation of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm laminin, which is known to contain terminal α1,3-galactosyl residues (44Arumugham R.G. Hsieh T.C.Y. Tanzer M. Laine R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 112-116Google Scholar, 45Knibbs R.N. Perini F. Goldstein I.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6379-6392Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that both the full-length and soluble α1,3GT cause the biosynthesis of high levels of α-galactosylated glycoproteins. To determine whether there are significant differences in the level of expression of the solubleversus the full-length α1,3GT and whether there are differences in secretion of the two forms, we measured the enzyme activity in cell extracts and culture media usingN-acetyllactosamine as the acceptor and UDP-[3H]Gal as the donor. The results are shown in TableI. No activity was detected in extracts of the parental 293 cells. Significant α1,3GT activity was present in extracts of fl-α1,3GT-1 cells (49.0 nmol/h), but approximately two-thirds of the total activity, which represents activity in the cell extracts plus culture media, was recovered in the culture media (Table I). The activities of the α1,3GT in extracts of s-α1,3GT-1, s-α1,3GT-2, and s-α1,3GT-3 cells were slightly lower than that of fl-α1,3GT-1 cell extracts (Table I). As might be expected, the levels of activity of α1,3GT in media of s-α1,3GT-1, s-α1,3GT-2, and s-α1,3GT-3 cells were slightly higher than that in the media from fl-α1,3GT-1 cells.Table Iα1,3GT activity in cell extracts and media from human 293 cells transfected with full-length or soluble, t"
https://openalex.org/W2041316200,"Membrane vesicles were prepared fromEscherichia coli cells in which SecE was depleted to 2% of wild-type membranes. SecE depletion had pleiotropic effects; SecD, SecF, SecG, and SecY were decreased 4–6-fold, whereas SecA was increased about 16-fold over that of wild-type membranes. These membranes were substantially active in the in vitrotranslocation of proOmpA, which was mediated by the SecA pathway since it was inhibited by azide. Similar substantial translocation activities were observed for proLamB and proLpp in the SecE-depleted membranes. However, the translocation of proPhoA was more severely impaired. These data indicate that SecE may enhance but is not obligatorily required for the translocation of at least certain precursors, and suggest that the effects of the SecE depletion on protein translocation may be precursor-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1967800051,"A stage-dependent increase in the level of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine during intraerythrocytic growth ofPlasmodium knowlesi in rhesus monkey erythrocytes was observed. Further, intraerythrocytic P. knowlesi-induced putrescine influx was found in trophozoite stage-infected erythrocytes and process was time- and temperature-dependent and showed saturable kinetics. Characteristics of induced putrescine influx appears in infected erythrocytes to be close to the normal erythrocytes in terms of affinity of putrescine to the putrescine transporter (Km 34.6 ± 3.8 μmas normal erythrocytes and Km 37.2 ± 5.2 μm in infected erythrocytes). However, the difference involves the significant increase in the putrescine influx rate after infection (Vmax = 4.21 nmol/min/1010 normal erythrocytes, compared with 11.6 nmol/min/1010 infected erythrocytes). Energy dependence, involvement of –SH group, and noninterference by amino acid, spermidine, and spermine in the putrescine influx process clearly demonstrate the presence of a distinct transporter for putrescine in infected erythrocytes. A putrescine conjugateN 1,N 4-bis(7-chloroquinoline-4-yl)butane-1,4-diamine (BCBD) was synthesized, which inhibits the putrescine influx in theP. knowlesi infected erythrocytes (Kiof 43.2 μm) as well as in vitrogrowth of P. knowlesi (IC50 value, 7.64 ± 0.97 ng/ml BCBD, 10.8 ± 0.45 ng/ml chloroquine). Addition of exogenous polyamines failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of BCBD in vitro. Administration of BCBD (24 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal, twice a day for 4 days) cured the Swiss mice infected with multidrug-resistant infection of Plasmodium yoelii. Therefore, inhibition of putrescine transport in malaria-infected erythrocytes offers a lead in the search of a new class of chemotherapeutic molecules against malaria.

Therefore, inhibition of putrescine transport in malaria-infected erythrocytes offers a lead in the search of a new class of chemotherapeutic molecules against malaria. Malaria remains one of the most important parasitic disease in the tropical countries. The global expansion of the disease has been attributed mainly to the failure of vector control programs and spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine and other known antimalarial drugs (1The World Health Report (1995) pp. 22–28, World Health Organization, GenevaGoogle Scholar). For the development of new molecules effective against resistant strains, a new target for rational drug design is imperative (2Cabantchik F. Blood. 1989; 74: 1464-1471Google Scholar). The naturally occurring polyamines, spermidine, spermine, and their precursor, putrescine, are important regulators of growth and differentiation in a wide variety of cell types including protozoan parasites (3Bacchi C.J. Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Bacchi C.J. Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Inhibition of Polyamine metabolism. Academic Press, New York1987: 317-344Google Scholar). Inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis could be a suitable target to control proliferative disorders and infectious diseases (4Pegg A.E. Cancer Rev. 1988; 48: 759-774Google Scholar, 5Shukla O.P. J. Sci. Indus. Res. 1990; 49: 263-282Google Scholar, 6Hibasami H. Tsukada T. Nishiguchi Y. Sakura M. Shirikawa S. Nakshima K. Int. J. Paracitol. 1994; 24: 213-217Google Scholar). Parasites of genus Plasmodia, during its intraerythrocytic schizogony (I-ES), 1The abbreviations used are: I-ES, intraerythrocytic schizogony; DFMO, difluoromethyl ornithine; MGBG, methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone); BCBD, N1,N4-bis(7-chloroquinoline-4-yl)butane-1,4-diamine; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; SPD/SPM, spermidine/spermine; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; pCMB, p-chloromercuric benzoate; N-EM, N-ethylmaleimide. undergoes a complex developmental cycle resulting in 8–32 merozoites from a single parasite. However, normal erythrocytes are devoid of polyamine biosynthetic machinery, and only traces of spermidine and spermine are detectable (7Assaraf Y.G. Golenser J. Spira D.T. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 815-819Google Scholar). Postinvasion, as P. falciparumrapidly multiply and grow, polyamines and their peak biosynthetic enzymes like ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase increases in parsitized erythrocytes (7Assaraf Y.G. Golenser J. Spira D.T. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 815-819Google Scholar, 8Whaun J.M. Brown N.D. J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 1985; 233: 507-511Google Scholar). These polyamines at certain stage of Plasodium cell cycle trigger the replication of malarial DNA and stimulate synthesis of specific proteins (9Assaraf Y.G. Abu-Elheiga L. Spira D.T. Hesser H. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 221-226Google Scholar). These observations were confirmed further by the presence of polyamine dependent α-like DNA polymerase that catalyzes synthesis of malarial parasite DNA during I-ES (10Bacharach U. Abu-Elheiga L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 633-637Google Scholar). ODC, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis, is irreversibly inhibited by α-difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO), an ornithine analogue (11Metcalf B.W. Bey P. Danzin C. Jung M.J. Casara P. Vevert J.P. J. Am Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 2551-2553Google Scholar). This compound inhibits the proliferation of various cell types including parasitic protozoan (12McCann P.P. Bacchi C.J. Hanson W.L. Cain G.D. Nathan H.C. Hunter S.H. Sjoerdsma A. Adv. Polyamine Res. 1981; 3: 97-110Google Scholar). Addition of DFMO to P. falciparum culture prevented the accumulation of putrescine and spermidine in parasitized erythrocytes, thus resulting in the arrest of malarial parasite growth at trophozoite stage, i.e. prior to initiation of DNA synthesis (7Assaraf Y.G. Golenser J. Spira D.T. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 815-819Google Scholar). On the basis of the above available evidence, it appears that polyamine may also regulate the I-ES of malarial parasite. However, DFMO failed to inhibit the erythrocytic schizogony of malarial parasite in vivo (13Bitonti A.J. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 237-243Google Scholar). No possible biochemical basis has yet been established for refractoriness of DFMO against blood stage malarial parasite infection in vivo. Our efforts to investigate the putrescine transport system in malarial parasite-infected erythrocytes are based on three specific reasons. First, an increasing body of evidence suggests that refractoriness of tumor cells and protozoan parasites to inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis is due to influx of polyamines across the membrane, and this transport is also subjected to regulation by environmental and physiological stimuli (14Khan N.A. Quemener V. Moulinox J. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 9-24Google Scholar, 15Lessard M. Zhao C. Sing S.M. Poulin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1685-1694Google Scholar, 16Seiler N. Dekros J.G. Moulinox J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1996; 28: 843-861Google Scholar). Changes in the influx or efflux of polyamines provides an additional mechanism to regulate the intracellular polyamine contents (17Seiler N. Dezeure F. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 211-218Google Scholar). Second, it has been well established that I-ES growth of malarial parasite results in numerous biochemical, structural, and functional changes in the host erythrocytes membrane (18Joshi P. Dutta G.P. Gupta C.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 103-108Google Scholar, 19Deitsach K.W. Wellems T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 1-10Google Scholar) and increased permeability to a wide variety of structurally unrelated solutes via transport pathways that are functionally distinct from those known to operate in normal erythrocytes (2Cabantchik F. Blood. 1989; 74: 1464-1471Google Scholar, 20Ginsburg H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 10: 1847-1856Google Scholar). These parasite-induced pathways facilitate both entry of metabolic and biosynthetic substrates into infected erythrocytes and rapid efflux of potentially harmful catabolites (21Elford B.C. Gowam G.M. Ferguson D.J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 361-374Google Scholar). Finally, exogenous addition of putrescine to DFMO-inhibited in vitro culture of P. falciparum resulted in the resumption of growth (7Assaraf Y.G. Golenser J. Spira D.T. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 815-819Google Scholar) and DNA synthesis (9Assaraf Y.G. Abu-Elheiga L. Spira D.T. Hesser H. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 221-226Google Scholar). On the basis of the above mentioned facts, we envisaged that putrescine might be available from plasma by increasing its transport across the red cell membrane in the parasitized erythrocytes to overcome DFMO inhibition of ODC. To prove the above mentioned hypothesis, the roles of specific polyamines were studied during intraerythrocytic development ofPlasmodium knowlesi (a simian malarial parasite) in rhesus monkey and P. knowlesi-induced putrescine transport system in the parasitized erythrocytes was characterized. In recent years, emphasis is on altred membrane transport in malaria-infected erythrocytes as a potential pharmacological target for antimalarial drug development (20Ginsburg H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 10: 1847-1856Google Scholar, 21Elford B.C. Gowam G.M. Ferguson D.J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 361-374Google Scholar). We have designed and synthesized a putrescine conjugate,N 1,N 4-bis(7-chloroquinoline-4-yl)butane-1,4-diamine (BCBD) on the basis of characteristics of induced putrescine transport system in parasitized erythrocytes and established a correlation between inhibition of putrescine influx and antimalarial activity. A summary of a part of this work has been published previously in abstract form (22Singh S. Puri S.K. Pandey V.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 31Google Scholar). Healthy rhesus monkeys of either sex weighing 4–6 kg were procured from the primate house of our institute. [14C]putrescine hydrochloride and [8-3H]hypoxanthine were obtained from Amersham International Plc. UK; α-DFMO was synthesized at Marion Merrel Dow Inc. (Cincinnati, OH) and obtained through Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. All other chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma. The infection of P. knowlesi was maintained in rhesus monkeys by serial blood passage with 1 × 106 infected erythrocytes, and parasitemia was recorded through microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. Blood from healthy and P. knowlesi-infected monkeys (at different developmental stages of the parasite, viz. ring, trophozoite, and schizont) were collected in prechilled acid citrate-dextrose solution. The blood was passed through CF-11 column, and thereafter, erythrocytes (both normal and infected) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (0.85% NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and suspended in the same medium. Different developmental stage-specific P. knowlesi-infected erythrocytes were enriched using Ficoll-Conray gradient as described earlier by Joshi et al. (18Joshi P. Dutta G.P. Gupta C.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 103-108Google Scholar), and an enriched population of parasitized erythrocytes (ring-stage infected ∼85–90% pure, trophozoite 85–88% pure, and schizonts stage 90–95% pure) were obtained. The normal and infected erythrocytes were lyzed by three brief cycles of freezing and thawing (at −70 and 37 °C) followed by sonication (Branson Sonifier B-12, microtip 15 s, 3 times at 15 watt). 4 to 6 volumes of perchloric acid (0.3 m) were added to sonicated medium and thereafter centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Polyamines were analyzed in the clear supernatant by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography after preparing their benzoyl derivatives according to method of Verkoelen et al.(23Verkoelen C.F. Ramijn J.C. Schroender F.H. Vanschalkwijk N.P. Splinster T.A.W. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 426: 41-45Google Scholar). Freshly prepared normal and trophozoite-infected erythrocytes were used for putrescine influx as described previously (24Krik K. Wang H.Y. Elford B.C. Newbold C.I. Ellory J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 521-525Google Scholar) with few modifications, and optimal conditions were standardized. In brief, erythrocyte (both normal and infected) were washed four times with Hepes buffer saline (134 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2PO4, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and resuspended in the same medium at 37 °C. Erythrocyte suspension (450 μl of 2–5 × 108 erythrocytes/ml) in combination with appropriate reagent solutions was taken in an Eppendorf tube and kept at 4/37 °C for 10 min for temperature equilibration. Influx of putrescine was initiated by adding varying concentrations of putrescine pulsed with 0.5 μCi [14C]putrescine and incubated further at 4/37 °C for the specified time. The reaction was terminated by transferring three aliquotes of 145 μl each of erythrocyte suspension to another Eppendorf tube containing 800 μl of ice-cold isotonic Mops-buffered MgCl2 solution (106 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Mops, pH 7.4) layered over 250 μl of dibutylpthalate. Tubes were immediately centrifuged at 10,000 × g (15 s at 4 °C), and supernatant along with dibutylpthalate layer were aspirated out. Traces of the solution on the inner wall were removed by cotton swab saturated with ethyl alcohol. The cell pellet was lyzed by brief freezing and thawing (−70 and 37 °C) and deproteinized by addition of 0.5 ml of trichloroacetic acid (5% w/v) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g (10 min at 4 °C). The radioactivity in the supernatant was measured after transferring 400 μl of supernatant to the 10 ml of water-based scintillation fluid (Aquasol) in LKB, 1209 Rack-beta liquid scintillation counter. For parallel control samples, [14C]putrescine influx was determined by substracting values obtained by carrying out incubations in the presence of 1.2 mm putrescine (25Ancelin M.L. Parant M. Thuet M.J. Philipport J.R. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 701-709Google Scholar). To a stirred putrescine-free base (0.088 g, 1 mmol), 4,7-dichloroquinoline (0.396 g, 2 mmol) at room temperature was added. The reaction mixture was held at 140–145 °C for 4 h and then allowed to attain room temperature. The solid residue was washed with cold ether several times to remove unreacted substrates. The solid residue, free from the starting material, was triturated with 2 n HCl (5 ml) solution, cooled in an ice bath, filtered, washed with water, and air-dried.

The in vitro antimalarial activity of BCBD was evaluated using short term culture of P. knowlesi(quotidian periodicity in vitro as well as in vivo) (26Butcher G.A. Bull. W. H. O. 1979; 57: 17-26Google Scholar). In brief, P. knowlesi-infected cells synchronized at predominantly ring stage were obtained from infected monkey and suspended in the culture medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% normal monkey serum) to get a final concentration of 6% hematocrit and 1.5% parasitaemia. Test compounds were dissolved in ethanol:water (1:1) solution and further diluted with culture medium. After initiation of the culture, test compounds and3[H]hypoxanthine (2 μCi/well) were added to each well as the culture plate was kept at 37 °C in candle jar module. After incubation for 20–22 h, the culture was harvested on glass membrane filter using automatic cell harvester (PHDTM Cambridge, MA). Filters were transferred to Triton-based scintillation fluid (333 ml Triton X-100, 5.5 gm 2,5-diphenyloxazole, 0.1 gm 1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)] benzene, and 100 ml of toluene), and radioactivity was counted in an LKB, 1209 Rack-beta liquid scintillation counter. The multidrug-resistantPlasmodium yoelii nigeriensis strain maintained in Swiss mice was used to evaluate the in vivo antimalarial activity (27Pandey A. Dutta G.P. Indian J. Malariol. 1986; 19: 121-124Google Scholar). Four-week-old Swiss albino mice of either sex weighing 20–22 gm were infected with P. yoelii (1 × 106infected erythrocytes) intraperitoneally. The BCBD was given intraperitoneally in 0.2 ml of water:ethanol mixture twice daily from days 0 to 3. Degree of parasitemia was recorded from Giemsa-stained thin blood smears (28Peters W. Portus J.H. Robinson B.L. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1975; 69: 155-162Google Scholar). The animals which did not develop patent infection till day 28 were recorded as cured. The LD50 of BCBD was determined in Swiss mice (29Horn H.J. Biometrics. 1956; 12: 311-322Google Scholar). The results of the polyamine profile at different developmental stages of malarial parasite (P. knowlesi) during intraerythrocytic schizogony in its host monkey erythrocytes are presented in Table I. Only traces of spermidine and spermine were present in the normal erythrocytes, while putrescine was undetectable. After invasion of the parasite, ring stage-infected erythrocytes showed a significantly elevated level of spermidine (∼7.0 fold) and spermine (∼3-fold), and putrescine also appeared as a new molecule. At trophozoite stage-infected erythrocytes, significant increase was found in all the three polyamines though the pattern of increase was different (∼3.5-fold for putrescine, ∼2.7-fold for spermine, and ∼2.11-fold for spermine) as compared with ring stage-infected erythrocytes. Similarly, schizont infected erythrocytes showed further increase in the polyamine levels though the pattern of increase was again different (∼2.5-fold for spermidine, ∼2.41-fold for putrescine, and ∼1.21-fold for spermidine). These observations clearly demonstrate stage-specific increases in the polyamine levels during I-ES of P. knowlesi.Table IPolyamine profile in normal and different development stages of Plasmodium knowlesi infected monkey erythrocytesSamplePolyamineSpermidine/Spermine ratioPutrescineSpermidineSpermineNormal erythrocytesND26.8 ± 3.411.9 ± 1.62.24Ring infected erythrocytes31.1 ± 4.9204 ± 10.842.7 ± 5.04.76Trophozoite infected erythrocytes111 ± 18.7556 ± 31.190.3 ± 10.76.17Schizont infected erythrocytes262 ± 16.2693 ± 59.8228 ± 23.23.03Polyamines expressed as nmol/1010 erythrocytes and data are mean ± S.D. of five independent experiments in duplicate. Open table in a new tab Polyamines expressed as nmol/1010 erythrocytes and data are mean ± S.D. of five independent experiments in duplicate. In our previous studies, increased putrescine influx was observed inP. knowlesi-infected erythrocytes as compared with normal erythrocytes (30Singh S. Tekwani B.L. Puri S.K. Pandey V.C. Kumar S. Sen R.K. Dutta G.P. Sharma R.N. Tropical Diseases, Molecular Biology and Control Strategies. Publication and Information Directorate, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, India1994Google Scholar). Fig. 2 showed that putrescine influx was quite low at 4 °C in normal erythrocytes (0.5 nmol/1010 erythrocytes after 5 min of incubation) which did not increase significantly even after 30 min of incubation. In contrast, at 37 °C, putrescine influx increased linearly with time, reaching up to 2.0 nmol/1010 erythrocytes after 20 min. In infected erythrocytes, putrescine influx was still very low at 4 °C (0.75 nmol/1010 erythrocytes after 20 min). However, at 37 °C, there was a steep linear increase in the putrescine influx, which reached 31.6 nmol/1010 erythrocytes after 15 min,i.e. more than 11-fold higher as compared with that observed in normal erythrocytes. The concentration-dependent influx of putrescine was investigated in normal and infected erythrocytes after 2 min of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3). Data obtained from concentration-dependent putrescine influx curve were computed in the Lineweaver-Burk plot using SigmaPlot 5.0, and parameters obtained using axis to axis regression analyses wereKm 34.6 ± 3.8 μm andVmax = 4.21 nmol/min/1010erythrocytes and Km = 37.2 ± 5.2 μm and Vmax = 11.6 nmol/min/1010 erythrocytes for normal erythrocytes and infected erythrocytes, respectively. Competition studies were carried out to demonstrate the specificity of the parasite-induced putrescine transport system in infected erythrocytes using structurally related molecules like amino acids and other polyamines. Serine, leucine, lysine, and aspartic acid representing different substrate or each amino acid transport system (A, L, Ly+, B−) failed to exert any effect on the rate of putrescine influx in infected erythrocytes (Table II, part I). Spermidine/spermine share the putrescine transport system partially while DFMO showed no competition with the putrescine. MGBG significantly inhibited the putrescine influx though, structurally, MGBG differs from putrescine. Therefore, observations from these studies indicate that parasite-induced putrescine transport system was highly specific for putrescine. Further competition studies were carried out with the −SH group interfering molecules and metabolic inhibitors to investigate the possibility of carrier-mediated process of putrescine influx in the infected erythrocytes. −SH group blocker agents,p-chloromercuric benzoate (pCMB) andN-ethylmaleimide (N-EM) inhibited the putrescine influx up to 85 and 93%, respectively, as compared with control (TableII). Involvement of −SH group in the putrescine influx process was further confirmed when pCMB and/or N-EM coincubated in presence of dithiothreitol restricted the effect of pCMB and/or N-EM in the putrescine influx process. In the presence of potassium cyanide, sodium arsenate, iodoacetic acid, and dinitrophenol in the incubation medium, the process of putrescine influx was inhibited significantly and maximum effect (82%) was observed with dinitrophenol.Table IIEffect of amino acids, polyamines, and their related compounds, -SH group protecting and blocking agents and metabolic inhibitors on putrescine influx in Plasmodium knowlesi infected erythrocytesEffector (Conc. 1 mM)Putrescine influx % of controlPart-IAmino AcidsSerine (A)84 ± 9.1Leucine (L)86 ± 13Lysine (Ly′)106 ± 11Aspartic Acid (β)92 ± 16Part-IIPolyamine & related moleculesSpermidine62 ± 9.8Spermine69 ± 10DFMO106 ± 16.2MGBG39 ± 14.7Part-III-SH Group InterferenceN-Ethyl maleimide15 ± 3.8p-Chloromercuricbenzoic acid17 ± 9.7Dithiothreitol + N-Ethyl maleimide69 ± 14Dithiothreitol + p-Chloro Mercuric Benzoate91 ± 28Part-IVMetabolic inhibitorDinitrophenol18 ± 8.9Potassium Cyanide22 ± 7.2Sodium Arsenate37 ± 14Iodoacetic Acid42 ± 16Erythrocytes were incubated in the presence of effector compound for 10 min at 37°C and then pulsed with 0.5 μCi labelled putrescine (final concentration 100 μM) and incubated further for 30 min before terminating the reaction.

Values given are mean ± S.D. of 3–5 independent experiments in duplicate. Putrescine influx inhibition by BCBD was carried out by Michaelis-Menten approach. Data obtained from influx inhibition curve were computed in the Lineweaver-Burk plot using SigmaPlot 5.0, and parameters obtained using axis to axis regression analysis wereKi 43.2 μm with mixed competitive inhibitory pattern (Fig. 4). Effect of BCBD of in vitro growth of P. knowlesiwas carried out by means [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation, and thereafter, concentration response data were fitted to generalized sigmoid function using nonlinear regression (31Webster H.K. Bouderean E.F. Pavanand K. Yongranitchil K. Paul L.W. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1985; 34: 228-235Google Scholar). Chloroquine as a reference gave IC50 of 10.3 ± 0.45 ng/ml (Fig.5 A), and BCBD yielded IC50 value of 7.64 ± 0.97 ng/ml (Fig. 5 B). Effect of BCBD in combination with different polyamines during short term culture of P. knowlesi were determined using [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assay (Fig.6). Putrescine did not affect the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation, while spermidine partially inhibited the process. Spermine inhibited [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation by 67% compared with corresponding control. Therefore, high concentration of spermine seems to be toxic to the parasite. BCBD inhibited the nucleic acid synthesis up to 58% at 25 μm concentration. Coincubation of putrescine or spermidine failed to reverse the effect of BCBD. However, cytotoxic effect of spermine against P. knowlesi culture in combination with BCBD produced an additive effect on nucleic acid synthesis of the parasite. The in vivo effect of BCBD against infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain of P. yoelii nigeriensis in Swiss albino mice was studied at two dose levels (Group 1, vehicle control; Group 2, 12 mg/kg body wt, twice daily, 0–3 day; and Group 3, 24 mg/kg body wt, twice daily, 0–3 day) (Table III). The results on day 4 showed that no parasitemia appeared in any of the BCBD-treated groups; whereas in vehicle control, all mice developed patent infection and average parasitemia was 9.55 ± 3.68%. All group 2 mice were negative till day 7 but subsequently developed patent infection while group 3 mice did not develop any patent infection up to observed period of day 28. Therefore, 96 mg/kg total dose treatment (group 2) suppresses the development of the parasitemia in P. yoelii-infected mice, and mean survival time was increased while 192 mg/kg total dose treatment of BCBD was found curative. LD50 value of BCBD determined after intraperitoneal administration in Swiss mice was 430 mg/kg body wt (confidence limit 265–698 mg/kg body wt).Table IIIEffect of BCBD on Plasmodium yoelii infection in miceDose mg/Kg body wt3-aThe dose was given twice daily × 4 days (0–3 day).RouteNo. of miceday 4 parasitemiaNo. of mice did not develop patent infection till day7142128Group-IVehicle Controli.p.109.55 ± 3.680 /10Group-II12 mgi.p.16nil16 /165 /160 /16Group-III24 mgi.p.8nil8 /88 /88 /88 /8i.p.6nil6 /66 /66 /66 /63-a The dose was given twice daily × 4 days (0–3 day). Open table in a new tab Polyamines are known to play an important role in cell proliferation. We have, therefore, investigated how each specific polyamine is involved with stage-dependent growth and multiplication of malarial parasite during intraerythrocytic schizogony and the polyamine based regulatory mechanism of the intra-erythrocytic parasite proliferation. Analysis of elevated polyamine levels in terms of spermidine/spermine (SPD/SPM) ratio, which is indicative of cell proliferation (32Seghieri G. Gironi A. Mammini P. Giorgio D. Bartolomeri G. Fgnesti G. Franconi F. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 543-545Google Scholar), revealed that this ratio in normal erythrocytes was 2.24. However, after invasion of malarial parasite, increase in the polyamine profile was observed, and this ratio reached to 4.76 in ring-infected erythrocytes. A threshold level of SPD/SPM (6.17) was attained in trophozoite-infected erythrocytes. It is not surprising that it is maximal at trophozite stage because major molecular synthesis occurs during this stage (33Geary T.G. Divo A.A. Jensen J.B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 577-583Google Scholar) and resembles the late G1 phase in eukaryotic cell cycle. Though maximum level of polyamines were found in schizont-infected erythrocytes, there was decrease in the SPD/SPM (3.03) due to a specifically higher increase in spermine profile as compared with spermidine. Studies carried out with malarial parasite α-DNA polymerase and polyamines showed that in vitroaddition of polyamines (1 mm putrescine, 1.5–2.0 mm spermidine, and 0.1–0.3 mm spermine) in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 increases the P. falciparum α-like DNA polymerase activity many-fold. But in contrast to these observations, higher concentrations of spermine (0.5–1.0 mm) inhibit the enzyme activity (more than 90%) (10Bacharach U. Abu-Elheiga L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 633-637Google Scholar). Therefore, terminal lowering of SPD/SPM in schizont-infected erythrocytes may lead to arrest of DNA synthesis at the end of theP. knowlesi growth cycle and corresponds with the completion of multiplication phase during I-ES of P. knowlesi. This is further supported by our findings that at ring stage of the P. knowlesi culture, addition of spermine to the culture medium arrest the nucleic acid synthesis ([3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assay) while the same concentrations of putrescine and spermidine do not interfere with the process (Fig. 6). Therefore, it can be concluded that during I-ES of malarial parasite, elevated concentrations of spermidine and spermine act as positive and negative regulator, respectively. Further, putrescine that acts as a precursor for spermidine and spermine is not detected in normal erythrocytes while it appears in ring-infected erythrocytes also as its biosynthetic enzyme, i.e. ODC. Inhibition of ODC by DFMO arrest the culture growth at the trophozoite stage (8Whaun J.M. Brown N.D. J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 1985; 233: 507-511Google Scholar). This indicates the importance of putrescine for proliferation of the malarial parasite. Characterization of malarial parasite-induced putrescine transport system in trophozoite-infected erythrocytes explains the biochemical mechanism by which addition of exogenous putrescine reverses the α-DFMO inhibition of P. falciparum (7Assaraf Y.G. Golenser J. Spira D.T. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 815-819Google Scholar, 8Whaun J.M. Brown N.D. J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 1985; 233: 507-511Google Scholar, 9Assaraf Y.G. Abu-Elheiga L. Spira D.T. Hesser H. Bachrach U. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 221-226Google Scholar) and in vivo refractoriness of blood stage malarial parasite infection to α-DFMO (13Bitonti A.J. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 237-243Google Scholar). In recent years, considerable interest has been generated in elucidating the structure, mechanism, and regulation of the polyamine transport system due to its major role in the homeostasis of intraceullar pool (16Seiler N. Dekros J.G. Moulinox J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1996; 28: 843-861Google Scholar, 17Seiler N. Dezeure F. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 211-218Google Scholar). No molecular characterization of polyamine transport beyond influx kinetics and competition studies has yet been reported, and the exact mechanism of transport as well as variety of transport systems involved is still debated (34Pegg A.E. Poulin R. Coward J.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 22: 425-442Google Scholar). We found that enhancement in the rate of putrescine influx in infected erythrocytes was due to a marked increase in the correspondingVmax value rather than to a significant decrease in the affinity constant. These results seems to indicate that increased requirement of polyamines for rapid growth and multiplication of intraerythrocytic malarial parasite give rise to a compensatory mechanism producing a remarkable induction of putrescine transporter synthesis. In most mammalian cell types examined for polyamine transport, it has been shown that induced polyamine transport is marked by increase in the influx rate without affecting the affinities of the substrate to the transporter (35Allhonen-Hongisto L. Seppanen P. Janne J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 941-945Google Scholar, 36Kakinuma Y. Hoshimo K. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 140: 409-414Google Scholar, 37Martin R.L. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 52-59Google Scholar, 38Gongalez N.S. Ceriani C. Algranati I.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 120-128Google Scholar). Energy dependence, involvement of −SH group, and noninterference by amino acid, spermidine, and spermine in the putrescine influx process clearly demonstrate the presence of a distinct transporter for putrescine in malarial parasite-infected erythrocytes. The presence of a malarial parasite-induced specific transport system for putrescine in the infected erythrocytes suggests that required putrescine for growth and multiplication of the parasite can be obtained from the external milieu, and failure of biosynthetic inhibitors in such organisms is not surprising. Therefore, blockage of polyamine transport or replacement of natural polyamines by their analogues may constitute an effective strategy for the development of chemotherapeutic molecules (39Morton L.J. Pegg A.E. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Google Scholar). For the development of new chemotherapeutic molecules, we have used three different approaches. First, diamine [H2N(CH2)xNH2] and structural homologs of spermidine [H2N(CH2)xNH(CH2)yNH2] antagonize putrescine and spermidine influx in mammalian cells, and available evidence suggests that a minimum of four methylene groups (x or x + y = 4) or their equivalent are necessary for efficient interaction with the polyamine transport system (40Gordonsmith R.H. Brooke-Taylor S. Smith L. Cohen G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 3701-3709Google Scholar, 41Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Adv. Enzyme Reg. 1988; 27: 57-82Google Scholar, 42Porter C.W. Cavanaugh P.F. Stolowich N. Ganis B. Kelley E. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2050-2057Google Scholar, 43Minchin R.F. Martin R.L. Summers L.A. Ilett K.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 391-395Google Scholar). Second, conjugates of transporter substrate and other drugs have been used as a means of enhancing the intracellular access of the conjugated drug. This approach has been applied to the polyamine transporter, polyamine-nitroimidazole conjugate, and polyamine-chlorambucil conjugate and has been shown to augment drug accumulation in Erlich-ascites tumors cells with a resulting enhancement of cytotoxicity (44Holley J. Mather A. Cullis P.M. Symons M.R. Wardman P. Watt R.A. Cohen G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 763-769Google Scholar, 45Holley J. Mather A. Wheelhouse R.T. Cullis P.M. Hartley J.A. Bingham J.P. Cohen G.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4190-4195Google Scholar). Finally, we have found that chloroquine shares the parasite-induced putrescine transport system in P. knowlesi-infected erythrocytes (46Singh S. Studies on Polyamine Metabolism of Malarial Parasite and Their Host with Reference to Antimalarial Chemotherapy. Ph. D. Thesis, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, India1994Google Scholar). We have succeeded in designing and synthesizing BCBD using the combined knowledge of all the three approaches mentioned above. Putrescine influx in P. knowlesi-infected erythrocytes was inhibited by BCBD in a dose-dependent manner, and the cytocidal concentration of growth of intraerythrocytic parasite (IC50 value of 7.64 ± 0.94 ng/ml) was found to be many-fold lower than other known polyamine analogues or biosynthetic inhibitors (47Wright P.S. Byers T.L. Cross Devorsen D.E. McCann P.P. Bitonti A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1713-1718Google Scholar, 48Bitonti A.J. Dumont J.R. Busch T.L. Edwards M.L. Stemerick D.M. McCann P.P.

Chem. 1991; 34: 569-574Google Scholar). The novelty of this approach is that inhibitory effect of BCBD on the parasite growth and multiplication in the culture medium is cytocidal as addition of exogenous polyamines fails to reverse the effect of BCBD. The lack of reversal would be expected if the BCBD blocks the intracellular binding of the polyamines or displaces intracellular polyamines from their binding sites (39Morton L.J. Pegg A.E. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Google Scholar, 50Calonge M. Johnson R. Balance-Fouce R. Ordonez D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 52: 835-841Google Scholar). It is of interest to compare the antimalarial properties ofN,N −-bis[3-[(phenylmethyl) amino]propyl]-1,7-diaminoheptane (MDL 27695, Merrell Dow Research Inst., OH), the most potent molecular of bis (benzyl) polyamine analogues series designed to interfere with polyamine biosynthesis and function with in vivo antimalarial activity of BCBD (48Bitonti A.J. Dumont J.R. Busch T.L. Edwards M.L. Stemerick D.M. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 651-655Google Scholar). MDL 27695 cures the Plasmodium berghei infection in vivo with a total dose of 150 mg in combination with DFMO (2% solution in drinking water), though the parasite appears on day-4, while BCBD cures the lethal multidrug-resistant strain of P. yoelii infection at the dose of 192 mg alone, and no patent infection appears in mice infected with the malarial parasite. Further LD50 doses of BCBD for mice ranges ∼430 mg/kg body wt; one can assume that therapeutic index in the P. yoeliiinfected is higher than 10, revealing the high efficiency of BCBDin vivo against the P. yoelii. The exact site of interaction of BCBD with putrescine transporter/other vulnerable biomolecules in the malarial parasite remains unknown. However, our results support the initial premise that inhibition of putrescine influx in malaria-infected erythrocytes by BCBD constitutes an effective strategy in the search for a new class of molecules against resistant strain of malarial parasite.

RNA degradation in eukaryotes, as in bacteria, appears to be a regulated process that involves multiple enzymatic steps (for reviews, see Refs. 3Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Google Scholar, 4Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Google Scholar, 5Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Google Scholar). Although a variety of ribonucleases have been identified in eukaryotes, with few exceptions little or no information is available about the specific biological role of these enzymes or the genes that encode them (for reviews, see Refs. 6Brawerman G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 149-159Google Scholar, 7Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Google Scholar, 8Deutscher M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 136-139Google Scholar). This is especially true of nucleases that degrade the mRNA of mammalian cells. The Escherichia coli rne gene encodes an essential endoribonuclease, RNase E, which has a key role in the decay and processing of 9 S ribosomal RNA, RNA I, an antisense regulator of replication of ColE1-type plasmids, and a variety of messenger RNAs (for reviews, see Refs. 9Ehretsmann C. Carpousis A.J. Krisch H.M. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3186-3192Google Scholar, 10Melefors O. Lundberg U. von Gabain A. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 11Cohen S.N. McDowall K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1099-1106Google Scholar). A human cDNA sequence designated asARD-1 (activator of RNAdecay) was identified recently by its ability to reverse the pleiotropic effects of temperature-sensitive (ts) and deletion mutations in rne (1Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Google Scholar). Expression ofARD-1 cDNA in E. coli results in RNase E-like cleavages in vivo in rne ts cells shifted to a nonpermissive temperature, and extracts isolated from cells mutated in rne but expressing ARD-1 cDNA cleave 9 S RNA in vitro at locations attacked by RNase E (1Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggested that ARD-1 may encode an endoribonuclease activity similar to that of RNase E. Moreover, the 13.3-kDa ARD-1 protein sequence deduced from analysis of the cDNA has multiple structural features in common with the 118-kDa Rne protein, including similarity to domains of eukaryotic proteins implicated in endocytosis, macromolecular transport, and RNA binding (12Casaregola S. Jacq A. Laoudj D. McGurk G. Margarson S. Tempete M. Norris V. Holland I.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 30-40Google Scholar, 13Claverie-Martin F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Yancey S.D. Kushner S.R. J. Biol.

Recently, a peptide sequence almost identical to the protein encoded by human ARD-1 cDNA was found at the carboxyl terminus of bovine NIPP-1 (38.5 kDa), a nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (2Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollens M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Google Scholar). 1P. Cohen, personal communication. Comparison of the cloned cDNA sequences of ARD-1 and NIPP-1 showed that the 5′-untranslated region of ARD-1 contains a 470-bp 2The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; nt, nucleotide(s). segment that is not present inNIPP-1 cDNA and that ARD-1 cDNA lacks a 220 bp segment of the coding region of NIPP-1 (2Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollens M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Google Scholar); these observations have led to the proposal by Van Eynde et al.(2Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollens M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Google Scholar) that ARD-1 and NIPP-1 mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing. Using ARD-1 protein overexpressed in E. coli and highly purified by affinity-column chromatography, we show here that ARD-1 is a single-strand-specific Mg2+-dependent endoribonuclease that binds to RNase E substrates, cleaves short oligoribonucleotides and complex substrates in A+U-rich regions at the sites cut by RNase E, and generates 5′-phosphate termini. Thus, the amino acid residues comprising the ARD-1 sequence appear to function both as a domain of the protein phosphatase inhibitor NIPP-1 and a human analog of E. coli ribonuclease E. For expression of the histidine-tagged ARD-1 protein in E. coli, two oligonucleotides, 5′ACGTGACTCATATGGTGCAAACTGCAGTGGTC-3′ (primer 1) and 5′-TCACGTCTGGATCCTCAAATCAGCAAGGAAGGTG-3′ (primer 2), corresponding to the 5′-end and 3′-end of ARD-1cDNA sequence, respectively, were synthesized for PCR amplification of the ARD-1 cDNA sequence. An NdeI site and a BamHI site were added to the 5′ ends of primers 1 and 2, respectively. The PCR product, after digestion with NdeI andBamHI, was ligated to the NdeI- andBamHI-cleaved pET16 expression vector (Novagen, WI), which contains a polyhistidine region and Factor Xa protease-cleavable region, and introduced into the protease-deficient λDE3 lysogenic strain BL21, which expresses T7 RNA polymerase under control of an IPTG (isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside)-induciblelacUV5 promoter (15Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar, 16Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Google Scholar). E. coli cells containing the expression plasmid or its derivatives were grown at 35 °C in LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin toA600 = 0.6–0.8, except where indicated. Expression of the ARD-1 protein was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm. Extracts of cells allowed to grow for 2 h at 30 °C following induction of ARD-1 expression by IPTG were analyzed by lysing the cells directly in the loading buffer for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described by Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For purification of ARD-1 by affinity column chromatography, cells were harvested and sonicated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm imidazole. Sonications were repeated for 20-s intervals, with 30-s rest periods at 0 °C until the solution was no longer viscous. For some preparations, 6 m guanidine HCl was added. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min to remove debris. The lysate was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter before applying to a column. The histidine-tagged fusion protein was purified by binding to divalent cations (Ni2+) immobilized on His-Bind (Novagen) metal chelation resin at 0 °C. The column was washed at 0 °C in 0.5 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 60 mm, and then 100 mm, imidazole. The protein was eluted in buffer containing 400 mm imidazole at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Buffers used for purification under protein-denaturing conditions contained 6 m guanidine HCl and 20 mm imidazole in the washing buffer. The eluted fraction was concentrated by centrifugation using a Centricon-10 (Amicon) concentrator and dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C against three changes of storage buffer (18McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 274: 287-290Google Scholar) at 4 °C. Further protein purification on a denaturing preparative gel and electro-elution was as described previously (19Cormack R.S. Genereaux J.L. Mackie G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9006-9010Google Scholar). Alternatively, ARD-1 protein was also purified under nondenaturing conditions using a imidazole gradient to elute the protein from the affinity column. Proteolytic cleavage of the ARD-1 fusion proteins was carried out using a ratio of Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) to fusion protein of 1 to 100 (w/w) in a storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Incubations were carried out for 2–4 h at room temperature or overnight at 16 °C. 32P-Labeled 9 S RNA and GGG·RNA I were synthesized in vitro from plasmids pTH90 (20Sohlberg B. Lundberg U. Hartl F.U. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 277-281Google Scholar) and pM21 (21Helmer-Citterich M. Anceschi M.M. Banner D.W. Cesareni G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 557-566Google Scholar), respectively, using the T7 MEGAshortscript™ in vitrotranscription kit (Ambion, Inc.) in the presence of [α-32P]GTP (DuPont NEN) as recommended by the vendor. The oligoribonucleotides BR10 and BR13, containing sequences present at the 5′ end of RNA I and GGG·RNA I, respectively (18McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 274: 287-290Google Scholar), were labeled by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies Inc.) (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. All radioactively labeled RNA substrates were purified on urea-polyacrylamide gels (6% for 9 S RNA and GGG·RNA I, and 20% for oligonucleotides) and extracted with phenol-chloroform prior to use. 32P-Labeled 9 S RNA, GGG·RNA I, and oligoribonucleotides BR10 and BR13 were synthesized as described above. Endoribonuclease activity was assayed in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 units/ml RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, and 10,000–30,000 cpm of the32P-labeled RNA substrate. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and then extracted with phenol/chloroform. After adding 20 μl of formamide sequencing loading buffer and heating for 3 min at 85 °C, samples were loaded in 6% or 20% sequencing gels. Gels were dried and then examined by autoradiography. The purified NH2-terminal half of RNase E, which contains the catalytic domain (22McDowall K.J. Cohen S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 349-355Google Scholar), was provided by K. J. McDowall (Stanford University). Placental RNase A, mung bean nuclease, and placental RNase inhibitor (RNAsin™) were purchased from Ambion, Sigma, and Promega, respectively. Proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose filter membranes as described by Dunn (23Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Google Scholar). Filters were then prehybridized in buffer containing yeast total tRNA or E. coli total RNA at 250 μg/ml before being probed with radioactively labeled 9 S RNA or GGG·RNA I as described by Cormack et al. (19Cormack R.S. Genereaux J.L. Mackie G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9006-9010Google Scholar). Purified ARD-1 protein (concentrations indicated in figure legends) was incubated in 20-μl reactions with ∼30,000 cpm of 32P-radiolabeled 9 S RNA in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 240 μg/ml tRNA, 3 units/ml placental ribonuclease inhibitor, and 240 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature. Reaction mixtures for RNase E binding studies were carried out under the same conditions except that the buffer contained 40 mm EDTA. The mixtures were then adjusted to 3% Ficoll (400) and loaded on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with a cross-linking ratio of 37.5:1 in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm glycine buffer. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C at 240 V for 3 h. The gels were dried and then exposed to x-ray film (DuPont) with an intensifier screen at −70 °C. For RNA competition, radiolabeled RNA was first mixed with varying amounts of unlabeled RNA competitor and then subjected to the gel mobility shift assay as described above. Total RNA and mRNA from B cells were purified using the RNA STAT-60™ reagent (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX), and the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega), respectively. Synthesis of unlabeled 9 S RNA was carried out as described for the 32P-labeled 9 S RNA, but in the absence of radionucleotide. Poly(A) oligoribonucleotides and yeast tRNA were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden) and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. Unlabeled GGG·RNA I was synthesized and purified as described for 32P-labeled GGG·RNA I but in the absence of [α-32P]GTP. GGG·RNA I (1 μg) was incubated at 30 °C with ARD-1 (2.5 μg), full-length RNase E (0.5 μg), or RNase A (2 pg) in 50-μl reactions for 3 h, 10 min, and 15 min, respectively. The ARD-1 and RNase A reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2. The RNase E reaction contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The ARD-1 and RNase E reactions contained 100 units of ribonuclease inhibitor. After incubation, samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and split into two aliquots. One aliquot from each sample was treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) to dephosphorylate the 5′ termini, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. Then all samples were incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O and passed through a MicroSpin S-200 HR column (Pharmacia) to remove unincorporated radionucleotides. Samples (5 μl) were mixed with formamide sequencing loading buffer (5 μl), heated for 3 min at 85 °C, and loaded in 6% sequencing gels. A PCR-amplified cDNA segment containing the full-length ARD-1 translational open reading frame was introduced into plasmid pET16b (Fig.1) and expressed from the bacteriophage T7 promoter inE. coli as a His/ARD-1 fusion protein. Total protein extracted from cells containing the fusion construct contained a 19-kDa band that increased approximately 20-fold in relative concentration 2 h after IPTG induction of T7 RNA polymerase. This protein species, which migrated more slowly than was predicted for a protein formed by joining of the 13.3-kDa ARD-1 peptide to the polyhistidine tag and Factor Xa-cleavable region, was purified by Ni2+-column chromatograply as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified His/ARD-1 fusion protein migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained by silver nitrate as a single 19-kDa band (Fig.2); treatment of this protein by Factor Xa generated a product migrating at 17 kDa, which was slower than expected from the calculated molecular mass of the 13.3-kDa protein encoded by the ARD-1 open reading frame. The observed retarded migration in gels of ARD-1, which has a pI of 10.43 and contains highly charged regions at both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal ends (pI = 10.43) (1Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Google Scholar), parallels the anomalous migration properties of Rne, which is a highly charged 118-kDa protein that migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gels at the 180-kDa position (12Casaregola S. Jacq A. Laoudj D. McGurk G. Margarson S. Tempete M. Norris V. Holland I.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 30-40Google Scholar, 24Casaregola S. Jacq A. Laoudj D. McGurk G. Margarson S. Tempete M. Norris V. Holland I.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 867Google Scholar). Both Northwestern and gel mobility shift assays showed that ARD-1 is an RNA-binding protein. In initial Northwestern blots using crude extracts from E. coli overexpressing the His/ARD-1 fusion (data not shown), a 19-kDa protein band was observed to bind to the RNase E substrates 9 S RNA, GGG·RNA I, and the BR13 oligonucleotide. Fig. 3(lanes 1 and 4) shows binding of the affinity-purified His/ARD-1 fusion protein to 9 S RNA and RNA I.E. coli extracts of cells expressing RNase E but lackingARD-1 cDNA contained bands that in Northwestern blots were observed to bind to these same RNAs (Fig. 3, lanes 3and 6), as has been reported previously (19Cormack R.S. Genereaux J.L. Mackie G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9006-9010Google Scholar, 25Taraseviciene L. Bjork G.R. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26391-26398Google Scholar, 22McDowall K.J. Cohen S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 349-355Google Scholar, 26Kaberdin V.R. Chao Y.-H. Lin-Chao S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13103-13109Google Scholar); however, these extracts did not show a 19-kDa RNA-binding protein species. Gel mobility shift assays showed that ARD-1 fusion protein purified under nondenaturing conditions and incubated with radioactively labeled 9 S ribosomal RNA retarded migration of the target in native polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4,top); unlabeled 9 S RNA (lanes 3 and4), total B cell RNA (lanes 5 and 6), which consists largely of ribosomal RNA, and poly(A) mRNA isolated from B cells (lanes 10 and 11) efficiently competed with the 32P-labeled 9 S RNA probe for binding to ARD-1. While the presence of unlabeled polyadenylic acid (poly(A)) in 10-fold excess (lanes 7 and 8) or tRNA in 50-fold excess (lane 9) did not prevent binding of ARD-1 to 9 S RNA, both of these RNAs reduced 9 S-specific binding of ARD-1 when added in still greater excess. As shown in Fig. 4 A(bottom), the RNA-binding specificity of ARD-1 was identical to that seen for RNase E.Figure 4Gel shift assays showing binding of ARD-1 (top) and RNase E (bottom) to E. coli 9 S RNA. Radiolabeled 9 S RNA probe (30,000 cpm, 75 ng) was incubated in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lanes 2–11) of purified ARD-1 fusion protein (300 ng) or RNase E (50 ng) plus individual unlabeled competitor RNAs (lanes 3–11) at the excess amounts indicated below each lane. Samples were electrophoresed in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The arrows indicate the position of the RNA-protein complexes; the unexpectedly large shift in migration of 9 S rRNA produced by the 13.3-kDa ARD-1 protein may indicate binding to multiple sites on this substrate and/or binding of ARD-1 in a multimeric form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ARD-1 protein purified under nondenaturing conditions by affinity chromatography and shown to migrate as a single band in silver nitrate-stained gels (see above) was assayed for endoribonuclease activity on 9 S RNA, GGG·RNA I, and the BR13 and BR10 oligoribonucleotides, all of which are cleaved by purified RNase E at highly specific sites (18McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 274: 287-290Google Scholar, 19Cormack R.S. Genereaux J.L. Mackie G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9006-9010Google Scholar, 22McDowall K.J. Cohen S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 349-355Google Scholar, 27Carpousis A.J. Van Houwe G. Ehretsmann C. Krisch H.M.

Control reactions that show the cleavages produced by RNase A, a common eukaryotic single-strand-specific endoribonuclease, were included for comparison; these controls demonstrated that the cleavage patterns of ARD-1 and RNase A are different, and also indicated the absence of RNase A activity in our purified ARD-1 preparations. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the affinity-purified His/ARD-1 fusion protein produced the same cleavages in 9 S RNA as RNase E, although cleavage at the “a” site (30Ghora B.K. Apirion D. Cell. 1978; 15: 1055-1066Google Scholar, 31Cormack R.S. Mackie G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1078-1090Google Scholar) was relatively more prominent for ARD-1; an identical cleavage pattern was observed for the discrete ARD-1 peptide generated by Factor Xa treatment of the fusion protein (results not shown). GGG·RNA I was cleaved by ARD-1 at a site located 8 nt from the 5′ end, leaving a product of 103 nt (Fig.5 B), as has been observed for RNase E (18McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 274: 287-290Google Scholar, 26Kaberdin V.R. Chao Y.-H. Lin-Chao S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13103-13109Google Scholar, 32Lin-Chao S. Wong T.-T. McDowall K.J. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10797-10803Google Scholar). While the major product resulting from RNase A digestion of GGG·RNA I was also a 103-nt species, RNase A additionally cleaved this substrate at other sites (Fig. 5 B). Analysis of ARD-1 and RNase E cleavages of two synthetic oligoribonucleotides, BR10 and BR13, containing the same sequence as the 5′ single-strand region of RNA I and GGG·RNA I, respectively (18McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 274: 287-290Google Scholar) provided further evidence of the identical cleavage specificity of the two enzymes. McDowall et al. (18McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 274: 287-290Google Scholar) have shown that BR10 and BR13 are each cleaved by RNase E at the intranucleotide bonds cleaved in RNA I; as seen in Fig. 5 (C and D, lane 6 of both), purified ARD-1 cleaved these oligoribonucleotides at the same sites as E. coli RNase E. However, differences in relative amounts of the products generated by the two enzymes, as indicated by the intensity of gel bands corresponding to individual RNA species, were observed. Cleavage of BR10 by ARD-1 occurred approximately equally at phosphodiester bonds located 5 and 6 nt from the 5′ end, whereas this oligonucleotide was cleaved by RNase E predominantly at a site 5 nt from the 5′ end (Fig. 5 C; see also Ref. 18McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 274: 287-290Google Scholar). RNase A cleaved oligonucleotides BR10 and BR13 at different locations than either ARD-1 or RNase E (Fig. 5, C and D). Additionally, RNase A generated 5′-OH termini that could be phosphorylated without further treatment using radioactively labeled ATP (Fig. 6, lane 7), as has been shown previously (33Davidson J.N. The Biochemistry of the Nucleic Acids.7th Ed. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar, 49Stryler L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1995: 216-218Google Scholar); in contrast, both RNase E (cf. Refs. 29Tomcsanyi T. Apirion D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 713-720Google Scholarand 34Roy M.K. Singh B. Ray B.K. Apirion D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 119-127Google Scholar) and ARD-1 generate 5′-phosphate termini that cannot be phosphorylated in vitro unless treated with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 5). Cleavages by ARD-1 and RNase E did not occur in reaction mixtures that contain 0.01m EDTA and lack Mg2+, whereas cleavages by RNase A do not require divalent cations (35Blackburn P. Moore S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 317-433Google Scholar). The human gene ARD-1 was identified by the ability ofARD-1 cDNA to rescue temperature-sensitive and deletion mutants of the E. coli rne gene (1Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Google Scholar), which is essential for bacterial viability as well as for RNA decay and processing (36Apirion D. Lassar A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1738-1742Google Scholar, 37Kuwano M. Ono M. Endo H. Hori K. Nakamura K. Hirota Y. Ohnishi Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 279-285Google Scholar).rne-defective mutants expressing ARD-1 can carry out RNase E-like cleavages in vivo, and extracts of cells that express ARD-1 but are deleted for therne gene segment encoding the catalytic domain of RNase E (22McDowall K.J. Cohen S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 349-355Google Scholar), were observed to cleave 9 S RNA in vitro (1Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Google Scholar). Like Rne, ARD-1 was inferred by DNA sequence analysis to be a highly proline-rich peptide that has similarity to segments of the small ribonucleoprotein RNA-binding proteins (38Query C.C. Bentley R.C. Keene J.D.

Analogous features of the 13.3-kDa ARD-1 and 118-kDa Rne proteins are further evident from our demonstration that ARD-1 has the same RNA binding properties as RNase E. However, antibodies raised against RNase E did not cross-react with ARD-1 (data not shown), consistent with the observation that these two proteins do not show regions of amino acid sequence homology (1Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Google Scholar,12Casaregola S. Jacq A. Laoudj D. McGurk G. Margarson S. Tempete M. Norris V. Holland I.B. J. Mol.

The studies reported here show that highly purified ARD-1 protein is an endoribonuclease that, like RNase E (19Cormack R.S. Genereaux J.L. Mackie G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9006-9010Google Scholar, 28Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 557-568Google Scholar, 41McDowall K.J. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10790-10796Google Scholar), cleaves single-strand RNA segments in A+U-rich regions. ARD-1 cleavage of native substrates and synthetic oligonucleotides containing RNase E cleavage sites occurs at the same phosphodiester bonds cleaved by E. coli RNase E. However, the relative rate of ARD-1 cleavage and RNase E cleavage differed at different sites within some substrates. These differences provide additional evidence that the activity we assayed for affinity-purified ARD-1 preparations, which had been synthesized inE. coli and were >99% pure by silver stain analysis (Fig.2), does not result from contamination by RNase E. No ARD-1 activity was detected in reaction mixtures that lack Mg2+ and contain 0.01 m EDTA, indicating that ARD-1 activity, like RNase E activity, requires divalent cations. Neither ARD-1 nor RNase E was inhibited by placental RNase inhibitor, which inhibits RNase A and its analogs (35Blackburn P. Moore S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 317-433Google Scholar). Both RNase E (18McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 274: 287-290Google Scholar, 31Cormack R.S. Mackie G.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10790-10796Google Scholar) and ARD-1 (this paper) cleave single-strand segments of RNA 3′ to both purines and pyrimidines in A+U-rich regions, whereas RNase A cuts single-stranded RNAs predominantly 3′ to pyrimidine residues (C or U nucleotides) (33Davidson J.N. The Biochemistry of the Nucleic Acids.7th Ed. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar). Cleavage of RNA I by ARD-1 generates 5′-phosphate termini on the product 3′ to the cleavage site (Fig. 6), as does cleavage of RNA I and 9 S RNA by RNase E (Refs. 29Tomcsanyi T. Apirion D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 713-720Google Scholar and 34Roy M.K. Singh B. Ray B.K. Apirion D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 119-127Google Scholar; also Fig. 6). Other endonucleases generating 5′-phosphate ends include the bacterial enzymes RNase III and RNase P (42Rosenberg M. Kramer R.A. Steitz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 777-782Google Scholar, 43Robertson H.D. Altman S. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5243-5251Google Scholar). In contrast, the mammalian ribonuclease, RNase A, and analogous endoribonucleases of E. coli that degrade substrates by cleavage at a large number of sites (i.e.RNase M, I, I*, and R) generate products that contain 5′-OH ends (33Davidson J.N. The Biochemistry of the Nucleic Acids.7th Ed. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar,44Cannistrano V.J. Kennell D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 285-293Google Scholar). During the course of these experiments, we observed that a small amount of ARD-1 was produced in the absence of IPTG treatment; presumably, this was due to incomplete repression of the T7 RNA polymerase gene that controls production of ARD-1 mRNA from the T7 promoter on the expression construct. Populations of cells containing the uninduced ARD-1 gene expressed from a high copy number plasmid lose the plasmid or show DNA rearrangements that inactivate ARD-1 production (1Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Google Scholar), suggesting that excess ARD-1 protein is detrimental to E. coli cells. Similar findings have been reported for E. coli expressing RNase E from a high copy number plasmid (13Claverie-Martin F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Yancey S.D. Kushner S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2843-2851Google Scholar). By growing cells containing the ARD-1expression construct at 30 °C, we minimized these effects, and upon addition of IPTG, routinely achieved a 20–30-fold induction ofARD-1 expression. Recent studies have shown that three regions of homology exist between the cDNA sequences of ARD-1 and NIPP-1, a nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (2Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollens M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Google Scholar). Two of these regions are located in a segment that corresponds to the 5′-untranslated region of ARD-1 mRNA, and are separated by a 470-bp fragment that is not present in mRNA encoding NIPP-1 (Fig. 7). On the other hand,NIPP-1 cDNA contains a specific 220-bp segment not found in ARD-1 cDNA. The remaining sequences of both cDNAs suggest that the ARD-1 polypeptide is identical to the COOH terminus of NIPP-1 (2Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollens M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Google Scholar). Chromosome mapping studies (45Wang, M. (1995) Isolation and Characterization of a Human Gene Encoding a Single-Strand-Specific Endoribonuclease. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.Google Scholar) have shown that the common 3′-untranslated regions of the gene(s) encoding ARD-1 and NIPP-1 are located on human chromosome 1. The sequences of the ARD-1 (1Wang M. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10591-10595Google Scholar), NIPP-1 (2Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollens M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Google Scholar), and RNase E (13Claverie-Martin F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Yancey S.D. Kushner S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2843-2851Google Scholar, 12Casaregola S. Jacq A. Laoudj D. McGurk G. Margarson S. Tempete M. Norris V. Holland I.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 30-40Google Scholar) proteins all encode regions that resemble the highly conserved 70-kDa RNA binding component of the U1 small ribonucleoprotein complex, which is involved in mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. Moreover, PP-1, which interacts with NIPP-1 and is the target of NIPP-1 inhibition, has been shown to have a role in both in the regulation of spliceosome assembly and in the splicing process itself (46Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that ARD-1, which we have now shown to be a site-specific single-strand endonuclease having the cleavage specificity of RNase E, may be implicated in mRNA splicing. Recently, a ∼65-kDa enzyme having RNase E-like cleavage specificityin vitro has been identified and partially purified from human cells (47Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Google Scholar). This enzyme and its E. coli counterpart were both shown to cleave in vitro the pentanucleotide motif (i.e. AUUUA), which has been proposed as a determinant of c-myc mRNA stability in mammalian cells. The relationship of this enzyme to ARD-1 is unknown. We thank P. Cohen for communicating unpublished data showing the ARD-1/NIPP-1 relationship, K. J. McDowall for providing the purified NH2-terminal half of RNase E, H. Huang for providing purified full-length RNase E for some experiments, S. Lin-Chao for a gift of the BR10 oligoribonucleotide, A.

Bone marrow is not present in fish, whereas hematopoietic tissues and lymphatic tissues co-exist in the lymphohematopoietic organs. In addition to the head kidney, spleen and kidney are also lymphohematopoietic organs in teleost fish (6Zapata A. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1979; 3: 55-65Google Scholar). The presence of four different types of cells (neurons, endocrine cells, immune cells, and hematopoietic cells) in the head kidney prompted us to study the secreted proteins from head kidney since these cells are all active in secretion. Interacting molecules may be secreted by one cell type in a paracrine mode to exert its effects on neighboring cells or on the extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RCM, reduced and carboxymethylated; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIG, digoxigenin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; bp, base pair(s); NA, nitroanilide; Tricine,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine. Therefore, we attempted to purify the secreted proteins from carp head kidney and eventually to understand the functions of the secreted molecules. Here, we report the purification and cloning of one secreted protein, nephrosin. Nephrosin is a zinc metalloproteinase and is present mainly in the gill, kidney, head kidney, and spleen. We have also demonstrated that secretion of nephrosin can be stimulated by high concentrations of extracellular potassium. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that nephrosin is most closely related to medaka hatching enzymes, members of the astacin family (12Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Google Scholar). However, our evidence suggests that nephrosin is probably not a hatching enzyme. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) purchased from a local fish market were held in plastic tanks (40 × 45 × 80 cm) under natural temperature and photoperiod for 1 day before experiments. Fish were decapitated between 10 and 11 a.m. The head kidney was carefully removed and placed in the normal perfusion buffer consisting of 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4. The setup of perfusion system was essentially the same as described (13Levine J.E. Ramirez V.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 466-494Google Scholar). Following a 90-min stabilization period, perfusate samples were collected for eight 10-min intervals. For the control group, tissue was perfused with the normal perfusion medium throughout the perfusion period, whereas for the experimental group, a high potassium perfusion medium (50 mm potassium, 80 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4) was administered for 20 min starting from collection interval two. Perfusate samples were then frozen at −20 °C until use for immunoblot, zymographic (see below), and lactate dehydrogenase assay (14Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 83-90Google Scholar). Carp head kidneys (20 g) were homogenized in 200 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, by a glass homogenizer. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and 0.3 m NaCl was added to the supernatant. The sample was then applied onto a Reactive Blue 72-agarose column (2.5 × 10 cm; Sigma) equilibrated with 0.3 m NaCl in the homogenization buffer and eluted stepwise by 0.3 m, 0.6m, and 1.0 m NaCl in the homogenization buffer. All three elution steps would desorb nephrosin from the column but the 0.6 m NaCl fractions contained nephrosin activity of the highest purity. The 0.6 m NaCl fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and dissolved in 25 mm imidazole/HCl buffer, pH 7.1, and applied to an FPLC Mono P HR5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Purification was achieved by a 10-min elution with 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.1, and a 40-min elution with 10% Polybuffer, pH 4.0 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at a constant flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and lyophilized. Proteolytic activities of nephrosin during each purification step were monitored with the proteolytic zymographic assay (see below). Protein concentrations were determined by a Coomassie Blue binding assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis was performed using a Tricine SDS-PAGE system as described previously (16Schägger H. von Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). The gel concentration was 7.5%, and the bisacrylamide to acrylamide ratio was 6%. For proteolytic zymographic assay, Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel was prepared as described (17Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Google Scholar, 18Haspal J. Bushell G. Ghosh P. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 288-293Google Scholar), except that the gel contained 0.1% reduced and carboxymethylated BSA (RCM-BSA). After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated for 1 h at 27 °C with 2% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 once and Tris buffer containing 0.1 mm ZnCl2 twice, each for 90 min. The gel was then stained with 0.2% Coomassie Blue R250 in 40% methanol, 7% acetic acid and destained with 30% methanol, 7% acetic acid. The effects of various inhibitors against nephrosin were examined using RCM-BSA as a substrate. The enzyme samples (0.1 μg in 10 μl) were preincubated with a particular inhibitor or buffer alone (mock) on ice for 10 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of substrate solution (30 μg of RCM-BSA in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 15 μm ZnCl2, pH 8.0). The reaction was maintained at 27 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2 × concentrated SDS sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixture was then boiled for 3 min. Four μl of the sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the amounts of residual RCM-BSA was calculated using an Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-670). For each treatment, the amounts of RCM-BSA digested (total RCM-BSA minus residual RCM-BSA) were calculated and compared with those of mock treatment. The peptides (10 μg in 40 μl) were dissolved in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 15 μm ZnCl2. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of enzyme solution (0.1 mg/ml) in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and the mixture was incubated at 27 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then lyophilized, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and separated on a reverse-phase C18 column eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Each peak was collected, lyophilized, and subjected to amino acid sequencing (model 477A; Applied Biosystems, Forest City, CA). The proteolytic activities of nephrosin was determined by using the synthetic peptides,N-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide,N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide,N-carbobenzoxy-Gly-Gly-Leu-p-nitroanilide, andN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-p-nitroanilide, respectively (19Huang C.-J. Chen C.-C. Chen H.-J. Huang F.-L. Chang G.-D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1715-1720Google Scholar), as substrates. The Mono-P fraction was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and thoroughly mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant for the first injection or Freund's incomplete adjuvant for the second and third injections. Approximately 100 μg of nephrosin was injected subcutaneously into the back of a guinea pig during each immunization, biweekly. Ten days after the third injection, the blood was collected by heart puncture and serum stored at 4 °C. Western blotting was carried out using guinea pig anti-nephrosin antiserum (1:2000 dilution) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:1000 dilution) after electrotransfer to nitrocellulose paper (0.22 μm, Sartorius). Immunoreactive bands were detected by the NiCl2 enhancement method (20Harlow, E., and Lane, D. (eds) (1988) Antibodies, pp. 471-510, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Female carp were injected twice at the base of pectoral fin with PBS homogenate of one pituitary, each 6 h apart. Ovulation occurred 12 h after the first injection (21Tsai Y.-J. Chang G.-D. Huang C.-J. Chang Y.-S. Huang F.-L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113B: 573-580Google Scholar). Ovulated eggs were collected and mixed with spontaneously spermiated milt for 5 min and then dispersed with tap water. Fertilized eggs were then allowed to develop at 25 °C with constant compressed air bubbling, and water was replaced twice a day. Embryos were harvested between 70 and 72 h after fertilization and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Hatching liquid was collected at 82 h when more than 80% of the embryos completed hatching, and then frozen at −70 °C. Standard procedures in molecular biology were used for preparation of plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA ligation, and the transformation of bacteria (22Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). A carp head kidney cDNA library prepared from poly(A)-enriched RNA by unidirectional insertion of cDNA into λ-ZAP II (23Short J.M. Fernandez J.H. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Google Scholar) was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The λ-ZAP phages were plated at a density of 5 × 104 plaques/agar plate (150 mm, inner diameter). A total of 60 plates was screened. After incubation for 3 h at 42 °C, the plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters (pore size, 0.45 μm; Micron Separations, Westboro, MA) that had been impregnated with 10 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Incubation was continued overnight at 37 °C. The filters were then removed, washed with PBS at room temperature, and blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Following blocking, filters were probed with a polyclonal antiserum specific for carp nephrosin at a 1:500 dilution in PBS containing 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 16 h. The filters were then washed three times at room temperature in PBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the immune complexes were incubated in PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml diaminobenzamidine and revealed by adding H2O2(10 μl in 10 ml of PBS). Phages displaying stronger signals were isolated for secondary screening. One positive clone was isolated after screening 3 × 106 plaques, and pBluescript plasmids containing cDNA inserts were obtained by in vivoexcision according to the protocols provided by Stratagene. Plasmids carrying cDNA inserts were sequenced in both directions using the T7 Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and the dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). A search for related sequences in GenBank™, EMBL, SWISS-PROT, and Protein Identification Resource was carried out with an IFIND program using the FASTA algorithm of Pearson and Lipman (25Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences with known members of the astacin family was accomplished with the Clustal W multiple alignment program (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from carp blood cells, brain, gill, heart, head kidney, intestine, kidney, liver, ovary, spleen, and late embryos with the RNAzol B kit (Biotecx, Houston, TX). Twenty μg of total RNA from each tissue was fractionated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel in MOPS buffer and transferred onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.). Following prehybridization for 1 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1%N-laurylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS at 50 °C for 1 h, blots were hybridized with a polymerase chain reaction-generated digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cDNA probe for 20 h under identical conditions. Blots were washed twice for 5 min with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice for 15 min at 68 °C with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Detection of DIG signals was accomplished using the DIG luminescent detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The cDNA probe used for Northern blotting was synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction DIG probe synthesis kit (Boehringer Mannheim) with two primers derived from nephrosin sequence; F1, CGGAGCCGTCCTGTTGAGGA (nucleotides 75–94) and R1, CCCCGTAAAGGAGTTTAGGCC (nucleotides 378–397). During the perfusion of carp head kidney, the spontaneous release of proteins or leakage of proteins due to handling damage of the tissue tended to decrease with time (data not shown). However, in response to a 50 mm potassium stimulation, higher amounts of protein were released by the carp head kidney (Fig. 1). The amounts of protein of 15, 23 (p23), 28, 64, and 70 kDa in the perfusate samples following the potassium treatment were elevated for 20–30 min and then returned to a lower level. Using a zymographic assay, we found that a proteinase activity was associated with the electrophoretic mobility of p23. Therefore, we attempted to purify this secreted proteinase from carp head kidney. By sequential chromatography on a Reactive Blue 72-agarose (Fig.2 A) and a FPLC-Mono P column (Fig.2 B), we purified the 23-kDa proteinase to near homogeneity (Fig. 2 C and Table I). N-terminal protein sequencing of this protein revealed a single sequence: NADPXTARRXKWRKSRNGLV-. The low recovery of nephrosin by the purification procedures was because we collected the fraction with the highest purity (0.6 m NaCl) only. However, by this purification scheme, the whole procedure can be accomplished within 10 days.Figure 2A and B, elution profiles of nephrosin from Reactive Blue 72-agarose (A) and Mono-P columns (B). Head kidney extract (200 ml) was chromatographed on a Reactive Blue 72-agarose column. Fractions of 6 ml were collected at a flow rate of 25 ml/h. Proteins obtained from the first column (80 μg) were chromatographed on a Mono-P column equilibrated with 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.1, and eluted with 10% Polybuffer, pH 4.0. Fractions containing nephrosin were collected as indicated by bar on the figure. Crude extract (lane 1) and samples from the Reactive Blue 72-agarose column (lane 2) and from Mono-P column (lane 3) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table ISummary of purification of nephrosin from carp head kidneyStepVolumeProteinActivityaOne unit of activity is defined as the amount of nephrosin causing the same proteolytic activity as 1 unit of chymotrypsin in the RCM-BSA zymographic assay.Specific activityYieldPurificationmlmgunitsunits/mg%-foldExtractbA total of 20 g of carp head kidney was used in this preparation.2002207119.20.0541001Dye column480.3766.2816.705.27172Mono-P40.0981.7818.161.49187a One unit of activity is defined as the amount of nephrosin causing the same proteolytic activity as 1 unit of chymotrypsin in the RCM-BSA zymographic assay.b A total of 20 g of carp head kidney was used in this preparation. Open table in a new tab The proteolytic activity of nephrosin could be demonstrated using SDS-PAGE zymography with gelatin, RCM-BSA, or RCM-fibrin as a substrate(data not shown). To determine the preference of cleavage sites by nephrosin, we examined various peptide-nitroanilides and peptides. None of the peptide-nitroanilides, including tosyl-GPK-NA, succinyl-AAPF-NA, succinyl-AAPL-NA and N-carbobenzoxy-GGL-NA, were digested by nephrosin (Table II). Obviously, nephrosin did not hydrolyze the amide bond of these nitroanilides. However, nephrosin cleaved certain peptide bonds of synthetic substance P and Lys-bradykinin. When bradykinin derivatives of different length were tested for their digestion by nephrosin, it was found that there is a length requirement for being a substrate. Nephrosin did not cleave the terminal peptide bonds of bradykinin 1–5 and bradykinin 1–6. Among the digestible substrates, nephrosin cleaved at the Gln-Phe and Phe-Phe bonds of substance P and at the Gly-Phe and Phe-Ser bonds of bradykinin derivatives with a preference for phenylalanine at the P1position and proline at the P2/P3/P4 position. Therefore, nephrosin mainly functions as an endopeptidase with little exopeptidase or amidase activity.Table IIDigestion of synthetic peptide substrates by nephrosinSubstratesSequencesa↓ indicates bonds cleaved by carp nephrosin, and ⇓ indicates major cleavage site.HydrolysisTosyl-GPK-NAGPKNDbND, nondetectable in 60 min.Suc-AAPF-NAAAPFND bND, nondetectable in 60 min.Suc-AAPL-NAAAPLND bND, nondetectable in 60 min.Cbz-GGL-NAGGLND bND, nondetectable in 60 min.Substance PRPKPQQ↓F⇓FGLM-NH2CompleteLys-BradykininKRPPG↓F⇓SPFRCompleteBradykinin 1–5RPPGFND 2-bND, nondetectable in 60 min.Bradykinin 1–6RPPGFSND 2-bND, nondetectable in 60 min.Bradykinin 1–7RP↓PGFSPPartialDes-Arg-bradykininPP↓GFSPFRCompletea ↓ indicates bonds cleaved by carp nephrosin, and ⇓ indicates major cleavage site.b ND, nondetectable in 60 min. Open table in a new tab Various inhibitors were tested for their effects on nephrosin with RCM-BSA as a substrate (Table III). The chelating agents including 1,10-phenanthroline, EDTA, captopril, and diethyldithiocarbamic acid inhibited the proteolytic activity of nephrosin to a great extent, especially 1,10-phenanthroline and diethyldithiocarbamic acid. Inhibitors of other classes of proteinases were ineffective. The results indicate that nephrosin is a metalloproteinase.Table IIIEffect of proteinase inhibitors on the enzymatic activities of nephrosinInhibitorConcentrationResidual activitymm%None1001,10-Phenanthroline58.21.2519EDTA5262.535Captopril5152.561Diethyldithiocarbamate56.22.523Pepstatin20 μg/ml90PMSF5100Iodoacetate10705.567The purified enzyme was preincubated with each reagent at the indicated concentration for 10 min at 0 °C and then with RCM-BSA for 1 h at 27 °C.

Residual enzyme activities were calculated as the ratio of the amount of RCM-BSA digested in the presence of inhibitor to that in the absence of inhibitor. After screening 3 × 106 plaques with a polyclonal antiserum raised against purified nephrosin, one positive clone was isolated. The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig.3. The clone has an insert of 1086 bp including 32 bp of the 5′-untranslated region, an open reading frame of 821 bp, and 232 bp of the 3′-untranslated region. The putative initiating ATG codon, which agrees with Kozak's rule (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar), is at nucleotide 33. The open reading frame is predicted to encode a protein of 273 amino acids, including a 19-amino acid signal peptide and a 56-amino acid propeptide. The N-terminal 20 amino acid residues determined from purified nephrosin matched with the deduced amino acid sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence also confirms the presence of a propeptide sequence (see also sequence comparison data). The theoretical molecular mass of the mature protein is 23089.35 Da, which is close to the estimated molecular mass from SDS-PAGE analysis. The deduced amino acid of nephrosin shows moderate sequence identity (29–52.5%) with members of the astacin family (Fig. 4) such as medaka HCE1 (52.5%), LCE (50.7%; Ref. 28Yasumasu S. Yamada K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21035-21043Google Scholar). The N-terminal regions, including the signal peptide and propeptide sequences, are most variable. All members are likely to be secreted and further processed as evidenced by the presence of the signal and propeptide sequences. The junction for the propeptide and mature protein in nephrosin is at a similar position to that in other members. Stretches of highly conserved sequences were found, especially in the unique zinc binding motif, HEXXHALGFXHEXXRXDRD. From x-ray structural analyses of crayfish astacin (32Bode W. Gomis-Rüth R.F. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Google Scholar), zinc ion is ligated by three histidine residues, one tyrosine residue, and one water molecule H-bonded to a glutamic acid residue. Five residues involved in the penta-coordination of zinc are conserved in all members. Most members of the family have extra domains C-terminal to the proteinase domain except crayfish astacin, medaka hatching enzymes, and carp nephrosin, which consist of only ∼200 amino acid residues in the mature forms. The presence of nephrosin in different tissues was examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5) with a polyclonal antiserum against purified nephrosin and by Northern blotting (Fig. 6) with nephrosin partial cDNA as a probe. Only samples of gill, kidney, head kidney, and spleen contained an immunoreactive protein of a similar molecular mass. Because of the limited distribution of nephrosin in the kidney, head kidney, and spleen, it was named nephrosin herein until we discover the true physiological functions of this metalloproteinase. The DIG-labeled cDNA probe for nephrosin hybridized with a single 1.2-kilobase band in all samples except intestine and ovary, and with highest levels in head kidney and kidney. This size of mRNA is in good agreement with that of nephrosin clone (1086 bp). The lack of a protein signal in heart extract is unusual, since its mRNA level was similar to that of spleen.Figure 6Tissue distribution of nephrosin as revealed by Northern blotting. Total RNA (20 μg) from different tissues were fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane. The blot was hybridized with a DIG-labeled nephrosin cDNA probe and visualized with luminescent detection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Due to the highest sequence identity to medaka hatching enzymes (HCE2, HCE1, and LCE), we wish to determine whether nephrosin is a carp hatching enzyme. Soluble proteins and total RNA were prepared from 70-h embryos (a 80-h hatching procedure) and subjected to immunoblot and Northern blot analysis (Fig.7). In addition, hatching liquid was also harvested after most embryos completed hatching. Using a comparable amount of protein and RNA, both protein and mRNA signals were observed in head kidney, but not in carp embryos or hatching liquid. Therefore, the data suggest that nephrosin is unlikely to be a hatching enzyme analogue, and that carp embryos at this stage expressed very little nephrosin, if any. Release of immunoassayable nephrosin from carp head kidney fragments was measured using anin vitro perfusion system. Fig. 8 shows the effect of potassium-induced secretion of nephrosin. Nephrosin and a degraded product of nephrosin were detected by immunoblotting following a 50 mm potassium treatment (Fig. 8, upper panel). The release of nephrosin was almost instantly following induction. The identity of nephrosin in the perfusate samples was confirmed by SDS-PAGE zymography (Fig. 8, lower panel). The release of nephrosin was not due to damage of the perfused tissue since lactate dehydrogenase activities in the perfusate samples were not changed during the perfusion experiment (data not shown). The results suggest that nephrosin is secreted by excitable cells in the head kidney in response to membrane depolarization caused by the potassium treatment. Nephrosin is a new member of the astacin family of metalloproteinases based on the following observations: First, the activity of nephrosin is inhibited by metal chelators but not by inhibitors of other classes of proteinases, suggesting that it is a metalloproteinase. Second, cDNA encoding the purified protein was isolated from a carp head kidney cDNA library. One segment of the deduced amino acid sequence matches perfectly with the first 20 amino acids determined from the purified nephrosin. Bacterially expressed protein encoded by the cloned cDNA can be recognized by the same antiserum used for immunoscreening. In addition, the polyclonal antiserum raised against this recombinant protein recognized native nephrosin. 2H.-R. Huang and G.-D. Chang, unpublished results. Finally, the deduced primary structure of nephrosin resembles members of the astacin family. The most distinguished zinc-binding motif, HEXXHXXGFXHEXXRXDR, is also present in nephrosin. Astacin family members are all secreted proteinases containing a proteinase domain of approximately 200 amino acid residues (23 kDa). Most of the known members contain one or more copies of interaction domains such as EGF (epidermalgrowth factor)-like or CUB (complement/sea urchin EGF/BMP-1) that are C-terminal to the proteinase domain (12Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Google Scholar). However, the mature form of nephrosin does not contain any extra sequences C-terminal to the proteinase domain as with astacin and hatching enzymes (HCE1, HCE2, and LCE). From sequence comparisons, nephrosin is most closely related to medaka hatching enzymes with >50% identity in amino acid sequence. Hatching enzymes are expressed in late stages of embryos in anticipation of hatching and can therefore be harvested from late embryos and hatching liquid (28Yasumasu S. Yamada K. Akasaka K. Mitsunaga K. Iuchi I. Shimada H. Yamagami K. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 250-258Google Scholar, 33Yasumasu S. Katow S. Hamazaki T. Iuchi I. Yamagami K. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 349-356Google Scholar). However, we were not able to detect nephrosin in late embryos (mRNA and protein) or hatching liquid (protein). Therefore, the high degree of identity between nephrosin and medaka hatching enzymes most likely results from the fact that they are the only sequences from teleost in the astacin family, but not that nephrosin represents a carp hatching enzyme. Most members of the astacin family are involved in developmental processes. They are hatching enzymes of medaka involved in degrading the egg shell of embryos (28Yasumasu S. Yamada K. Akasaka K. Mitsunaga K. Iuchi I. Shimada H. Yamagami K. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 250-258Google Scholar, 33Yasumasu S. Katow S. Hamazaki T. Iuchi I. Yamagami K. Dev.

Few members of the astacin family are expressed in mature organisms in a tissue-specific manner. For examples, crayfish astacin is synthesized in the crayfish hepatopancreas and functions as a digestive enzyme (41Vogt G. Stöcker W. Storch V. Zwilling R. Histochemistry. 1989; 91: 373-381Google Scholar). Mammalian meprins are expressed as dimeric proteins (42Butler P.E. McKay M.J. Bond J.S. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 229-235Google Scholar, 43Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (; Correction (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17647): 13505-13512Google Scholar) in the brush border membranes of kidney and intestine (44Barnes K. Ingram J. Kenny A.J.

Along with these limited precedents, nephrosin is expressed in the gill, head kidney, kidney, and spleen of mature carp. Although nephrosin and meprins are all present in the kidney, they are not identical as suggested by differences in the primary structure and in the forms of mature protein (dimeric membrane proteinversus monomeric soluble protein). In addition, meprin exhibits an arylamidase activity toward peptide-p-nitroanilide substrates (43Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (; Correction (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17647): 13505-13512Google Scholar) that are shown to be very poor substrates for nephrosin. Our data show that nephrosin is secreted from carp head kidney and its secretion can be regulated by manipulation of the membrane potentials. The fact that nephrosin is present in the kidney, head kidney, and spleen suggests a role of nephrosin in the lymphohematopoietic system. Whether nephrosin is expressed by the immune system and/or by the hematopoietic system requires critical examinations. We are currently preparing antisera against proteins derived from both systems as cell type markers. Along with the antiserum against nephrosin, we may be in a better position to solve this problem by immunohistochemical staining procedures. We speculate that expression of nephrosin at high levels in the lymphohematopoietic tissues suggests that the proteinase may function in ECM remodeling. One most striking feature pertaining to the tissues is the frequent migration of cells out of and into these sites (46Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Google Scholar). ECM proteins provide multiple interaction domains mediating adhesion of cells and ECM (47Shimizu Y. Shaw S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2292-2299Google Scholar). Although studies on proteolytic remodeling of ECM have been focused largely on matrix metalloproteinases (48Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Google Scholar), meprin (49Kaushal G.P. Walker P.D. Shah S.V. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1319-1327Google Scholar), and HMP1 (35Yan L. Pollcok G.H. Nagase H. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 1995; 121: 1591-1602Google Scholar) of the astacin family are also effective in degrading ECM proteins. In a preliminary experiment, 3G.-D. Chang, unpublished results. we also found that nephrosin was able to degrade mammalian fibronectin, but not laminin or type IV collagen. In addition, nephrosin can degrade mammalian gelatin in a SDS-PAGE zymographic assay. We are now repeating these experiments using carp ECM as substrates. We are indebted to Dr. Chung-Ho Chang for critical comments on this manuscript."

We have previously shown that the serine-sensing ability of Tsr-T156C, which has a unique cysteine in place of threonine at residue 156, is specifically inactivated by thiol-modifying reagents and that l-serine protects the receptor from modification. In this study, we demonstrated the correlation between protective effects of various attractants and their potencies to elicit attractant responses. This indirect binding assay was used to monitor the affinity of the receptor for l-serine under various conditions. It has been demonstrated by <i>in vitro</i> assays that the ligand-binding affinities of Tsr and the related chemoreceptor Tar are unaffected by changes in the methylation state of the receptor. Using the serine protection assay, we re-examined this issue both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The methylation levels of Tsr-T156C did not affect its ligand-binding affinity. We also showed both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> that the ligand-binding affinity was unaffected by temperature. These results suggest that the structure of the periplasmic domain of the receptor is uncoupled from the signaling states of the cytoplasmic domain. This ligand-binding assay system should be applicable to other receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2047142299,"During the study on the mechanisms of abdominal leg development in the silkworm Bombyx mori, we found that a high molecular mass protein (p260/270) was expressed specifically in abdominal leg cells during early embryonic stages and disappeared by a late embryonic stage. p260/270 consists of two polypeptides with molecular masses of 260 and 270 kDa. We have established a purification procedure for p260/270 and have raised an antibody against p260/270. Immunoblot analysis of theE Ca/E Ca (additional crescent) and E N/E N (new additional crescent) mutants, which lack the Bombyx abdominal-A gene and therefore do not express abdominal legs, demonstrated that the two mutants lacked p260/270. Therefore, we speculate that the expression of p260/270 may be regulated by the Bombyx abdominal-A gene. cDNA cloning and sequencing demonstrated that p260 and p270 have structures similar to that of rat fatty-acid synthase, which synthesizes palmitate. Most of the enzymatic domains for palmitate synthesis were well conserved in the amino acid sequences of p260 and p270, while the thioesterase domains of p260 and p270 were less homologous to that of rat fatty-acid synthase. Purified p260/270 can transfer palmitate to cysteine residues of synthetic peptides in vitro. We propose that p260/270 may be involved in protein palmitoylation and may function in abdominal leg development.

Homeotic genes that specify segment identity regulate morphogenesis of segment-specific tissues and organs in the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster (1Garcia-Bellido A. Am. J. Zool. 1977; 17: 613-630Google Scholar), the flour beetleTribolium castaneum (2Beeman R.W. Nature. 1987; 327: 247-249Google Scholar), and the silkworm Bombyx mori (3Tazima y. The Genetics of the Silkworm. Logos Press, London1964: 60-75Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms of limb development have been well studied, and the genes involved in limb development were elucidated inDrosophila (4Sunkel C.E. Whittle J.R.S. Roux's Arch. Dev.

In Drosophila, development of larval and adult thoracic limbs is thought to be repressed in abdominal segments by the bithorax complex (7Lewis E.B. Am. Zool. 1963; 3: 33-56Google Scholar, 8Lewis E.B. Nature. 1978; 276: 565-570Google Scholar). In vertebrates, molecular mechanisms of limb development have also been studied, andHox genes are known to regulate the development (9Morgan, B. A., and Tabin, C. (1994) Development (Camb.), Suppl., 181–186Google Scholar). In B. mori, wild-type embryos express not only thoracic legs, but also abdominal legs. Since some types of mutations in the E homeotic complex cause abnormal development of abdominal legs, the E complex regulates development of abdominal legs (3Tazima y. The Genetics of the Silkworm. Logos Press, London1964: 60-75Google Scholar). We have reported that the E complex is similar to the Drosophila bithorax complex (10Ueno K. Hui C.-C. Fukuta M. Suzuki Y. Development ( Camb. ). 1992; 114: 555-563Google Scholar, 11Ueno K. Nagata T. Suzuki Y. Goldsmith M.R. Wilkins A.S. Molecular Model Systems in the Lepidoptera. Cambridge University Press, New York1995: 165-180Google Scholar). The E complex comprises three homeobox genes:Bombyx Ultrabithorax (Bm Ubx), Bombyx abdominal-A (Bm abd-A), and Bombyx Abdominal-B (Bm Abd-B). Analyses of two mutants that lack abdominal legs demonstrated that Bm abd-A is deleted in the mutant chromosomes (10Ueno K. Hui C.-C. Fukuta M. Suzuki Y. Development ( Camb. ). 1992; 114: 555-563Google Scholar). Therefore, Bm abd-A is probably an essential gene for development of abdominal legs. The homeodomain proteins encoded by homeotic genes are proposed to act as transcriptional regulators on target genes (12Levine M. Hoey T. Cell. 1988; 55: 537-540Google Scholar, 13Krasnow M. Saffman E.E. Kornfeld K. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1989; 57: 1031-1043Google Scholar, 14Samson M.-L. Jackson-Grusby L. Brent R. Cell. 1989; 57: 1045-1052Google Scholar). To determine the target genes of the Bm abd-A gene product, we biochemically analyzed the proteins that are expressed specifically in abdominal legs. In this report, we found a high molecular mass protein (p260/270) composed of two polypeptides expressed specifically in abdominal leg cells during embryogenesis. Molecular cloning showed that the amino acid sequences of the two polypeptides resemble that of an animal fatty-acid synthase, rat FAS, 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty-acid synthase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; mBHA, 4-methylbenzhydrylamine. which can synthesize palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA (15Wakil S.J.

Many viral, cytoskeletal, and cell-surface receptor proteins, among others, have been reported to be modified with palmitate at their cysteine residues (17Schultz A.M. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 611-647Google Scholar, 18Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Google Scholar). Some small GTP-binding, heterotrimeric G-protein, and G-protein-linked receptor proteins are known to be modified with palmitate via thioester linkages. Such modifications may be important in the regulation of signal transduction (19Newman C.M.H. Magee A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 79-96Google Scholar, 20Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Google Scholar, 21Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Google Scholar). However, the enzyme responsible for protein palmitoylation has not yet been elucidated. In this report, we describe the purification of p260/270 from embryos and show that p260/270 can transfer palmitate to peptides via cysteine residues. We propose that p260/270 may function in the regulation of signal transduction in abdominal cells by palmitoylation of proteins and, in this way, may regulate abdominal leg development. Embryos of a commercial strain of B. mori (Kin-Shu × Sho-Wa; Kanebo Silk Co., Kasugai City, Japan) were incubated at 25 °C for 3–8 days to stage 19–24 (22Takami T. Kitazawa T. Tech. Bull. Seric. Exp. Sta. 1960; 75: 1-31Google Scholar) and dissected from eggs under a binocular microscope. The B. mori eggs of mutant strains f12, carrying theE N chromosome, and f21, carrying theE Ca chromosome, were provided by Dr. H. Doira (Institute of Genetic Resources, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). 4 g of B. mori eggs containing stage 22 embryos was added to 50 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl) and was homogenized in a Dounce glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein in the supernatant was fractionated in 27.5–50% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in 40 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (GIGAPITE, Seikagakukogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). After washing away unbound proteins, p260/270 was eluted in a gradient of 10–150 mm sodium phosphate. p260/270 was detected by electrophoresis of eluted proteins on a 0.1% SDS, 5% polyacrylamide gel (PAGEL, Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The p260/270-containing fraction was concentrated using Centriprep-30 (Amicon, Inc.), applied to a 50 × 1.0-cm Sephacryl S-300 column (Pharmacia), and eluted in buffer A. Then, the p260/270-containing fraction was again concentrated with Centricon-30 (Amicon, Inc.) and again purified by column chromatography using Sephacryl S-300. p260/270 was resolved by SDS-PAGE. The bands containing p260 and p270 were excised from the gels and were used to prepare an anti-p260/270 polyclonal antibody in mice (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies; A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of whole mount B. mori embryos was done using a modification of the method described by Mitchison and Sedat (24Mitchison T. Sedat J. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 261-264Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Embryos were stained with a 5000-fold dilution of anti-p260/270 antibody followed by fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Cappel) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum. Immunoblot analysis was done using a method described by Glenney (25Glenney J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 315-319Google Scholar). Ten embryos each of the wild type,E Ca/E Ca, andE N/E N were dissected fromB. mori eggs and homogenized in 25 μl of a buffer containing 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol. 0.5 μl of each homogenate was applied to a 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel (PhastSystem™, Pharmacia). Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was stained with India ink and then treated with a 5000-fold dilution of anti-p260/270 antibody and with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Cappel). p260/270 was detected using an ECL™ system (Amersham Corp.). A cDNA library was constructed using mRNA extracted from embryos at stage 20 (22Takami T. Kitazawa T. Tech. Bull. Seric. Exp. Sta. 1960; 75: 1-31Google Scholar). A QuickPrep™ mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia) was used to extract mRNA from 200 embryos. Purified mRNA was used to synthesize cDNA using a TimeSaver™ cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia). cDNAs were inserted into λgt11 and transformed intoEscherichia coli Y1088 or Y1090. Immunoscreening of a cDNA library with an antibody against p260/270 was done using an ECL™ system. DNA was sequenced with a Taqdye primer cycle sequencing kit and a Taq DyeDeoxy™ terminator cycle sequencing kit of an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA analysis system. To isolate flanking cDNAs, we prepared DNA probes by polymerase chain reaction and screened an embryonic cDNA library. Polymerase chain reaction (26Gibbons I.R. Asai D.J. Ching N.S. Dolecki G.J. Mocz G. Phillison A. Ren H. Tang E.-J.Y. Gibbons B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8563-8567Google Scholar) was used to determine DNA sequence at the 5′-end of the p270 cDNA as described. BLAST and FASTA were used for DNA homology analysis. p260 and p270 were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE as follows. Purified p260/270 was applied to 3% polyacrylamide gel (PAGEL) containing 0.1% SDS. p260 and p270 were separated with a ChromaPhor® protein visualization system (Promega). After excising the bands corresponding to p260 and p270, these proteins were eluted in 100 mm CAPS (pH 11.0) with CENTRILUTOR Micro-Electroelutor (Amicon, Inc.) for 40 min and concentrated using Centricon-30. Approximately 15 μg each of purified p260 and p270 were fixed to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by ProSpin (Applied Biosystems) and was used to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequences. To determine the internal amino acid sequences of p260 and p270, ∼20 μg of each peptide was fragmented in 70% formic acid containing 70 mg/ml CNBr at room temperature for 24 h. The reaction mixture was dried in vacuo and applied to a reverse-phase column (300C4-HG-5, Nomura Chemical Co., Seto, Japan). Amino acid sequencing was done using Applied Biosystems 473A and 492 peptide sequencers. Approximately 0.05 μg of purified p260/270 and 0.1 μg of synthetic peptides were incubated in 10 μl of reaction solution (40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 10 μm acetyl-CoA, 0.01 μCi of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA, 0.5 mm NADPH, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C. After 1 h, reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol Blue), and labeled peptides were separated on a 15–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Dai-ichi Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 40 mA of constant current for 40 min in Tris/Tricine buffer (Dai-ichi Co.) containing 0.1% SDS. The electrophoresis systems could separate low molecular mass peptides ranging from ∼2 to 16 kDa. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and analyzed with a Bio-Image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Fatty acid-peptide binding was analyzed using a synthetic peptide linked to 4-methylbenzhydrylamine (mBHA) resin. Approximately 0.5 μg of purified p260/270 and 1 mg of mBHA-linked peptide, which fixes ∼200 μg of peptide, were incubated in 100 μl of reaction solution. After 1 h, the mBHA-linked peptide was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 2 min and washed twice in methanol. Fatty acid bound to peptide was released as described (27Schmidt M.F.G. Bracha M. Schlesinger M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1687-1691Google Scholar). The washed mBHA-linked peptide was incubated in 300 μl of 0.1 mKOH/methanol for 30 min at room temperature, and released fatty acid was recovered into the organic phase. After methylation of fatty acid in 5% HCl/methanol, fatty acids were analyzed by TLC as described (28Bizzozero O.A. Lees M.B. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 630-636Google Scholar). [1-14C]Myristylate, [1-14C]palmitate, and [1-14C]stearate were purchased from DuPont NEN. Various peptides for palmitoylation assayed as shown in Fig.7 A and the mBHA-linked peptide were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesis system. Our primary interest was to identify proteins that are expressed specifically in abdominal leg cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, early in embryogenesis, a wild-type B. mori embryo expresses three pairs of thoracic legs in thoracic segments (T1 to T3) and four pairs of abdominal legs in abdominal segments (A3 to A6). We dissected and divided embryos into six body regions: the head, the thoracic legs, the thoracic body, the abdominal legs, the abdominal body, and the caudal region (Fig.1 A). Proteins from each body region were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Two high molecular mass polypeptides of ∼260 kDa (p260) and ∼270 kDa (p270) were detected only in abdominal legs (Fig. 1 B). To study p260 and p270, we purified them from whole embryos by ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydroxylapatite column chromatography, and two rounds separation on a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (Fig.1 C). p260 and p270 coeluted from the gel filtration columns, and the stoichiometry of p260 and p270 was equimolar (Fig.1 C). The native molecular mass of the protein was estimated as ∼430 kDa by gel filtration column chromatography (Fig.1 D). Therefore, we inferred that p260 and p270 form a heterodimer complex; hence, the protein was named p260/270. To localize p260/270 within embryos, we made a polyclonal antibody against p260/270. Immunohistochemical analyses were done using whole mountB. mori embryos. p260/270 was not detected in embryos at stage 19, when abdominal legs are not yet developed. Significant amounts of p260/270 were detected in very few cells in segments A1 to A8 of embryos at stage 20, when abdominal legs begin to develop (Fig. 2 A). The cells expressing p260/270 appeared in clusters consisting of ∼50 cells. At stage 21A (∼1 day after stage 20), the cells expressing p260/270 increased in number to ∼100 in each cluster (Fig.2 B), and small abdominal legs began to develop. One more day later (stage 22), these clusters consisted of ∼200 cells (Fig.2 C). Abdominal legs continued to develop in segments A3 to A6 from stage 21A to stage 22, although abdominal leg development stopped in segments A1, A2, A7, and A8. During stage 22, cell clusters in segments A3 to A6 lengthened more than those in the other abdominal segments. p260/270 was most concentrated in the cells at the distal ends of the cell clusters in the eight abdominal segments. At stage 24 (2 days after stage 22), p260/270 had disappeared from the embryo (Fig.2, D and E). We performed immunoblot analysis to determine whether mutants that lack abdominal legs express p260/270. Embryos homozygous for theE Ca (additional crescent) mutation express three pairs of normal thoracic legs, but lack abdominal legs in the abdominal segments (29Itikawa N. Jpn. J. Genet. 1943; 19: 182-188Google Scholar). Embryos homozygous for the E N (new additional crescent) mutation express many thoracic-type legs in would-be abdominal segments (29Itikawa N. Jpn. J. Genet. 1943; 19: 182-188Google Scholar). Thus, embryos homozygous forE Ca and E N lack abdominal legs in the abdominal segments (10Ueno K. Hui C.-C. Fukuta M. Suzuki Y. Development ( Camb. ). 1992; 114: 555-563Google Scholar). Proteins extracted from 10 wild-type and 10 mutant embryos were resolved by gradient SDS-PAGE (0.1% SDS, 4–15% polyacrylamide). India ink staining of nitrocellulose blots showed no qualitative difference between wild-type and mutant proteins, although the amount of total protein in the mutant embryos was slightly less than that in the wild-type embryos (Fig. 3 A). Antibody staining detected p260/270 in wild-type embryos, but not in embryos homozygous for E Ca or E N (Fig.3 B). Although p260 and p270 could not be separated here by gradient SDS-PAGE, the polyclonal antibody recognizing p260/270 detected both p260 and p270 individually; hence, they could be distinguished on 5% polyacrylamide. A cDNA expression library was constructed from stage 20 embryos because we first detected p260/270 at that stage. The library was screened with the antibody against p260/270. Inserts in one cDNA clone of p260 (260-4) and two cDNA clones of p270 (270-2 and 270-7) were sequenced (Figs.4 A and 5 A). Then, to obtain clones containing flanking sequences, we prepared DNA probes corresponding to the ends of these insert DNAs and rescreened the embryonic cDNA library.Figure 5Cloning of p270 cDNA. A, map of p270 cDNAs. The upper line shows the combined p270 cDNA. The thick bar represents the open reading frame, and the thin bars at either end represent untranslated regions. Underlining in sequence indicates the regions that were elucidated by polymerase chain reaction-directed sequencing.Kb, kilobase pair. B, amino acid sequence of p270. The underlined N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences are those determined by CNBr fragmentation of purified p270.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The p260 cDNAs (Fig. 4) represented a long open reading frame encoding 2342 amino acids (Fig. 4 B). We purified p260 by preparative SDS-PAGE (described under “Experimental Procedures”) to determine the N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. The N-terminal amino acids (TMVNPPEVK) corresponded to the deduced amino acids at positions 8–16, implying that the amino acids from methionine to arginine (residues 1–7) are removed during maturation of p260. The amino acid sequences of 260(2), 260(12), 260(5), and 260(6) (revealed by analysis of CNBr-fragmented peptides) were found at amino acids 146–164, 1455–1466, 1563–1574, and 2169–2184, respectively. Therefore, p260 comprises the amino acid sequence from residues 8 to 2342 (Fig. 4 B). The molecular mass of p260 estimated by SDS-PAGE coincides with the molecular mass (261,608 Da) of the amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame. To obtain a clone containing the 5′-end of p270, we performed polymerase chain reaction (26Gibbons I.R. Asai D.J. Ching N.S. Dolecki G.J. Mocz G. Phillison A. Ren H. Tang E.-J.Y. Gibbons B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8563-8567Google Scholar) to generate 270-PCR8 (Fig.5 A). Analysis of p270 cDNAs yielded a long open reading frame encoding 2422 amino acids (Fig. 5 B). The sequenced N-terminal amino acid sequence (APTTVVED) was encoded by the DNA sequence corresponding to the position one amino acid after the first methionine residue. The amino acid sequences of 270(2) and 270(4) (revealed by analysis of CNBr-fragmented peptides) corresponded to amino acids 729–740 and 1675–1686, respectively, in the translated cDNA sequence. From this we concluded that p270 comprises the complete amino acid sequence from residues 2 to 2422 of the translated cDNA (Fig. 5 B). The molecular mass of p270 estimated by SDS-PAGE approximated the deduced molecular mass (268,017 Da) of the peptide translated from the open reading frame. Amino acid sequence comparison between p260 and p270 revealed sequence homology of 38% and no region of common sequence between the two polypeptides. Therefore, it is unlikely that either polypeptide is a modified or processed product of the other. Amino acid sequence analyses of p260 and p270 showed that these proteins have structures similar to that of rat FAS (30Amy C.M. Witkowski A. Naggert J. Williams B. Randhawa Z. Smith S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3114-3118Google Scholar), which synthesizes palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA (Fig. 6). Fatty-acid synthase possesses seven enzymatic domains: ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyltransferase, dehydrase, enolreductase, ketoreductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase. Amino acid homologies between rat FAS and p270 ranged from 43 to 59% in all but the dehydrase and thioesterase domains. The catalytic sites of rat FAS are Cys161 for ketoacyl synthase (31Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Google Scholar), Ser581 for malonyl/acetyltransferase (31Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Google Scholar), His878 for dehydrase (32Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22508-22513Google Scholar),1670GXGXXG for enolreductase (33Witkowski A. Rangan V.S. Randhawa Z.I. Amy C.M. Smith S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 571-579Google Scholar),1886GXGXXG for ketoreductase (33Witkowski A. Rangan V.S. Randhawa Z.I. Amy C.M. Smith S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 571-579Google Scholar), Ser2302 for thioesterase (34Naggert J. Witkowski A. Wessa B. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 787-790Google Scholar), and Ser2151 for the 4′-phosphopantetheine-binding site in acyl carrier protein. The amino acid sequence of p270 contains all of these catalytic sites and the 4′-phosphopantetheine-binding site. That ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyltransferase, enolreductase, ketoreductase, and acyl carrier protein domain amino acid sequences are conserved suggests that, like rat FAS, p270 may synthesize palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Although amino acid homologies between rat FAS and p260 in the ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyltransferase, and enolreductase domains ranged from 37 to 42%, homologies in the ketoreductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase domains were considerably lower (22–26%) (Fig. 6). The amino acid sequence of p260 contained catalytic sites for enolreductase, malonyl/acetyltransferase, dehydrase, enolreductase, and thioesterase, but a catalytic site for ketoreductase and a binding site for 4′-phosphopantetheine in acyl carrier protein could not be found. The four C-terminal domains of p260 (enolreductase, ketoreductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase) were less homologous to those of rat FAS than were those of p270. Many proteins have been reported to be modified with palmitate at cysteine residues (17Schultz A.M. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 611-647Google Scholar, 18Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Google Scholar). Protein palmitoylation may be an important regulation mechanism for signal transduction (20Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Google Scholar, 21Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Google Scholar). However, the structure of the enzyme responsible for protein palmitoylation is not yet known. Comparison of p260/270 with rat FAS revealed some interesting differences with respect to catalytic activity. Rat FAS comprises two identical multifunctional polypeptide chains. The two polypeptides align head-to-tail, and two centers for fatty acid assembly form at the subunit interface (15Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Google Scholar, 16Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Google Scholar). Since p260/270 comprises two different polypeptides, one of which (p260) lacks the catalytic site for ketoreductase and the binding site for 4′-phosphopantetheine in acyl carrier protein, we hypothesized that one center formed at the p260/270 interface may synthesize palmitate. Although the ketoacyl synthase and malonyl/acetyltransferase domains of p260 and p270 were highly homologous to those of rat FAS, the thioesterase domains of p260 and p270 were only 26 and 22% homologous to that of rat FAS, respectively (Fig. 6). Because the thioesterase domain catalyzes palmitate synthesis and releases palmitate from the enzyme, we further hypothesized that p260/270 transfers synthesized palmitate to target polypeptides. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether p260/270 could palmitoylate peptides at cysteine residues in vitro. Insect cells are thought to possess protein palmitoylation activity since palmitoylated peptides can be obtained using baculovirus expression systems (35Linder M.E. Middleton P. Helper J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Google Scholar, 36Koegl M. Zlatkine P. Ley S.C. Courtneidge S.A. Magee A.I. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 749-753Google Scholar). However, there is no known endogenous acceptor peptide that is modified with palmitate in insect cells. The C-terminal regions of yeast and mammal Ras proteins are known to be modified with palmitate in vivo (37Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Google Scholar) and in vitro(38Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 147-154Google Scholar). Cys181 is palmitoylated, and Cys186 is polyisoprenylated in the C-terminal region of p21Ha-Ras(37Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Google Scholar). Therefore, we inferred that the C-terminal regions of theDrosophila ras1 and ras2 gene products (39Neuman-Silberberg F.S. Schejter E. Hoffmann F.M. Shilo B.-Z. Cell. 1984; 37: 1027-1033Google Scholar) would be suitable acceptors for in vitro protein palmitoylation by p260/270. Fig. 7 A shows the amino acid sequences of synthetic peptides used in our experiments. C1 and C2 are 20-mer peptides of the C-terminal regions of the Drosophila ras1 and ras2 gene products, respectively. Peptides were subjected to palmitoylation in vitro by p260/270 in the presence of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The reaction products were resolved by gradient SDS-PAGE (0.1% SDS, 15–20% acrylamide) in Tris/Tricine buffer. The labeled product was detected based on the presence of p260/270, acetyl-CoA, and NADPH (data not shown). The labeled products moved faster than unlabeled peptides. We assumed that the increase in hydrophobicity causes the increase in SDS gel mobility. As shown in Fig. 7 B, C1, C2, C1SC, and C1CS were palmitoylated by p260/270, whereas C1SS, C2SS, and E-C1 were not. Palmitoylation apparently occurred only at cysteine residues, as long as they were located in a basic region. A single substitution of serine for cysteine, as in C1SC or C1CS, resulted in reduction of the radioactivity of the labeled peptides to ∼70% that of C1 (Fig.7 B), implying that each cysteine residue in C1 is palmitoylated about equally. C2 was also palmitoylated to ∼70% the degree of palmitoylation of C1 (Fig. 7 B, lane 6). This lesser degree of palmitoylation of C2 may have resulted from steric hindrance between fatty acids at adjacent cysteine residues. The absence of cysteine residues, as in C2SS, resulted in no detectable labeled peptide (Fig. 7 B, lane 7). Basic amino acid residues in the palmitoylated region are thought to be necessary for modification with palmitate (21Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Google Scholar, 40Bizzozero O.A. Tetzloff S.U. Bharadwaj M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 923-933Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we synthesized E-C1, in which basic amino acids (lysine and arginine) were substituted with acidic amino acids (glutamate). Despite the presence of cysteine residues in E-C1, this peptide proved to be unsuitable for palmitoylation by p260/270 (Fig. 7 B,lane 2). The basic amino acid sequence may be necessary for recognition of an acceptor peptide by the enzyme. To verify the identity of the fatty acid joined to C1, palmitoylation was done using C1 bound to mBHA resin (C1-mBHA). In this way, the fatty acid could easily be released from C1 and purified. The palmitate–peptide thioester bond was cleaved by treatment with 0.1m KOH/methanol (27Schmidt M.F.G. Bracha M. Schlesinger M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1687-1691Google Scholar). TLC separation of fatty acids released from C1-mBHA yielded palmitate and a small amount of stearate (Fig.7 C). We assumed that p260/270 can synthesize not only palmitate, but also a small amount of stearate. We concluded that p260/270 transferred palmitate to C1 via thioester linkages. We performed a standard fatty acid synthesis assay with p260/270 as described (41Arslanian M.J. Wakil S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 59-65Google Scholar) and compared rates versus peptide acylation with the enzyme. Since the rate of peptide acylation was approximately one-third of that of fatty acid synthesis, we concluded that the peptide acylation activity of p260/270 was an endogenous function of the enzyme. Early in embryogenesis, B. mori embryos begin to develop abdominal legs in all eight abdominal segments. Whereas abdominal legs in abdominal segments A1, A2, A7, and A8 stop developing at stage 22, legs continue to form in abdominal segments A3 to A6 until late embryonic stages. Therefore, all eight abdominal segments must have the potential to express abdominal legs. Genetic analysis revealed that some E complex mutants display extra abdominal legs in abdominal segments A1, A2, A7, and A8. For example, the E (Plain extra-legs) andE Ms (Multistars) mutations cause expression of extra abdominal legs in segments A1 and A2 (42Sasaki S. J. Seric. Sci. Jpn. 1930; 1: 87-102Google Scholar) and in segments A7 and A8 (43Tsujita M. Sakaguchi B. Jpn. J. Genet. 1956; 31: 207-216Google Scholar), respectively. Our previous work showed that the E complex ofB. mori is similar to the Drosophila bithorax complex and suggested that Bm abd-A is probably involved in abdominal leg development (10Ueno K. Hui C.-C. Fukuta M. Suzuki Y. Development ( Camb. ). 1992; 114: 555-563Google Scholar). We supposed that Bm Ubxand/or abd-B might be mutated in the E orE Ms chromosome and that Bm Ubx and/orabd-B might affect the development of abdominal legs by repressing expression of Bm abd-A. Immunohistochemical analysis detected p260/270 in small cell clusters in eight abdominal segments at an early embryonic stage. The number of cells that expressed p260/270 increased from stages 20 to 22, but p260/270 had disappeared by stage 24. Immunoblot analysis of mutant embryos that expressed no abdominal legs suggested that p260/270 may be involved in abdominal leg development and that Bm abd-A may regulate expression of p260/270. Whereas the cell clusters in segments A1, A2, A7, and A8 maintained their conformations from stages 20 to 22, those in segments A3 to A6 drastically altered theirs. Bm abd-A may regulate cell cluster conformation change, whereasBm Ubx and/or abd-B may repress regulation byBm abd-A and repress the development of abdominal legs. We suspected that the cell clusters containing p260/270 may be oenocyte clusters since oenocyte clusters develop in abdominal legs in segments A1 to A8. However, without a molecular marker to identify oenocyte cluster cells, we could not verify this identification. Amino acid homology analysis revealed that, although sequences of p260 and p270 differ considerably from each other, these proteins are homologous to rat FAS. p260 and p270 were 38% homologous and had analogous functional domains, but had no region of amino acid sequence identity. From this we concluded that p260 and p270 are encoded by different genes. Analysis of mutant embryos that are deficient in Bm abd-A suggested that Bm abd-Amight regulate the expression of p260/270. Since Bm abd-Acontains a homeobox, Bm abd-A is thought to be a transcriptional regulator. Further analysis is needed to determine the molecular mechanism of Bm abd-A regulation of the p260 and p270 genes. Rat FAS is composed of two identical polypeptides of ∼270 kDa (15Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Google Scholar, 16Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Google Scholar). Homology analysis revealed that the structures of p260 and p270 are similar to that of rat FAS, even though the sequences of p260 and p270 differ from each other. SDS-PAGE analysis of p260/270 implied that p260 and p270 combine in equimolar proportions to form p260/270. However, further analysis is needed to determine the number of subunits that compose the structure of p260/270. Kuhajda et al. (44Kuhajda F.P. Jenner K. Wood F.D. Hennigar R.A. Jaccobs L.B. Dick J.D. Pasternack G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6379-6383Google Scholar) discovered, in tumor cells of human breast cancer, a protein (human FAS) that proved important in determining prognosis. The reason for this protein's significance in disease prognosis remains unknown. It may be that FAS-like proteins are involved in regulation of the growth of carcinoma cells. Purified p260/270 transferred palmitate to synthesized peptides in vitro, and palmitoylation occurred at cysteine residues. Basic amino acids within the vicinity of these cysteines were necessary for palmitoylation, although an acceptor peptide consensus sequence for palmitoylation is not yet known (21Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Google Scholar, 40Bizzozero O.A. Tetzloff S.U. Bharadwaj M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 923-933Google Scholar). We found that the thioesterase domains of p260 and p270 contained highly acidic regions at amino acids 2200–2219 and 2280–2296, respectively. The content of glutamate and aspartate residues was 45 and 31%, respectively, in these regions of p260 (Fig.4 B) and p270 (Fig. 5 B). These acidic regions may interact with and recognize the basic regions of acceptor polypeptides. In this work, we showed that p260/270 is a soluble protein that can palmitoylate peptides in the presence of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. We supposed that palmitate synthesized by p260/270 was transferred to cysteine residues of acceptor peptides. Many studies have been done to determine the molecular mechanisms of peptide palmitoylation in vitro. For example, a cell-free system for protein palmitoylation using a membrane fraction was described (28Bizzozero O.A. Lees M.B. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 630-636Google Scholar, 38Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 147-154Google Scholar), and partial purification of a palmitoyl acyltransferase was accomplished (45Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22399-22405Google Scholar, 46Schmidt M.F. McIlhinney R.A. Burns G.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 205-213Google Scholar). These authors used labeled palmitate as the fatty acid substrate for protein palmitoylation and found that a palmitoyl acyltransferase was localized in the membrane fraction. Since the fatty acid substrate and the enzyme source differed between our work and theirs, it would be interesting to compare the structure and function of p260/270 to those of a purified palmitoyl acyltransferase. The cells that expressed p260/270 during embryogenesis increased in number, and the cell clusters changed shape during abdominal leg development. It seems therefore likely that p260/270 regulates protein palmitoylation in a small number of abdominal leg cells and that a palmitoylated protein may regulate cell division or maturation of cell clusters. To elucidate the mechanisms of p260/270 regulation of cell division, an endogenous acceptor for protein palmitoylation in the embryo must be identified. Using the in vitro protein palmitoylation method described herein, we should be able to identify an endogenous acceptor protein and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of p260/270 regulation of abdominal leg development in B. mori.

Uptake of these cations is dependent on respiration and is prevented by uncoupling agents, and the Vmax for K+ is 1.2–1.5 μmol/min/mg. Albeit more slowly, the non-electrolytes mannitol and sucrose are also transported by this pathway. Treatment of the peptides with proteinase K eliminates the stimulatory effect. Since the stimulated rate is not inhibited by ATP or by cyclosporin, we conclude that this pathway is not related to the mitochondrial KATP channel or the Ca2+-dependent permeability transition pore. Transport is stimulated by pCOX IV-(1–23), pCOX IV-(1–22), and pCOX IV-(1–12)Y, but not by a 13-amino acid peptide representing the nuclear location sequence of the SV40 large T antigen, which is responsible for directing that protein to the nucleus. Spermine, which has four positive charges, also has no stimulatory effect, and an amphiphilic 22-residue peptide derived from antithrombin III with seven net charges is only one-twentieth as effective as pCOX IV-(1–22). Thus, these data indicate that the sequence/structure is important for activation of transport. We also demonstrate that mitochondrial uncoupling, previously reported to be induced by these peptides, actually reflects coupled accumulation of salt. In view of our findings, it is also likely that the lytic effects attributed to these peptides are secondary to swelling and are not due to membrane damageper se. Finally, we show that, in non-ionic media, the peptide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase.

Finally, we show that, in non-ionic media, the peptide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase. Proteins synthesized in the cytosol are imported into mitochondria if they possess an appropriate signal sequence. This is usually a sequence of 20–30 amino acids with 3–5 lysine or arginine residues, each separated by 2–5 hydrophobic residues. They can be presequences, cleaved after import, or can be part of the mature protein (see Ref. 1Pfanner N. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 331-353Google Scholarfor review). Synthetic peptides based on these signal sequences, frequently referred to as leader peptides, have been shown to competitively inhibit import of proteins (2Hurt E.C. Pesold-Hurt B. Schatz G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 178: 306-310Google Scholar, 3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar) and have also been shown to inhibit certain mitochondrial K+ channels (4Chich J.F. Goldschmidt D. Thieffry M. Henry J.P. Eur. J.

Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 115-123Google Scholar). These findings have led to the suggestion that these channels may be part of the mitochondrial protein import machinery (6Henry J.P. Chich J.F. Goldschmidt D. Thieffry M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1989; 71: 963-968Google Scholar, 7Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Tedeschi H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 497-506Google Scholar, 8Lohret T.A.

Campo M.L. Mannella C.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 115-123Google Scholar). In a previous paper (11Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Google Scholar), we examined the properties of a K+transport pathway in intact mitochondria that is stimulated byN-ethylmaleimide and inhibited by adenine nucleotides. Although we have suggested that this pathway may be involved in volume homeostasis, its exact function has not been established. Thus, in view of the reports mentioned above, the question arose as to whether this transport pathway may be one of those involved in protein import. Thus, we began this study by examining the effect of a synthetic leader peptide on K+ uptake by mitochondria. Despite the apparent importance of leader sequences in the translocation of proteins, the effects of leader peptides on isolated mitochondria have not been fully characterized. Several groups have reported that these peptides, which can form amphiphilic helices (12Tamm L.K. Bartoldus I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 29-33Google Scholar), uncouple mitochondria (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar, 13Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Google Scholar, 14Ito A. Ogishima T. Ou W.

Omura T. Aoyagi H. Lee S. Mihara T. Izumiya N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1985; 98: 1571-1582Google Scholar,16Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Google Scholar). Glaser and Cumsky (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar), however, have reported that the peptide pCOX IV-(1–22), which represents the first 22 amino acids of the leader sequence of yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, does not uncouple, whereas pCOX IV-(1–23), which has a C-terminal tyrosine, does uncouple. In this paper, we demonstrate that pCOX IV-(1–22) and related peptides have no effect on the ATP-dependent K+ channel. We do show, however, that they activate a transport pathway that not only conducts K+, tetraethylammonium, and lysine cations, but also the non-electrolytes sucrose and mannitol. Activation of this pathway does not uncouple mitochondria per se; however, the respiration-coupled uptake of salts probably explains the reported respiratory stimulation (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar, 13Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Google Scholar, 14Ito A. Ogishima T. Ou W. Omura T. Aoyagi H.

Moreover, the swelling that ensues probably explains the reported peptide-induced disruption of mitochondria (16Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Google Scholar). We suggest that this pathway could be involved in protein import. Transport was assayed by following swelling that accompanies net solute transport using the light scattering technique as described in detail elsewhere (17Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Google Scholar, 18Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13434-13441Google Scholar). Using this technique, we generated a light scattering variable, β, which normalizes reciprocal absorbance for mitochondrial protein concentration. The rate of solute transport is calculated from the rate of change of β. The normal mitochondrial stock suspension (50 mg of protein/ml) in 0.25m sucrose was treated with rotenone (0.5 μg/mg) and oligomycin (2 nmol/mg). The media for assay of salt transport contained the K+, tetraethylammonium+, or lysine+ salts of acetate (30 mm), Cl− (45 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), and MOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; TMPD,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. (5 mm) plus MgCl2 (0.3 mm) and cytochrome c (10 μm). Ascorbate (2.5 mm) and TMPD (0.25 mm) or succinate (3 mm) were added as indicated in the figure legends. For the sucrose and mannitol assay media, acetate and Cl− salts were replaced by sucrose or mannitol (125 mm). The KCl assay medium contained 75 mmKCl and no acetate. All media had an osmolality close to 146 milliosmolal. Most drugs were obtained from Sigma. The ionophores and rotenone were dissolved in ethanol. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared as described previously (17Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Google Scholar), and rat liver mitoplasts were prepared as described by Schnaitman and Greenawalt (19Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.N. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Google Scholar). The peptides pCOX IV-(1–12)Y, pCOX IV-(1–22), and pCOX IV-(1–23) used in this study were synthesized by Dr. Katherine Wall (University of Toledo) using essentially the same procedure described in Ref. 3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar. The purified peptides were analyzed for amino acid composition, and molecular weights were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry by the University of Texas Health Science Center at the San Antonio Biopolymer Facility. pAT III was a generous gift from Dr. K. W. Kinnally and was synthesized by the Wadsworth Center Biochemistry Core. In a previous study (11Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Google Scholar), we demonstrated that respiring mitochondria swell in K+ salts of permeant acids and that this transport can be partially inhibited by ATP. Using a similar assay, we have now examined the effect of the leader sequence of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV on K+ transport in intact mitochondria. The data in Fig. 1 A show the effect of pCOX IV-(1–22), a peptide that represents the first 22 amino acids of the leader peptide and that has the sequence MLSLRQSIRFFKPATRTLCSSR. Contrary to expectations, the peptide stimulated swelling in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of the peptide was not observed in the absence of ascorbate and TMPD (trace g) and was abolished by nigericin, an electroneutral K+/H+ antiporter (trace h), and also by the uncoupler CCCP (trace i). These findings indicate that the swelling is dependent on electrophoretic K+ uptake driven by the membrane potential and does not represent lysis of the mitochondria. Similar results were obtained using succinate as respiratory substrate (data not shown). The dose-response curves for pCOX IV-(1–22) with mitochondria respiring on ascorbate/TMPD and succinate are compared in Fig.1 B. Although the control rate with succinate was only about half that found with ascorbate/TMPD, the maximum rates were very similar. In both cases, influx rates approached aJmax of 1.2 μmol/min/mg with an EC50 of 14 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1. This represents a 7.5- and 14.6-fold stimulation of the flux with ascorbate/TMPD and succinate, respectively. Since it has been reported that pCOX IV-(1–23), which has a C-terminal tyrosine, is an uncoupler (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar), we also tested this peptide. The data obtained with pCOX IV-(1–23) were very similar to those obtained with pCOX IV-(1–22) and yielded EC50 values of 11.0 and 12.5 μm using ascorbate/TMPD and succinate, respectively. Again,Jmax values were similar and close to 1.4 μmol/min/mg (data not shown). The data in Fig. 2 show that pretreatment of the peptide solution with proteinase K completely abolishes the effect of the peptide with a half-time of ∼2 min at 4 °C. Over the time course of the traces, the protease alone had no effect (trace g). Thus, an intact peptide is necessary to induce stimulation. Similar results were obtained with both succinate and ascorbate/TMPD as substrates. In view of our previous studies under similar conditions showing potent inhibition of K+ transport by ATP (KI = 2.3 μm) (11Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Google Scholar), we asked the question whether ATP would also inhibit transport induced by the peptide. The data in Fig. 3 show that this is not the case. Although ATP (0.2 mm) inhibited the control rate in the absence of pCOX IV-(1–22) (traces a and b), no inhibition was observed in the presence of pCOX IV-(1–22) (8.3 μm) (traces c and d). In fact, we consistently observed a small stimulation. Two possible explanations for the lack of inhibition by ATP are 1) that the pathway induced by pCOX IV-(1–22) is independent of the ATP-regulated pathway and 2) that the peptide prevents ATP from inhibiting the channel. Although formation of a complex between the positively charged peptide and negatively charged ATP could lead to a mutual neutralization of effects, this cannot explain these results because ATP was added in excess of peptide, and consequently, formation of a complex could only enhance the inhibitory effect of ATP. In view of the role of leader peptides in directing the import of proteins into mitochondria, the possibility arises that pCOX IV-(1–22) is activating a channel involved in protein import. If this were the case, the effect should only be observed with authentic leader sequences. To begin a study of the specificity of the effect, we first examined the effect of spermine on K+ uptake since spermine, like the peptide, is polycationic. Spermine, however, did not stimulate, but rather inhibited uptake (data not shown). We have also examined the effect of a 13-residue peptide (which we will refer to as Q13) that contains the nuclear location sequence responsible for directing the import of the SV40 large T antigen into the nucleus (20Forbes D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 495-527Google Scholar). This peptide has the sequence CGGGPKKKRKVED, which, like pCOX IV-(1–22), contains 5 basic amino acids, but also 2 acidic amino acids. For comparison, we also examined the effect of pCOX IV-(1–12)Y, which has a net charge of 3+ and includes the first 12 amino acids of pCOX IV-(1–22), which are sufficient to direct import of proteins into mitochondria (21Hurt E.C. Pesold-Hurt B. Suda K. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2061-2068Google Scholar). As shown by the traces in Fig.4, pCOX IV-(1–12)Y stimulated K+ uptake, but was less potent than pCOX IV-(1–22). In contrast, Q13 had no effect at least up to a concentration of 33 μm. As a more appropriate control, we examined the effect of pAT III, which is a 22-amino acid peptide derived from antithrombin III with the sequence RNASVLKSSKNAKRYLRCNLKA. This peptide contains 7 basic amino acids and can also form an amphiphilic helix, but, unlike pCOX IV-(1–22), is reported not to inhibit protein import in yeast (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 B show that although pAT III does stimulate K+ transport, it is only about one-twentieth as potent as pCOX IV-(1–22). From these data, we conclude that the presence of positive charges alone is insufficient to activate transport and that some additional property of pCOX-(1–22) is responsible for its potency. If the “K+ channel” activated by pCOX IV-(1–22) is normally involved in the transport of proteins, e.g. when the peptide is attached to a protein, one would expect a rather broad selectivity to permit passage of the variety of amino acid side chains found in proteins. Thus, we have investigated the effect of pCOX IV-(1–22) on mitochondria respiring in a variety of media. The dose-response curves shown in Fig. 5 show that transport can be observed in respiring mitochondria when the K+ in the assay medium is replaced by tetraethylammonium ions or by the amino acid lysine. We also observed swelling, although at a much lower rate, in the non-electrolytes sucrose and mannitol. One would not expect the uptake of these non-electrolytes to be driven by the membrane potential; however, the rate was significantly higher in respiring mitochondria (data not shown). One explanation for this effect may be that, in the absence of a membrane potential, K+ is lost from the mitochondria. It is also possible that the membrane potential may play a role in the binding of the peptide to the putative channel or may affect the open probability of the channel. The lowest rate of swelling was observed in KCl medium. In this case, addition of an uncoupler or omission of substrates actually stimulated swelling. This suggests that Cl− may be able to enter the mitochondria under these conditions, but that in energized mitochondria, this flux is prevented by the membrane potential. The data presented in Figs. 1 and 5 suggest that the uptake of K+induced by pCOX IV-(1–22) is coupled to respiration and is not the result of mitochondrial damage or uncoupling. To investigate this further, we examined the effect of pCOX IV-(1–22) on the rate of oxygen consumption in KOAc/Cl, sucrose, and KCl media in experiments carried out in parallel to those shown in Fig. 5. As shown by the data in Fig. 6, pCOX IV-(1–22) stimulated respiration substantially in KOAc/Cl medium, but negligibly in sucrose or KCl. Thus, at least over this dose range, pCOX IV-(1–22) does not appear to uncouple mitochondria. A number of reports, however, have suggested that leader peptides do uncouple mitochondria (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar, 13Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Google Scholar, 14Ito A. Ogishima T. Ou W. Omura T. Aoyagi H. Lee S. Mihara T. Izumiya N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1985; 98: 1571-1582Google Scholar, 15Gillespie L.L. Argan C. Taneja A.T. Hodges R.S. Freeman K.B. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16045-16048Google Scholar, 16Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Google Scholar). To try to resolve this issue, we have investigated the effect of pCOX IV-(1–22) on mitochondria respiring in a medium with the same salt composition as that used by Nicolay et al. (16Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Google Scholar). Although the major osmolytes are non-electrolytes, this medium does contain about 39 mm K+, 10 mm succinate, and 2.5 mm Pi; therefore, the stimulation of respiration reported by Nicolay et al. (16Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Google Scholar) may in fact reflect respiration-driven uptake of potassium succinate permitted by an increased K+ permeability and the activities of the dicarboxylate carrier and phosphate carrier. The data shown in Fig.7 support this hypothesis. Traces a andb in Fig. 7 A show that pCOX IV-(1–22) stimulates respiration 3.7-fold; however, traces c and dshow that the stimulation is dependent on the presence of Pi, and trace e shows that the stimulation can be blocked by N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of the phosphate carrier. Comparison of traces a and freveals that, in the absence of pCOX IV-(1–22), Pistimulates respiration 1.4-fold, and comparison of traces dand f shows that, in the absence of added Pi, the peptide stimulates respiration 1.6-fold. Since this latter stimulation is also blocked by N-ethylmaleimide (initial parts of traces e and d), this probably reflects the existence of endogenous Pi. These data also show that the rate of pCOX IV-(1–22)-stimulated respiration is essentially the same whether Pi is added at the start (trace b) or at 1.25 min (trace c). Thus, the effect of pCOX IV-(1–22) must be induced very rapidly.Figure 7Low concentrations of phosphate are sufficient to support pCOX IV-(1–22)-dependent respiratory stimulation and uptake of K+. Oxygen electrode recordings (A) and light scattering kinetics (B) are shown for mitochondria (1.3 mg/ml (A) and 0.12 mg/ml (B)) respiring on succinate. For both panels: trace a, control with Pi (2.5 mm); trace b, plus pCOX IV-(1–22) (25 μm) and Piat zero time; trace c, plus pCOX IV-(1–22) (25 μm) at t = 0 and Pi att = 1.3 min; trace d, plus pCOX IV-(1–22) (25 μm) at t = 0; trace e,N-ethylmaleimide-treated mitochondria, plus pCOX IV-(1–22) at t = 0 and Pi at t = 1.3 min; trace f, no pCOX IV-(1–22) and no Pi;trace g, plus pCOX IV-(1–22) (25 μm), Pi, and CCCP (0.26 μm) at t = 0 (B only). The assay medium contained sucrose (250 mm), MgCl2 (2.5 mm), cytochromec (10 μm), and rotenone (1 μg/ml) plus the K+ salts of HEPES (25 mm), succinate (10 mm), and EDTA (1 mm) and, where indicated, Pi (2.5 mm). This medium is essentially the same as that used by Nicolay et al. (16Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Google Scholar), with the mannitol replaced by sucrose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These conclusions are fully supported by light scattering traces obtained in parallel experiments shown in Fig. 7 B. Comparison of traces a, c, and d shows that, in the presence of both Pi and pCOX IV-(1–22), there is rapid swelling, which can be blocked by N-ethylmaleimide (trace e). Moreover, consistent with the effects on respiration, in the absence of exogenous Pi, pCOX IV-(1–22) stimulated swelling slightly (traces d andf). In this experiment, we also show that CCCP, a true uncoupler, abolished the swelling induced by pCOX IV-(1–22) and phosphate (traces c and g). Thus, the swelling induced by the peptide under these experimental conditions cannot be attributed to an uncoupling effect. This does not rule out the possibility that pCOX IV-(1–22) increases proton permeability; however, it does mean that the H+ flux must be insignificant compared with the K+ flux. In view of our finding that the pCOX IV-(1–22)-induced pathway can carry a variety of solutes, the question arose as to whether it could represent the so-called permeability transition pore (22Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Google Scholar), which is frequently assayed through its ability to transport sucrose. Since the opening of the permeability transition pore is potently inhibited by cyclosporin A, we examined the effect of cyclosporin on sucrose permeability induced by pCOX IV-(1–22). For this experiment, cyclosporin was added at zero time, and 2 min were allowed to elapse before addition of pCOX IV-(1–22). As shown by the data in Fig. 8, addition of the peptide induced swelling; moreover, the traces obtained with 0.17 and 1.7 μm cyclosporin are indistinguishable from the control trace. From this result, we conclude the pCOX IV-(1–22) does not activate the permeability transition pore. In comparing data obtained in the various media, we observed that, unlike in salt media, in sucrose medium, the Vmax and EC50 values for pCOX IV-(1–22) and pCOX IV-(1–23) appeared to be lower when ascorbate/TMPD was used as a substrate than when succinate was used (data not shown). This difference appears to be related to the lower ionic strength since, as shown in Fig.9, a similar result was obtained in mannitol medium. Since, at the highest peptide doses, the rates actually appear to decrease, we suspected that the effect may be related to inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase. To investigate this possibility, we examined the effect of pCOX IV-(1–22) and pCOX IV-(1–23) on the rate of respiration of mitoplasts suspended in sucrose medium and KCl assay medium with CCCP added to ensure respiration was limited by the activity of the respiratory chain. As shown by the data in Fig. 10, pCOX IV-(1–22) significantly inhibited oxidation of ascorbate/TMPD, but had a relatively small effect on oxidation of succinate. These results are consistent with cytochrome c oxidase being the site of inhibition since oxidation of succinate is limited by succinate dehydrogenase and not by cytochrome c oxidase. The higher potency in sucrose versus KCl suggests that ionic interactions between the positively charged peptides and their site of action may be involved in binding. The IC50 obtained in this experiment was 31 μm with a mitoplast concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. Further experiments revealed that the IC50decreased as the mitoplast concentration was decreased, yielding an extrapolated value of 7 μm at zero concentration (data not shown). This result is consistent with the existence of a large number of low affinity binding sites on the mitoplasts, which will affect the free concentration of peptide. This finding is consistent with the report of Pak and Weiner (23Pak Y.K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14298-14307Google Scholar). To further investigate the nature of this inhibition, we examined the effect of varying cytochrome c concentration. In these experiments, inhibition by 8.6 μm pCOX IV-(1–22) decreased from 75% to 65, 55, and 35% as the concentration of exogenous cytochrome c was raised from 0 μm to 10, 26, and 129 μm, respectively (data not shown). Most of this effect can be explained by an increase in the apparentKm for cytochrome c from 2.6 to 16 μm, which would require a KI of 1.7 μm for the peptide. From these results, it can be predicted that, in intact mitochondria, in which the concentration of cytochrome c between the membranes must be very high, the activity of cytochrome c oxidase should be relatively insensitive to inhibition by pCOX IV-(1–22). This proved to be the case. Addition of 50 μm pCOX IV-(1–22), which inhibited cytochrome c oxidase by 65% in the presence of 10 μm cytochrome c, inhibited respiration by only 20% in intact mitochondria oxidizing ascorbate/TMPD (data not shown). In this paper, we have examined the effect of the leader sequence of yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit IV on the permeability and respiratory chain of rat liver mitochondria. This leader sequence is responsible for directing the import of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV into the mitochondrial matrix (1Pfanner N. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 331-353Google Scholar), but can also direct the import of totally unrelated proteins (2Hurt E.C. Pesold-Hurt B. Schatz G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 178: 306-310Google Scholar, 21Hurt E.C. Pesold-Hurt B. Suda K. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2061-2068Google Scholar, 24Horwich A.L. Kalousek F. Mellman I. Rosenberg E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1129-1135Google Scholar). Several groups have begun investigations of the effects of synthetic peptides based on mitochondrial leader sequences on membranes and isolated channels. These peptides, which form amphiphilic helices (12Tamm L.K. Bartoldus I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 29-33Google Scholar), interact with lipid membranes (13Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H.

Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar, 13Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Google Scholar, 14Ito A. Ogishima T. Ou W.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1015-1019Google Scholar) have suggested that this latter effect may result from the peptides themselves forming pores. Others have shown that these synthetic peptides competitively inhibit protein import (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar, 15Gillespie L.L. Argan C. Taneja A.T.

Tuboi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3188-3193Google Scholar). Thieffry and co-workers (4Chich J.F. Goldschmidt D. Thieffry M. Henry J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 29-35Google Scholar, 5Henry J.P.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 101-108Google Scholar) have identified a K+channel, believed to reside in the outer mitochondrial membrane, that can be blocked by pCOX IV-(1–12)Y. In view of the reported properties of leader peptides, we were surprised when we first found that pCOX IV-(1–22) is able to stimulate the uptake of K+ in respiring mitochondria. Moreover, since this uptake is prevented by uncouplers, nigericin, and omission of respiratory substrates, it is clearly not a consequence of membrane lysis. The EC50 for this process, which lies between 10 and 15 μm, is in the range reported for inhibition of protein import (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar, 15Gillespie L.L. Argan C. Taneja A.T. Hodges R.S. Freeman K.B. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16045-16048Google Scholar, 23Pak Y.K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14298-14307Google Scholar). Unlike the K+ uptake pathway previously characterized (11Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Google Scholar), the peptide-induced pathway is not blocked by ATP; therefore, we tentatively conclude that the pathways are not related. One important question regarding the action of pCOX IV-(1–22) is, what structural features are necessary to induce the effect? Although it is difficult to answer this question without synthesizing a large number of peptides, we have demonstrated the following. Both pCOX IV-(1–22) and pCOX IV-(1–12)Y, which have five and three net positive charges, respectively, stimulate transport, while other positively charged molecules such as spermine, which has four positive charges and a 13-residue peptide (Q13) that contains the sequence Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys, did not. More interesting is the finding that pAT III, which has many properties similar to pCOX IV-(1–22), is much less potent than pCOX IV-(1–22). For example, if it is assumed that theJmax values for the two peptides are equal, the EC50 for pAT III is 20-fold higher than for pCOX IV-(1–22). Thus, it is quite possible that the structural requirements for activating protein import and the K+ channel are the same. The selectivity of the peptide-activated pathway appears to be fairly broad. It not only carries K+ and other cations including tetraethylammonium and lysine, but also non-electrolytes such as sucrose and mannitol. In the absence of salts that can be accumulated, the increased permeability does not appear to be associated with an increase in the rate of respiration. Thus, although the peptide-activated pathway is able to conduct molecules as large as sucrose, it seems to be relatively impermeable to protons. Contrary to this conclusion, many others have reported that leader peptides uncouple intact mitochondria (3Glaser S.M. Cumsky M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8808-8816Google Scholar, 13Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Google Scholar, 14Ito A. Ogishima T. Ou W. Omura T. Aoyagi H. Lee S. Mihara T. Izumiya N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1985; 98: 1571-1582Google Scholar, 15Gillespie L.L. Argan C. Taneja A.T. Hodges R.S. Freeman K.B. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16045-16048Google Scholar, 16Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Google Scholar). Thus, in an attempt to reconcile these disparate conclusions, we investigated the effect of pCOX IV-(1–22) on the respiration rate and volume of mitochondria in a medium with the same salt composition as that used by Nicolay et al. (16Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Google Scholar). We confirmed their finding that the peptide stimulates respiration, but we disagree with their conclusion. Our data clearly demonstrate that, in this medium, the immediate effect of the peptide is the activation of a K+ influx pathway and that it is the respiration-dependent uptake of K+ phosphate and succinate that is responsible for the stimulation of respiration. In view of the rapid swelling associated with the influx of the K+ salts, the outer membrane will be broken and intermembrane enzymes lost. Eventually, the inner membrane may itself become damaged; and volume homeostatic mechanisms involving the K+/H+ antiporter (31Beavis A.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2538-2545Google Scholar) and the inner membrane anion channel (32Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Google Scholar) will become active, and oxidative phosphorylation will be uncoupled. Thus, we believe that the conclusions that these peptides solubilize the outer membrane at low doses and make the inner membrane leaky at high doses should be reassessed. It is most likely that these effects are secondary to mitochondrial swelling. Since we have shown that pCOX IV-(1–22) also increases the permeability to sucrose and mannitol, which are frequently used as the major osmolytes in studies with isolated mitochondria, it is likely that, even in the absence of permeant acids, swelling due to influx of these non-electrolytes will also cause breakage of the outer membrane and eventual loss of respiratory control. In the course of these studies, the question arose as to whether pCOX IV-(1–22) was activating a pathway specific to the mitochondrial membrane or whether, as suggested by Singer et al. (28Singer S.J. Maher P.A. Yaffe M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1015-1019Google Scholar), it itself was forming channels. In view of the five positive charges carried by the peptide, it is hard to imagine that it would form a cation-conducting channel; however, we investigated whether we could induce the formation of channels in a planar lipid bilayer by adding 100 μm peptide to the chamber. No channels, however, were observed (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the report of Henry et al. (5Henry J.P. Chich J.F. Goldschmidt D. Thieffry M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 112: 139-147Google Scholar), who found that pCOX IV-(1–12)Y does not form channels in lipid bilayers, and the report of Simon and Blobel (33Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Google Scholar), who found that the LamB signal peptide, which opens protein-conducting channels in Escherichia coli, does not change the conductance of planar lipid bilayers in the absence of proteins. Another property of pCOX IV-(1–22) is its ability to inhibit respiration at the level of cytochrome c oxidase. Our data suggest that the peptide competes with cytochrome c for binding to the oxidase since its effectiveness is decreased by raising the concentration of cytochrome c and is negligible in intact mitochondria, which maintain a high concentration of cytochromec between their membranes. An ionic interaction is suggested by the fact that, in the 0–30 μm range, inhibition is only significant at low ionic strength. Although this effect can complicate the interpretation of data obtained utilizing these peptides in intact mitochondria, it probably has no physiological significance because cytochrome c oxidase does not play a significant limiting role when succinate or NAD-linked substrates are being oxidized. It is tempting to speculate that the peptide-activated transport pathway is in fact part of the protein import machinery. It makes sense that the leader peptide should open the channel through which the protein has to pass since, in the absence of a substrate, one would expect the channel to be closed. Although it has been reported that channels isolated from mitochondria can be blocked by pCOX IV-(1–22) (4Chich J.F. Goldschmidt D. Thieffry M. Henry J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 29-35Google Scholar, 5Henry J.P. Chich J.F. Goldschmidt D. Thieffry M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 112: 139-147Google Scholar, 6Henry J.P. Chich J.F. Goldschmidt D. Thieffry M.

Mannella C.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 115-123Google Scholar), it has also been reported that leader peptides open channels responsible for the secretion of proteins in bacteria (33Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Google Scholar). The increase in K+ conductance induced by the peptide may be apparent only in the absence of a protein attached to the leader sequence. On the other hand, it is possible that the increase in K+ conductance is not a coincidence, but is important for the growth of mitochondria. When mitochondria divide, it is not only necessary for new proteins to be synthesized, but they must also increase their K+ content. Another possibility is that the cation conductance may somehow be necessary for the conduction of negatively charged residues in translocated peptides. One may also question whether the concentration of peptide necessary to open the pore is not too high. It is possible, however, that the binding affinity may be much higher when it is attached to a protein. A decrease in affinity after cleavage, e.g. due to exposure of a C-terminal carboxyl group, could then prevent the peptide from keeping the channel open after protein translocation is complete. One could also argue that a relatively low affinity is necessary to enable the leader peptide to pass through the channel. If it were to bind too tightly, it may actually block transport of the protein. Although these considerations are very interesting, it remains to be proved whether or not the effects of these peptides on mitochondrial permeability are related to their interaction with the protein import machinery or are an unrelated phenomenon.

The mutant porins were purified and reconstituted into planar bilayers, tested for channel formation and compared with wild type Hib porin.

The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria forms a selective permeability barrier to substances that are present in their environment. Solutes such as sugars, amino acids, nucleosides, and small antibiotics diffuse across the outer membrane, whereas substances such as proteins, detergents, and large antibiotics do not readily gain access to the periplasm. Porins are trimeric proteins located in the outer membrane and are largely responsible for the molecular sieve properties of this bilayer. They form water-filled channels, which allow the diffusion of hydrophilic molecules into the periplasm; large antibiotics are excluded from this compartment (1Benz R. Ghuysen J.-M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1994: 397-423Google Scholar, 2Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Google Scholar). The maximum size of a solute molecule that can permeate the pores defines a value termed the molecular mass exclusion limit. Solutes lower in molecular mass than this value are considered to diffuse through porins into the periplasm; solutes whose molecular mass exceed the value of the exclusion limit are apparently impeded in their passage. The variety of porins and their exclusion limits differ from one bacterial genus to another (3Jeanteur D. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Ghuysen J.-M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1994: 363-380Google Scholar). Hib 1The abbreviations used are: Hib, H. influenzae type b; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Hi, H. influenzae; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nS, nanosiemen(s). is an encapsulated Gram-negative bacterium that until recently was the leading cause of meningitis in infants under 18 months. The most abundant protein in the outer membrane of Hib is porin, encoded by the ompP2 gene. Sequencing of the ompP2 gene (4Hansen E.J. Hasemann C. Clausell A. Capra J.D. Orth K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Latimer J.L. Miller E.E. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1100-1107Google Scholar, 5Munson Jr., R. Tolan Jr., R.W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 88-94Google Scholar) revealed an open reading frame for a signal sequence of 20 amino acids followed by 341 amino acids of the mature protein. Whereas the outer membrane ofEscherichia coli contains at least three proteins (OmpF, OmpC, and PhoE) that are diffusion channels (6Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 42-435Google Scholar), only one of the six major outer membrane proteins from Hib apparently has channel activity. Hib porin has a molecular mass exclusion limit of 1400 Da (7Vachon V. Lyew D.J. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 918-924Google Scholar), considerably larger than the value of 600 Da (6Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 42-435Google Scholar) for the pore formed by OmpF of E. coli. Significant advances in our understanding of porin functions derive from the crystal structures of Rhodobacter capsulatus porin (8Weiss M.S. Abele U. Weckesser J. Welte W. Schiltz E. Schulz G.E. Science. 1991; 254: 1627-1630Google Scholar), Rhodopseudomonas blastica porin (9Kreusch A. Neubuser A. Schiltz E. Weckesser J. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 58-63Google Scholar), and E. coli OmpF, PhoE (10Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Google Scholar), and LamB (11Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Google Scholar) porins. From these analyses at atomic resolution, the folding pattern of bacterial porins was demonstrated to be 16 (or 18, in the case of specific porins) anti-parallel β strands that traverse the outer membrane and loops that connect the β strands on both sides of the membrane. The whole structure forms a β barrel. The connecting loops on the extracellular surface are longer than the turns on the periplasmic surface. In all five porin structures, loop 3 folds back into the channel and produces a constriction of the channel. This structural feature is considered to determine pore sizes and thus the molecular mass exclusion limits of porins. Based on parameters of hydrophilicity and amphiphilicity, we exploited computer-assisted algorithms to generate a model for the secondary structure of Hib porin (12Srikumar R. Dahan D. Gras M.F. Ratcliffe M.J.H. van Alphen L. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4007-4016Google Scholar). Even though the amino acid sequences of porin from nontypeable Haemophilus did not show extensive homology to any known porins (3Jeanteur D. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Ghuysen J.-M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1994: 363-380Google Scholar), our model of Hib porin is in agreement with an emerging consensus for the channel-forming motif of porins. We predicted 16 anti-parallel β strands that traverse the outer membrane and eight long loops that connect the β strands on one side of the membrane. Experiments that used a panel of nine mAbs against Hib porin (13Hansen E.J. Pelzel S.E. Orth K. Moomaw C.R. Radoff J.D. Slaughter C.A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3270-3275Google Scholar, 14Srikumar R.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 665-676Google Scholar) supported our computer-assisted predictions of secondary structure and allowed for orientation of the Hib porin model; the eight long, connecting loops were assigned to the extracellular surface. These studies also identified two surface-exposed regions in Hib porin, amino acids 162–172 and amino acids 318–325, which were assigned to the fourth loop (loop 4) and to the eighth loop (loop 8) in our secondary structure model. Two regions between amino acids 112–126 and 148–153 were buried or inaccessible at the surface of the outer membrane. We proposed (12Srikumar R. Dahan D. Gras M.F. Ratcliffe M.J.H. van Alphen L. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4007-4016Google Scholar) that residues 112–126 contribute to the third loop (loop 3) of Hib porin and that the inaccessibility of these residues at the cell surface was due to loop 3's forming a constriction inside the pore. This paper describes experimental strategies for isolation of an Haemophilus influenzae strain that is deleted for the ompP2 gene and the construction of mutant Hib porins by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, we propose a homology-based model of Hib porin that provides the structural framework for our discussion of the channel-forming activity of these mutant Hib porins. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. Nontypeable H. influenzae (Hi) strain DB117 is a recombination-deficient derivative from parent Hi strain KW20.Haemophilus strains were grown routinely on chocolate agar plates (36 g·liter−1 GC base (Difco), 10 g·liter−1 hemoglobin, and 20 ml·liter−1Vitox supplements (Oxoid)) containing 150 μg·ml−1 of bacitracin. Liquid cultures of Haemophilus strains were propagated in brain heart infusion (Oxoid) broth supplemented with hemin (10 μg·ml−1) and NAD+ (10 μg·ml−1); this medium is designated supplemented brain heart infusion. Media for E. coli strains have been described (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibiotic concentrations used for selection of chromosomal or plasmid markers after transformation ofHaemophilus and E. coli were 20 μg·ml−1 of kanamycin and 10 μg·ml−1of tetracycline. For selection of plasmid-encoded resistance inE. coli, ampicillin concentration was 100 μg·ml−1.Table IBacterial strains, phages, and plasmids used in this studyStrain, phage, or plasmidRelevant characteristicsSource or referenceE. coli strainsDH5αsupE44ΔlacU169(φ80 lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1Life Technologies, Inc.CJ236dut1 ung1 thi-1 relA1/pCJ105(cam rF′)Bio-RadMV1190Δ(lac-proAB) thi supEΔ(srl-recA)306∷Tn10(tet r) F′[traD36 proAB lac1 q lacZΔM15]Bio-RadHaemophilus strainsATCC9795Wild type Hib subtype 1H ompP2 +(7)KW20Wild type Hi Rd ompP2 + rec-1 +(30Alexander H.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strain DH5α or Hi strain DB117 were used as hosts for large scale isolation of plasmid DNA using the plasmid maxi kit from QIAGEN. DNA was extracted from agarose gels using the GeneClean kit (Bio 101). To transform E. coli, cells were made competent with calcium chloride (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Haemophilusstrains were made competent for DNA uptake using calcium chloride; alternatively, Haemophilus strains were induced to be naturally competent (16Barcak G.J. Chandler M.S. Redfield R.J. Tomb J.-F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 321-342Google Scholar). The entire Hib porin gene (ompP2) together with upstream sequences (1.1 kb at the 5′-end of the gene) and downstream sequences (0.37 kb at the 3′-end of the gene) are contained in the shuttle vector pEJH39-1-35 as an EcoRI-PstI fragment. This plasmid was linearized with PvuII and then subjected to partial digestion with MluI. The digestion products were electrophoresed on an agarose gel; the 11.6-kbPvuII-MluI DNA fragment was isolated. A double-stranded DNA adaptor with PvuII and MluI ends and containing an internal SalI site (underlined) was constructed by annealing two single-stranded oligonucleotides: 5′-CTGGTCGAC A-3′ and 5′-CG CGT GTCGAC CAG-3′. Ligation of the adaptor to the 11.6-kb DNA fragment therefore introduced a novel SalI site. The ligation mixture was used to transform Hi strain DB117; selection was for tetracycline resistance. Plasmid DNA was isolated from transformants and was designated pRS02. Plasmid pRS02 was deleted for 98% of the coding sequences for Hib porin, and it retained sequences flanking the excised porin gene. To overcome SalI site modification in Hi strain DB117, pRS02 was used to transform E. coli strain DH5α and plasmid DNA was re-isolated. E. coli-passaged pRS02 was digested with SalI and ligated to a 1.1-kb SalI-restricted DNA fragment containing a kanamycin resistance gene derived from transposon Tn903. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli strain DH5α with selection for both tetracycline and kanamycin resistances. Plasmid pRS21 harbors the kanamycin resistance cassette with its own promoter in the same orientation as the Hib ompP2 promoter. Plasmid pRS21, digested to completion with BamHI, was used to transform naturally competent Hi strain KW20; selection was for kanamycin resistance. Transformants were screened for absence of porin in outer membrane preparations. From Hi strains that were missing porin, chromosomal DNA was subjected to Southern blotting using as probes the ompP2 gene and the kanamycin resistance gene. Genomic DNA was isolated from Haemophilus strains by a microscale procedure (16Barcak G.J. Chandler M.S. Redfield R.J. Tomb J.-F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 321-342Google Scholar). DNA restriction fragments were separated electrophoretically in 0.7% agarose gels containing TAE (0.01m Tris acetate plus 0.01 m EDTA) buffer and transferred to Nytran hybridization membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Enzymes and the digoxigenin DNA labeling kit (The Genius system) for Southern hybridization were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Southern hybridizations were carried out with digoxigenin-labeled probes at 25 ng·ml−1 of hybridization solution. Hybridizations were at 68 °C and a final wash with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 15 min was included to reduce background. Plasmid pEJH39-1-35 was digested with PvuII andSspI. The 1.1-kb PvuII-SspI DNA fragment was isolated; it contained only the coding sequences for the mature form of Hib porin. This DNA fragment was ligated to the 2.5-kbPvuII fragment from pBluescript SK(−) and used to transformE. coli strain DH5α; selection was for ampicillin resistance. A recombinant plasmid in which thePvuII-SspI DNA fragment from pEJH39-1-35 was cloned in the same orientation as the lacZ gene in pBluescript SK(−) was designated pFFA02. It was used for mutagenesis experiments. Site-directed deletions in Hib porin were constructed with the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitromutagenesis kit, version 2 (Bio-Rad), using single-stranded mutagenic oligonucleotides. Two regions in Hib porin were selected for mutagenesis (Fig. 1), and they correspond to loop 3 and to loop 4 in the proposed topological model for Hib porin (12Srikumar R. Dahan D. Gras M.F. Ratcliffe M.J.H. van Alphen L. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4007-4016Google Scholar). Plasmid pFFA02 was used to transform E. coli strain CJ236. After infection of a transformant with helper phage M13K07, uracil-containing single-stranded phagemid DNA was isolated and used for the mutagenesis. Two mutagenic oligonucleotides created deletions of 6 amino acids and 12 amino acids in loop 3: 5′-ACA AGT GCA GAA GAT AAA GAGCTC GAC TAT ATT CCT ACT AGT-3′ and 5′-GAT GGC ATA ACA AGT GCA GAGCTC CCT ACT AGT GGT AAT ACC-3′, respectively. Two mutagenic oligonucleotides created deletions of 6 amino acids and 12 amino acids in loop 4: 5′-AAG CGT GAG GGT GCA AAAGAGCTC AAG GCT GGT GAA GTA CGT-3′ and 5′-TTA GCA CAA AAG CGT GAG GAGCTC GAA GTA CGT ATA GGT GAA-3′, respectively. Each mutagenic oligonucleotide also incorporated a unique SacI site (underlined). After in vitromutagenesis, the reactions were used to transform E. colistrain MV1190. Plasmids were isolated from transformants and mapped using restriction enzyme digestions. All candidates for each mutation were confirmed by DNA sequencing of plasmid DNA. Plasmids (pFFA05 to pFFA08, Table I) were digested to completion withPvuII and MluI, and the 1.0-kbPvuII-MluI DNA fragments containing the mutations were isolated. These fragments were ligated to the 11.6-kbPvuII-MluI DNA fragment from pEJH39–1-35 and used to transform competent Hi strain RSFA21, with selection for kanamycin and tetracycline resistances. Plasmid pFFA02 contains unique sites for the restriction enzymes SpeI and SnaBI within the coding sequences for the mature form of Hib porin. Restriction sites for SpeI and SnaBI are found within sequences encoding amino acids of loop 3 and loop 4 of Hib porin, respectively. These sites were used to construct in-frame insertions of the C3 epitope of the VP1 protein of poliovirus (17Charbit A.J. Ronco J. Michel V. Werts C. Hofnung M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 262-275Google Scholar, 18Moeck G.S. Fazly Bazzaz B.S. Gras M.F. Ravi T.S. Ratcliffe M.J.H. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4250-4259Google Scholar) in Hib porin. Plasmid pFFA02, digested with either SpeI orSnaBI, was ligated to double-stranded oligonucleotides. Linker SpeI-C3 was constructed by annealing two single-stranded oligonucleotides: 5′-CT AGT GAT AAC CCG GCG TCG ACC ACT AAC AAG GAT AAG A-3′ and 5′-CT AGT CTT ATC CTT GTT AGT GGT CGA CGC CGG GTT ATC A-3′. Linker SnaBI-C3 was constructed by annealing two single-stranded oligonucleotides: 5′-GT GAT AAC CCG GCG TCG ACC ACT AAC AAG GAT AAG C-3′ and 5′-G CTT ATC CTT GTT AGT GGT CGA CGC CGG GTT ATC AC-3′. Linkers SpeI-C3 and SnaBI-C3 created the codons for the C3 epitope in-frame to the codons for Hib porin. The ligation mixtures were used to transform E. coli strain DH5α with selection for ampicillin resistance. Plasmids from transformants were isolated, mapped, and sequenced. Plasmids pFFA03 and pFFA04 were digested to completion with PvuII andMluI; the isolated mutagenized fragment was ligated to the 11.6-kb PvuII-MluI DNA from pEJH39-1-35. For dideoxy sequencing (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used. One oligonucleotide was adequate for all DNA sequencing across regions encoding amino acids corresponding to loop 3 and loop 4: 5′-T(584) GAA GTA AAA CTT GGT CGT (603)G-3′; the numbers correspond to the published sequence of the Hib porin gene (5Munson Jr., R. Tolan Jr., R.W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 88-94Google Scholar). Outer membrane vesicles were obtained by treatment of cells with Tris-lysozyme-EDTA (19Hantke K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 288-292Google Scholar). Samples of vesicles containing outer membrane proteins were suspended in electrophoresis sample buffer with 2% (w/v) SDS, heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and run on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. For immunoblotting, outer membrane proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies (12Srikumar R. Dahan D. Gras M.F. Ratcliffe M.J.H. van Alphen L. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4007-4016Google Scholar) that were diluted 1/2000. Bacteria from mid-log phase cultures were washed in PBS and suspended in PBS to 2 × 109cells·ml−1. Affinity-purified anti-Hib porin mouse mAbs (14Srikumar R. Chin A.C. Vachon V. Richardson C.D.

Fazly Bazzaz B.S. Gras M.F. Ravi T.S. Ratcliffe M.J.H. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4250-4259Google Scholar) at 1/100 dilution was mixed with 2 × 108cells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Bacteria were pelleted, washed, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated to fluorescein. Bacteria were diluted ten-fold in PBS and analyzed for green fluorescence intensity using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with LysisII software. For each sample, 104cells were analyzed. Planar bilayer studies were executed as described previously (20Dahan D. Vachon V. Laprade R. Coulton J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 204-211Google Scholar) but with the following change in instrumentation: an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments) was used to measure the ionic current across the membrane. Our proposed model for the secondary structure of Hib porin (12Srikumar R. Dahan D. Gras M.F. Ratcliffe M.J.H. van Alphen L. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4007-4016Google Scholar) is consistent with the consensus fold that is derived from five high resolution x-ray structures of nonspecific bacterial porins. We therefore explored possibilities to map the sequence of Hib porin onto the homology-derived scaffold of these structures. Using Hib porin as a target for the FASTA sequence alignment program, only one significantly scoring sequence homolog was found in SWISSPROT, identifying OmpF from E. coli as the closest currently known sequence relative. Hib porin and OmpF are 341 and 340 amino acids, respectively; identities are found at 58 amino acids (17% of the sequence), and there is no extended clustering of amino acid identities. This initial alignment was improved as follows. (i) A family alignment of structurally known porins (R. capsulatus porin and E. coli OmpF and PhoE) was constructed based on their three-dimensionally equivalent residues and using SUPERIMPOSE (21Diederichs K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 187-195Google Scholar). (ii) The sequences of three other Hi porins were included and the alignment modified so as to place insertions, deletions, and other variable regions of those sequences primarily within loops and turns, while maximizing the number of identities with OmpF and with other members of the structure-based family alignment. A similar strategy to that described here was successfully employed to identify a molecular replacement model, thereby solving the x-ray structure of porin from Paracoccus denitrificans (22Hirsch A. Breed J. Saxena K. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Diederichs K. Welte W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 208-210Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates of OmpF (10Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Google Scholar) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY), entry code 1OMF. Using the Swiss-Model Server (23Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Google Scholar) 2The Swiss-Model server is accessible on the World-wide Web (URL: http://expasy.hcuge.ch). and the alignment shown in Fig. 1, a homology model for porin of Hib was generated (Fig. 2). The model maps the sequence of Hib porin onto the structural scaffold of the porin family. This model is not meant to represent the detailed conformation of the loops but rather to indicate the length and position of loops within the overall β-barrel framework. Highlighted in the stereo figure is the modeled Cα backbone of sequences that are proposed to form loop 3. The length of loop 3 for Hib porin is apparently shorter than the length of loop 3 for OmpF of E. coli. While there is currently no high resolution structure for Hib porin and therefore no direct evidence for the position of loop 3 within the pore, observations on the differences in the lengths of loops 3 are in agreement with the measured molecular mass exclusion limits for OmpF (600 Da) and Hib porin (1400 Da). The molecular model predicts that deletions of 6 amino acids or of 12 amino acids in loop 3 of Hib porin might alter properties of ion conductivity. The experiments that follow were designed in part to test this prediction. Plasmid pRS21 was constructed by replacing the sequences coding for the mature form of Hib porin in pEJH39-1-35 with a kanamycin resistance cassette. The kanamycin resistance cassette in this construct was flanked by sequences upstream and downstream of the Hib ompP2 gene. ABamHI fragment derived from pRS21 and containing the kanamycin resistance cassette was used to transform nontypeable Hi; selection was for kanamycin resistance. Hi strain RSFA21, a representative transformant, was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting of outer membrane preparations. Gain of kanamycin resistance coincided with loss of porin (Fig. 4, lane 4). Analyses by Southern blotting (data not shown) confirmed the replacement of the chromosomal copy of the Hi porin gene with the kanamycin resistance cassette. The Hib ompP2 probe hybridized to a chromosomal DNA fragment from wild type Hi strain KW20 but not to any chromosomal DNA fragment from the porin deletion strain. Conversely, the kanamycin resistance gene probe hybridized to a chromosomal DNA fragment from the porin deletion Hi strain RSFA21 but not to any chromosomal DNA fragment from the wild type Hi strain. We chose to introduce deletions and insertions into the proposed loop 3 and the proposed loop 4 of Hib porin. The amino acids deleted were those that correspond to epitopes (12Srikumar R. Dahan D. Gras M.F. Ratcliffe M.J.H. van Alphen L. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4007-4016Google Scholar) recognized by the anti-Hib porin mAbs POR.1 (loop 3) and POR.4 (loop 4). The gene sequences of the mutations created by site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting mutant amino acid sequences of Hib porins are shown in Fig. 3. Since all four oligonucleotides used for construction of the deletions contained 6 nucleotides that introduced a SacI site, each deletion protein gained 2 additional amino acids, Glu and Leu. For example, to create a net deletion of 6 amino acids in loop 3 as encoded by pRS05, 8 amino acids were removed; they were replaced by 2 amino acids, Glu and Leu. The ends of the linkers SpeI-C3 and SnaBI-C3 were compatible for insertion at SpeI and SnaBI restriction sites, respectively. There were net insertions of 13 amino acids and 12 amino acids in the loop 3-C3 and loop 4-C3 mutant proteins. Plasmids containing the cloned Hib porin gene (pEJH39-1-35) or containing deletions and insertions in Hib ompP2 (pRS03 to pRS08) were used to transform the porin deletion Hi strain RSFA21. Proteins expressed in the transformants (RS01 and RS03 to RS08) were initially detected by SDS-PAGE of total cell lysates. To determine the cellular location of the mutant proteins, outer membrane vesicles were prepared, run on polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 4). Deletions in loop 3 (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7) or C3 epitope insertion in loop 3 of Hib porin (Fig. 4, lane 10) altered the mobility of the mutant porins when compared with the migration of wild type Hib porin. Deletions in loop 4 (Fig. 4, lanes 8 and 9) or C3 insertion in loop 4 (Fig. 4, lane 11) did not alter the mobility of the mutant porins when compared with the wild type Hib porin. Three anti-Hib porin mAbs (POR.1, POR.4, and POR.6; Ref. 14Srikumar R. Chin A.C. Vachon V. Richardson C.D. Ratcliffe M.J.H. Saarinen L. Käyhty H. Mäkelä P.H. Coulton J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 665-676Google Scholar) and a polyclonal antibody against the C3 epitope of poliovirus designated 928 (18Moeck G.S. Fazly Bazzaz B.S. Gras"
