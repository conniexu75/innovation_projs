https://openalex.org/W2260024370,"Cas9-mediated gene editing corrects hereditary tyrosinemia in a mouse model. The combination of Cas9, guide RNA and repair template DNA can induce precise gene editing and the correction of genetic diseases in adult mammals. However, clinical implementation of this technology requires safe and effective delivery of all of these components into the nuclei of the target tissue. Here, we combine lipid nanoparticle–mediated delivery of Cas9 mRNA with adeno-associated viruses encoding a sgRNA and a repair template to induce repair of a disease gene in adult animals. We applied our delivery strategy to a mouse model of human hereditary tyrosinemia and show that the treatment generated fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-positive hepatocytes by correcting the causative Fah-splicing mutation. Treatment rescued disease symptoms such as weight loss and liver damage. The efficiency of correction was >6% of hepatocytes after a single application, suggesting potential utility of Cas9-based therapeutic genome editing for a range of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2258336271,"T cells can be re-directed to kill cancer cells using chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T cell receptors (TCRs). This approach, however, is constrained by the rarity of tumor-specific single antigens. Targeting antigens also found on bystander tissues can cause life-threatening adverse effects. A powerful way to enhance ON-target activity of therapeutic T cells is to engineer them to require combinatorial antigens. Here, we engineer a combinatorially activated T cell circuit in which a synthetic Notch receptor for one antigen induces the expression of a CAR for a second antigen. These dual-receptor AND-gate T cells are only armed and activated in the presence of dual antigen tumor cells. These T cells show precise therapeutic discrimination in vivo-sparing single antigen ""bystander"" tumors while efficiently clearing combinatorial antigen ""disease"" tumors. This type of precision dual-receptor circuit opens the door to immune recognition of a wider range of tumors. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2256579886,"Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are commonly used vehicles for in vivo gene transfer. However, the tropism repertoire of naturally occurring AAVs is limited, prompting a search for novel AAV capsids with desired characteristics. Here we describe a capsid selection method, called Cre recombination-based AAV targeted evolution (CREATE), that enables the development of AAV capsids that more efficiently transduce defined Cre-expressing cell populations in vivo. We use CREATE to generate AAV variants that efficiently and widely transduce the adult mouse central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous injection. One variant, AAV-PHP.B, transfers genes throughout the CNS with an efficiency that is at least 40-fold greater than that of the current standard, AAV9 (refs. 14,15,16,17), and transduces the majority of astrocytes and neurons across multiple CNS regions. In vitro, it transduces human neurons and astrocytes more efficiently than does AAV9, demonstrating the potential of CREATE to produce customized AAV vectors for biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2256857837,"The Notch protein is one of the most mechanistically direct transmembrane receptors-the intracellular domain contains a transcriptional regulator that is released from the membrane when engagement of the cognate extracellular ligand induces intramembrane proteolysis. We find that chimeric forms of Notch, in which both the extracellular sensor module and the intracellular transcriptional module are replaced with heterologous protein domains, can serve as a general platform for generating novel cell-cell contact signaling pathways. Synthetic Notch (synNotch) pathways can drive user-defined functional responses in diverse mammalian cell types. Because individual synNotch pathways do not share common signaling intermediates, the pathways are functionally orthogonal. Thus, multiple synNotch receptors can be used in the same cell to achieve combinatorial integration of environmental cues, including Boolean response programs, multi-cellular signaling cascades, and self-organized cellular patterns. SynNotch receptors provide extraordinary flexibility in engineering cells with customized sensing/response behaviors to user-specified extracellular cues."
https://openalex.org/W2264578395,"Haplotyping of human chromosomes is a prerequisite for cataloguing the full repertoire of genetic variation. We present a microfluidics-based, linked-read sequencing technology that can phase and haplotype germline and cancer genomes using nanograms of input DNA. This high-throughput platform prepares barcoded libraries for short-read sequencing and computationally reconstructs long-range haplotype and structural variant information. We generate haplotype blocks in a nuclear trio that are concordant with expected inheritance patterns and phase a set of structural variants. We also resolve the structure of the EML4-ALK gene fusion in the NCI-H2228 cancer cell line using phased exome sequencing. Finally, we assign genetic aberrations to specific megabase-scale haplotypes generated from whole-genome sequencing of a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. This approach resolves haplotype information using up to 100 times less genomic DNA than some methods and enables the accurate detection of structural variants."
https://openalex.org/W2259709515,"Microbial pathogenesis studies are typically performed with reference strains, thereby overlooking within-species heterogeneity in microbial virulence. Here we integrated human epidemiological and clinical data with bacterial population genomics to harness the biodiversity of the model foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and decipher the basis of its neural and placental tropisms. Taking advantage of the clonal structure of this bacterial species, we identify clones epidemiologically associated either with food or with human central nervous system (CNS) or maternal-neonatal (MN) listeriosis. The latter clones are also most prevalent in patients without immunosuppressive comorbidities. Strikingly, CNS- and MN-associated clones are hypervirulent in a humanized mouse model of listeriosis. By integrating epidemiological data and comparative genomics, we have uncovered multiple new putative virulence factors and demonstrate experimentally the contribution of the first gene cluster mediating L. monocytogenes neural and placental tropisms. This study illustrates the exceptional power in harnessing microbial biodiversity to identify clinically relevant microbial virulence attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2253584908,"Many genetic liver diseases in newborns cause repeated, often lethal, metabolic crises. Gene therapy using nonintegrating viruses such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) is not optimal in this setting because the nonintegrating genome is lost as developing hepatocytes proliferate. We reasoned that newborn liver may be an ideal setting for AAV-mediated gene correction using CRISPR-Cas9. Here we intravenously infuse two AAVs, one expressing Cas9 and the other expressing a guide RNA and the donor DNA, into newborn mice with a partial deficiency in the urea cycle disorder enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC). This resulted in reversion of the mutation in 10% (6.7-20.1%) of hepatocytes and increased survival in mice challenged with a high-protein diet, which exacerbates disease. Gene correction in adult OTC-deficient mice was lower and accompanied by larger deletions that ablated residual expression from the endogenous OTC gene, leading to diminished protein tolerance and lethal hyperammonemia on a chow diet."
https://openalex.org/W2262448048,"Intestinal crypts display robust regeneration upon injury. The relatively rare secretory precursors can replace lost stem cells, but it is unknown if the abundant enterocyte progenitors that express the Alkaline phosphate intestinal (Alpi) gene also have this capacity. We created an Alpi-IRES-CreERT2 (Alpi(CreER)) knockin allele for lineage tracing. Marked clones consist entirely of enterocytes and are all lost from villus tips within days. Genetic fate-mapping of Alpi(+) cells before or during targeted ablation of Lgr5-expressing stem cells generated numerous long-lived crypt-villus ""ribbons,"" indicative of dedifferentiation of enterocyte precursors into Lgr5(+) stems. By single-cell analysis of dedifferentiating enterocytes, we observed the generation of Paneth-like cells and proliferative stem cells. We conclude that the highly proliferative, short-lived enterocyte precursors serve as a large reservoir of potential stem cells during crypt regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2268032794,"Translocation events are frequent in cancer and may create chimeric fusions or 'regulatory rearrangements' that drive oncogene overexpression. Here we identify super-enhancer translocations that drive overexpression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYB as a recurrent theme in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Whole-genome sequencing data and chromatin maps highlight distinct chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose super-enhancers to the MYB locus. Chromosome conformation capture confirms that the translocated enhancers interact with the MYB promoter. Remarkably, MYB protein binds to the translocated enhancers, creating a positive feedback loop that sustains its expression. MYB also binds enhancers that drive different regulatory programs in alternate cell lineages in ACC, cooperating with TP63 in myoepithelial cells and a Notch program in luminal epithelial cells. Bromodomain inhibitors slow tumor growth in ACC primagraft models in vivo. Thus, our study identifies super-enhancer translocations that drive MYB expression and provides insight into downstream MYB functions in alternate ACC lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2268489608,"Soil-transmitted nematodes, including the Strongyloides genus, cause one of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases. Here we compare the genomes of four Strongyloides species, including the human pathogen Strongyloides stercoralis, and their close relatives that are facultatively parasitic (Parastrongyloides trichosuri) and free-living (Rhabditophanes sp. KR3021). A significant paralogous expansion of key gene families--families encoding astacin-like and SCP/TAPS proteins--is associated with the evolution of parasitism in this clade. Exploiting the unique Strongyloides life cycle, we compare the transcriptomes of the parasitic and free-living stages and find that these same gene families are upregulated in the parasitic stages, underscoring their role in nematode parasitism."
https://openalex.org/W2253416145,"β-Arrestins critically regulate G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling, not only 'arresting' the G protein signal but also modulating endocytosis and initiating a discrete G-protein-independent signal through MAP kinase. Despite enormous recent progress towards understanding biophysical aspects of arrestin function, arrestin cell biology remains relatively poorly understood. Two key tenets underlie the prevailing current view: β-arrestin accumulates in clathrin-coated structures (CCSs) exclusively in physical complex with its activating GPCR, and MAP kinase activation requires endocytosis of formed GPCR-β-arrestin complexes. We show here, using β1-adrenergic receptors, that β-arrestin-2 (arrestin 3) accumulates robustly in CCSs after dissociating from its activating GPCR and transduces the MAP kinase signal from CCSs. Moreover, inhibiting subsequent endocytosis of CCSs enhances the clathrin- and β-arrestin-dependent MAP kinase signal. These results demonstrate β-arrestin 'activation at a distance', after dissociating from its activating GPCR, and signalling from CCSs. We propose a β-arrestin signalling cycle that is catalytically activated by the GPCR and energetically coupled to the endocytic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2271752557,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of devastating neurodevelopmental syndromes that affect up to 1 in 68 children. Despite advances in the identification of ASD risk genes, the mechanisms underlying ASDs remain unknown. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in Contactin Associated Protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) are strongly linked to ASDs. Here we investigate the function of Cntnap2 and undertake pharmacological screens to identify phenotypic suppressors. We find that zebrafish cntnap2 mutants display GABAergic deficits, particularly in the forebrain, and sensitivity to drug-induced seizures. High-throughput behavioral profiling identifies nighttime hyperactivity in cntnap2 mutants, while pharmacological testing reveals dysregulation of GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. Finally, we find that estrogen receptor agonists elicit a behavioral fingerprint anti-correlative to that of cntnap2 mutants and show that the phytoestrogen biochanin A specifically reverses the mutant behavioral phenotype. These results identify estrogenic compounds as phenotypic suppressors and illuminate novel pharmacological pathways with relevance to autism."
https://openalex.org/W2265483245,"Movement suppression in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is thought to arise from increased efficacy of the indirect pathway basal ganglia circuit, relative to the direct pathway. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. To examine whether changes in the strength of synaptic inputs to these circuits contribute to this imbalance, we obtained paired whole-cell recordings from striatal direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs) and optically stimulated inputs from sensorimotor cortex or intralaminar thalamus in brain slices from control and dopamine-depleted mice. We found that dopamine depletion selectively decreased synaptic strength at thalamic inputs to dMSNs, suggesting that thalamus drives asymmetric activation of basal ganglia circuitry underlying parkinsonian motor impairments. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vivo chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition of thalamostriatal terminals reversed motor deficits in dopamine-depleted mice. These results implicate thalamostriatal projections in the pathophysiology of PD and support interventions targeting thalamus as a potential therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2265101850,"José Luis Gómez-Skarmeta, Hector Escrivá, Ignacio Maeso, Damien Devos and colleagues perform 4C-seq profiling of the Hox cluster in amphioxus embryos and find that, unlike in vertebrate embryos, the cluster is organized into a single chromatin interaction domain. They suggest that the vertebrate Hox bipartite regulatory system is an evolutionary novelty. The HoxA and HoxD gene clusters of jawed vertebrates are organized into bipartite three-dimensional chromatin structures that separate long-range regulatory inputs coming from the anterior and posterior Hox-neighboring regions1. This architecture is instrumental in allowing vertebrate Hox genes to pattern disparate parts of the body, including limbs2. Almost nothing is known about how these three-dimensional topologies originated. Here we perform extensive 4C-seq profiling of the Hox cluster in embryos of amphioxus, an invertebrate chordate. We find that, in contrast to the architecture in vertebrates, the amphioxus Hox cluster is organized into a single chromatin interaction domain that includes long-range contacts mostly from the anterior side, bringing distant cis-regulatory elements into contact with Hox genes. We infer that the vertebrate Hox bipartite regulatory system is an evolutionary novelty generated by combining ancient long-range regulatory contacts from DNA in the anterior Hox neighborhood with new regulatory inputs from the posterior side."
https://openalex.org/W2269786471,"There is much speculation on which hypervariable region provides the highest bacterial specificity in 16S rRNA sequencing. The optimum solution to prevent bias and to obtain a comprehensive view of complex bacterial communities would be to sequence the entire 16S rRNA gene; however, this is not possible with second generation standard library design and short-read next-generation sequencing technology.This paper examines a new process using seven hypervariable or V regions of the 16S rRNA (six amplicons: V2, V3, V4, V6-7, V8, and V9) processed simultaneously on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Four mock samples were amplified using the 16S Ion Metagenomics Kit™ (Life Technologies) and their sequencing data is subjected to a novel analytical pipeline.Results are presented at family and genus level. The Kullback-Leibler divergence (DKL), a measure of the departure of the computed from the nominal bacterial distribution in the mock samples, was used to infer which region performed best at the family and genus levels. Three different hypervariable regions, V2, V4, and V6-7, produced the lowest divergence compared to the known mock sample. The V9 region gave the highest (worst) average DKL while the V4 gave the lowest (best) average DKL. In addition to having a high DKL, the V9 region in both the forward and reverse directions performed the worst finding only 17% and 53% of the known family level and 12% and 47% of the genus level bacteria, while results from the forward and reverse V4 region identified all 17 family level bacteria.The results of our analysis have shown that our sequencing methods using 6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA and subsequent analysis is valid. This method also allowed for the assessment of how well each of the variable regions might perform simultaneously. Our findings will provide the basis for future work intended to assess microbial abundance at different time points throughout a clinical protocol."

The current study set out to examine the performance of seven individuals with extraordinary face recognition memory, so called “super recognisers” (SRs), on two face matching tasks resembling border control identity checks. In Experiment 1, the SRs as a group outperformed control participants on the “Glasgow Face Matching Test”, and some case-by-case comparisons also reached significance. In Experiment 2, a perceptually difficult face matching task was used: the “Models Face Matching Test”. Once again, SRs outperformed controls both on group and mostly in case-by-case analyses. These findings suggest that SRs are considerably better at face matching than typical perceivers, and would make proficient personnel for border control agencies."
https://openalex.org/W2269697848,"Whereas human dendritic cells (DCs) are largely resistant to productive infection with HIV-1, they have a unique ability to take up the virus and transmit it efficiently to T lymphocytes through a process of trans-infection or trans-enhancement. To elucidate the molecular and cell biological mechanism for trans-enhancement, we performed an shRNA screen of several hundred genes involved in organelle and membrane trafficking in immature human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). We identified TSPAN7 and DNM2, which control actin nucleation and stabilization, as having important and distinct roles in limiting HIV-1 endocytosis and in maintaining virus particles on dendrites, which is required for efficient transfer to T lymphocytes. Further characterization of this process may provide insights not only into the role of DCs in transmission and dissemination of HIV-1 but also more broadly into mechanisms controlling capture and internalization of pathogens."

Developmental processes involve interactions of multiple germ layers, tissues, and organs (Arnold and Robertson, 2009Arnold S.J. Robertson E.J.

Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), providing optimal environments in which cells grow and differentiate. During developmental progression, cells often migrate from one niche to another, before they reach their “home” tissue (Richardson and Lehmann, 2010Richardson B.E. Lehmann R. Mechanisms guiding primordial germ cell migration: strategies from different organisms.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Discovering what types of factors are implicated in such a complicated mechanism is important for understanding how specific cells are properly regulated. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) migrate to various sites during development before reaching the bone marrow (BM), where they reside during adulthood (Mikkola and Orkin, 2006Mikkola H.K. Orkin S.H. The journey of developing hematopoietic stem cells.Development. 2006; 133: 3733-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). HSCs resident in the adult BM are predominantly maintained in a dormant state, protecting them from accumulating damages and allowing them to support blood production for an entire lifespan (Morrison and Spradling, 2008Morrison S.J. Spradling A.C. Stem cells and niches: mechanisms that promote stem cell maintenance throughout life.Cell. 2008; 132: 598-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). For this reason, HSCs have the lowest protein synthesis rate within the blood hierarchy of the BM (Signer et al., 2014Signer R.A.J. Magee J.A. Salic A. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Our previous work demonstrated that HSCs have lower tolerance to stress triggered by un- or mis-folded proteins, so-called endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Walter and Ron, 2011Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar), upon enhanced growth conditions during ex vivo culture (Miharada et al., 2014Miharada K. Sigurdsson V. Karlsson S. Dppa5 improves reconstitution capacity of hematopoietic stem cells by reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress.Cell Rep. 2014; 468: 653-658Google Scholar). An increase in abnormal proteins initially activates signals enhancing protein folding and degradation of un- or mis-folded proteins (survival signals), and severe and continuous stress triggers the apoptotic pathway (death signal) (Walter and Ron, 2011Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar). ER stress was preferentially and rapidly elevated in HSCs, and the addition of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a specific bile acid (BA) known as a chemical chaperone (Özcan et al., 2006Özcan U. Yilmaz E. Ozcan L. Furuhashi M. Vaillancourt E. Smith R.O. Görgün C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Chemical chaperones reduce ER stress and restore glucose homeostasis in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar), maintained functional HSCs in vitro by reducing ER stress levels (Miharada et al., 2014Miharada K. Sigurdsson V. Karlsson S. Dppa5 improves reconstitution capacity of hematopoietic stem cells by reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress.Cell Rep. 2014; 468: 653-658Google Scholar). This higher sensitivity to ER stress may contribute to the integrity of the stem cell pool by selectively removing damaged HSCs (van Galen et al., 2014van Galen P. Kreso A. Mbong N. Kent D.G. Fitzmaurice T. Chambers J.E. Xie S. Laurenti E. Hermans K. Eppert K. et al.The unfolded protein response governs integrity of the haematopoietic stem-cell pool during stress.Nature. 2014; 510: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the adult, HSCs actively expand during development in the fetal liver (FL) (Ema and Nakauchi, 2000Ema H. Nakauchi H. Expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in the developing liver of a mouse embryo.Blood. 2000; 95: 2284-2288PubMed Google Scholar), with no apparent triggering of ER-stress related signals. However, the mechanisms enabling HSCs to deal with the higher protein-folding requirement during the expansion phase are altogether unknown. BAs, the active components of bile, are almost exclusively known for their role in lipid absorption and cholesterol catabolism (Hofmann, 1999Hofmann A.F. The continuing importance of bile acids in liver and intestinal disease.Arch. Intern. Med. 1999; 159: 2647-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). However, studies have also reported additional roles in metabolism and signal transduction and as chemical chaperones (Watanabe et al., 2006Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. et al.Bile acids induce energy expenditure by promoting intracellular thyroid hormone activation.Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, Nguyen and Bouscarel, 2008Nguyen A.

Pleiotropic roles of bile acids in metabolism.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BA is already detected in the FL during HSC expansion (Nakagawa and Setchell, 1990Nakagawa M. Setchell K.D. Bile acid metabolism in early life: studies of amniotic fluid.J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Itoh and Onishi, 2000Itoh S. Onishi S. Hepatic taurine, glycine and individual bile acids in early human fetus.Early Hum. Dev. 2000; 57: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), although its role is unknown. In addition, at this stage, the FL contains no bile duct structures separating blood and bile flow (Strazzabosco and Fabris, 2012Strazzabosco M. Fabris L. Development of the bile ducts: essentials for the clinical hepatologist.J. Hepatol. 2012; 56: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), resulting in an exposure of hematopoietic cells to BAs. In this work we have discovered a previously unknown role for BAs in developing FL. Our results show that expanding FL-HSCs have an increased level of protein synthesis and that BAs inhibit the elevation of ER stress signals through blocking production of aggregated or un- or mis-folded proteins. The work implies that BAs have a novel role in the FL, enabling higher protein synthesis without stress activation and thus heavily contributing to HSC expansion. Although the expansion of HSCs in FL has been well described (Ema and Nakauchi, 2000Ema H. Nakauchi H. Expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in the developing liver of a mouse embryo.Blood. 2000; 95: 2284-2288PubMed Google Scholar), it has remained unknown whether they also elevate protein production during this process. We measured the protein synthesis rate in HSCs derived from FL (FL-HSCs) using O-propargyl-puromycin (OP-Puro) (Liu et al., 2012Liu J. Xu Y. Stoleru D. Salic A. Imaging protein synthesis in cells and tissues with an alkyne analog of puromycin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2012; 109: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) incorporation in pregnant mice. Previous work reported that the protein synthesis rate in HSCs derived from BM was only half compared with other populations (Signer et al., 2014Signer R.A.J. Magee J.A. Salic A. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, FL-HSCs showed comparable or higher intensity of OP-Puro, when compared with total cells in FL (Figure 1A). This suggests that protein synthesis in FL-HSCs is comparable with other populations and relatively higher than BM-HSCs. Despite the increased protein production, during the expansion period (E12.5–E15.5), FL-HSCs exhibit a lower expression of ER stress response genes when compared with adult BM-HSCs (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1A). It has also been reported that ER stress signals and subsequent enhancement of the secretion capacity support growth, differentiation, and maturation of various types of cells (Iwawaki et al., 2009Iwawaki T. Akai R. Yamanaka S. Kohno K. Function of IRE1 alpha in the placenta is essential for placental development and embryonic viability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2009; 106: 16657-16662Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Saito et al., 2009Saito A. Hino S. Murakami T. Kanemoto S. Kondo S. Saitoh M. Nishimura R. Yoneda T. Furuichi T. Ikegawa S. et al.Regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response by a BBF2H7-mediated Sec23a pathway is essential for chondrogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, this is not the case for HSCs, as both ER stress levels and the secretory pathways are not increased or enhanced in expanding FL-HSCs (Figure 1D; Table S1B). Activated cells that are continuously expanding generally have high expression of ER chaperones (Luo and Lee, 2013Luo B. Lee A.S. The critical roles of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones and unfolded protein response in tumorigenesis and anticancer therapies.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In turn, ER chaperones provide cells with a larger capacity for protein folding and also reduce the frequency of un- or mis-folded proteins and subsequent triggering of ER stress signals. Seemingly this is not the case in FL-HSCs, as they do not show increased expression of ER chaperones (Figure 1E; Table S1C), suggesting that alternative machineries are implicated in the ER stress regulation of FL-HSCs. BAs are synthesized from cholesterol by several key enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily in liver (primary BA) (Lorbek et al., 2012Lorbek G. Lewinska M. Rozman D. Cytochrome P450s in the synthesis of cholesterol and bile acids--from mouse models to human diseases.FEBS J. 2012; 279: 1516-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One of the key enzymes in primary BA biosynthesis is CYP7A1, catalyzing the first step of the classical pathway. The derivative produced is then either converted to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or used to produce another major component, cholic acid (CA), through the function of CYP8B1. In addition to being involved in a late step of the classical pathway, CYP27A1 governs the first step of an alternative pathway (the acidic pathway) by initiating a process independent of CYP7A1 that can produce CDCA. Furthermore, mice and rats have a rodent-specific synthetic pathway that produces muricholic acid (Figure 1F), and BAs can exist conjugated to either glycine or taurine. Primary BAs are then converted to other BAs by intestinal bacteria (secondary BA) (Hofmann, 1999Hofmann A.F. The continuing importance of bile acids in liver and intestinal disease.Arch. Intern. Med. 1999; 159: 2647-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), which therefore require implication of adult tissues. During the HSC expansion period, the FL is largely different from adult liver (AL), as the majority of the cells are hematopoietic. In FL, Cyp8b1 and Cyp27a1 are expressed at relatively higher levels than in AL, while Cyp7a1 is lower (Figure S1A). To characterize the composition of adult and fetal BAs, we performed mass spectrometry analyses. The results showed that the main proportion of mouse fetal BA was taurocholic acid (TCA), and all BAs in the FL were taurine conjugated, while only 30% was taurine-conjugated form in the AL (Figures 1G, 1H, S1B, and S1C). Unexpectedly, we also detected secondary BAs (e.g., taurodeoxycholic acid) in the FL samples, suggesting that fetal BA may be mixture of fetal and maternal BAs. To address whether the quantity of BA affect HSC expansion in FL, we inhibited the biosynthesis of BA. The expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 is tightly regulated by the farnesoid X nuclear receptor (FXR), which has a negative feedback loop when overproduced BAs bind to FXR, resulting in downregulation of these two enzymes (Figure 1F) (Lorbek et al., 2012Lorbek G. Lewinska M. Rozman D. Cytochrome P450s in the synthesis of cholesterol and bile acids--from mouse models to human diseases.FEBS J. 2012; 279: 1516-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The chemical agonist GW4064 also binds to FXR, resulting in decreased BA synthesis through a pseudo feedback signal (Watanabe et al., 2011Watanabe M. Horai Y. Houten S.M. Morimoto K. Sugizaki T. Arita E. Mataki C. Sato H. Tanigawara Y. Schoonjans K. et al.Lowering bile acid pool size with a synthetic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist induces obesity and diabetes through reduced energy expenditure.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26913-26920Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In our study, pregnant mice were intravenously injected with either GW4064 (2.5 mg/kg) or vehicle alone on a daily basis from E10.5–E15.5, and the fetuses were subjected to analyses (Figure 2A). Quantitative mass spectrometry demonstrated that GW4064 significantly reduced the quantity of BAs in FL, particularly TCA (Figures 2B and S2A). Fetuses derived from GW4064 treated mothers showed slightly smaller size (Figures S2B and S2C) and significantly reduced FL cellularity (Figure S2D). Flow cytometry analyses revealed that the frequency of Lineage− (Lin−) cells, representing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), were significantly decreased, while Lineage+ (Lin+) cells were increased. In contrast, erythroid cells and non-hematopoietic cells remained unchanged (Figures 2C and 2D). The number of Lin− cells, c-kit+Sca-I+Lineage− (KSL) cells and CD150+CD48−KSL cells (HSCs) in FL were also significantly decreased upon GW4064 treatment (Figure S2E), while the numbers of HSCs in BM of the mothers were not affected (Figure S2F). We hypothesized that lowered BA production would induce higher ER stress levels, so intracellular staining of ER stress response genes was performed. Flow cytometry analyses showed elevated GRP78, spliced XBP-1, and CHOP (Figure 2E). To further confirm that the ER stress signaling pathway is implicated in the response to decreased BA levels, we utilized CHOP knockout (KO) mice (Zinszner et al., 1998Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). CHOP KO cells have an attenuated ER stress response, as treatment with tunicamycin (an ER stress inducer) shows diminished levels of apoptotic cells (Li et al., 2009Li G. Mongillo M. Chin K.T. Harding H. Ron D. Marks A.R. Tabas I. Role of ERO1-α-mediated stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor activity in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). GW4064 was injected into pregnant wild-type (WT) or CHOP KO mice and FL were analyzed. The number of HSCs in the FL of WT mice treated with GW4064 was significantly reduced, while c-kit+ cells were unchanged. In contrast, numbers of FL-HSCs in the CHOP KO fetuses treated with vehicle were slightly lower than WT, but not affected by GW4064 injection (Figure 2F). The results clearly showed that the ER stress pathway, in particular the severe signal mediated by CHOP, was involved when the level of BA was reduced. We also confirmed that GW4064 lowering of BA induces apoptosis in FL cells (Figure S2G). To confirm that the effects of GW4064 treatment were due to decreased BA production and subsequent elevation of ER stress levels, two types of rescue experiments were performed: (1) the effect of reduced BA levels on HSPC number was rescued by supplementation of TCA, and (2) a connection to the ER stress signaling pathway was confirmed using salubrinal, an inhibitor of ER stress-induced apoptosis (Boyce et al., 2005Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. A selective inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation protects cells from ER stress.Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Mass spectrometry confirmed that intraperitoneal injection of TCA robustly compensated the effect of GW4064 treatment on reduced endogenous BA level (Figures 2B and S2A). Unexpectedly, TCA treatment also increased other types of Bas, including secondary BA, possibly because of the enhancement of maternal BA production. Analyses of FL showed that the cellularity was rescued by both TCA and salubrinal, while the decreased body weight was not rescued (Figures 2G and 2H), suggesting that the decrease in fetal weight was not related to reduced BA levels. Flow cytometry analyses revealed that the decrease in the number of stem/progenitor cells was ameliorated (Figure 2I). GW4064 injection resulted in a high ratio of apoptotic cells within the FL-HSPCs (Figure S2G) that was rescued by co-injection of TCA or salubrinal, resulting in significantly lower levels of apoptotic cells (Figure 2J). Finally, we evaluated the number of functional HSCs in the FL using in vivo limiting dilution assay. We observed that reduction of BA levels using GW4064 significantly decreased the frequency of HSCs and that both TCA and salubrinal fully rescued the number of functional FL-HSCs (Figure 2K). These findings strongly suggest that the reduction of HSPCs was caused by ER stress-associated apoptosis, due to reduced BA levels. Because GW4064 inhibits the classic pathway through indirectly targeting CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, but not CYP27A1, we analyzed Cyp27a1 KO (Cyp27a1−/−) mice (Rosen et al., 1998Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Björkhem I. Leitersdorf E. Markedly reduced bile acid synthesis but maintained levels of cholesterol and vitamin D metabolites in mice with disrupted sterol 27-hydroxylase gene.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that lack both classical and acidic pathways, resulting in severe reduction of BA. Deletion of CYP27A1 in humans is known to be the cause of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, caused by the deposition of cholesterol (Cali et al., 1991Cali J.J. Hsieh C.L. Francke U. Russell D.W. Mutations in the bile acid biosynthetic enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase underlie cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7779-7783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyp27a1−/− mice show reduced BA synthesis in AL, while levels of cholesterol and vitamin D are normal (Rosen et al., 1998Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Björkhem I. Leitersdorf E. Markedly reduced bile acid synthesis but maintained levels of cholesterol and vitamin D metabolites in mice with disrupted sterol 27-hydroxylase gene.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), but no observations have been reported about the hematopoietic system. We have seen that production of BAs in Cyp27a1−/− adult mice was profoundly impaired, even in pregnant mice (Figures S3A and S3B), but profiling of BM cells did not show any major differences (Figures S3C–S3E). Because previous experiments showed that secondary BAs, derived from the mother, could be detected in FL (Figures 1G, S1B, and S1C), we hypothesized that maternal BAs may also contribute to fetal development. In order to address this, we crossed heterozygous males and heterozygous females but also heterozygous males and homozygous females in order to create a more severe environment in which fetuses develop in low levels of BAs (Figure 3A). Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that deletion of Cyp27a1 in fetuses had a very minor effect on BA levels of the fetuses in heterozygous mothers, while fetuses from homozygous mothers showed severely and significantly reduced levels of BA (Figures 3B and S3F). Additionally, embryos that developed in homozygous mothers did not have any detectable secondary BA in FL (Figures 3B and S3F). This strongly suggests that maternal BAs go to the fetus during development. Fetuses lacking Cyp27a1 derived from heterozygous male and female mice developed normally, and cellularity of FL did not show significant changes (Figures 3C–3E). In contrast, Cyp27a1−/− fetuses developed in homozygous mothers displayed smaller livers, and the cellularity was significantly lower (Figures 3C and 3D). Of note, body weight of fetuses from heterozygous and homozygous mothers did not show any significant differences, further confirming that reduced body weight seen with GW4064 treatment was not connected to reduced BA levels (Figure 3E). To further analyze the effect of Cyp27a1 deletion on hematopoietic cell development, FL derived from each genotype were subjected to flow cytometry analyses. Absolute numbers of phenotypic HSPCs were significantly decreased in Cyp27a1−/− fetuses derived from homozygous mothers, while Cyp27a1−/− fetuses derived from heterozygous mothers did not show significant changes in any population (Figure 3F). Of note, absolute number of phenotypic HSCs in Cyp27a1+/− fetuses developed in homozygous mothers was also significantly reduced (Figure 3G). Intracellular staining showed significantly higher levels of CHOP expression in HSCs derived from Cyp27a1−/− fetuses in homozygous mothers (Figure 3G) and annexin-V assay revealed higher proportion of apoptotic cells (Figure 3H). These findings suggest that in FL both maternal and fetal BAs contribute to support HSPCs. The number of functional HSCs was determined using in vivo limiting dilution assay, and the results showed that Cyp27a1−/− FL-HSCs from homozygous mothers contained significantly lower number of HSCs (Figure 3I). To further confirm the implication of ER stress signals in the reduction of HSC number, salubrinal was injected to pregnant Cyp27a1−/− female mice. As expected, the defect in cellularity of FL and the number of HSPCs were rescued (Figures 3C–3I). Taken together, reduced BA levels in the FL environment induce elevated ER stress that leads to apoptotic cell death, preferentially in HSCs. Although the effect of reduced BA levels on the number of HSCs in vivo was clarified, the mechanism of BA function still remained elusive. Because taurine-conjugated BAs are mainly transported into the cytosol via transporters, but not by diffusion (Halilbasic et al., 2013Halilbasic E. Claudel T. Trauner M. Bile acid transporters and regulatory nuclear receptors in the liver and beyond.J. Hepatol. 2013; 58: 155-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we tested whether BAs are taken up by hematopoietic cells. FL-HSPCs were incubated with tritium (3H)-labeled TCA (van der Mark et al., 2014van der Mark V.A. de Waart D.R. Ho-Mok K.S. Tabbers M.M. Voogt H.W. Oude Elferink R.P. Knisely A.S. Paulusma C.C. The lipid flippase heterodimer ATP8B1-CDC50A is essential for surface expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (SLC10A2/ASBT) in intestinal Caco-2 cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1842: 2378-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and uptake was measured using a scintillation counter. 3H-TCA was rapidly taken up by both BM (not shown) and FL-HSPCs within 10 min, indicating the existence of active transporters of BA on hematopoietic cells (Figure 4A). The intracellular level of 3H-TCA was decreased upon the addition of various non-labeled BAs, suggesting that these BAs were competitively transported to FL-HSPCs without specific affinity for one BA compared with another (Figure 4B). The primary function of BA is to act as a detergent for effective absorption of dietary fats and vitamins. However, our previous work identified TUDCA as a potential factor that maintains functional HSCs in vitro through ER stress reduction (Miharada et al., 2014Miharada K. Sigurdsson V. Karlsson S. Dppa5 improves reconstitution capacity of hematopoietic stem cells by reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress.Cell Rep. 2014; 468: 653-658Google Scholar), possibly mediated by its chemical chaperone properties (Özcan et al., 2006Özcan U. Yilmaz E. Ozcan L. Furuhashi M. Vaillancourt E. Smith R.O. Görgün C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Chemical chaperones reduce ER stress and restore glucose homeostasis in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that TCA and TUDCA may be working through a similar chaperone mechanism in expanding FL-HSPCs. Initially, we tested the basic ability of different BAs to prevent protein aggregation in a cell free assay. All BAs we tested, including TCA and TUDCA, showed inhibitory abilities on protein aggregation (Figure S4A). Accumulation of abnormal proteins and protein aggregates is known to occur in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases (Scheper and Hoozemans, 2009Scheper W. Hoozemans J.J. Endoplasmic reticulum protein quality control in neurodegenerative disease: the good, the bad and the therapy.Curr. Med. Chem. 2009; 16: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There is also a connection between protein aggregates and activation of ER stress-induced apoptosis in these diseases (Scheper and Hoozemans, 2009Scheper W. Hoozemans J.J. Endoplasmic reticulum protein quality control in neurodegenerative disease: the good, the bad and the therapy.Curr. Med. Chem. 2009; 16: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the effect of protein aggregation in HSCs has not been studied. To assess whether BAs can block the formation of protein aggregates upon cell culture, we measured the levels of cytosolic aggregated proteins (aggresomes) in TCA and TUDCA treated FL-HSPCs using ProteoStat staining (Bershtein et al., 2013Bershtein S. Mu W. Serohijos A.W. Zhou J. Shakhnovich E.I. Protein quality control acts on folding intermediates to shape the effects of mutations on organismal fitness.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, resulting in high levels of aggregated proteins. We defined the clear peak appearing upon MG-132 treatment as the ProteoStat-high population (Figure 4C). In vitro cell culture conditions quickly increased the level of aggregated proteins in FL cells, which was most pronounced within the HSC population, although TCA and TUDCA significantly diminished this increase (Figure 4D). Consistent with these findings, fresh FL-HSCs from Cyp27a1−/− fetuses derived from homozygous mothers showed significantly higher levels of protein aggregation, while other genotypes showed a slight increase or no increase at all (Figure 4E). Finally, we confirmed whether different BAs can maintain HSC capacity by transplantation of HSCs after in vitro culture (Figure 4F). Similar to our previous work using BM-HSC"

Although the mechanisms underlying cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activation, which triggers mitotic entry, have been extensively studied, the regulatory mechanisms that couple CDK1-cyclin B activity to chromosome stability are not well understood. Here, we identified a signaling axis in which Aurora B activity is modulated by CDK1-cyclin B via the acetyltransferase TIP60 in human cell division. CDK1-cyclin B phosphorylates Ser90 of TIP60, which elicits TIP60-dependent acetylation of Aurora B and promotes accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. Mechanistically, TIP60 acetylation of Aurora B at Lys215 protects Aurora B's activation loop from dephosphorylation by the phosphatase PP2A to ensure a robust, error-free metaphase-anaphase transition. These findings delineate a conserved signaling cascade that integrates protein phosphorylation and acetylation with cell cycle progression for maintenance of genomic stability."

Wnt signaling is implicated in both maintenance and differentiation of adult stem/progenitor cells, yet how this pathway serves these dichotomous roles remains enigmatic.

These studies identify a novel intersection of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in adult progenitor cell differentiation that has important implications for targeting β-catenin to modulate adult progenitor cell behavior in disease. Activation of endogenous somatic stem/progenitor cells is required for both normal homeostasis and repair of damaged tissues and organs. This fundamental process requires tight regulation of stem/progenitor cells to maintain the equilibrium between decisions for self-renewal and differentiation to produce daughter cells of a committed fate. Numerous critical signal transduction pathways are implicated in regulation of stem/progenitor cell fate during development and in the adult, including Wnt signaling. Stem/progenitor cells must integrate a complex array of environmental cues to arrive at a final decision regarding preservation of quiescence or cell cycle entry, and subsequent maintenance of progenitor status or differentiation. Aberrant regulation of cell fate decisions is associated with malignancy, fibrosis, and other disorders (1Kahn M. Symmetric division versus asymmetric division: a tale of two coactivators.Future Med. Chem. 2011; 3: 1745-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Elucidation of pathways that regulate normal adult progenitor cell differentiation is key to understanding the contribution of abnormal differentiation to disease pathogenesis. Wnt signaling is a developmental pathway that participates in maintenance and repair programs in the adult (2Logan C.Y. Nusse R. The Wnt signaling pathway in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Traditionally, Wnt signaling has been categorized as either “canonical” (β-catenin-dependent) or “non-canonical” (β-catenin independent). Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling leads to nuclear localization of β-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes (2Logan C.Y. Nusse R. The Wnt signaling pathway in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 3Komiya Y. Habas R. Wnt signal transduction pathways.Organogenesis. 2008; 4: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), whereas non-canonical Wnt signaling is mediated by alternative signal transduction pathways, including PKC (4Semenov M.V.

Although it is clear that β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling is important in regulation of stem/progenitor cell behavior, how this pathway serves dichotomous roles in stem/progenitor cell self-renewal/maintenance of potency versus differentiation remains somewhat elusive. β-Catenin recruits transcriptional co-activators cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) 6The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; hTEC, human tracheobronchial epithelial cell; NS, non-silencing; MLE, mouse lung epithelial; DM, differentiation medium; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; AEC, alveolar epithelial cell; qRT, quantitative RT; Rt, transepithelial electrical resistance. -binding protein (CBP) or the highly homologous co-activator p300 (E1A-binding protein, 300 kDa), as well as other components of the basal transcription machinery, to generate a transcriptionally active complex (2Logan C.Y.

Although p300 and CBP are often viewed as functionally redundant (as reviewed by Kalkhoven (7Kalkhoven E. CBP and p300: HATs for different occasions.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)), increasing evidence suggests that usage of either of these co-activators, within the context of β-catenin-dependent signaling, differentially regulates target gene expression leading to different functional outcomes (1Kahn M.

Based on studies in embryonic stem cells, we developed a model that highlights the distinct roles of co-activators CBP and p300 and provides a mechanistic basis to account for dichotomous behavior of Wnt/β-catenin-dependent signaling in controlling stem/progenitor cell function (8Emami K.H.

The critical feature of this model is that differential interactions between β-catenin and CBP or p300 activate transcriptional programs that promote either self-renewal or differentiation, respectively. How differential co-activator usage is controlled endogenously in adult stem/progenitor cell populations for normal tissue homeostasis and repair is unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate mechanisms regulating shifts in endogenous β-catenin interactions with CBP or p300 in coordination of adult epithelial progenitor/progeny relationships. To this end, we utilized in vitro models of distal and proximal adult lung epithelial progenitor cell differentiation: alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) and tracheal epithelial cells in primary culture, respectively. Distal lung AEC are comprised of type 2 (AT2) cells, cuboidal surfactant-producing cells, and type 1 (AT1) cells, large flat cells that provide the surface area for gas exchange (11Crapo J.D.

Transdifferentiation of AEC grown on polycarbonate inserts is monitored by development of transepithelial electrical resistance due to formation of tight junctions, concurrent with loss of AT2 (e.g. pro-surfactants A, B, and C (pro-SFTPA, -SFTPB, and -SFTPC)), and gain of AT1 (e.g. aquaporin-5 (AQP5), podoplanin (T1α), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and caveolin-1 (CAV1)) cell phenotypic markers. In the proximal airways, including the trachea and bronchi, epithelial basal cells marked by expression of transformation-related protein 63 (TRP-63 or p63) serve as progenitor cells (18Rock J.R.

Isolated tracheobronchial epithelial cells (hTEC) comprise a proliferative population of basal cells (19Horani A. Nath A. Wasserman M.G. Huang T. Brody S.L.

Primary cells from proximal and distal regions of the lung constitute ideal adult progenitor cell differentiation model systems, because temporally regulated differentiation is well documented and can be closely monitored by changes in expression of phenotypic markers. We describe a novel mechanism downstream of WNT5a/PKC that regulates the critical role of p300/β-catenin interaction in differentiation of both these adult epithelial progenitor cells. Studies in C2C12 myoblast to myocyte differentiation suggest that this paradigm can also be extended to differentiation of non-epithelial progenitors. Using AEC in vitro and Wnt5a−/− mice (21Li C. Xiao J. Hormi K. Borok Z. Minoo P. Wnt5a participates in distal lung morphogenesis.Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that specific β-catenin co-activator interactions are the result of posttranslational modification of p300 regulated by WNT5a/PKC, providing novel insight into the coordination of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in regulation of stem/progenitor cell maintenance versus differentiation. Rat AT2 (rAT2) cells were isolated as previously described (22Borok Z. Danto S.I. Zabski S.M. Crandall E.D.

IQ-1 (5–20 μm) or DMSO (vehicle control) was added to media from the time of plating through completion of the experiment. Media were changed on day 3 and subsequently every other day. PKC inhibitor Gö6983 (5 μm, EMD, San Diego, CA) or DMSO (vehicle control), or PKCζ pseudo substrate (50 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) or H2O (vehicle control) were added to media in the same manner as IQ-1, except media were changed on days 2 and 4. Dose responses to inhibitors were determined to assess efficacy and toxicity. Recombinant human WNT5a (100 ng/ml, STEMRD, Burlingame, CA) was added to freshly isolated rAT2 cells at the time of plating. Cell extracts were collected 24 h post-plating. Mouse lung epithelial (MLE-15) cells, an AT2-like cell line (J. Whitsett, University of Cincinnati), were cultivated in HITES medium (24Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C.

DMSO (vehicle control) or IQ-1 (10–20 μm) treatment was initiated ∼5 days after plating, concurrent with removal of apical fluid to establish an air-liquid interface, and replenished three times per week. hTEC were harvested for RNA isolation or immunofluorescence analysis on days 8 (early ciliated cell differentiation) and 24 (completed differentiation). C2C12 mouse myoblast cells (ATCC: CRL-1772) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at ≤70–80% confluence to minimize spontaneous differentiation. To differentiate C2C12 cells into myotubes, cells were seeded into 10-cm or 6-well plates at 50% confluence in normal growth medium and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight. Subsequently, normal growth medium was aspirated and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) and incubated in differentiation medium (DMEM, 2% horse serum, and penicillin/streptomycin) for 5 days to induce myotube formation. IQ-1 (5 μm) or ICG-001 (10 μm) was added to appropriate media, which were changed every other day. Animals were maintained according to an approved IACUC protocol. Timed matings were set up between Wnt5a-heterozygous mice to generate homozygotes (21Li C. Xiao J. Hormi K. Borok Z. Minoo P. Wnt5a participates in distal lung morphogenesis.Dev.

Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for measurement of firefly luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Values were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity for transfection efficiency and empty vector or no vector controls. pCDNA3.1 and pCDNA3.1-p300 wild-type vectors were provided by D. Livingston (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School), and pCDNA3.1-p300 S89A was generated using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Cedar Creek, TX). The lentivirus backbone vectors pGIPZ, engineered to contain p300 or non-silencing (NS) shRNA, or PLKO.1, engineered to contain Wnt5a, Cbp, or non-silencing (NS) shRNA (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO), and packaging plasmids pCMVΔ8.91 and pMD2.G, were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. Virus was concentrated with PEG-itTM virus precipitation solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) and titered with HIV p24 ELISA (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA). Viral titers were on the order of 108 transducing units/ml. Freshly isolated rAT2 cells were plated on 24-well BD Primaria (BD Biosciences) plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. On day 2, AEC were transduced with control pGIPZ or PLKO.1 non-silencing control, p300, or CBP shRNA-expressing lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection of 60 to obtain transduction efficiencies of ∼70–80%. E10 cells were plated at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well on 12-well plates (or 106 cells/100-mm dish) 1 day prior to transduction with pLKO.1 non-silencing control or pLKO.1 Wnt5a shRNA lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5.

Protein was extracted from cells in 2% SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) for studies of protein phosphorylation. Protein concentrations were measured using DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and all total protein amounts were equally loaded prior to SDS-PAGE gel separation. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto ImmunoBlot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), followed by blocking in 5% nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for phosphoantibodies. Primary antibodies (Abs) included rabbit anti-AQP5 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) -p300, -CBP, -Ser(P)-89, -Lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), -RAGE, -CAV-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), -pan phospho-PKC (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), -T1α (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), -AQP5, pro-SFTPC (Millipore, Temecula, CA), and mouse anti-p300/CBP (NM11) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), -GAPDH (Life Technologies), and -β-catenin (Sigma). Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-IgG conjugates (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature. Complexes were visualized by West Femto Super Sensitivity Kit (Thermo Scientific) with a FluorChem 8900 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Precision Plus ProteinTM Dual Color Standards (Bio-Rad) were used to assess molecular weight of bands. Location of standards are noted on Western blot figures. Rat AT2 cells or hTEC grown on polycarbonate filters were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS (pH 7.2). E18.5 mouse lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Filters and de-paraffinized slides were subjected to antigen retrieval using citric acid-based Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), blocked in CAS block (Life Technologies), and incubated with rabbit anti-AQP5 (Millipore or Alomone Labs) or anti-pro-SFTPC (Seven Hills, Cincinnati, OH), mouse anti-acetylated α-tubulin (Clone 6-11-B1, Sigma) and anti-SCGB1A1 (B.

After washing, filters were incubated with biotin-labeled secondary Abs, followed by incubation with Avidin DCS FITC (Vector Laboratories) or with Alexa Fluor® Dye-labeled secondary Abs (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). C2C12 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes. After treatment, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol, blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS containing 2% Triton X-100, incubated with anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) (K-16) Ab (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C, and incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG H&L Alexa Fluor® 568 (Life Technologies) at room temperature for 1 h. Filters and coverslips were mounted on slides with media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories) to counterstain DNA. Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope equipped with a DS-Qi1Mc camera (Melville, NY) (for AEC), a Leica DM5000 microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) with a Retiga 200R charge-coupled device camera (Q-Imaging, Surrey, Canada) interfaced with Q-Capture Pro software (Q-Imaging) (for hTEC) or a Leica DM6000 fluorescent microscope with a Leica DFC360 FX Monochrome Digital Camera (for C2C12 cells). Images were uniformly adjusted for brightness and contrast using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies) and DNase treated for 30 min using Turbo-DNase-free (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA was synthesized using the First Strand Synthesis Kit III (Life Technologies) or qScriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). qPCR was performed with the ABI 7900-HT Fast Real-time PCR System or the Bio-Rad MyiQ Thermal Cycler using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems or Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD, respectively). Primer sequences are available upon request. Data were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method. Rat AT2 cells were grown on Primaria 6-well plates (BD Biosciences) and nuclear extracts were collected at days 2 and 6 using the ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction Kit (EMD) or NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 150–200 μg of nuclear extract was diluted in PBB (20 mm HEPES, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) or co-IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA), respectively, both containing protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem). Diluted lysate was pre-cleared for 2 h and incubated overnight with 2 μg of rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-p300 or -CBP antibodies (Santa Cruz), or 5 μg of rabbit anti-Ser(P)-89 p300 Ab (Santa Cruz). Proteins were immunoprecipitated using protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz), washed 5× in PBB buffer, and collected by boiling beads in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to Western analysis. Statistical analysis was performed utilizing Prism Statistical software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. with n being the number of biological replicates used in statistical analysis. p values were calculated using one-way analysis of variance or unpaired Student's t tests compared with a hypothetical value. To investigate the dynamics of interactions between endogenous β-catenin and co-activators p300 and CBP during transdifferentiation from an AT2 to AT1 cell-like phenotype, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using nuclear extracts from AEC harvested early (day 2; AT2 cell-like) and late (day 6; AT1 cell-like) in primary culture (22Borok Z.

https://openalex.org/W2273569821,"Recurrent, reciprocal genomic disorders resulting from non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between near-identical segmental duplications (SDs) are a major cause of human disease, often producing phenotypically distinct syndromes. The genomic architecture of flanking SDs presents a challenge for modeling these syndromes; however, the capability to efficiently generate reciprocal copy number variants (CNVs) that mimic NAHR would represent a valuable modeling tool. We describe here a CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering method, single-guide CRISPR/Cas targeting of repetitive elements (SCORE), to model reciprocal genomic disorders and demonstrate its capabilities by generating reciprocal CNVs of 16p11.2 and 15q13.3, including alteration of one copy-equivalent of the SDs that mediate NAHR in vivo. The method is reproducible, and RNA sequencing reliably clusters transcriptional signatures from human subjects with in vivo CNVs and their corresponding in vitro models. This new approach will provide broad applicability for the study of genomic disorders and, with further development, may also permit efficient correction of these defects."

In this study 149 antiretroviral-naïve seropositive subjects in Nigeria (SP, 92 women and 57 men) and 58 seronegative (SN, 38 women and 20 men) were administered neuropsychological testing that assessed 7 ability domains. From the neuropsychological test scores was calculated a global deficit score (GDS), a measure of overall NCI. Percentages of circulating monocytes and plasma HIV RNA, soluble CD163 and soluble CD14 levels were also assessed. HIV SP women were found to be younger, more educated and had higher CD4+ T cell counts and borderline higher viral load measures than SP men. On the neuropsychological testing, SP women were more impaired in speed of information processing and verbal fluency and had a higher mean GDS than SN women. Compared to SP men, SP women were also more impaired in speed of information processing and verbal fluency as well as on tests of learning and memory. Numbers of circulating monocytes and plasma sCD14 and sCD163 levels were significantly higher for all SP versus all SN individuals and were also higher for SP women and for SP men versus their SN counterparts. Among SP women, soluble CD14 levels were slightly higher than for SP men, and SP women had higher viral load measurements and were more likely to have detectable virus than SP men. Higher sCD14 levels among SP women correlated with more severe global impairment, and higher viral load measurements correlated with higher monocyte numbers and sCD14 and sCD14 levels, associations that were not observed for SP men. These studies suggest that the risk of developing NCI differ for HIV infected women and men in Nigeria and, for women, may be linked to effects from higher plasma levels of HIV driving activation of circulating monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2265544830,"A hallmark of targeted cancer therapies is selective toxicity among cancer cell lines. We evaluated results from a viability screen of over 200,000 small molecules to identify two chemical series, oxalamides and benzothiazoles, that were selectively toxic at low nanomolar concentrations to the same 4 of 12 human lung cancer cell lines. Sensitive cell lines expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4F11, which metabolized the compounds into irreversible inhibitors of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD is recognized as a promising biological target in cancer and metabolic disease. However, SCD is essential to sebocytes, and accordingly SCD inhibitors cause skin toxicity. Mouse sebocytes did not activate the benzothiazoles or oxalamides into SCD inhibitors, providing a therapeutic window for inhibiting SCD in vivo. We thus offer a strategy to target SCD in cancer by taking advantage of high CYP expression in a subset of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2258113041,"Osteoporosis may complicate iron overload diseases such as genetic hemochromatosis. However, molecular mechanisms involved in the iron-related osteoporosis remains poorly understood. Recent in vitro studies support a role of osteoblast impairment in iron-related osteoporosis. Our aim was to analyse the impact of excess iron in Hfe-/- mice on osteoblast activity and on bone microarchitecture. We studied the bone formation rate, a dynamic parameter reflecting osteoblast activity, and the bone phenotype of Hfe-/- male mice, a mouse model of human hemochromatosis, by using histomorphometry. Hfe-/- animals were sacrificed at 6 months and compared to controls. We found that bone contains excess iron associated with increased hepatic iron concentration in Hfe-/- mice. We have shown that animals with iron overload have decreased bone formation rate, suggesting a direct impact of iron excess on active osteoblasts number. For bone mass parameters, we showed that iron deposition was associated with bone loss by producing microarchitectural impairment with a decreased tendency in bone trabecular volume and trabecular number. A disorganization of trabecular network was found with marrow spaces increased, which was confirmed by enhanced trabecular separation and star volume of marrow spaces. These microarchitectural changes led to a loss of connectivity and complexity in the trabecular network, which was confirmed by decreased interconnectivity index and increased Minkowski's fractal dimension. Our results suggest for the first time in a genetic hemochromatosis mouse model, that iron overload decreases bone formation and leads to alterations in bone mass and microarchitecture. These observations support a negative effect of iron on osteoblast recruitment and/or function, which may contribute to iron-related osteoporosis."

We studied associations between levels of five fungal DNA sequences, two mycotoxins (sterigmatocystin and verrucarol) and cat allergen (Fel d 1) levels in schools and rhinitis and other weekly SBS symptoms in the students. Fungal DNA was measured by quantitative PCR and cat allergen by ELISA. Pupils (N = 462) from eight randomly selected schools in Johor Bahru, Malaysia participated (96%). Dust samples were collected by cotton swabs and Petri dishes exposed for one week. None of the schools had a mechanical ventilation system, but all classrooms had openable windows that were kept open during lectures and indoor CO2 levels were low (mean 492 ppm; range 380–690 ppm). Weekly nasal symptoms (rhinitis) (18.8%), ocular (11.6%), throat (11.1%), dermal symptoms, headache (20.6%) and tiredness (22.1%) were common. Total fungal DNA in swab samples was associated with rhinitis (p = 0.02), ocular symptoms (p = 0.009) and tiredness (p = 0.001). There were positive associations between Aspergillus versicolor DNA in Petri dish samples, ocular symptoms (p = 0.02) and tiredness (p = 0.001). The level of the mycotoxin verrucarol (produced by Stachybotrys chartarum) in swab samples was positively associated with tiredness (p = 0.04). Streptomyces DNA in swab samples (p = 0.03) and Petri dish samples (p = 0.03) were negatively associated with tiredness. In conclusion, total fungal contamination, measured as total fungal DNA) in the classrooms, Aspergillus versicolor and verrucarol can be risk factors for rhinitis and SBS symptoms among students in the tropical country Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W2258163445,"Stigmatising and discriminating attitudes may discourage tuberculosis (TB) patients from actively seeking medical care, hide their disease status, and discontinue treatment. It is expected that appropriate knowledge regarding TB should remove stigmatising and discriminating attitudes. In this study we assessed the prevalence of stigmatising and discriminating attitudes towards TB patients among general population and their association with knowledge regarding TB.A cross-sectional knowledge, attitude and practice survey was conducted in 30 districts of India in January-March 2011. A total of 4562 respondents from general population were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires which contained items to measure stigma, discrimination and knowledge on TB.Of the 4562 interviewed, 3823 were eligible for the current analysis. Of these, 73% (95% CI 71.4-74.2) had stigmatising and 98% (95% CI 97.4-98.3) had discriminating attitude towards TB patients. Only 17% (95% CI 15.6-18.0) of the respondents had appropriate knowledge regarding TB with even lower levels observed amongst females, rural areas and respondents from low income groups. Surprisingly stigmatising (adjusted OR 1.31 (0.78-2.18) and discriminating (adjusted OR 0.79 (0.43-1.44) attitudes were independent of knowledge regarding TB.Stigmatising and discriminating attitudes towards TB patients remain high among the general population in India. Since these attitudes were independent of the knowledge regarding TB, it is possible that the current disseminated knowledge regarding TB which is mainly from a medical perspective may not be adequately addressing the factors that lead to stigma and discrimination towards TB patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to review the messages and strategies currently used for disseminating knowledge regarding TB among general population and revise them appropriately. The disseminated knowledge should include medical, psycho-social and economic aspects of TB that not only informs people about medical aspects of TB disease, but also removes stigma and discrimination."

This enzyme binds selectively to conformation-dependent protein determinants in the 60 or so lysosomal acid hydrolases and transfers GlcNAc-1-P from UDP-GlcNAc to mannose residues on high mannose-type N-linked glycans of the hydrolases (2Reitman M.L.

The GlcNAc is subsequently excised by a second Golgi enzyme (“uncovering enzyme”) to generate the high affinity Man-6-P ligand (3Varki A. Kornfeld S.

Enzyme kinetic studies have indicated that the α and β subunits specifically bind lysosomal acid hydrolases and mediate the catalytic function of the enzyme (8Kudo M. Canfield W.M.

The γ subunit enhances the rate of GlcNAc-P transfer to a subset of the acid hydrolases without substantially altering the binding to these acceptors. Consistent with this, analysis of the level of mannose phosphorylation of the acid hydrolases in the brain of mice lacking the γ subunit, as estimated by the extent of binding to a cation-independent (CI)-MPR affinity resin, indicated that about one-third of the acid hydrolases were phosphorylated at close to wild-type (WT) levels, whereas another third were poorly phosphorylated with the final third showing intermediate levels of phosphorylation (9Qian Y.

These studies leave unanswered the key question of how GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase specifically recognizes lysosomal acid hydrolases. In looking for clues, we examined the domain structures of the α, β, and γ subunits of this transferase (10Qian Y. van Meel E. Flanagan-Steet H. Yox A. Steet R. Kornfeld S. Analysis of mucolipidosis II/III GNPTAB missense mutations identifies domains of UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase involved in catalytic function and lysosomal enzyme recognition.J.

The α/β subunits contain three identifiable domains as follows: the Stealth domain, two Notch repeat modules, and a DNA methyltransferase-associated protein (DMAP) interaction domain. The Stealth domain resembles sequences within bacterial genes that encode sugar-phosphate transferases involved in cell wall polysaccharide synthesis and has been shown to mediate the catalytic function of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (8Kudo M.

Stealth proteins: in silico identification of a novel protein family rendering bacterial pathogens invisible to host immune defense.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e63Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, the bacterial genes lack the Notch repeats and the DMAP interaction domain, which has been proposed to function as a protein-protein interaction domain (12Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. DNMT1 binds HDAC2 and a new co-repressor, DMAP1, to form a complex at replication foci.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Because the bacterial enzymes transfer sugar-phosphates directly to polysaccharide acceptors without the involvement of protein recognition, we hypothesized that the mammalian transferase, in the course of protein evolution, acquired the Notch and DMAP interaction domains to function in the specific recognition of protein determinants on lysosomal acid hydrolases. Support for this hypothesis has come from studies of the consequences of missense mutations in Notch 1 and the DMAP interaction domain found in patients with the autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders mucolipidosis II and III (10Qian Y. van Meel E. Flanagan-Steet H. Yox A. Steet R. Kornfeld S.

These mutations were shown to impair lysosomal enzyme phosphorylation without altering the catalytic activity of the transferase toward the simple sugar α-methyl d-mannoside (αMM). This is consistent with a role for these domains in binding to lysosomal enzymes. The γ subunit contains two recognizable domains as follows: a Man-6-P receptor homology (MRH) domain (14Munro S. The MRH domain suggests a shared ancestry for the mannose 6-phosphate receptors and other N-glycan-recognising proteins.Curr.

The MRH domain contains residues critical for mannose binding, but it lacks those needed for phosphate binding (15Castonguay A.C. Olson L.J. Dahms N.M.

Although it has not been shown to bind high mannose oligosaccharides, similar MRH domains in other proteins do so (16Hosokawa N. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Kato K. Nagata K.

The function of the MRH and DMAP interaction domains of the γ subunit in lysosomal acid hydrolase phosphorylation has not been examined to date. To gain a better understanding of the role of the domains of the α, β, and γ subunits of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase in lysosomal enzyme recognition, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system to inactivate the GNPTAB and GNPTG genes in HeLa cells and then determined the ability of various mutants of these genes to restore phosphorylation of a panel of lysosomal enzymes and proteins. Our findings establish that the two Notch repeats along with the DMAP interaction domain of the α subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase mediate the specific recognition of lysosomal acid hydrolases. Furthermore, we present evidence that the requirement for the individual protein interacting domains to achieve phosphorylation varies among the acid hydrolase substrates. We also show that the γ subunit binds to the spacer region between Notch 2 and the DMAP interaction domain, and we document a variable requirement for the MRH domain and the DMAP interaction domain of the γ subunit. Together, these findings provide new insight into how lysosomal acid hydrolases are selectively recognized by GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. GNPTAB−/− and GNPTG−/− HeLa cells were generated by CRISPR nuclease-induced targeted double strand break at the Genome Engineering Center at Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, MO). HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (parental line). Exon 3 of GNPTAB was targeted with guide RNA 5′-GTAAACAACGTCAATCGGCA-3′, whereas Exon 2 of GNPTG was targeted with guide RNA 5′-TTCGCTGCACCTGCCGGCGC-3′ (Fig. 1). Sequencing determined that all three alleles of GNPTAB were disrupted with one allele having a 17-bp deletion, c.216_232del, whereas the other two alleles had a 1-bp deletion c.221delC. In the case of GNPTG, all three alleles had an insertion, c.61insT, c.61insA, and c.61insG (see Fig. 1). All cell lines were maintained in DMEM (Mediatech, Inc.) containing 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate and 4.5 g/liter glucose, supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Mediatech). Human γDMAP (amino acids 173–267) cDNA was PCR-amplified from human GNPTG-FLAG cDNA in pcDNA3.1(+) (10Qian Y. van Meel E. Flanagan-Steet H. Yox A. Steet R. Kornfeld S.

Human GNPTG-FLAG in pcDNA3.1(+) was modified by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis to generate the various mutant γ constructs. The full cDNA sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human GNPTAB-V5/His in pcDNA6 has been described (10Qian Y. van Meel E. Flanagan-Steet H. Yox A. Steet R. Kornfeld S.

The various α/β deletion constructs were made by a two-step overlap-extension PCR process wherein the native cDNA restriction fragment encoding the Notch 1-DMAP (amino acids 438–819) sequence was swapped with a similar PCR-generated restriction fragment encoding the specific deletion. The two Notch 1 repeat-containing construct was generated by a three-step overlap-extension PCR process. All of the sequences were confirmed to be correct by DNA sequencing. In preliminary experiments, we found that deletion of residues 431–819 gave rise to a mutant protein that was well expressed and localized to the Golgi but had no catalytic activity toward αMM, in agreement with De Pace et al. (18De Pace R. Velho R.V. Encarnação M. Marschner K. Braulke T. Pohl S. Subunit interactions of the disease-related hexameric GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By contrast, the Δ438–819 mutant had full catalytic activity (see Fig. 3). To generate the α/β and γ bicistronic construct, a 1.5-kb gBlocks gene fragment was synthesized (IDT Inc.) that encoded the internal ribosomal entry site sequence from the pTandem vector (EMD Millipore), followed by the human γ cDNA sequence with the hemagglutinin (HA) tag nucleotide sequence in-frame at the 3′ end. The NPC2 cDNA construct was generously provided by Daniel Ory (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Sandra Hofmann (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) kindly provided the cDNA construct for PPT1. To visualize lysosomes, parental, GNPTAB−/− and GNPTG−/− HeLa cells were fixed and stained as described (10Qian Y. van Meel E. Flanagan-Steet H. Yox A. Steet R. Kornfeld S.

To visualize the subcellular localization of the α/β and γ subunits, the various constructs were transfected into parental or GNPTAB−/− HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Co-transfection of α/β and γ subunit cDNAs was performed using an 8:1 ratio, respectively. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed, and the α/β subunits were detected with affinity-purified rabbit anti-α antibody with the exception of the ΔN1-DMAP and the ΔDMAP deletions, which were detected with mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reason for this is that the rabbit anti-α antibody is directed against an epitope within the DMAP domain. This necessitated the use of two different Golgi markers, GM130 and GOLPH4, which were detected with mouse anti-GM130 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-GOLPH4 polyclonal antibody (Abcam), respectively. The γ subunit was detected with either rabbit anti-γ antiserum that was kindly provided by Thomas Braulke (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) or with mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The processed cells were mounted in ProLong® Gold antifade mounting medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the images were acquired with either a Zeiss LSM510 or an LSM880 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Images were analyzed by ImageJ software (Fiji). To determine binding of WT or mutant α/β to WT or mutant γ, HEK 293 cells were either transfected with the co-expression bicistronic vector or co-transfected with the individual α/β and γ plasmids. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors) and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was added to Ni-NTA beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) and tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with ice-cold buffer B (buffer A with 20 mm imidazole and no protease inhibitors), boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the bound proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by Western blotting. Soluble bovine CI-MPR was purified from FBS and covalently conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml as described (19Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. Soluble insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor carries multiple high molecular weight forms of insulin-like growth factor II in fetal bovine serum.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two days post-transfection, HeLa cells in a 6-well plate were collected and lysed with 250 μl of cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. 20 μl of the CI-MPR-Sepharose beads was washed twice with lysis buffer, and mixed with 200 μl of cell lysate. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with tumbling and then centrifuged at 2,400 × g for 2 min to pellet the beads, which were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate. Finally, the beads were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Man-6-P to elute the bound proteins. Lysosomal enzyme assays were performed on the eluates as described previously (10Qian Y. van Meel E. Flanagan-Steet H. Yox A. Steet R. Kornfeld S.

GST and GST fusions were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli BL21 (RIL) cells (Agilent Technologies), and pulldown assays wereperformed with the purified lysosomal enzymes exactly as described (13Qian Y. Flanagan-Steet H. van Meel E. Steet R. Kornfeld S.A. The DMAP interaction domain of UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase is a substrate recognition module.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 10246-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and detected with antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Labeling experiments were performed with parental, GNPTAB−/−, and GNPTG−/− HeLa cells as follows. 48 h post-transfection, cells in 60-mm tissue culture plates were incubated with 50–150 μCi of [2-3H]mannose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h, followed by the addition of complete medium containing 5 mm glucose, 5 mm mannose, and 10 mm NH4Cl to stop mannose uptake and induce secretion. The cells were incubated for an additional 3 h before the media were collected. In several experiments, cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blotting for β subunit content to confirm that the constructs were being expressed at comparable levels. Acid hydrolases secreted into the media were immunoprecipitated, and oligosaccharides were isolated and analyzed essentially as described in detail previously (22Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. A novel mutagenesis strategy identifies distantly spaced amino acid sequences that are required for the phosphorylation of both the oligosaccharides of procathepsin D by N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For the CathD-myc, α-Man-myc, NPC2-myc, and β-Man-HA experiments, 20 μl of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 5 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was pre-bound to 100 μl of protein G-agarose-PLUS beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) prior to immunoprecipitation of labeled lysosomal hydrolases from the media. In the case of α-Gal and PPT1, the secreted enzymes were immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose-PLUS beads pre-bound to anti-α-Gal antibody (Amicus Therapeutics) and rProtein A-agarose beads (RepliGen) pre-bound to anti-PPT1 antibody (kindly provided by Sandra Hofmann, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), respectively. Immunoprecipitated material was treated with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) and filtered with Ultracel-10K (EMD Millipore). The filtrate containing neutral and phosphorylated high mannose glycans was treated with mild acid to remove any N-acetylglucosamine residues still attached to the phosphate moieties and applied to a QAE-column matrix to separate the oligosaccharides bearing zero, one, or two Man-6-P residues. The retentate containing Endo H-resistant complex oligosaccharides was treated with Pronase (Roche Diagnostics) and fractionated on concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The [2-3H]mannose content of each fraction was determined, and the percent phosphorylation was calculated as described (22Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. A novel mutagenesis strategy identifies distantly spaced amino acid sequences that are required for the phosphorylation of both the oligosaccharides of procathepsin D by N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase.J.

To analyze the function of the various domains of the subunits of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, we needed cell lines that lacked either the α/β or γ subunits while maintaining good growth and being readily transfectable. To achieve this goal, the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system was used to generate GNPTAB−/− and GNPTG−/− HeLa cells. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of these cells using the lysosomal/late endosomal marker LAMP-1 revealed a striking enlargement of lysosomes in both lines compared with the parental HeLa cells, with the abnormality being greatest in the GNPTAB−/− cells (Fig. 2A). Both knock-out cell lines had a dramatic increase in LAMP-1 content, as documented by Western blots for this membrane protein (Fig. 2B). These findings are indicative of major lysosomal dysfunction in the mutant cells. Despite this, the cells grew well and were readily transfectable. Whole cell extracts of the GNPTAB−/− and GNPTG−/− cells had low but detectable levels of a panel of lysosomal acid hydrolases based on enzymatic assays. To determine whether the residual hydrolases observed in the GNPTAB−/− and GNPTG−/− cells contained any Man-6-P residues, we measured their binding to beads containing immobilized CI-MPR, which exhibits high affinity binding to phosphorylated lysosomal proteins (23Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. Ligand interactions of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. The stoichiometry of mannose 6-phosphate binding.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seven of the eight hydrolases assayed in the GNPTAB−/− lysates exhibited less than 1% of the binding observed with the WT extract, whereas α-mannosidase (α-Man) had 4% of WT binding (Fig. 2C). This indicates that most of the residual activities measured in the whole cell extract from GNPTAB−/− cells are in fact non-phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes that are in the process of traversing the secretory pathway. Binding of these hydrolases in the GNPTG−/− lysates to immobilized CI-MPR was also greatly reduced (Fig. 2C), but in three instances it was substantially increased over that observed with the same enzymes from GNPTAB−/− cells as follows: arylsulfatase B, 16 ± 0.4% versus 1.2 ± 0.1%; β-hexosaminidase (β-Hex), 3.4 ± 1.5% versus 0.3 ± 0.2%; and β-galactosidase (β-Gal), 1.3 ± 0.5% versus 0.1 ± 0.1%. In addition to these acid hydrolases, the eluates of the CI-MPR affinity beads were also analyzed for their content of cathepsin D (CathD), Niemann-Pick disease, type C2 (NPC2), and palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (PPT1) by Western blotting (Fig. 2D). Whereas all three proteins were found in the eluate of the WT cell lysate, None were detected in the eluate of the GNPTAB−/− cell lysate. By contrast, two of these proteins (CathD and PPT1) were present at substantial albeit reduced levels in the eluate of the GNPTG−/− cell lysate, whereas NPC2 was recovered at close to the WT level. We next turned to the use of [2-3H]mannose labeling to obtain quantitative determinations of the degree of Man-6-P formation on the various lysosomal proteins. In these experiments, cells were transfected with"

Sande M.A. Role of platelets in endocarditis: clues from von Willebrand disease.J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 120: 507-509PubMed Google Scholar), the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis is a complex process that is not well understood. The viridans group of streptococci, including Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii, accounts for an estimated 17–45% of all cases of infective endocarditis (4.Murdoch D.R. Corey G.R.

These infective endocarditis-associated pathogens often contain a gene encoding a serine-rich repeat adhesin that can mediate the attachment of each respective pathogen to human platelet glycans (7.Bensing B.A. López J.A. Sullam P.M. The Streptococcus gordonii surface proteins GspB and Hsa mediate binding to sialylated carbohydrate epitopes on the platelet membrane glycoprotein Ibα.Infect.

Microbiol. 2005; 58: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The adhesive interaction is perhaps best understood in S. gordonii strain M99, which interacts with platelets via the serine-rich repeat adhesin GspB. This surface component mediates host adherence via a binding region that promotes a high affinity interaction to a narrow range of sialylated carbohydrates (10.Deng L. Bensing B.A. Thamadilok S. Yu H. Lau K. Chen X. Ruhl S. Sullam P.M. Varki A. Oral streptococci utilize a Siglec-like domain of serine-rich repeat adhesins to preferentially target platelet sialoglycans in human blood.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004540Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Studies using recombinant GspB and whole bacteria have shown that the binding of GspB to the sialylated glycans of GPIbα is the primary adhesive interaction to host platelets (7.Bensing B.A. López J.A. Sullam P.M. The Streptococcus gordonii surface proteins GspB and Hsa mediate binding to sialylated carbohydrate epitopes on the platelet membrane glycoprotein Ibα.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6528-6537Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9.Takamatsu D. Bensing B.A. Cheng H. Jarvis G.A. Siboo I.R. Lopez J.A. Griffiss J.M. Sullam P.M.

Binding of the streptococcal surface glycoproteins GspB and Hsa to human salivary proteins.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and that expression of GspB enhances virulence (12.Xiong Y.Q. Bensing B.A. Bayer A.S. Chambers H.F. Sullam P.M. Role of the serine-rich surface glycoprotein GspB of Streptococcus gordonii in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.Microb. Pathog. 2008; 45: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). S. sanguinis is often cited as the most common cause of bacterial infective endocarditis and contains a sequence homolog of GspB (8.Plummer C. Wu H. Kerrigan S.W. Meade G. Cox D. Ian Douglas C.W. A serine-rich glycoprotein of Streptococcus sanguis mediates adhesion to platelets via GPIb.Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 129: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In S. sanguinis strain SK36, this homolog is called SrpA and includes a binding region (termed SrpABR) that is 32% identical and 46% similar to the corresponding region of GspB (termed GspBBR), but is significantly shorter, suggesting that GspBBR contains an additional domain as compared with SrpABR. Experimental validation of a role for SrpA in virulence is less clear than it is for GspB. Targeted mutagenesis of SrpA and other possible adhesins of S. sanguinis indicated that the deletion of SrpA does not influence virulence in an animal model of infective endocarditis (13.Turner L.S. Kanamoto T. Unoki T. Munro C.L. Wu H. Kitten T. Comprehensive evaluation of Streptococcus sanguinis cell wall-anchored proteins in early infective endocarditis.Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 4966-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the subsequent finding that individual deletion of every identified cell wall anchored protein in S. sanguinis had no significant influence on virulence suggests that S. sanguinis could have multiple adhesins that provide functional redundancy (13.Turner L.S. Kanamoto T. Unoki T. Munro C.L. Wu H. Kitten T. Comprehensive evaluation of Streptococcus sanguinis cell wall-anchored proteins in early infective endocarditis.Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 4966-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Like GspB, SrpA binds platelet glycoprotein GPIbα and can mediate binding to platelets in vitro (8.Plummer C. Wu H. Kerrigan S.W. Meade G. Cox D. Ian Douglas C.W. A serine-rich glycoprotein of Streptococcus sanguis mediates adhesion to platelets via GPIb.Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 129: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Unlike GspB, SrpA appears to have a wider range of glycan-binding partners, but quantification of binding between SrpA and defined sialoglycans suggests only weak interactions for the carbohydrates tested (10.Deng L. Bensing B.A. Thamadilok S. Yu H. Lau K. Chen X. Ruhl S. Sullam P.M. Varki A. Oral streptococci utilize a Siglec-like domain of serine-rich repeat adhesins to preferentially target platelet sialoglycans in human blood.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004540Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sialoglycan array data further indicate that although GspB strongly prefers the N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) form of sialic acid, SrpA has some preference for glycans containing the N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) form of sialic acid (10.Deng L. Bensing B.A. Thamadilok S. Yu H. Lau K. Chen X. Ruhl S. Sullam P.M. Varki A. Oral streptococci utilize a Siglec-like domain of serine-rich repeat adhesins to preferentially target platelet sialoglycans in human blood.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004540Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which is not present in humans. Nevertheless, SrpA binds human platelets with high affinity (8.Plummer C. Wu H. Kerrigan S.W. Meade G. Cox D. Ian Douglas C.W. A serine-rich glycoprotein of Streptococcus sanguis mediates adhesion to platelets via GPIb.Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 129: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); thus it is possible that a high affinity human carbohydrate ligand for SrpA remains unidentified. The naturally occurring range of carbohydrate binding properties of GspB and SrpA can offer insights into the adhesive properties important for endovascular infection and may allow broader conclusions to be drawn about carbohydrate binding in these related adhesins. In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of the carbohydrate-binding region of GspB (14.Pyburn T.M. Bensing B.A. Xiong Y.Q. Melancon B.J. Tomasiak T.M. Ward N.J. Yankovskaya V. Oliver K.M. Cecchini G. Sulikowski G.A. Tyska M.J. Sullam P.M. Iverson T.M.

Commun. 2010; 66: 1503-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This binding region (termed GspBBR) contains three linearly arranged, independently folded domains termed the CnaA, Siglec, and Unique domains based upon their structural similarity to other proteins. The binding pocket for sialylated carbohydrates is located within the Siglec domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the GspB binding pocket identified residues critical for both carbohydrate binding and platelet binding, as well as for virulence in the setting of infective endocarditis (14.Pyburn T.M. Bensing B.A. Xiong Y.Q. Melancon B.J. Tomasiak T.M. Ward N.J. Yankovskaya V. Oliver K.M. Cecchini G. Sulikowski G.A. Tyska M.J. Sullam P.M. Iverson T.M. A structural model for binding of the serine-rich repeat adhesin GspB to host carbohydrate receptors.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here, we determine the crystal structure of the SrpA carbohydrate-binding region (SrpABR), both alone and in complex with a Neu5Gc-based synthetic sialyl galactoside disaccharide, and we use mutagenesis to validate key residues important for platelet binding. We identified a Thr-Arg motif conserved across homologous carbohydrate-binding adhesins that may orient the sialic acid moiety of carbohydrate ligands. Together, our results suggest that a small number of short sequence insertions in closely related homologs influence the quaternary structure, the tertiary structure, and the binding pocket. The latter may contribute to the differences in carbohydrate affinity and binding spectrum between SrpA and GspB. A codon-optimized gene for S. sanguinis strain SK36 SrpABR (encoding residues 240–453 of the full protein) was synthesized (DNA 2.0) and subcloned into the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible pSV278 vector (Vanderbilt University), which encodes a His6-maltose-binding protein (MBP) 3The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; r.m.s., root mean square; DPBS, Dulbecco's PBS; GalβOMe, methyl β-galactopyranoside; ULI, unique loop insertion. affinity tag at the N terminus followed by a thrombin cleavage site. Variants of SrpABR were cloned into pGEX5X, which encodes an N-terminal GST tag followed by a factor Xa protease cleavage site. Wild type and variant SrpABR were expressed using the same protocol in Escherichia coli BL21 Gold (DE3) in LB medium and 50 μg/ml kanamycin or 100 μg ampicilllin, as appropriate for each plasmid. The cells were first grown at 37 °C until an A600 ∼0.5 was reached and then were cold shocked in an ice bath for 20 min. The cells were then moved to 18 °C, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 × g at 4 °C and frozen at −20 °C before purification. Each frozen pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml DNase, and 1 μg/ml RNase. The resuspended cells were then lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 45 min and filtered using a 0.45-μm filter. Purification was performed at 4 °C. For wild-type SrpABR, the His6-MBP-SrpABR fusion protein was first purified by affinity chromatography with an MBP-Trap column. The eluted protein was concentrated in a 10-kDa cutoff concentrator and exchanged into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl. The His6-MBP affinity tag was then cleaved with 1 unit of thrombin per mg of protein and separated from SrpABR by passing the cleavage products over the MBP-Trap column in binding buffer. Variant SrpABR was first purified on a GST-Trap column and concentrated, and then the GST tag was cleaved with factor Xa protease. GST was selectively removed from the cleavage products by passage over the GST-Trap column. For both wild-type and variant protein, the protein aggregates and excess affinity tag were removed using a 24-ml Superdex S-200 size exclusion column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl. For some protein preparations, separation of SrpABR from the fusion tag required an additional iteration of either affinity or size exclusion chromatography. After purification, the protein was >95% pure as assessed by visual inspection of the protein separated by SDS-PAGE. The SrpABR variant gene sequences, along with BamHI and EcoRI linkers, were synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then cloned in pGEX5X. The presence of only the expected alteration was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The GST-SrpABR fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (10.Deng L. Bensing B.A. Thamadilok S. Yu H. Lau K. Chen X. Ruhl S. Sullam P.M. Varki A. Oral streptococci utilize a Siglec-like domain of serine-rich repeat adhesins to preferentially target platelet sialoglycans in human blood.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004540Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To assess SrpABR binding to platelets, fresh human platelets were washed, fixed, and immobilized in 96-well plates as described (16.Bensing B.A. Sullam P.M. An accessory sec locus of Streptococcus gordonii is required for export of the surface protein GspB and for normal levels of binding to human platelets.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). All subsequent binding steps were carried at out room temperature. To reduce nonspecific adherence, the wells were treated with 50 μl of a 1× casein solution (blocking reagent, Roche Applied Science) in Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) for 1 h. The blocking solution was replaced with 50 μl of purified GST-SrpABR wild-type or variant proteins (0.5 μm in 1× blocking solution). The plates were incubated for 1 h with vigorous rocking; wells were rinsed three times with 100 μl of DPBS, and 50 μl of a rabbit polyclonal anti-GST (Life Technologies, Inc.) diluted 1:500 in 1× blocking solution was added to each well. After 1 h, wells were rinsed three times with 100 μl of DPBS, and 50 μl of a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000 dilution in DPBS) was added. After incubation for 1 h, wells were rinsed three times with 100 μl of DPBS, and 200 μl of a solution of 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) was added. The absorbance at 450 nm was read after ∼15 min. Results are reported as the mean ± S.D., with n = 4 for each protein tested. GalβOMe (50 mg, 0.26 mmol), N-glycolylmannosamine (91 mg, 0.38 mmol), sodium pyruvate (113 mg, 1.03 mmol), and CTP (217 mg, 0.38 mmol) were dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (10 ml, 100 mm, pH 8.5) containing MgCl2 (20 mm) and appropriate amounts of Pasteurella multocida sialic acid aldolase (3 mg), Neisseria meningitidis CMP-sialic acid synthetase (2 mg), and Pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase 1 M144D (2 mg). The reaction was carried out by incubating the reaction mixture in an incubator shaker at 37 °C for 12 h. The reaction was monitored by TLC (EtOAc/MeOH/H2O/HOAc = 5:2:1:0.1, by volume) with p-anisaldehyde sugar staining and mass spectrometry. When an optimal yield was achieved, to the reaction mixture was added the same volume (10 ml) of 95% ethanol followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. The precipitates were removed by centrifugation (5533 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant was concentrated and purified by Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration chromatography (water was used as an eluent). Further purification was achieved using silica gel chromatography (EtOAc/MeOH/H2O = 4:2:1, by volume) and a final pass through of a Bio-Gel P-2 gel filtration column to produce Neu5Gcα2–3GalβOMe (101 mg).

SrpABR was concentrated and buffer exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. All crystals grewusing the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in a CombiClover 4 chamber plate at room temperature (∼23 °C) by equilibrating droplets containing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution over 50 μl of a reservoir solution. Native crystals grew in space group C2 using a protein concentration of 10.6 mg/ml and a reservoir condition that contained 0.2 m Ca(CH3CO2)2, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 18% PEG 8000. Cocrystals of SrpABR with the Neu5Gcα2–3GalβOMe synthetic disaccharide used 14.4 mg/ml protein in a buffer solution containing 10 mm carbohydrate and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Crystals of the SrpABR R347E variant were grown using a protein concentration of 15.3 mg/ml and a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m NaCH3COO, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 30% PEG 8000. An Os derivative was generated by soaking fully formed crystals in the C2 space group in reservoir solution supplemented with 2 mm K2OsO4 and 5% DMSO overnight. Native crystals were cryo-protected using a solution containing all of the components of the reservoir solution plus 5% DMSO before cryo-cooling while the Os derivative crystals were flash-cooled directly from the soaking drop, and disaccharide cocrystals were cryo-cooled using the well solution supplemented with 5 mm disaccharide.

The initial coordinates then transferred directly into the native data set with an initial round of rigid body refinement. The unliganded and disaccharide-bound crystals of SrpABR were isomorphous, and thus the disaccharide-bound structure was determined by isomorphous replacement. In short, following refinement of the unliganded structure, all solvent molecules were removed, and the coordinates were transferred directly into the dataset for SrpABR cocrystallized with the disaccharide. The coordinates were subjected to rigid body refinement in Phenix (19.Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Unambiguous electron density for the sialic acid was observed even in the initial electron density maps, and both the sialic acid and the galactose were placed into the model after two rounds of refinement. The occupancy of the disaccharide was retained at 1.0 for the duration of the refinement, and the average temperature factors of this ligand (42.6 Å2) are similar to that of the protein (35.2 Å2) in the final model. The structure of the R347E variant in the P212121 space group was determined by molecular replacement using the Phaser subroutine in Phenix and the coordinates of the unliganded protein with all solvent molecules and ligands removed. The final model of the R347E variant contained a geometric outlier (Table 1) within the loop that changed position upon mutation. This region contains electron density that was challenging to assign with confidence. All models were improved with iterative rounds of model building in Coot (22.Emsley P. Cowtan K.

A method for the analysis of domain movements in large biomolecular complexes.Proteins. 2009; 76: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering was performed using a DynaPro NanoStar instrument (Wyatt Technology) on protein samples that were first filtered through a 0.22-μm Spin-X centrifugal filter (Corning Inc.). Measurements were performed in triplicate with an SrpABR concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium cacodylate, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2, at 25 °C. Three measurements of 10 acquisitions were collected for each of three SrpABR samples. Dynamics 7.1.9 software was used for data analysis. The x-ray crystal structure of unliganded SrpABR (residues 240–453 of the full-length protein) was determined to 1.8 Å resolution (Table 1) using de novo phasing calculated from single wavelength anomalous diffraction of an osmium derivative. Each SrpABR protomer folds into two domains (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain is similar to the “Siglec”-like domain of GspB that is a variant of a V-set Ig fold, with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.8 Å over the 102 amino acids in the alignment. The C-terminal domain is similar to the “Unique” domain of GspB with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.4 Å over the 76 amino acids in the alignment. Given the close conservation of fold in each domain, we used these structures to improve the accuracy of our sequence alignment with GspB (Fig. 2). This sequence alignment reveals several notable insertions in each adhesin with respect to each other. These insertions add structural elements to the surface of SrpA (Fig. 2B) or GspB (Fig. 2C) that appear to alter the structural and functional properties of the adhesins.FIGURE 2Structure-based sequence alignment of SrpA and GspB. A, sequence alignment was performed manually by overlaying the structures of SrpABR and GspBBR. Secondary structural elements are shown above and below the sequence. Amino acids in red text are identical. The Thr-Arg motif is highlighted in green. The insertions in GspB highlighted in yellow are near the ligand binding pocket, with residues 449–451 forming a short loop and residues 498–514 forming the helix at the carbohydrate binding pocket. Insertions in SrpA highlighted in purple are predicted to influence the interdomain angle, and the insertion in GspB highlighted in red is predicted to prevent dimerization. B, ribbon diagram"
https://openalex.org/W2263031682,"Travel time is an important measurement used to evaluate the extent of congestion within road networks. This paper presents a new method to estimate the travel time based on an evolving fuzzy neural inference system. The input variables in the system are traffic flow data (volume, occupancy, and speed) collected from loop detectors located at points both upstream and downstream of a given link, and the output variable is the link travel time. A first order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rule set is used to complete the inference. For training the evolving fuzzy neural network (EFNN), two learning processes are proposed: (1) a K-means method is employed to partition input samples into different clusters, and a Gaussian fuzzy membership function is designed for each cluster to measure the membership degree of samples to the cluster centers. As the number of input samples increases, the cluster centers are modified and membership functions are also updated; (2) a weighted recursive least squares estimator is used to optimize the parameters of the linear functions in the Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy rules. Testing datasets consisting of actual and simulated data are used to test the proposed method. Three common criteria including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute relative error (MARE) are utilized to evaluate the estimation performance. Estimation results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the EFNN method through comparison with existing methods including: multiple linear regression (MLR), instantaneous model (IM), linear model (LM), neural network (NN), and cumulative plots (CP)."
https://openalex.org/W2281873405,"In CA1 pyramidal neurons, correlated inputs trigger dendritic plateau potentials that drive neuronal plasticity and firing rate modulation. Given the strong electrotonic coupling between soma and axon, the >25 mV depolarization associated with the plateau could propagate through the axon to influence action potential initiation, propagation, and neurotransmitter release. We examined this issue in brain slices, awake mice, and a computational model. Despite profoundly inactivating somatic and proximal axon Na(+) channels, plateaus evoked action potentials that recovered to full amplitude in the distal axon (>150 μm) and triggered neurotransmitter release similar to regular spiking. This effect was due to strong attenuation of plateau depolarizations by axonal K(+) channels, allowing full axon repolarization and Na(+) channel deinactivation. High-pass filtering of dendritic plateaus by axonal K(+) channels should thus enable accurate transmission of gain-modulated firing rates, allowing neuronal firing to be efficiently read out by downstream regions as a simple rate code."

The control group received standard management alone.Rate of cancellation on the day of surgery or the day before.The study population comprised 3900 patients enrolled between November 2012 and September 2013: 1950 patients were randomized to the checklist arm and 1950 patients to the control arm. The checklist was administered to 68.8% of patients in the intervention arm, 1002 by the automated phone system and 340 by a research assistant. The rate of late cancellation did not differ significantly between the checklist and control arms (109 (5.6%) vs. 113 (5.8%), adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.91 [0.65-1.29], (p = 0.57)). Checklist administration revealed that 355 patients (28.0%) had not undergone tests ordered by the surgeon or anesthetist, and that 254 patients (20.0%) still had questions concerning the fasting state.A standardized pre-operative telephone checklist did not avoid late cancellations of ambulatory surgery but enabled us to identify several frequent causes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01732159."
https://openalex.org/W2271664767,"Over the past two decades many studies have demonstrated that plant species diversity promotes primary productivity and stability in grassland ecosystems. Additionally, soil community characteristics have also been shown to influence the productivity and composition of plant communities, yet little is known about whether soil communities also play a role in stabilizing the productivity of an ecosystem.Here we use microcosms to assess the effects of the presence of soil communities on plant community dynamics and stability over a one-year time span. Microcosms were filled with sterilized soil and inoculated with either unaltered field soil or field soil sterilized to eliminate the naturally occurring soil biota. Eliminating the naturally occurring soil biota not only resulted in lower plant productivity, and reduced plant species diversity, and evenness, but also destabilized the net aboveground productivity of the plant communities over time, which was largely driven by changes in abundance of the dominant grass Lolium perenne. In contrast, the grass and legumes contributed more to net aboveground productivity of the plant communities in microcosms where soil biota had been inoculated. Additionally, the forbs exhibited compensatory dynamics with grasses and legumes, thus lowering temporal variation in productivity in microcosms that received the unaltered soil inocula. Overall, asynchrony among plant species was higher in microcosms where an unaltered soil community had been inoculated, which lead to higher temporal stability in community productivity.Our results suggest that soil communities increase plant species asynchrony and stabilize plant community productivity by equalizing the performance among competing plant species through potential antagonistic and facilitative effects on individual plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2253217900,"Introduction Gingival fibroblast-mediated extracellular matrix remodelling is implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, yet the stimuli that regulate this response are not fully understood. The immunoregulatory adipokine leptin is detectable in the gingiva, human gingival fibroblasts express functional leptin receptor mRNA and leptin is known to regulate extracellular matrix remodelling responses in cardiac fibroblasts. We therefore hypothesised that leptin would enhance matrix metalloproteinase secretion in human gingival fibroblasts. Methods and Results We used in vitro cell culture to investigate leptin signalling and the effect of leptin on mRNA and protein expression in human gingival fibroblasts. We confirmed human gingival fibroblasts expressed cell surface leptin receptor, found leptin increased matrix metalloproteinase-1, -3, -8 and -14 expression in human gingival fibroblasts compared to unstimulated cells, and observed that leptin stimulation activated MAPK, STAT1/3 and Akt signalling in human gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, leptin synergised with IL-1 or the TLR2 agonist pam2CSK4 to markedly enhance matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -3 production by human gingival fibroblasts. Signalling pathway inhibition demonstrated ERK was required for leptin-stimulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts; whilst ERK, JNK, p38 and STAT3 were required for leptin+IL-1- and leptin+pam2CSK4-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression. A genome-wide expression array and gene ontology analysis confirmed genes differentially expressed in leptin+IL-1-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts (compared to unstimulated cells) were enriched for extracellular matrix organisation and disassembly, and revealed that matrix metalloproteinase-8 and -12 were also synergistically upregulated by leptin+IL-1 in human gingival fibroblasts. Conclusions We conclude that leptin selectively enhances the expression and secretion of certain matrix metalloproteinases in human gingival fibroblasts, and suggest that gingival fibroblasts may have an ECM-degrading phenotype during conditions of hyperleptinaemia (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, exogenous leptin therapy)."
https://openalex.org/W2258430389,"Human paraoxonase 1 (h-PON1) is a serum enzyme that can hydrolyze a variety of substrates. The enzyme exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-atherogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-microbial and organophosphate-hydrolyzing activities. Thus, h-PON1 is a strong candidate for the development of therapeutic intervention against a variety conditions in human. However, the crystal structure of h-PON1 is not solved and the molecular details of how the enzyme hydrolyzes different substrates are not clear yet. Understanding the catalytic mechanism(s) of h-PON1 is important in developing the enzyme for therapeutic use. Literature suggests that R/Q polymorphism at position 192 in h-PON1 dramatically modulates the substrate specificity of the enzyme. In order to understand the role of the amino acid residue at position 192 of h-PON1 in its various hydrolytic activities, site-specific mutagenesis at position 192 was done in this study. The mutant enzymes were produced using Escherichia coli expression system and their hydrolytic activities were compared against a panel of substrates. Molecular dynamics simulation studies were employed on selected recombinant h-PON1 (rh-PON1) mutants to understand the effect of amino acid substitutions at position 192 on the structural features of the active site of the enzyme. Our results suggest that, depending on the type of substrate, presence of a particular amino acid residue at position 192 differentially alters the micro-environment of the active site of the enzyme resulting in the engagement of different subsets of amino acid residues in the binding and the processing of substrates. The result advances our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of h-PON1."

https://openalex.org/W2265149698,"In the theory of belief functions, the approximation of a basic belief assignment (BBA) is for reducing the high computational cost especially when large number of focal elements are available. In traditional BBA approximation approaches, a focal element’s own characteristics such as the mass assignment and the cardinality, are usually used separately or jointly as criteria for the removal of focal elements. Besides the computational cost, the distance between the original BBA and the approximated one is also concerned, which represents the loss of information in BBA approximation. In this paper, an iterative approximation approach is proposed based on maximizing the closeness, i.e., minimizing the distance between the approximated BBA in current iteration and the BBA obtained in the previous iteration, where one focal element is removed in each iteration. The iteration stops when the desired number of focal elements is reached. The performance evaluation approaches for BBA approximations are also discussed and used to compare and evaluate traditional BBA approximations and the newly proposed one in this paper, which include traditional time-based way, closeness-based way and new proposed ones. Experimental results and related analyses are provided to show the rationality and efficiency of our proposed new BBA approximation."
https://openalex.org/W2266947097,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an extremely successful intracellular pathogen that has evolved a broad spectrum of pathogenic mechanisms that enable its manipulation of host defense elements and its survival in the hostile environment inside phagocytes. Cellular influx into the site of mycobacterial entry is mediated by a variety of chemokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), and the innate cytokine network is critical for the development of an adaptive immune response and infection control. Using affinity chromatography, liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance techniques, we identified M. tuberculosis AtsG arylsulphatase, bifunctional glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GlmU) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SahH) as the pathogen proteins that bind to human IL-8. The interactions of all of the identified proteins (AtsG, GlmU and SahH) with IL-8 were characterized by high binding affinity with KD values of 6.83x10-6 M, 5.24x10-6 M and 7.14x10-10 M, respectively. Furthermore, the construction of Mtb mutant strains overproducing AtsG, GlmU or SahH allowed determination of the contribution of these proteins to mycobacterial entry into human neutrophils. The significantly increased number of intracellularly located bacilli of the overproducing M. tuberculosis mutant strains compared with those of ""wild-type"" M. tuberculosis and the binding interaction of AtsG, GlmU and SahH proteins with human IL-8 may indicate that these proteins participate in the modulation of the early events of infection with tubercle bacilli and could affect pathogen attachment to target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2268303319,"Background The naturalistic course for patients suffering from depressive disorders can be quite varied. Whilst some remit with little or no intervention, others may suffer a more prolonged course of symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify trajectory patterns for depressive symptoms in a Chinese primary care cohort and their associated factors. Methods and Results A 12-month cohort study was conducted. Patients recruited from 59 primary care clinics across Hong Kong were screened for depressive symptoms using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and monitored over 12 months using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9) administered at 12, 26 and 52 weeks. 721 subjects were included for growth mixture modelling analysis. Using Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, Entropy and Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test, a seven-class trajectory path model was identified. Over 12 months, three trajectory groups showed improvement in depressive symptoms, three remained static, whilst one deteriorated. A mild severity of depressive symptoms with gradual improvement was the most prevalent trajectory identified. Multivariate, multinomial regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with each trajectory. Risk factors associated with chronicity included: female gender; not married; not in active employment; presence of multiple chronic disease co-morbidities; poor self-rated general health; and infrequent health service use. Conclusions Whilst many primary care patients may initially present with a similar severity of depressive symptoms, their course over 12 months can be quite heterogeneous. Although most primary care patients improve naturalistically over 12 months, many do not remit and it is important for doctors to be able to identify those who are at risk of chronicity. Regular follow-up and greater treatment attention is recommended for patients at risk of chronicity."
https://openalex.org/W2269952135,"Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a common otological disorder characterized by a hearing loss greater than 30 dB over three consecutive frequencies, in less than 72 hours. It has been established that platelet parameters, such as mean platelet volume, are associated with ischemic heart events, whose clinical manifestations are similar to those of SSNHL. Hence, we aimed to determine if the platelet count, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are related to the occurrence and severity of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. A case-control prospective study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Iran. One hundred-eight patients with SSNHL and an equal number of healthy, age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled in the study. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the subjects, and the platelet count, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width were measured with an automated blood cell counter. Analysis of the audiometry and hematological test results using SPSS22 software showed no statistical correlation between the platelet parameters and the occurrence of SSNHL, but correlation coefficients showed a significant correlation between PDW and hearing loss severity in patients group. However, further investigation is required to unequivocally establish the absence of correlation between the platelet parameters and occurrence of SSNHL."

However, the mechanism by which this variant modulates MTC pathogenesis is still open to discuss. Of interest, strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) between RET S836S and 3'UTR variants has been reported in Hirschsprung's disease patients.To evaluate the frequency of the RET 3'UTR variants (rs76759170 and rs3026785) in MTC patients and to determine whether these variants are in LD with S836S polymorphism.Our sample comprised 152 patients with sporadic MTC. The RET S836S and 3'UTR (rs76759170 and rs3026785) variants were genotyped using Custom TaqMan Genotyping Assays. Haplotypes were inferred using the phase 2.1 program. RET mRNA structure was assessed by Vienna Package.The mean age of MTC diagnosis was 48.5±15.5 years and 57.9% were women. The minor allele frequencies of RET polymorphisms were as follows: S836S, 5.6%; rs76759170, 5.6%; rs3026785, 6.2%. We observed a strong LD among S836S and 3'UTR variants (|D'| = -1, r2 = 1 and |D'| = -1, r2 = 0,967). Patients harboring the S836S/3'UTR variants presented a higher percentage of lymph node and distant metastasis (P = 0.013 and P<0.001, respectively). Accordingly, RNA folding analyses demonstrated different RNA secondary structure predictions for WT(TCCGT), S836S(TTCGT) or 3'UTR(GTCAC) haplotypes. The S836S/3'UTR haplotype presented a greater number of double helices sections and lower levels of minimal free energy when compared to the wild-type haplotype, suggesting that these variants provides the most thermodynamically stable mRNA structure, which may have functional consequences on the rate of mRNA degradation.The RET S836S polymorphism is in LD with 3'UTR variants. In silico analysis indicate that the 3'UTR variants may affect the secondary structure of RET mRNA, suggesting that these variants might play a role in posttranscriptional control of the RET transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2269648804,"Lysine is one of the most limiting essential amino acids for humans and livestock. The nutritional value of maize (Zea mays L.) is reduced by its poor lysine content. To better understand the lysine biosynthesis pathway in maize seed, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of the genes involved in lysine biosynthesis. We identified lysine biosynthesis pathway genes (LBPGs) and investigated whether a diaminopimelate pathway variant exists in maize. We analyzed two genes encoding the key enzyme dihydrodipicolinate synthase, and determined that they contribute differently to lysine synthesis during maize seed development. A coexpression network of LBPGs was constructed using RNA-sequencing data from 21 developmental stages of B73 maize seed. We found a large set of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, elongation factors and zein proteins that were coexpressed with LBPGs. The coexpressed genes were enriched in cellular metabolism terms and protein related terms. A phylogenetic analysis of the LBPGs from different plant species revealed different relationships. Additionally, six transcription factor (TF) families containing 13 TFs were identified as the Hub TFs of the LBPGs modules. Several expression quantitative trait loci of LBPGs were also identified.

Here, proteomics was used to study the NHR mechanism of two typical substances, the compound 4880 and ovalbumin. Twelve different proteins were suggested as potential biomarkers for examining the NHR mechanism, and our results revealed that the mechanism mainly encompassed 2 processes, i.e., generation and effect processes. The generation process could be classified as direct stimulation, complement (classical and alternative), coagulation, kallikrein-kinin, and integrated pathways. Thus glutathione peroxidase 1, terminal complement complex (complement factor 4d and Bb), coagulation 13, kininogen-1, and IgE could be used as candidate biomarkers for the indication of the corresponding pathways respectively, the proteins were further confirmed by ELISA. And the effect process was mainly composed of histamine as well as proteins such as DCD and MYLPF, which could be used as important indices for the symptoms of NHR. Our study differs from previous studies in that C4880 was found to not only be involved in the direct stimulation pathway, but also in the activated complement and kallikrein-kinin pathways through the coagulation pathway. We also report for the first time that ovalbumin-induced NHR could be a combination of the coagulation, classical complement, and integrated pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2263025365,"Introduction Polymyxin B (PmB) belongs to the group of cyclic peptide antibiotics, which neutralize the activity of LPS by binding to lipid A. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of PmB on the biological activity of lipooligosaccharide (LOS E. coli B,rough form of LPS) in vitro and in experimental metastasis models. Results Cultures of murine macrophage J774A.1 cells and murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DC) stimulated in vitro with LOS and supplemented with PmB demonstrated a decrease in inflammatory cytokine production (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α) and down-regulation of CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC class II molecule expression. Additionally, PmB suspended in drinking water was given to the C57BL/6 mice seven or five days prior to the intravenous injection of B16 or LLC cells and intraperitoneal application of LOS. This strategy of PmB administration was continued throughout the duration of the experiments (29 or 21 days). In B16 model, statistically significant decrease in the number of metastases in mice treated with PmB and LOS (p<0.01) was found on the 14th day of the experiments, whereas the most intensive changes in surface-antigen expression and ex vivo production of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α by peritoneal cells were observed 7 days earlier. By contrast, antigen expression and ex vivo production of IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ by splenocytes remained relatively high and stable. Statistically significant decrease in LLC metastases number was observed after the application of LOS (p<0.01) and in the group of mice preconditioned by PmB and subsequently treated with LOS (LOS + PmB, p<0.01). Conclusions In conclusion, prolonged in vivo application of PmB was not able to neutralize the LOS-induced immune cell activity but its presence in the organism of treated mice was important in modulation of the LOS-mediated response against the development of metastases."

https://openalex.org/W2264894301,"Excessive truncation of a population’s size structure is often identified as an important deleterious effect of exploitation, yet the effect on population persistence of size-structure truncation caused by exploitation is often not quantified due to data limitations. In this study, we estimate changes in eggs per recruit (EPR) using annual length-frequency samples over a 9 year period to assess persistence of the two most important recreational fishes in southern Angola: west coast dusky kob (Argyrosomus coronus) and leerfish (Lichia amia). Using a length- and age-structured model, we improve on an existing method to fit this type of model to length-frequency data and estimate EPR. The objectives of the methodological changes are to add flexibility and robustness to the approach for assessing population status in data-limited situations. Results indicate that dusky kob presents very low levels of EPR (5%-10% of the per recruit reproductive capacity in the absence of fishing) in 2013, whereas large inter-annual variability in leerfish estimates suggest caution must be applied when drawing conclusions about its exploitation status. Using simulated length frequency data with known parameter values, we demonstrate that recruitment decline due to overexploitation leads to overestimation of EPR values. Considering the low levels of EPR estimated for the study species, recruitment limitation is not impossible and true EPR values may be even lower than our estimates. It is, therefore, likely that management action, such as the creation of Marine Protected Areas, is needed to reconstitute the west coast dusky kob population."
https://openalex.org/W2271430052,"The need for more effective anti-chlamydial therapeutics has sparked research efforts geared toward further understanding chlamydial pathogenesis mechanisms. Recent studies have implicated the secreted chlamydial serine protease, chlamydial protease-like activity factor (CPAF) as potentially important for chlamydial pathogenesis. By mechanisms that remain to be elucidated, CPAF is directed to a discrete group of substrates, which are subsequently cleaved or degraded. While inspecting the previously solved CPAF crystal structure, we discovered that CPAF contains a cryptic N-terminal PSD95 Dlg ZO-1 (PDZ) domain spanning residues 106-212 (CPAF106-212). This PDZ domain is unique in that it bears minimal sequence similarity to canonical PDZ-forming sequences and displays little sequence and structural similarity to known chlamydial PDZ domains. We show that the CPAF106-212 sequence is homologous to PDZ domains of human tight junction proteins."
