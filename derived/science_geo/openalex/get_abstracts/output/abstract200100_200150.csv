https://openalex.org/W2082096454,"Analyses of three samples of fall-out revealed the presence of the induced radioisotopes Co/sup 57/, Co/sup 58/, and Co/sup 60/. The amounts of these radioisotopes present in the samples would not constitute an internal hazard compared to the abounts of Sr/sup 90/ present in the samples. However, the Co/sup 57/, Co/sup 58/, and Co/sup 60/ values obtained indicate that these isotopes would contribute appreciably to the external gamma radiation from fall- out fields represented by the samples. The product/fission ratios of the individual nuclides were obtained. (auth)"
