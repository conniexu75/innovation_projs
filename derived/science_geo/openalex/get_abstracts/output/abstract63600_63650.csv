https://openalex.org/W1999740995,"The distribution of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and bioassay experiments both show that nitrogen is the critical limiting factor to algal growth and eutrophication in coastal marine waters. About twice the amount of phosphate as can be used by the algae is normally present. This surplus results from the low nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in terrigenous contributions, including human waste, and from the fact that phosphorus regenerates more quickly than ammonia from decomposing organic matter. Removal of phosphate from detergents is therefore not likely to slow the eutrophication of coastal marine waters, and its replacement with nitrogen-containing nitrilotriacetic acid may worsen the situation."
https://openalex.org/W1573899446,"The kinetics of catalysis of CO2 hydration by human carbonic anhydrases B and C (EC 4.2.1.1) has been reinvestigated with use of an improved pH indicator stop-flow approach that was checked by studying the uncatalyzed rate of hydration. The Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined between pH 5.8 and 8.8 in noninhibitory buffers. For both isoenzymes Km was independent of pH, whereas Vmax increased with increasing pH. These results are similar to the findings of others on bovine carbonic anhydrase, but differ from the earlier report of Gibbons and Edsall (J. Biol. Chem., 239, 2539 (1964)) in the finding that Km is pH independent. Despite the differences between the low and high activity forms of carbonic anhydrase, there are close kinetic similarities between them that indicate underlying similarities in active site structure. Imidazole inhibits the B enzyme, apparently competitively, but has no effect on the C enzyme. N-Methyl substitution of imidazole abolishes its inhibitory effect. Nitrous oxide does not inhibit catalysis of CO2 hydration by either of the two human isoenzymes, or by bovine carbonic anhydrase. The infrared absorption studies of Riepe and Wang (J. Biol. Chem., 243, 2779 (1968)) had indicated that N2O and CO2 bind competitively to a site identified as the substrate-binding site. The present kinetic results are interpreted as representing a great specificity of carbonic anhydrase for the binding of its substrate CO2. It is proposed that the enzyme-catalyzed hydration of CO2 requires, not only water activation by a basic group, but also charge neutralization in the transition state by an electron acceptor function. The zinc-bound water in carbonic anhydrase could be involved in both donor and acceptor roles."

https://openalex.org/W1490796893,"Abstract Studies have been made of the effects of nucleotides on binding of 125I-glucagon at its specific binding sites in plasma membranes of rat liver. GTP and GDP, equally and at a minimal concentration of 0.05 µm, stimulate the rate and degree of dissociation of bound labeled hormone, decrease uptake of glucagon by the membranes, and decrease the affinity of the binding sites for glucagon. These effects of the nucleotides are concentration-dependent, reversible, and rapid in onset. Divalent metal ions are not required for the actions of the nucleotides which act equally at 0° or 30°. 5'-Methylene guanylyl-diphosphonate, a nonphosphorylating analogue of GTP, mimicked the effects of GTP or GDP on glucagon binding although at 100 times the concentration of the natural nucleotides. Based on these observations and the finding that the nucleotides do not act competitively with glucagon, it is suggested that GTP or GDP regulate glucagon binding by an allosteric type of action. This action of the guanyl nucleotides is inhibited by a sulfhydryl reagent (p-chloromercuri-benzoate), which also inhibits binding of glucagon. Sodium fluoride, which stimulates adenyl cyclase activity in liver membranes, has no effect on either the binding of glucagon or on the actions of guanyl nucleotides on this process. ATP, ADP, UTP, and CTP act similarly to the guanyl nucleotides on the glucagon binding process but only at concentrations greater than 0.1 mm. Cyclic 3', 5'-GMP, 5'-GMP, and the corresponding adenine nucleotides are inactive on the glucagon-binding process."
https://openalex.org/W2075051413,Threshold spectral sensitivity of primate eyes is the upper envelope of the sensitivity of three response channels. Sensitivity in the green and red channels is modeled as linear difference functions reflecting neural interaction between cones containing photopigments with 535- and 575-nanometer peaks. Sensitivity in the blue channel seems determined by a single class of cones containing a 445-nanometer photopigment.

Cells were driven primarily by gentle manipulation of multiple joints residing on one or more limbs. Both excitatory and inhibitory convergence were demonstrated. It is postulated that the multijoint receptive fields of area 5 are the result of convergence from single-joint cells of the primary receiving area. An analogy is drawn between the modification of information in the visual and somatosensory systems.

Each protein had a molecular weight of 49,000, and each consisted of two identical polypeptide chains of 24,500 molecular weight. The proteins were immunochemically indistinguishable and had identical hemagglutinin activity and very similar compositions. LcH-B contained 4 more lysine residues per molecule than LcH-A, accounting for their different electrophoretic properties. Peptide mapping indicated that both proteins have a large majority of common primary sequence with small areas of unique sequence. Individual lentil seeds all contained both LcH-A and LcH-B, but with varying proportions depending on the source of the lentils."

https://openalex.org/W1568575011,"Abstract The α1 and α2 chains of soluble collagen from human and baboon skin were separated and cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and the resultant peptides were separated by ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography. Eight peptides from the α1 chain and six from the α2 chain accounted for the weight and amino acid content of both collagens. Only small differences of questionable significance could be detected between the collagens of the two primate species by amino acid analysis or molecular weight of the peptides. The amino-terminal cross-link region of both the α1 and α2 chain is identical in both species. The peptides are very similar to those previously isolated from the rat and the chick, demonstrating a close homology in the helical portion of the molecule and, to a lesser extent, in the amino-terminal crosslink region."
https://openalex.org/W1602736453,"Abstract Previous observations (Mauck, J., and Glaser, L., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 39, 699 (1970)) on the turnover of the cell wall of Bacillus subtilis W-23 during logarithmic growth have been extended to show that (a) freshly synthesized wall does not become available for turnover for about one-half to one generation; (b) the turnover rates of the cell wall mucopeptide and cell wall teichoic acid are identical; (c) the products of cell wall turnover can be isolated from the growth medium and are the products of cell wall cleavage by an N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase. Cell wall turnover has also been observed in Bacillus megaterium strain KM in logarithmic growth phase. Preliminary studies with inhibitors suggest that turnover is dependent on new cell wall deposition. The implications of these observations for the mechanism of cell wall growth are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1591660320,"Abstract Group A meningococcal polysaccharide was shown to be a homopolymer of d-mannosamine phosphate which is partially N- and O-acetylated. The principal glycosidic bond in this polysaccharide seems to be a 1—6 phosphodiester bond involving the hemiacetal group of carbon 1 and the alcohol group of carbon 6 of the d-mannosamine. There is also evidence to suggest that other glycosidic linkages exist. The exact nature and the position of these linkages are not yet known. The average chain length of this polysaccharide determined by reducing group analysis is 93 residues. The molecular weight of the polymer is in excess of 100,000 which implies that there are several chains in the A polysaccharide. A procedure has been developed for the determination of reducing group present in an oligosaccharide. This procedure was developed based on the observation that, when a hexosamine such as mannosamine or glucosamine was first treated with sodium borohydride to convert the carbonyl function into an alcohol, the resulting aminohexitol remained qualitatively and quantitatively unchanged by subsequent treatment with the oxidizing agent K3Fe(CN)6 at 100° for 10 min, whereas hexosamine similarly treated with K3Fe-(CN)6 was quantitatively destroyed. When dealing with an oligosaccharide consisting of hexosamine which had been treated with sodium borohydride, the ratio of the values of two analyses, one performed before oxidation with K3Fe(CN)6 and the other after, yields the fraction of hexosamine with its reducing group free."

https://openalex.org/W1591755830,"Abstract The rate of the ATP:glucose transphosphorylase reaction catalyzed by yeast hexokinase, isozyme Pii, is inhibited by lowering the pH of the reaction below 7.0, especially at suboptimal concentrations of ATP. This effect of acidity is largely overcome by activators such as orthophosphate, citrate, malate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and riboside triphosphates. Thus, in the acid range, ATP appears to serve both as an activator and a substrate with the result that 1/v versus 1/[ATP] plots are nonlinear. It appears that yeast hexokinase may exist as two conformational isomers, an inactive form which is favored in the acid range and an active form favored by various polyanions or by alkaline pH. The conversion of inactive to active enzyme by citrate is slow, requiring about 1 min at 25° when citrate is added to the reaction mixture after the substrates. When citrate is added to the enzyme simultaneously with both substrates, the reaction begins at the fully activated rate indicating that only the ternary complex can undergo the conversion to inactive enzyme. Equilibrium isotope exchange experiments indicate that citrate activates the glucose ⇄ glucose 6-phosphate, ADP ⇄ ATP, and glucose-6-P ⇄ ATP exchanges equally. This is consistent with the idea that the ternary complex is undergoing the allosteric interconversions. Native hexokinase assayed inside semipermeable yeast cells exhibits the same kinetic properties as the isolated native enzyme, indicating that the activation phenomena may be important in controlling the rate of hexokinase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1512770567,"Abstract Bovine and human B erythrocyte carbonic anhydrases substituted with Co2+ cause an enhancement of the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate of solvent water protons (T1-1) at high pH that is decreased by the addition of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as azide and Ethoxzolamide. The part of T1-1 which can be inhibited by Ethoxzolamide is due to exchangeable protons located at the active site of the enzyme. This inhibitable part of T1-1 is pH-dependent with a pK of 7.0 ± 0.2 for the bovine cobalt enzyme and a pK of 8.2 ± 0.2 for the human B cobalt enzyme. From the magnetic field dependence of the inhibitable part of T1-1, a correlation time for the dipolar interaction of a proton with a cobalt electronic spin of 10-11 sec, a proton-cobalt distance of 2.5 to 2.9 A, and for the bovine enzyme a proton residence time, τm, small compared to 10-5 sec are calculated. We conclude from the pH dependence and the proton-cobalt distance that the proton which contributes to the inhibitable part of T1-1 is located either on a hydroxide ion bound to the Co2+ at the active site or on a water molecule with 1 proton hydrogen bonded to a nearby residue. In contrast to the similarity of the inhibitable part of T1-1 for the bovine and human B cobalt enzymes, there is a non-inhibitable, pH-independent contribution resulting from the cobalt substitution, relatively large for the bovine enzyme and very small for the human B enzyme, that is not understood. The contributions of the (diamagnetic) native zinc enzymes to T1-1 have also been measured. As in the case of apotransferrin (Koenig, S. H., and Schillinger, W. E., J. Biol. Chem., 244, 3283 (1969)), the results agree qualitatively but not quantitatively with theory."
https://openalex.org/W2032867645,"The responses of single units in the monkey lateral geniculate nucleus to different portions of figures which differed from their backgrounds in color and brightness were examined. Border enhancement was found in the response to luminance figures but not in the response to color figures. In addition, cells showed border enhancement only in the case of a figure which produced an increment (as opposed to a decrement) in their firing rates. In situations in which very striking brightness contrast is seen perceptually, the cells do not show the corresponding changes in firing rate across the whole pattern. The lateral inhibitory mechanisms found in the retina and geniculate can thus account for luminance border enhancement, but not entirely for simultaneous brightness or color contrast, for which other cortical processes of some sort must be responsible."

The levels of all of these isozymes can be determined quantitatively by immunochemical methods following their separation by electrofocusing.

https://openalex.org/W1529462858,"Abstract The rat liver enzyme, serine dehydratase (l-serine hydrolyase (deaminating), EC 4.2.1.13), has been crystallized by a slight modification of the method of Nakagawa and his associates (Nakagawa, H., Kimura, H., and Muira, S., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 28, 359 (1967)). The crystalline enzyme has been separated into two homogeneous components by means of DEAE-cellulose chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each of the two components possessed identical specific serine dehydratase activities. No differences were found in ultraviolet or visible spectra, molecular weight, cofactor or phosphate content, or immunochemical reactivity. The two crystalline isozymes had similar amino acid compositions, but one form of serine dehydratase (II) contained 1 less lysyl residue and between 1 and 2 additional prolyl residues as compared to the other (I). The two forms of the enzyme were under different metabolic regulatory controls; the more electronegative isozyme (form II) was regulated by glucagon, whereas form I, the more electropositive form, was regulated by corticosteroids. By means of pulse labeling after cortisone induction in the adrenalectomized animal, it was shown that each of the two forms are synthesized independently of the other. It is therefore concluded that the environmental regulation of the two chemically similar isozymes is quite different and the possibility of the regulation of their synthesis at the level of genetic translation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1591267214,"Abstract An inducible system for the active transport of citrate in Bacillus subtilis has been studied. Gratuitous conditions are used under which the addition of citrate to the medium results in an increased uptake of citrate into the bacteria without influencing the growth rate. Wild type cells of B. subtilis metabolize citrate quickly after it is taken up into the cells, thereby rendering transport kinetics difficult to interpret in quantitative terms. To avoid this difficulty, we investigated citrate transport in B. subtilis 60871 which carries a genetic block in aconitase activity. This strain can accumulate citrate inside the cells more than 100-fold over the citrate level in the external medium. Under these conditions citrate catabolism is insignificantly low. Citrate is transported in B. subtilis 60871 with a Vmax of 145 ± 25 µmoles per min per g, dry weight, of cells and an apparent Km of 2.3 ± 0.4 mm at 37°. These bacteria exhibit an apparent constitutivity for citrate uptake when compared with induced wild type cells. This phenomenon is probably due to endogenous induction caused by citrate accumulation as consequence of the aconitase block. Citrate uptake in B. subtilis is also regulated by catabolite repression. The steady state uptake rate of citrate into cells of the aconitase mutant previously loaded with citrate is about the same as the initial uptake rate into induced wild type cells. The outflow rate of citrate from cells of strain 60871 previously loaded with citrate to steady state was found to be only 22% of the initial uptake rate. High concentrations of citrate in the medium slightly stimulate the outflow rate. The citrate uptake system in B. subtilis is inhibited by sodium cyanide, dinitrophenol, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide."
https://openalex.org/W1484603877,"Abstract The cell wall of Streptococcus faecalis, strain N, has been found to contain two antigenic glycans, a diheteroglycan of glucose and galactose and a tetraheteroglycan of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine. The present report describes the isolation, purification, and structural and immunochemical characterization of the hitherto unknown diheteroglycan. A tentative structure has been proposed for the new glycan on the basis of structural information on oligosaccharides isolated from acid hydrolysates of the polymer and on the basis of immunological inhibition studies. Of considerable interest is the finding that, of the two major disaccharide moieties (lactosyl and gentiobiosyl) in the glycan, the lactosyl moiety is the immunodominant group."

https://openalex.org/W1574053625,"Abstract Liver microsomal apocytochromes b5 from man, monkey (Alouatta fusca), pig, and chicken were subjected to trypsin digestion, and all of the peptides were isolated and characterized. The sum of the residues present in these peptides equaled the total amino acid composition of the corresponding parent cytochrome. For all of these peptides a homologous segment was found in our previously established bovine and rabbit cytochrome sequence. This information provided sufficient evidence to construct a unique amino acid sequence for human, monkey, porcine, and chicken cytochrome b5. Comparison of the six sequences indicated a close similarity between these proteins. The human cytochrome differed from that of chicken in 15 positions but from that of monkey in only 2 positions. With the exception of the avian protein sequence, the amino acid replacements were confined predominantly to the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments of the cytochrome. A segment comprising residues 42 to 72 was invariant in all six cytochromes."
https://openalex.org/W1570405367,"Abstract Rabbit muscle 5'-AMP-aminohydrolase [EC 3.5.4.6] was sensitive to inhibition by di- and tricarboxylic acids such as succinate, maleate, fumarate, and citrate; the ADP-activated enzyme was more sensitive to these inhibitors than enzyme assayed in the presence of the activator, potassium. Citrate was competitive for ADP (Ki = 0.11 mm) and reduced the Hill slope for ADP activation from 1.7 to 1.1. Citrate also inhibited the enzyme when allowed to remain with enzyme before assay. Enzyme incubated in the presence of other metal-binding agents such as o-phenanthroline, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonate, dithioerythritol, and mercaptoethanol also showed marked inhibition as a function of time of incubation before assay. Atomic absorption analysis established the presence of 2.6 g atoms of zinc per mole of native enzyme (mol wt 278,000). No significant amounts of magnesium, calcium, iron, or cobalt were observed in the purified enzyme. Removal of zinc by 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonate decreased enzymatic activity proportionally. Apo-AMP-aminohydrolase, which contained 0.45 g atoms of zinc per mole enzyme, was readily reconstituted with Zn2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Fe2+; the cations Ni2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, and Cu2+ did not reactivate. The data suggest that AMP-aminohydrolase is a zinc metalloenzyme and that zinc is required for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1559097830,"Abstract Bacillus subtilis has been found to contain two distinct species of aspartokinase which can be separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. Aspartokinase I is specifically inhibited by meso-diaminopimelate, while aspartokinase II is subject to multivalent feedback inhibition by l-threonine and l-lysine. The two enzymes differ in many of their properties, such as molecular weight, specificity for monovalent cations, response to pH, substrate and inhibition kinetics, and interaction with nonpolar l-amino acids. While the level of aspartokinase I is little affected by growth conditions, the specific activity of aspartokinase II declines near the end of exponential growth and is depressed in rich media. The physiological role of the two enzymes and their relation to the aspartokinases of other Bacillus species are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1533156803,"The secretion of alkaline phosphatase by Micrococcus sodonensis has been studied by observing the production and accumulation of extracellular enzyme by log phase cells which have been resuspended in fresh growth medium. The accumulation of extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity is the result of a selective permeation process and is totally dependent upon the presence of divalent cation. Although calcium is an actual component of the enzyme and is required for both catalytic activity and enzyme stability, magnesium appears to be the divalent cation required for the actual synthesis or release (or both) of alkaline phosphatase from the cell. Studies with various inhibitors of protein synthesis suggest that the bacterial cell may possess at least two distinct sites of protein synthesis, one site functioning to provide intracellular and cell-associated proteins and another for the synthesis of extracellular proteins. The over-all process of enzyme secretion is markedly temperature-dependent and is characterized by an activation energy of 55 kcal per mole. This observation suggests that the rate-limiting step in alkaline phosphatase secretion is probably not an enzyme-catalyzed event. A relatively small but significant amount of alkaline phosphatase activity exists in a cell-bound form and can be quantitatively released from cells by treatment with lysozyme. Although lysozyme-sensitive cell wall components are involved in the binding of alkaline phosphatase to the cell, the cell wall is not an obligatory component of the secretion process since lysozyme-prepared, sucrose-stabilized protoplasts are capable of extracellular enzyme production."

https://openalex.org/W1595197136,"Abstract A short-lived new spectral species of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, a trivalent non-heme iron-containing enzyme, was observed in the early stage of the reaction. This new spectral species was characterized by a broad absorption band with a maximum between 500 and 520 mµ, distinct from those of the enzyme or the enzyme-protocatechuic acid complex. It could be demonstrated only in the presence of both protocatechuic acid and molecular oxygen. The rate constant for the decomposition of this species determined by the stopped flow analysis agreed quite well with the turnover number of the enzyme as determined by the over-all reaction. During the steady state of the reaction, a similar spectral species could be shown with substrate analogues which were metabolized more slowly than protocatechuic acid. Based on these findings, the new spectral species was interpreted to represent an oxygenated form of the enzyme, namely a ternary complex of oxygen, substrate, and enzyme, and to be an obligatory intermediate in the reaction."

The vegetative cell enzyme was shown to have a molecular weight of 88,000 to 92,000 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in the presence or absence of 10 mm potassium phosphate by the high speed equilibrium method at low protein concentration. Spore purine nucleoside phosphorylase had a minimal molecular weight of 47,000 in the absence of phosphate and 95,000 in the presence of 10 mm phosphate. The cell and spore enzymes sedimented as single symmetrical peaks with unextrapolated S20, w values of 5.5 S and 5.3 S, respectively, in the absence of phosphate. In 10 mm phosphate the spore purine nucleoside phosphorylase had a S20, w value of 5.7 S and the cell enzyme was unchanged. The cell enzyme was a tetramer while that from spores underwent a phosphate-induced association from dimer to tetramer. Subunit analysis indicated that the polypeptide chains from the cell and spore enzymes had molecular weights of 24,000. The catalytic properties of both the spore and cell enzymes were similar. The Michaelis constants with inosine for the cell and spore enzymes were 4.6 x 10-4 m and 7.0 x 10-4 m, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1514286300,"Abstract Bacillus subtilis glutamine synthetase readily reacts with iodoacetamide, producing very specific changes in the catalytic parameters characteristic of the native enzyme. The alkylation reaction is influenced both by substrates and feedback inhibitors of the enzyme; whereas ammonia and glutamate are without effect, Mg2+-ATP enhances the alkylation reaction, and Mn2+-ATP effectively prevents the catalytic changes that accompany incubation of the enzyme with the alkylating agent. Histidine, tryptophan, and glutamine also potentiate the response of the enzyme to iodoacetamide. With limited alkylation, a marked increase in activity is seen using Mn2+ as divalent cation, a sharp reduction in specific activity is seen in the assay using Mg2+ as divalent cation, and the response of the enzyme to feedback inhibitors is altered. Whereas these changes in B. subtilis catalytic activity are qualitatively similar to changes seen with enzymatic adenylylation of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase, no role in vivo for sulfhydryl modification of B. subtilis enzyme has been found. When assayed with Mn2+ as divalent cation, alkylated glutamine synthetase has a higher apparent Km for glutamate than does native enzyme; the substrate saturation function with the alkylated enzyme is hyperbolic and has lost the inhibition by high concentrations of glutamate, which is characteristic of the native enzyme. When assayed with Mg2+ as divalent cation, the alkylated enzyme shows loss of apparent affinity for glutamate at high glutamate concentrations. Sulfhydryl titration indicates that 1 cysteine residue is readily alkylated per subunit, with two to three additional groups titrated after dissociation of the enzyme. The alkylation reaction is specific for cysteine residues. These results thus provide by chemical modification of the B. subtilis glutamine synthetase a system that is qualitatively analogous to the enzymatic adenylylation of the E. coli glutamine synthetase; the results also exhibit a clear structural distinction between the two enzymes. Under similar conditions of study, the sulfhydryl groups of the B. subtilis enzyme are readily titrated by iodoacetamide, whereas those of E. coli glutamine synthetase are not accessible to the alkylating agent."

https://openalex.org/W1513078193,"Abstract The CO2 hydration activity of human carbonic anhydrase B is rapidly inactivated by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene at neutral pH. The inactivation reaction is second order and is retarded by the presence of various enzyme inhibitors. The second order rate constant for inactivation is about 100 times the second order rate constant for the reaction of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and α-N-acetylhistidine. The inactivated enzyme was purified and was found to contain one 2,4-dinitrophenyl group per molecule, at the 3' position of a histidine residue. While such a reacted enzyme has lost more than 95% of its CO2 hydration activity, it retains over half its esterase activity. The dinitrophenyl group can be quantitatively removed by thiolysis, regenerating a fully active native carbonic anhydrase. Dinitrophenyl carbonic anhydrase binds iodoacetate with somewhat greater affinity than the unmodified enzyme. However, iodoacetate does not react covalently with the dinitrophenyl enzyme, as it does with the native enzyme. Analysis of the tryptic peptides of dinitrophenyl carbonic anhydrase shows that reaction takes place with histidine residue 204, the same residue modified by iodoacetate. It is suggested that histidine 204, while clearly in the active site, may not play any direct role in enzyme catalysis. Modifications at this position may disrupt the normal substrate binding site."

This finding agrees with earlier results concerning replication after amino acid starvation in this organism. The results are not compatible with regulation of chromosome replication at the initiation step only, and they suggest that a second regulatory circuit controls replication under conditions of amino acid starvation."
