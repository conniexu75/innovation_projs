https://openalex.org/W2087641521,"The principles of ecological succession bear importantly on the relationships between man and nature. The framework of successional theory needs to be examined as a basis for resolving man’s present environmental crisis. Most ideas pertaining to the development of ecological systems are based on descriptive data obtained by observing changes in biotic communities over long periods, or on highly theoretical assumptions; very few of the generally accepted hypotheses have been tested experimentally. Some of the confusion, vagueness, and lack of experimental work in this area stems from the tendency of ecologists to regard “succession” as a single straightforward idea; in actual fact, it entails an interacting complex of processes, some of which counteract one another."

https://openalex.org/W1565884843,"During the course of an investigation of the synthesis and secretion of bacterial extracellular enzymes, Bacillus stearothermophilus α-amylase was found to be different from that previously described. Repetition of the purification procedure for the enzyme yielded crystals which were identical in appearance with those reported to be B. stearothermophilus α-amylase, but which are not in fact the enzyme. A new purification procedure for the enzyme has been devised. The purified enzyme was found to have properties different from the unique ones previously described for B. stearothermophilus α-amylase, but resembled those of other α-amylases. The molecular weight was approximately 53,000, and it also resembled other bacterial extracellular enzymes in lacking cyst(e)ine. Although the enzyme was capable of hydrolyzing starch at temperatures of 70° and above, it did not possess unusual thermostability. The enzyme was protected from thermal denaturation above 55° by metal ions, particularly Ca2+, and by protein. The purified B. stearothermophilus enzyme is 50% inactivated in 24 hours at 6° while completely stable at 25°. It is concluded that the enzyme studied here does not have the semi-random coil structure previously reported for an α-amylase produced by B. stearothermophilus."
https://openalex.org/W1968891182,A mnode-locked laser was used to measure fluorescence decay down to 80 picoseconds. Measurements on the fluorescence of methylene blue quenchled with potassium iodide demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Fluorescence decay times of chlorophyll b (3.87 +/- 0.05 nianoseconds) and c-phycocyanin (1.14 +/- 0.01 nanoseconds) in vitro and chlorophyll a in the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa (1.14 to 1.6 nanoseconds) compare well with some of the existing data.

https://openalex.org/W1974641817,"RECENT work with adenovirus1, Sindbis virus2 and the viruses causing influenza3, measles4, vesicular stomatitis5 and German measles6 has shown that subunits of the viruses can stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies, and in some cases can be used as vaccines. Subunits are usually present in unfractionated virus preparations and in the case of the lipid-containing viruses can also be produced from complete virus particles by treating with ‘Tween’-ether or a detergent, for example, sodium deoxycholate or sodium dodecyl sulphate. The use of subunits for immunization has the important advantage that it avoids the side effects from other components of the virus. We report here preliminary experiments with rabies virus in which subunits separated from virus suspensions were shown to be potentially useful for protection against the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1545204869,"Abstract Radioactive bisnorbiotin, α-dehydrobisnorbiotin, tetranorbiotin, urea, and uracil have been isolated from culture filtrates of a pseudomonad grown on a biotin-salts medium to which 14C-carbonyl-labeled biotin was added. These findings establish that the side chain of biotin is degraded by β-oxidation with loss of 2 acetate units, and that after the complete degradation of the side chain of biotin, oxidation of both carbons bridging the ureido to thiophane rings occurs, producing urea which is degraded to CO2 and NH3 by urease. The relatively high radioactivity found in uracil may indicate not only the participation of carbamyl phosphate from the CO2 and NH3 produced from urea, but an additional direct cyclization of a catabolite which retains the ureido function."

Taylor and Muller-Eberhard4 observed that blocking either fibrinogen or γM-globulin with specific antibody prevented normal retraction and lysis of dilute whole-blood clots prepared by the technique of Fearnley et al.4. Because platelets are also necessary for a normal response4, their studies suggested that the fibrinogen and γM-globulin adsorbed onto the platelets play an essential part in the process."
