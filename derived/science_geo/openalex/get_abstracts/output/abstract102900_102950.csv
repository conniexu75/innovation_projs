We show that in the glucose-responsive β-cell line INS-1, major secretagogue-stimulated signaling pathways converge to activate 44-kDa mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Thus, glucose-induced insulin secretion was found to be associated with a small stimulatory effect on 44-kDa MAP kinase, which was synergistically enhanced by increased levels of intracellular cAMP and by the hormonal secretagogues glucagon-like peptide-1 and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide. Activation of 44-kDa MAP kinase by glucose was dependent on Ca2+ influx and may in part be mediated by MEK-1, a MAP kinase kinase. Stimulation of Ca2+ influx by KCl was in itself sufficient to activate 44-kDa MAP kinase and MEK-1. Phorbol ester, an activator of protein kinase C, stimulated 44-kDa MAP kinase by both Ca2+-dependent and -independent pathways. Nerve growth factor, independently of changes in cytosolic Ca2+, efficiently stimulated 44-kDa MAP kinase without causing insulin release, indicating that activation of this kinase is not sufficient for secretion. In the presence of glucose, however, nerve growth factor potentiated insulin secretion. In INS-1 cells, activation of 44-kDa MAP kinase was partially correlated with the induction of early response genes junB, nur77, and zif268 but not with stimulation of DNA synthesis. Our findings suggest a role of 44-kDa MAP kinase in mediating some of the pleiotropic actions of secretagogues on the pancreatic β-cell.

With increasing agonist dose, the frequency but not the amplitude of the Ca2+ waves increased. Intracellular Ca2+ wave rates were constant, but transcellular signal propagation was determined by agonist dose, giving rise to a dose-dependent increase in the rate at which Ca2+ waves spread through the liver. At high vasopressin doses, a single Ca2+ wave was observed and the direction of Ca2+ wave propagation was reversed, initiating in the pericentral region and spreading to the periportal region.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6187) Google Scholar), isolated hepatocytes respond with oscillations or periodic spiking of cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]icytosolic free [Ca2+]InsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateBSPbromosulfophthaleinBSAbovine serum albumin. when challenged with agonists coupled to the second messenger InsP3(2Woods N.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the subcellular level these [Ca2+]i oscillations occur as waves of [Ca2+]i increase that initiate from a discrete subcellular locus(4Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Thomas A.P. Renard D.C. Rooney T.A.

Although [Ca2+]ioscillations and waves are observed in many isolated cell preparations (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6187) Google Scholar, 7Rooney T.A. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 674-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the possibility remains that these phenomena may not occur in intact tissues where gap junctions and other forms of cell-cell interaction can modify signal transduction in the individual cells. In isolated cell preparations that maintain or establish gap junctions, [Ca2+]i changes have been shown to pass between cells and this can result in intercellular propagation of a [Ca2+]i wave(8Saez J.C.

However, [Ca2+]i wave propagation is not an automatic consequence of the existence of a syncytium, since monolayers of epithelial or glial cells, which propagate intercellular [Ca2+]i waves when stimulated mechanically, demonstrate asynchronous [Ca2+]i oscillations that do not propagate into neighboring cells(10Charles A.C. Merrill J.E. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 983-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 11Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J.

Another property of [Ca2+]i oscillations observed in isolated cells that may be regulated differently in intact tissues is the control of oscillation frequency by agonist dose. Frequency modulation of [Ca2+]i oscillations has been proposed to play an important role in determining the extent and targeting of cellular [Ca2+]i responses(1Berridge M.J.

The livers of anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-250 g) were perfused in situ via the hepatic portal vein with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer(3Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For most experiments the median lobe of the liver was studied and other lobes were tied off with silk thread and excised (perfusion adjusted to maintain ~3.5 ml/min/g, wet weight). The remaining liver was then removed from the rat and perfused with buffer composed of (in mM): 121 NaCl, 25 HEPES, 5 NaHCO3, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.3 CaCl2, 5.5 glucose, 0.5 glutamine, 3 lactate, 0.3 pyruvate, 0.2 bromosulfophthalein (BSP), 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4, equilibrated with 100% O2 at 30°C. BSP, a competitive anion transport inhibitor, was included to inhibit loss of Ca2+ indicator dyes from the hepatocytes(15Thomas A.P. Delaville F. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 1-54Google Scholar). BSP did not affect liver viability or alter [Ca2+]i oscillations when added to isolated hepatocytes. 2L. D. Robb-Gaspers and A. P. Thomas, unpublished observations. After 20-30 min of initial perfusion, Ca2+-sensitive indicators were loaded by recirculating 60 ml of perfusion buffer containing the acetoxymethyl ester (2-5 μM) plus 0.003% Pluronic F-127 and 2% BSA for 30 min. The liver was immobilized with gauze sheets anchored to a microscope imaging chamber constructed from a 100-mm Petri dish with a 24 × 50-mm glass coverslip inserted into the base. The nonrecirculating perfusion was maintained by gravity feed. Hormones and other agents were infused via a mixing chamber 15 cm upstream of the liver using a syringe pump at 1-2% of perfusate flow. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained from fluo3-loaded livers using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope (488 nm excitation). Optical slice thickness determined under the experimental conditions (Bio-Rad technical bulletin 101) ranged from 5 μm using a 60× objective to 125 μm at 10×. To visualize the spatial organization of Ca2+ signals measured with the single wavelength confocal microscope system, these image data are presented as the actual fluorescence depicted on a gray scale with the [Ca2+]i change at each time point displayed as a yellowoverlay. The [Ca2+]i changes were calculated by subtraction of sequential fluorescence images, and the intensity of the overlay is proportional to the fluorescence change at each point. The difference images were processed with a 3 × 3 median filter and a minimum threshold to remove high frequency noise. The fura2 fluorescence was monitored using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and alternating excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm, as described previously (3Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rooney T.A. Renard D.C. Sass E. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12272-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Values for [Ca2+]i were calculated from the 340/380 nm ratio after correction for autofluorescence and out of focus information(15Thomas A.P. Delaville F. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 1-54Google Scholar, 17Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Images of autofluorescence were obtained at the end of each experiment by perfusion of the liver for 10 min with 100 μM MnCl2 in Ca2+-free medium. Deblurring of the nonconfocal fura2 fluorescence images was achieved using the deconvolution algorithm described by Monck et al.(18Monck J.R. Oberhauser A.F. Keating T.J. Fernandez J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similar [Ca2+]i values were obtained when the fluorescence of individual cells was corrected by subtraction of fluorescence signals from neighboring sinusoidal regions. Calibration parameters for fura2 were determined in vitro, a Kd value of 184 nM was used. Fluorescence imaging of fura2- or fluo3-loaded perfused liver lobes at a focal plane 25-50 μm into the tissue revealed the typical hepatic structure of sheets of hepatocytes separated by open sinusoids (Fig. 1). Larger dark areas are due to hepatic venules in the pericentral zones of the lobule. Identification of the lobular organization was achieved by infusion of fluorescein-BSA, which first appeared in periportal zones and then spread rapidly through the sinusoids to pericentral zones. Infusion of vasopressin resulted in increases of [Ca2+]i, which occurred first in a limited number of hepatocytes in each lobule and then spread progressively through adjacent cells. At low doses of vasopressin, the [Ca2+]i increases occurred as periodic [Ca2+]i spikes. Fig. 2A shows [Ca2+]i values calculated for one hepatocyte in a fura2-loaded perfused liver. After an initial latent period, 100 pM vasopressin initiated a series of [Ca2+]i oscillations, the frequency of which was increased when the infusion of vasopressin was stepped to 500 pM. At higher vasopressin concentrations, the [Ca2+]i increase was sustained or decayed slowly to basal with no subsequent [Ca2+]i oscillations in the continuing presence of the hormone (Fig. 2B). The rate of rise and maximum amplitude of [Ca2+]i increase within each cell was the same for all agonist doses, and although the calibrated [Ca2+]i values were somewhat lower than we calculated for isolated hepatocytes, the rise time was very similar (2-6 s)(3Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also in agreement with our isolated hepatocyte studies, the latent period to the first [Ca2+]i rise decreased with increasing vasopressin dose. Thus, hepatocytes in the intact liver respond to vasopressin with frequency-modulated [Ca2+]i oscillations that are similar in character to those observed previously in isolated hepatocytes(2Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S.R. Cobbold P.H. Nature. 1986; 319: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 3Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol.

The data of panel B are derived from a different liver.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The [Ca2+]i oscillations of individual cells in the intact liver did not occur independently. Remarkably, all of the hepatocytes visible in a single lobule (400-600 cells) were entrained to the same frequency and pattern of oscillation. Underlying this phenomenon was a propagation of the [Ca2+]i changes between cells, such that the rising phase of each [Ca2+]i oscillation spread sequentially through neighboring hepatocytes. Fig. 2C shows [Ca2+]i oscillations from Fig. 2A on an expanded time scale overlaid with the [Ca2+]i response of a second cell 40 μm further along the same hepatic plate. The [Ca2+]i oscillations in the two hepatocytes have the same periodicity, but are phase-shifted due to the propagation of the [Ca2+]i signals from one cell to the next. This intercellular propagation of the [Ca2+]i oscillations resulted in a series of [Ca2+]i waves (one for each oscillation) that spread through the lobule. The low magnification confocal images of Fig. 1A show the path of [Ca2+]i wave propagation for several lobules. In each lobule the [Ca2+]i increase was detected first in a small number of cells in the periportal zone and then a wave of [Ca2+]i increase spread radially through the hepatocytes toward the central veins. At vasopressin doses that caused [Ca2+]i oscillations, each oscillation started in the same periportal cells and propagated through the lobule in a similar manner. Thus, the [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency of these initiating cells sets the frequency and pattern for the entire lobule. The periportal initiation of the [Ca2+]i waves was observed for all livers during coordinated [Ca2+]i oscillations. However, with suprathreshold doses of vasopressin that gave only a single [Ca2+]i increase, the path of wave propagation was reversed and the [Ca2+]i waves initiated in the pericentral zones. Although the [Ca2+]i increase still spread through the lobule as a wave under these conditions, discontinuities along the wave path suggested initiation at multiple loci through the lobule or propagation from cells outside the focal plane. The fact that the path of [Ca2+]i wave propagation was dependent on agonist dose suggests that the [Ca2+]i waves are not secondary to the perfusion flow through the liver. This is supported by the maintenance of the wave path for many oscillation cycles during continuous vasopressin perfusion. In addition, when a liver was first perfused with low vasopressin via the portal vein and then the flow was reversed by perfusion from the hepatic vein, infusion of vasopressin from both directions caused [Ca2+]i oscillations initiating from the periportal zones. Termination of intralobular [Ca2+]i waves occurred either at the hepatic venules or as a result of collision annihilation. An example of [Ca2+]i wave annihilation is shown in Fig. 1B, where [Ca2+]i wave fronts propagating from the two sides of the imaged region (first shown at 17.3 s) are seen to collide in the images of 23.1-26.0 s. This example is from a liver giving a single pericentral to periportal [Ca2+]i wave to high vasopressin. Fig. 3 shows higher magnification confocal images of [Ca2+]i wave propagation at a dose of vasopressin causing [Ca2+]i oscillations. The arrows superimposed on the initial image show the propagation paths for three parallel hepatic plates near to the portal tract. In agreement with our studies in isolated hepatocytes(4Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Thomas A.P. Renard D.C. Rooney T.A. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the [Ca2+]i oscillations within individual hepatocytes of the intact liver occurred as [Ca2+]i waves initiating from discrete loci and then propagating throughout the cell. In some cases the [Ca2+]i increase in the first cell to respond in a hepatic plate initiated from the sinusoidal membrane (see cell at leftcenter responding 31.6-37.3 s in Fig. 3). In others the first [Ca2+]i increase spread from the center of the cell (see cell at upperleft responding at 43.1 s in Fig. 3), suggesting propagation from a cell out of the focal plane. For subsequent cells in each hepatic plate, the [Ca2+]i waves generally initiated from the membrane region in contact with the previously responding cell. There was a marked lag as [Ca2+]i waves propagated between cells, such that [Ca2+]i wave fronts arriving at cell-cell boundaries often did not appear in the next cell for several seconds (e.g. from 37.3 to 45.9 s for the first and second cells in the middle of the three hepatic plates indicated in Fig. 3). This lag presumably reflects the time taken for the propagating message to pass between cells. During each oscillation in a series, the same cell in each hepatic plate responded initially, and the inter- and intracellular paths of [Ca2+]i wave propagation were the same. This suggests that certain cells acted as pacemakers for each lobule, driving the successive waves of [Ca2+]i increase that underlie the entrained lobular [Ca2+]i oscillations. Consistent with this, specific cells have been found to initiate the synchronized [Ca2+]i oscillations in isolated groups of 2-4 hepatocytes(13Combettes L. Tran D. Tordjmann T. Laurent M. Berthon B. Claret M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the rate of [Ca2+]i wave propagation within isolated hepatocytes (20-25 μm/s) is the same for a variety of agonists and is independent of agonist dose(4Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Thomas A.P. Renard D.C. Rooney T.A. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Rooney T.A. Renard D.C. Sass E. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12272-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular [Ca2+]i waves in the intact liver were also unaffected by agonist dose and fell within the same range as the [Ca2+]i waves in isolated hepatocytes (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the intracellular [Ca2+]i wave rates, the time required for propagation of [Ca2+]i increases between cells (the transcellular lag period) was sensitive to agonist concentration, and decreased with increasing vasopressin dose (Fig. 4B). This gave rise to a dose-dependent increase in the rate at which [Ca2+]i waves spread through the liver (Fig. 4C). Under conditions giving rise to maximal [Ca2+]i increases, the rate of spread through the lobule sometimes exceeded the intracellular [Ca2+]i wave rate. This may reflect the existence of multiple origination points along the [Ca2+]i wave path at high agonist doses, as noted above. The mean intercellular [Ca2+]i wave rate for vasopressin doses giving sustained [Ca2+]i increases was 39.9 ± 4.5 μm/s (n = 7 livers). There was considerable variation between livers in the vasopressin dose range that gave [Ca2+]i oscillations versus sustained [Ca2+]i increases. Therefore, the data in Fig. 4(A-C) are from single livers. In order to combine the dose-response data for intercellular [Ca2+]i waves, the rates at which the waves spread through the lobule were plotted against the frequency for all vasopressin treatments that gave rise to [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that the rate of intercellular [Ca2+]i wave propagation was determined by vasopressin dose, and this can be ascribed to the effect of vasopressin concentration on the transcellular lag period for [Ca2+]i wave propagation between adjacent cells. We have investigated a number of possible mechanisms for the propagation of [Ca2+]i waves through the hepatic lobule. As discussed above, the path of [Ca2+]i wave propagation is not secondary to the flow of perfusate. Moreover, the fact that the direction of the [Ca2+]i waves remains the same when the flow is reversed suggests that release of an extracellular paracrine signal is unlikely to be involved. A wave of activated Ca2+ influx at the plasma membrane can also be excluded, because vasopressin still induced both intracellular and intercellular [Ca2+]i waves when CaCl2 was omitted from the perfusate (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that both Ca2+ and InsP3 pass through gap junctions in isolated hepatocyte couplets(8Saez J.C. Connor J.A. Spray D.C. Bennett M.V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In addition, propagation of [Ca2+]i waves between lung epithelial cells appears to depend on diffusion of InsP3 through gap junctions(11Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Science. 1992; 258: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Gap junction coupling can be blocked in these preparations with chemical agents such as octanol, carbeneoxolene, and halothane. However, infusion of these compounds into the liver either had no effect (perhaps due to buffering or other forms of uptake by cells proximal to the inflow of perfusate) or caused substantial damage to the areas of the liver visible to the imaging system and abolished all [Ca2+]i responses. Despite the inconclusive data described above, the most likely form of intercellular communication underlying the spread of [Ca2+]i waves in the intact liver is through gap junctions. It has been suggested that, in lung epithelial cells, intercellular [Ca2+]i waves may result from InsP3 diffusion from a single activated cell(19Sneyd J. Charles A.C. Sanderson M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C293-C302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the much greater distances and three-dimensional structure involved in the intact liver, such a mechanism would almost certainly require some form of regeneration of the diffusing signal. For InsP3 this might be achieved through a process of Ca2+ activation of phospholipase C. An alternative mechanism would rely on a subthreshold elevation of InsP3 throughout the liver (induced by the global perfusion with vasopressin), which then forms an excitable medium through which [Ca2+]i waves can propagate as a result of the feedback activation of InsP3 receptors by Ca2+. This is directly analogous to the process that has been proposed to underlie subcellular [Ca2+]i waves in Xenopus oocytes(20Lechleiter J. Girard S. Peralta E. Clapham D. Science. 1991; 252: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 21Atri A. Amundson J. Clapham D. Sneyd J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1727-1739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Regenerative Ca2+ release mechanisms of this type can explain the constant rate and amplitude of [Ca2+]i waves within hepatocytes, independent of agonist dose, and the modulation of oscillation frequency can be explained by a dose-dependent increase in the rate of activation of the trigger Ca2+ pool(7Rooney T.A. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 674-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The fact that the time required to propagate [Ca2+]i waves between cells in the perfused liver (transcellular lag period) was inversely dependent on agonist dose suggests that the concentration of message passing between hepatocytes is controlled by the agonist, which would implicate InsP3 rather than Ca2+. However, intercellular [Ca2+]i waves could also be driven by Ca2+ passing through the gap junctions if the amount of trigger Ca2+ required is determined by the level of InsP3 in the next cell, or if Ca2+ activation of phospholipase C is involved. Another alternative is that agonist dose controls gap junction permeability, independently of [Ca2+]i. The nature of the pacemaker-like cells initiating the oscillatory [Ca2+]i waves from the periportal zones of the liver remains to be elucidated. One possibility is a difference in the signal transduction system that results in a greater sensitivity to low vasopressin levels. However, in situ hybridization measurements of vasopressin V1a receptor mRNA expression have shown a gradient that is highest in pericentral hepatocytes and decreases toward the periportal cells(22Ostrowski N.L.

This distribution could explain the pericentral initiation of non-oscillatory [Ca2+]i increases, but argues against a role for vasopressin receptor distribution in the portal origin of [Ca2+]i oscillations. Nevertheless, the initiating hepatocytes of the periportal zone could be established by enhanced sensitivity due to other elements of the signaling system, including the G-protein/phospholipase C system, a higher basal level of InsP3, or a greater efficacy of InsP3 for releasing Ca2+. The present study demonstrates for the first time that intracellular [Ca2+]i oscillations and waves can occur in an integral tissue, composed of multiple cell types and a circulatory system in the configuration existing in vivo. The frequency of the hepatocyte [Ca2+]i oscillations was regulated by vasopressin dose (frequency modulation), whereas the amplitude and rate of intracellular [Ca2+]i waves were not. The oscillatory [Ca2+]i responses were organized in the intact liver, such that each [Ca2+]i oscillation initiated in the periportal zone and spread throughout the lobule as an intercellular wave. This coordination of Ca2+ signaling may have important consequences for hepatic function. Previous studies have shown oscillations of Ca2+ release into the perfusate from intact perfused rat liver(23Graf P. vom Dahl S. Sies H. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the metabolic function of the liver may oscillate. It is also possible that coordination of lobular [Ca2+]i signals may contribute to the secretion and canalicular movement of bile, which are important functions of the hepatocyte plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2030182530,"The human gene encoding thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a homeodomain-containing nuclear transcription protein of the Nkx2 gene family, was isolated and characterized. Human TTF-1 was encoded by a single gene locus spanning approximately 3.3 kilobases and consisted of two exons and a single intron. The TTF-1 cDNA and polypeptide of 371 amino acids have been highly conserved, sharing 98% identity with the rat TTF-1 polypeptide. Human TTF-1 mRNA and polypeptide were selectively expressed in human and mouse pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. In addition to its presence in thyroid gland epithelium, the human TTF-1 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in human fetal lung as early as 11 weeks of gestation, being localized in the nuclei of epithelial cells of the developing airways. After birth, TTF-1 was selectively expressed in Type II epithelial cells in the alveoli and in subsets of bronchiolar epithelial cells in the conducting regions of the lung. The 5′-flanking region of the human TTF-1 gene directed transcription of luciferase cDNA in a lung epithelial cell-selective manner.

Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: TTF-1thyroid transcription factor-1SPsurfactant proteinCCSPClara cell secretory proteinkbkilobase(s). is a 38-kDa nuclear protein initially identified as a mediator of thyroid-specific gene transcription(1Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 2Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2533-2542Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). TTF-1 contains a highly conserved homeobox domain and a 17-amino acid domain characterizing it as a member of the Nkx2 family of homeodomain transcription factors. TTF-1 activates thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase gene transcription in thyroid adenocarcinoma cells and is expressed in epithelial cells of the developing and mature thyroid gland in the rat, consistent with its role in thyroid epithelial cell gene expression(2Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2533-2542Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 3Price M. Lazzaro D. Pohl T. Mattei M. Rüther U. Olivo J.C. Duboule D. Di Lauro R.

A potential role for TTF-1 in lung epithelial cell gene expression was recently demonstrated by the finding that TTF-1 activates the transcription of human surfactant protein B gene(5Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). TTF-1 binds to two closely apposed TTF-1 DNA binding sites located −80 to −100 base pairs from the start of SP-B gene transcription. TTF-1 is also expressed in the embryonic forebrain and in the respiratory epithelium of the rat, appearing in fetal lung buds of the embryonic rat lung on postconceptional day 9 or 10(4Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). thyroid transcription factor-1 surfactant protein Clara cell secretory protein kilobase(s). Like the thyroid gland, the lung develops as an outpouching of epithelial cells from the foregut endoderm. The fetal lung then undergoes branching morphogenesis and cellular differentiation to form the complex respiratory epithelium characteristic of the mature lung. Morphologic and biochemical criteria distinguish subsets of respiratory epithelial cells that line the proximal and distal respiratory tract in mammals. A number of proteins are selectively expressed by respiratory epithelial cells, including pulmonary surfactant proteins A, B, and C and the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) (for review, see (6Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L489-L497PubMed Google Scholar)). These cellular markers distinguish subsets of cells in the conducting and alveolar region of the lung in nonciliated respiratory epithelial and alveolar Type II epithelial cells. The surfactant proteins play important roles in surfactant homeostasis, enhancing the spreading of alveolar phospholipids and contributing to the regulation of the uptake and recycling of surfactant by Type II epithelial cells. The similarity of the temporal-spatial distribution of TTF-1 and surfactant protein B in the developing lung provides further support for the potential role of TTF-1 in the regulation of surfactant function of lung epithelial cell gene expression. In the work of Bohinski et al.(5Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), the promoter elements for surfactant proteins B and C as well as the CCSP gene were transactivated by TTF-1 in vitro, suggesting that TTF-1 may also play a more general role in lung epithelial cell gene expression. While the cDNAs encoding rat (1Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and canine TTF-1 2P. H. G. Van Renterhen, G. Vassant, and D. Christophe, GenBank™ accession number X77910. have been isolated and characterized, there is less information regarding the structure and function of the TTF-1 gene and its distribution in the human lung. Because of the potential importance of TTF-1 in the differentiation and function of the respiratory epithelium, we have assessed the immunohistochemical localization of this homeodomain protein in the human respiratory epithelium. The human TTF-1 gene was isolated, and the promoter elements that contribute to the regulation of expression of TTF-1 mRNA in lung cells were identified. Restriction endonucleases and enzymes used in cloning reactions were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. A random primer kit (Stratagene) was used to radiolabel cDNA fragments with [α-32P]dCTP. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by kinase reaction. Radioisotopes were purchased from DuPont NEN. Escherichia coli DH5α or DH5αF1 was used as a host strain for pUC and pBluscript plasmids and M13 phage. A human cosmid (pWE15, Stratagene) genomic library was kindly provided by Dr. A. Menon (University of Cincinnati College of Medicine) and screened using a 1.3-kb rat TTF-1 cDNA clone, a gift from Dr. R. Di Lauro (Stazione Zoologica “Anton Dohrn,” Naples, Italy). Hybridization was performed at 60°C under conditions recommended for Hybond (Amersham Corp.). The final wash was in 0.2 × SSC (1 × SSC, pH 7.0: 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate) at 65°C. Positive colonies were screened at lower density an additional three times to achieve colony purity. Filters were exposed to Kodak XAR film at −80°C for 2 nights. Three genomic equivalents were screened in duplicate, and two positive clones were identified. Initial restriction analyses of the two clones were identical, so one clone was selected for more detailed analysis. DNA from human lung adenocarcinoma line H441-4 and from the cosmid clone was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and KpnI, electrophoresed through an agarose gel, transferred to Hybond (Amersham), and probed with the labeled rat TTF-1 cDNA. Filters were washed at a final stringency of 0.2 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 65°C and exposed to Kodak XAR film at −80°C. In addition, the cosmid clone DNA was digested with additional restriction enzymes, subjected to Southern analysis, and probed under less stringent conditions with labeled oligonucleotide probes made to various regions of the rat TTF-1 cDNA. A 5.7-kb XhoI-HindIII fragment and a 4.6-kb BamHI fragment containing the human TTF-1 gene were subcloned into pUC18 and −19 and into M13 mp 18 and 19. The TTF-1 gene was sequenced using the U. S. Biochemical Corp. sequenase kit, using either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. Human TTF-1-specific oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as primers as the sequence was generated. The resulting DNA sequence was stored and analyzed on a MacIntosh IIs, using the program DNA Star. Cell lines were maintained in standard tissue culture prior to harvest including HeLa cervical epithelial cells, 3T3 fibroblasts, A549, H441, H820, 9/HTEo−, and BEAS-2B pulmonary adenocarcinomas. H446 and H345 small cell carcinomas were obtained from ATCC and maintained as suggested prior to harvest. Total RNA was isolated by an adapted method of Chirgwin et al.(8Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Tissue was homogenized in 4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 25 mM sodium citrate, and 0.1 M β-mercaptoethanol. Cells grown in culture were lysed directly on the plate using the same buffer. Thereafter, Phase Lock gels (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) were used to prepare RNA. RNA quantity was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Total RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed through a 1.0% agarose, 7% formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond (Amersham) or Nytran (Schleicher & Schuell), and bound to the filter by UV cross-linking. Filters were hybridized overnight at 42°C in 50% formaldehyde plus standard sodium phosphate-EDTA solution as recommended, using 32P-random primer-labeled rat TTF-1 cDNA as probe. Filters were washed to a final stringency of 0.2 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 60°C and exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film. The pGL2 vector, a luciferase reporter vector, was purchased from Promega. Two human TTF-1 gene fragments, HindIII/SspI and SmaI/SspI, were cloned into the multiple cloning site of the pGL2 basic construct to generate pGL2-2.7 kb and pGL2-0.55 kb, respectively, as seen in Fig. 2B. Human NCI-H441-4 (H441) and mouse MLE-15 cells were maintained as described previously(5Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 9Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells (3T3) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described by Rosenthal (10Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) except that glycerol shock was not used. Luciferase reporter plasmid (5 pmol) and 2.5 pmol of the internal control plasmid, pCMV-βgal(11MacGregor G.R. Nolan G.P. Fiering S. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1989; 7: 1-19Google Scholar), were co-transfected. Cells were incubated for approximately 18 h, washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and returned to culture in original media for an additional 24 h for MLE-15 cells, 72 h for H441 cells, and 48 h for 3T3 cells. Cells were harvested with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) followed by a rapid single freeze-thaw cycle. The lysates were prepared, and aliquots were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (5Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and for luciferase activity using a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). To correct for variations in transfection efficiency, assays were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Immunohistochemistry was performed on post-mortem samples of formalin-fixed tissues of human fetal and neonatal or adult lung obtained under protocols approved by the Human Research Committee, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. Immunoperoxidase methods using a streptavidin-biotin kit (Biogenex) or an avidin biotin kit (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) were used for immunolocalization of the antigen(12Sternberger L.A. Immunocytochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979: 104-114Google Scholar). Antigen retrieval systems, using microwave heating, markedly enhanced TTF-1 staining and were routinely used. Anti-rat TTF-1 serum, produced in rabbits, was kindly provided by Dr. R. Di Lauro and used at a dilution of 1:1000 to 1:2000. Specificity was established by replacing the specific TTF-1 antibody with nonimmune rabbit antisera. Staining was completely blocked by preadsorption of the antisera with recombinant TTF-1 (data not shown). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin or nuclear fast red prior to photography. The staining represents data from more than 20 distinct samples obtained at post mortem at ages 11 weeks of gestation through adulthood. Two identical genomic TTF-1 clones were isolated from an amplified human genomic library by hybridization screening with the rat TTF-1 cDNA under stringent conditions. Restriction fragment analysis of the cosmid clone was similar to that of DNA from human adenocarcinoma cell line H441 (Fig. 1), indicating the presence of only one human TTF-1 gene. The TTF-1 locus was contained within a 4.6-kb BamHI fragment consisting of two exons and one intron (Fig. 2). The predicted human TTF-1 peptide of 371 amino acids shared close identity with the amino acid sequence predicted by the rat TTF-1 cDNA sequence and 92.4% identity with the nucleotide sequence of the rat TTF-1 cDNA. The human TTF-1 gene consisted of two exons interrupted by a single exon of approximately 1 kb flanked by consensus splice donor acceptor sites that fit splice-acceptor donor rules. The restriction map, location of the exons, and nucleotide sequence are provided in Figure 2:, Figure 3:. The cosmid clone included the transcriptional start site previously identified for rat TTF-1 and termination signals consistent with the size of the 2.3-kb mRNA detected by Northern blot analysis of RNA from rat lung tissue (data not shown) and mouse and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (H441) (Fig. 4). TTF-1 mRNA was detected in human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells H441 and H820 (data not shown) and small cell carcinoma H345 but was not detected in 9/HTEo− or BEAS-2B (tracheal-bronchial epithelial cell lines), A549, HeLa, or 3T3 cells, demonstrating the cell selectivity of TTF-1 expression. The size of TTF-1 mRNA was similar to that previously described in the rat thyroid and thyroid carcinoma cells(1Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The start of transcription was mapped by S1 analysis of mRNA from MLE-15 and H441 cells demonstrating three closely apposed transcriptional start sites located approximately −196 base pairs from the ATG initiator methionine in both species (data not shown).Figure 3:Nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of human TTF-1 gene.

The TTF-1-luciferase constructs expressed luciferase activity in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells H441 and MLE-15; activity of these constructs was detected, albeit at lower levels, in 3T3 cells (Fig. 5). Activity of the TTF-1-luciferase constructs was approximately 10-20-fold higher in mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-15) and H441-4 cells than in 3T3 cells. Luciferase activity was higher in the 2.7-kb TTF-1-luciferase construct than in the 0.55-kb TTF-1-luciferase constructs in all cell types. TTF-1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in nuclei of the respiratory epithelium in human fetal lung as early as 11-12 weeks of gestation. Immunostaining was observed in the developing airways in a distribution pattern similar to that previously described for pro-SP-C (14Khoor A. Stahlman M.T. Gray M.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Thereafter, TTF-1 was detected in subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the developing lung, including nonciliated bronchiolar, and rarely in nonciliated bronchial respiratory epithelial cells in the immature lung (Fig. 6). At the time of birth, TTF-1 was detected in alveolar Type II epithelial cells and in subsets of nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells. TTF-1 was not detected in alveolar Type I cells or ciliated epithelial cells. The distribution of cells expressing TTF-1 is consistent with the overlapping distribution patterns of surfactant proteins A, B, and C and CCSP(13Khoor A. Gray M.E. Hull W.M. Whitsett J.A. Stahlman M.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Khoor A. Stahlman M.T. Gray M.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem.

Cytochem. 1988; 36: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the adult lung, TTF-1 was readily detected in subsets of nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells and was most prominent in Type II epithelial cells but was excluded from Type I cells (Fig. 6). Human TTF-1 was detected in respiratory epithelial cells from as early as 11 weeks of gestation to adulthood, marking distinct subsets of nonciliated respiratory epithelial cells in the conducting airway and Type II epithelial cells within the alveoli postnatally. Transcriptional elements from the 5′-flanking region of the human TTF-1 gene provide, at least in part, for the cell-selective expression of TTF-1 in the respiratory epithelium. The temporal-spatial pattern of human TTF-1 polypeptide is consistent with its importance in the regulation of surfactant protein synthesis and perhaps with a more general role in the early differentiation of the foregut epithelium during fetal lung development. The structure and function of TTF-1 have been highly conserved during evolution, providing further support for its potential role in mammalian lung development and in surfactant homeostasis. The polypeptide sequences of human TTF-1 have been strongly conserved among mammalian species. TTF-1 is a member of the Nkx2 class of homeodomain-containing proteins, initially isolated by screening of thyroid cDNA library with oligonucleotides based on a partial amino acid sequence of the bovine TTF-1 protein(1Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). TTF-1 contains a highly conserved homeodomain DNA binding domain distinct from the Antenapedia class of transcriptional proteins and is also distinguished by the presence of a highly conserved 17-amino acid peptide domain characteristic of genes of the Nkx2 gene family(1Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 16Damante G. Di Lauro R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5388-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The predicted TTF-1 polypeptide shares 98-99% identity with that predicted from the TTF-1 cDNA from canine2 and rat(1Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), with conservation of the homeodomain and the 17-amino acid Nkx2 domain. While the gene structures of other mammalian TTF-1 genes have not been reported, the 5′-flanking region of the TTF-1 gene has also been highly conserved between the rat (17Guazzi S. Lonigro R. Pintonello L. Boncinelli E. Di Lauro R. Mavilio F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3339-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the human TTF-1 genes, supporting the likelihood of shared regulatory characteristics of the TTF-1 genes. The temporal-spatial pattern of TTF-1 expression in the developing human lung recapitulates the findings in the developing rat lung previously described by Lazzaro et al.(4Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the rat, TTF-1 is expressed in the primordial thyroid epithelium between postconceptional days 10 and 11 and at a similar time in the primordial lung buds, being expressed at high levels in the distal tips of the developing airways. In the human fetal lung, the distribution of TTF-1 staining is similar to the pattern of SP-C mRNA in the distal respiratory epithelium(14Khoor A. Stahlman M.T. Gray M.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), a finding consistent with the observation that TTF-1 strongly activated lung cell-specific SP-C gene transcription(5Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). However, SP-C was nearly completely excluded from the conducting airway epithelium in the more mature human (14Khoor A. Stahlman M.T. Gray M.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and rodent lung(18Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), while TTF-1 was detected in both nonciliated respiratory epithelial cells in the conducting airways and in alveolar Type II cells. The distribution of TTF-1 in the conducting airway in human lung included regions of the respiratory epithelium expressing SP-A, SP-B, and CCSP genes. The promoters of each of these genes are transactivated by TTF-1 in vitro(5Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Thus TTF-1 expression includes distinct subsets of epithelial cells that express the lung epithelial cell-specific markers; however, the presence of TTF-1 alone is not sufficient to explain the heterogeneous distribution of these markers in the developing fetal and mature lung. In the human, TTF-1 was expressed at the highest levels in the tips of the fetal lung buds and in the alveolar Type II epithelial cells in the postnatal lung. TTF-1 staining was excluded from the ciliated respiratory epithelial cells and from terminally differentiated Type I epithelial cells, neither of which contain detectable levels of SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, or CCSP. It is therefore not surprising that TTF-1 mRNA was detected in several differentiated cell lines including mouse MLE-15 and human H441-4 adenocarcinoma cells that express surfactant proteins. Surprisingly, TTF-1 mRNA was also detected in a small cell carcinoma cell line H345 and was detected in 12 of 12 human small cell carcinomas in clinical pathology specimens, 3P. A. Bejarano, R. P. Baughman, P. W. Biddinger, M. A. Miller, C. Fenoglio-Preiser, and J. A. Whitsett, unpublished observations. a tumor type that generally does not express surfactant proteins. TTF-1 mRNA was not present in HeLa, 3T3 fibroblasts, or human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line A549 that does not express surfactant proteins. In the present study, TTF-1 was also detected in the human fetal thyroid epithelium by immunohistochemistry (data not shown), consistent with previous findings in the rat thyroid and in thyroid carcinoma cells wherein TTF-1 is known to activate thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin synthesis (1Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 2Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2533-2542Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 4Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surfactant proteins are not detected in the thyroid gland or in thyroid carcinoma cells, suggesting that in addition to TTF-1, other factors must further distinguish lung and thyroid-specific gene transcription. Whether thyroid and lung cell specificity is mediated by differences of the binding sites for TTF-1 or by the interactions of TTF-1 with other transcriptional proteins (for example, PAX-8 in the thyroid) is unclear at present. The start of transcription and the proximal 5′-flanking region of the TTF-1 gene were highly conserved in the rat and human. Lung-selective expression of luciferase reporter gene was conferred by the 5′-flanking regions in the TTF-1-luciferase constructs when transfected into cells in vitro. The 5′-flanking region of the human TTF-1 gene contains a TATA-like element, located approximately −30 base pairs from the start of transcription. The sequence at the start of transcription located at −196 base pairs from the ATG is similar to that recently reported for the TTF-1 gene in the rat(17Guazzi S. Lonigro R. Pintonello L. Boncinelli E. Di Lauro R. Mavilio F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3339-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The coding region of the human TTF-1 gene predicts a polypeptide of 371 amino acids (38.6 kDa). The size of the major human TTF-1 mRNA (approximately 2.3 kb) is similar to that of rat lung, mouse, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells. The 5′-flanking region of the human and rat TTF-1 genes is also strongly conserved, sharing 98% identity in the region −142 to +103 base pairs relative to the start of transcription(17Guazzi S. Lonigro R. Pintonello L. Boncinelli E. Di Lauro R. Mavilio F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3339-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the shared temporal-spatial distribution of TTF-1 gene expression in both human and rat thyroid and lung. TTF-1 is also expressed in the rat diencephalon; however, in the present study we could not assess its distribution in the fetal human brain. While the 5′-flanking region of the human TTF-1 gene was expressed at much higher levels in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells, significant expression, albeit at lower levels, was also detected in 3T3 cells. The finding that elements between 2.7 kb and the start of transcription conferred higher level expression in lung cells than in 3T3 cells supports the presence of elements stimulating activity in lung cells in that region. Binding and activation of TTF-1 expression by Hox 2.7 was recently described by Guazzi et al.(17Guazzi S. Lonigro R. Pintonello L. Boncinelli E. Di Lauro R. Mavilio F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3339-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This region of the rat TTF-1 gene has been nearly completely conserved in the human gene. Hox 2.7 is expressed in the developing lung(7Sham M.H. Hunt P. Nonchev S. Papalopulu N. Graham A. Boncinelli E. Krumlauf R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1825-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); however, its precise colocalization and potential role in TTF-1 expression have not been discerned. The 5′-region of the TTF-1 gene also contained elements consistent with SP-1 binding as well as potential sites for binding of TTF-1 to its own promoter. Whether the TTF-1 interacts with these elements to modulate its own expression is unclear. The finding that TTF-1-luciferase constructs were expressed at low levels in a non-lung cell supports the concept that critical lung-specific elements may not be included in the 2.7-kb TTF-1 promoter constructs or that cell-specific function of the TTF-1 gene is further influenced by the context of the sites that distinguish the endogenous TTF-1 gene locus but are lacking from the TTF-luciferase constructs tested. In conclusion, the strong conservation of the TTF-1 gene and polypeptide among species, its temporal and spatial distribution in the developing respiratory epithelium, and the lung cell-selective expression of TTF-1-luciferase constructs support the important role of this nuclear transcription factor in lung differentiation and gene expression. The abundance of TTF-1 in alveolar Type II cells is consistent with its role in the modulation of surfactant protein gene expression and surfactant homeostasis that is critical to postnatal adaptation to air breathing.

Maher, the technical assistance of Sandra Olson and Sherri Profitt with immunohistochemistry, and Dr. Mary E. Gray and Dr. Susan E. Wert for interpretation of TTF-1 distribution."

https://openalex.org/W1992055378,"RhoB, a small GTP-binding protein, was shown previously to contain farnesyl (C-15) as well as geranylgeranyl (C-20) groups (Adamson, P., Marshall, C. J., Hall, A., and Tilbrook, P. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20033-20038). The COOH-terminal sequence of the protein is CCKVL. According to current rules of prenylation, the COOH-terminal leucine should render the protein a substrate for CAAX geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTase-1), but not for CAAX farnesyltransferase (FTase). To determine the mechanism of farnesylation, we prepared recombinant RhoB and incubated it with recombinant preparations of either FTase or GGTase-1. RhoB was neither farnesylated nor geranylgeranylated efficiently by FTase, but it was farnesylated as well as geranylgeranylated by GGTase-1. The enzyme attached farnesyl more efficiently than geranylgeranyl to RhoB. Neither farnesylation nor geranylgeranylation required the cysteine at the fifth position from the COOH terminus. However, replacement of the cysteine at the fourth position abolished attachment of both prenyl groups. We conclude that the previously observed farnesylation of RhoB is attributable to the FTase activity of GGTase-1. These data, and other accumulating data, indicate that GGTase-1 is a highly unusual enzyme that efficiently transfers both farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups and that the choice of prenyl group is dictated by the nature of the protein acceptor.

These prenyltransferases recognize cysteine in the context of the CAAX consensus, where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is a COOH-terminal amino acid that specifies which transferase will act. Early studies suggested simple rules for CAAX specificity(4Reiss Y. Stradley S.J. Gierasch L.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CAAX geranylgeranyl transferase (also known as GGTase-1) prefers leucine at the X position and transfers a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl (GG) group. These conclusions were based on studies in which CAAX-terminated peptides were used as substrates (4Reiss Y. Stradley S.J. Gierasch L.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recent studies suggest that the determinants of enzyme recognition may be much more complex, particularly for GGTase-1. 2James, G. L., Goldstein, J. L., and Brown, M. S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 6221-6226 farnesyltransferase farnesyl pyrophosphate geranylgeranyl geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate geranylgeranyl transferase-1 histidine-tagged polymerase chain reaction. The earliest indication of this complexity was revealed by the finding that both CAAX prenyl transferases are α/β heterodimers that share a single α-subunit(8Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 9Chen W.-J. Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Brown M.S.

Both prenyltransferases have the unusual ability to form stable noncovalent complexes with their respective prenyl pyrophosphates(5Yokoyama K. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

These complexes can be isolated by size exclusion chromatography, after which the prenyl pyrophosphate can be transferred to a CAAX-terminated protein. CAAX FTase binds geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) as well as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), but only the FPP is transferred to CAAX boxes(11Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10672-10677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The situation with GGTase-1 is even more complex. In the initial studies with a partially purified enzyme preparation, Yokoyama et al.(6Yokoyama K. Goodwin G.W. Ghomashchi F. Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5302-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) showed that this enzyme can transfer either farnesyl or GG to leucine-terminated CAAX boxes, although farnesyl transfer was much less efficient. Although the two enzymes prenylate each other's substrates inefficiently in vitro, this cross-talk may be significant under certain conditions in vivo. Yeast with defects in the β-subunits of FTase are partially viable because the β-subunit of GGTase-1 can compensate for the defective β-subunit of FTase (13Trueblood C.E. Ohya Y. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4260-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). On the other hand, yeast lacking either the common α-subunit or both β-subunits are nonviable. Moreover, overexpression of the β-subunit of GGTase-1 partially corrects the defective phenotype in yeast lacking the β-subunit of FTase, and vice versa(13Trueblood C.E. Ohya Y. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4260-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to the two CAAX prenyltransferases, cells contain a third prenyltransferase designated Rab GGTase (also known as GGTase-2)(3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1993; 366: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Instead of CAAX boxes, this enzyme recognizes proteins that terminate in CysCys or CysXCys. The protein substrates must also contain an upstream sequence, so far unidentified, that is common to all members of the Rab family of GTP-binding proteins (14Cremers F.M. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme contains α- and β-subunits that are related to, but distinct from, those of the CAAX prenyltransferases(15Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Südhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Südhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12221-12229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it also requires a third polypeptide, designated Rab escort protein (REP), that binds the upstream Rab sequence and presents the Rab to the catalytic heterodimer(17Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P.M. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The complexity of prenylation in vivo is illustrated in a recent study of the p21 Rho proteins(19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins, in the molecular mass range of 21 kDa, bind GTP and are believed to function in the coupling of membrane and cytoskeletal events. RhoB, a member of this family, terminates in the sequence CCKVL. According to the simple rules outlined above, this protein should be geranylgeranylated by GGTase-1. Adamson et al.(19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed, surprisingly, that preparations of this protein isolated from transfected simian COS cells radiolabeled with [3H]mevalonate contained roughly equal portions of [3H]farnesyl and [3H]geranylgeranyl residues. Moreover, incubation of the nonprenylated protein with a crude reticulocyte lysate led to prenyl transfer from both [3H]FPP and [3H]GGPP. Incorporation of both prenyl groups was abolished by mutation of the C of the CAAX box. Replacement of the immediately upstream C (i.e. the fifth residue from COOH terminus) reduced, but did not abolish, geranylgeranyl transfer, and it did not affect the amount of farnesyl transfer. Adamson et al.(19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the prenylation of RhoB was complicated and not consistent with any simple notion of CAAX box specificity. However, without the availability of purified enzymes, it was impossible for them to determine which enzyme actually attached farnesyl or geranylgeranyl to RhoB. In the current studies we have used recombinant FTase and GGTase-1 to prenylate recombinant RhoB in vitro. The data show that this protein will accept either a farnesyl or a GG from GGTase-1. Surprisingly, the efficiency of farnesyl transfer is as great as that of GG transfer. On the other hand, RhoB is not a substrate for FTase. Standard molecular biology techniques were used(20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing reactions were performed on an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequenator. The protein content of the samples was determined by the method of Bradford(21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar), using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Recombinant FTase was prepared by coinfection of fall armyworm ovarian (Sf9) cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the α- and β-subunits of rat FTase and purified from Sf9 cytosol as previously described(22James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Rawson T.E. Somers T.C. McDowell R.S. Crowley C.W. Lucas B.K. Levinson A.D. Marsters Jr., J.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Recombinant CAAX GGTase-1, a heterodimer of the α-subunit of FTase and the β-subunit of GGTase-1, was produced and purified as follows. A cDNA clone that encodes the GGTase-1 β-subunit (23Zhang F.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3175-3180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Patrick Casey (Duke University Medical School). A PstI-EcoRI fragment that contains the GGTase-1 β-subunit coding region was ligated into a PstI-EcoRI digested pVL-1392 baculovirus transfer vector (24O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar) and designated pVL-CAAXGGT. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding the GGTase-1 β-subunit were generated by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with pVL-CAAXGGT and linearized BacPAK6 viral DNA (Clontech) and plaque purified as described elsewhere (14Cremers F.M. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To produce the recombinant heterodimeric enzyme, Sf9 cells (50 ml in suspension at 1 × 106 cells/ml) were grown as previously described (14Cremers F.M. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and infected with baculoviruses encoding the α-subunit of FTase (22James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Rawson T.E. Somers T.C. McDowell R.S. Crowley C.W. Lucas B.K. Levinson A.D. Marsters Jr., J.C.

Twenty-four hours after infection, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 8 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 μM ZnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin by passage through a 25-gauge needle 15 times. The lysate was then centrifuged at 105× g for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant was chromatographed on a Q-Sepharose 5/5 column that had been equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 μM ZnCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The heterodimeric CAAX GGTase-1 was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient from 0 to 400 mM NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by enzyme assay and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and active fractions were stored in multiple aliquots at −70 C°. RhoB containing six histidine residues at the NH2 terminus was prepared as follows. PCR primers RH-1 (5′-AGAGAATTCCATATGGCGGCCATCCGCAAGAAGCTGGTG-3′) and RH-3 (5′-AGAAAGCTTTCATAGCACCTTGCAGCAGTTGATGCAGC-3′) based on the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of rat RhoB, respectively (25Jahner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), were used in a PCR with ~1 μg of DNA from an amplified rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene). The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI-HindIII and ligated into an EcoRI-HindIII- digested pBluescript KS+ vector (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid, designated pBS-RhoB, was sequenced. A NdeI-SalI fragment from pBS-RhoB that contained the RhoB coding region was ligated into a NdeI-XhoI-digested pET14b vector (Novagen), which contains the 6 histidine codons. The resulting plasmid, designated pET14b-RhoB, was transformed into BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. E. coli cells containing pET14b-RhoB were grown and lysed as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen). The His-tagged wild-type RhoB was purified by nickel column chromatography as described previously (14Cremers F.M. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to greater than 95% purity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM sodium GDP, and stored in multiple aliquots at −70°C. Mutations in the COOH-terminal sequence of rat RhoB were introduced by PCR using 1 ng of the original pET-14b-RhoB clone. In all reactions the 5′-oligonucleotide was RH-1 as described above. The 3′-oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-AGAGTCGACTCATAGCACCTTGCAAGAGTTGATGCAGC-3′ for RhoB-SCKVL and 5′-AGAGTCGACTCATAGCACCTTAGAGCAGTTGATGCAGC-3′ for RhoB-CSKVL. The PCR products were digested with NdeI-SalI and introduced into an NdeI-XhoI-digested pET14b vector. The mutant proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells and purified as described above. The COOH-terminal amino acid sequences of the mutant RhoB proteins were verified by DNA sequencing of the mutant plasmids. Wild-type human H-Ras with six histidine residues at the NH2 terminus (His-tagged H-RasCVLS) was produced as described previously.2 To produce His-tagged H-RasCVLL, pRcCMV-H-RasL189(26James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with XbaI, and the fragment containing the H-RasCVLL coding region was ligated into an XbaI-digested pUC18 plasmid. This plasmid was then digested with HindIII, and the H-RasCVLL coding region was introduced into a HindIII-digested pTrcHis-C vector (Invitrogen). The orientation of the resulting plasmid pTRC-RasCVLL was confirmed by restriction mapping. His-tagged H-RasCVLL was produced in E. coli cells and purified as described above for wild-type RhoB. Unless otherwise stated, each reaction mixture contained the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 μM ZnCl2, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithioerythritol, 20 μM Zwittergent(3Brown M.S.

Following incubation for 15 min at 37°C, the amount of [3H]farnesyl or [3H]GG transferred was measured by ethanol precipitation and filtration on glass fiber filters (7Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). One μg of recombinant CAAX GGTase-1 was incubated for 10 min at 37°C with 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) β-D-octylglucoside, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and the indicated amount of [3H]FPP (49,500 dpm/pmol) or [3H]GGPP (33,000 dpm/pmol) in a final volume of 50 μl. Each reaction mixture was then applied to a 1-ml Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (at 4°C) that had been previously equilibrated with the same buffer(12Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The columns were eluted by centrifugation at 820 × g for 2 min. The amount or [3H]FPP of [3H]GGPP in the eluate was determined in a scintillation counter. A 20-μl aliquot of the [3H]prenyl pyrophosphate/enzyme complex eluted from the Sephadex G-50 column (see above) was counted in a scintillation counter. A second 20-μl aliquot was added to 10 μl of buffer adjusted to give a final concentration of 5 mM MgCl2, 20 μM ZnCl2, and 20 μM RhoB or H-Ras. The reaction mixture was incubated for the indicated time at 37°C, after which the amount of [3H]farnesyl or [3H]GG transferred to RhoB or H-Ras was measured as described above under “Assay for Prenyltransferase Activity.” Purified recombinant CAAX FTase transferred [3H]farnesyl from [3H]FPP to H-Ras with its normal CAAX box (CVLS), but not to a mutant H-Ras in which X had been changed to leucine (Fig. 1A). The enzyme transferred a very small but detectable amount of [3H]farnesyl to RhoB. It did not transfer [3H]GG from [3H]GGPP to any of the protein substrates (Fig. 1B). The results with recombinant GGTase-1 were quite different (Fig. 2). As expected, this enzyme transferred [3H]GG to the leucine-terminated mutant form of H-Ras (H-Ras-CVLL), but there was no appreciable transfer to wild-type H-Ras (H-Ras-CVLS) (Fig. 2B). GGTase-1 also transferred [3H]GG to RhoB, which terminates in CCKVL (Fig. 2B). As expected, GGTase-1 did not transfer [3H]farnesyl to H-Ras-CVLS, and it had only a slight ability to farnesylate H-Ras-CVLL (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, however, GGTase-1 had a robust ability to farnesylate RhoB (Fig. 2A). With RhoB as acceptor, the maximal velocity for the transfer of [3H]farnesyl was more than 3-fold greater than the maximal velocity of transfer of [3H]GG (compare Panels A and B). Fig. 3 shows the prenyl pyrophosphate saturation curves for GGTase-1. With RhoB as acceptor, GGTase-1 showed a relatively high affinity for [3H]FPP (Fig. 3A). The concentration of [3H]FPP giving half maximal velocity (S0.5) was in the range of 0.5 μM. The enzyme had a similar high affinity for [3H]GGPP when H-Ras-CVLL was used as an acceptor (S0.5≃ 0.5 μM) (Fig. 3B). However, with RhoB as acceptor, the affinity for [3H]GGPP was much lower. Saturation was not approached at 5 μM, which was the highest concentration tested (Fig. 3B). The enzyme also showed a low affinity for [3H]GGPP when H-Ras-CVLS was the acceptor (Fig. 3B). To explore the roles of the two cysteine residues in the CCKVL sequence of RhoB, we prepared recombinant RhoB with serine residues replacing either of the cysteines (Fig. 4). Replacement of the first cysteine (SCKVL) reduced slightly the ability of the protein to be farnesylated (Fig. 4A) and produced a 2-fold increase in the amount of [3H]GG incorporated (Fig. 4B). Replacement of the second cysteine (CSKVL) eliminated the acceptance of [3H]farnesyl (Fig. 4A) and severely reduced the ability of the protein to accept [3H]GG (Fig. 4B). Fig. 5 shows an experiment designed to compare the carrier function of GGTase-1 with respect to the two prenyl pyrophosphates. The enzyme was incubated with either [3H]FPP (Fig. 5A) or [3H]GGPP (Fig. 5B), and the complexes were isolated by gel exclusion chromatography. We then incubated the complexes with RhoB and measured the amount of [3H]prenyl that was transferred. GGTase-1 bound comparable amounts of [3H]FPP and [3H]GGPP. During the subsequent incubation, approximately 50% of both prenyl groups were transferred to RhoB. The binding of [3H]FPP to GGTase-1 was competitively inhibited by unlabeled FPP and by unlabeled GGPP (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, the binding of [3H]GGPP was not inhibited by unlabeled FPP, although it was inhibited by unlabeled GGPP (Fig. 6B). This striking result was repeated on several occasions with the same results. As expected from the steady state kinetic analysis, the [3H]FPP bound to GGTase-1 was transferred efficiently to RhoB, but not efficiently to H-Ras-CVLL or H-Ras-CVLS (Fig. 7A). The bound [3H]GGPP was transferred efficiently to RhoB and to H-Ras-CVLL, but not to H-Ras-CVLS (Fig. 7B). The results in this study, considered together with previous data, reveal that the CAAX prenyltransferases are highly unusual enzymes. In the absence of a protein acceptor, both enzymes form highly stable noncovalent complexes with FPP and with GGPP (5Yokoyama K. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Farnesyltransferase will efficiently transfer only the farnesyl group(11Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10672-10677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GGTase-1 will transfer either the farnesyl or the GG group depending on which protein acceptor is presented (Fig. 7). The peculiar properties of GGTase-1 are particularly apparent when RhoB is the substrate. In this case the enzyme will transfer either the farnesyl or the GG group. Farnesyl transfer is more efficient than GG transfer in terms of the maximal velocity of the enzyme (Fig. 2). Moreover, its affinity for FPP is greater than for GGPP (Fig. 3). We believe that these findings explain the previous observation of Adamson et al.(19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that RhoB can be farnesylated as well as geranylgeranylated in animal cells and in reticulocyte lysates. What are the properties of RhoB that make it an efficient acceptor of farnesyl groups? RhoB terminates in CCKVL. The C at the fifth position from the COOH terminus is not crucial in directing the prenylation specificity. When this C was substituted with a serine, RhoB remained susceptible to farnesylation as well as geranylgeranylation by GGTase-1 (Fig. 4). As expected, the C at the fourth position from the COOH terminus was crucial for the acceptance of both prenyl groups. Based on these observations, we believe that each RhoB molecule accepts only a single prenyl group, either a farnesyl or a GG, which is attached to the cysteine of the CAAX box. A prominent feature of the RhoB CAAX box is the lysine in place of the usual aliphatic amino acid at the first A position. This is not likely to be important in dictating prenylation specificity since Adamson et al.(19Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) changed this lysine to a leucine without any effect on either farnesylation or geranylgeranylation in crude systems. Thus, the CAAX box and the adjacent C are unlikely to account for the ability of RhoB to be farnesylated by GGTase-1. The responsible sequence must be on the NH2-terminal side of the CAAX box. One other small GTP binding protein, K-RasB, is known to have a regulatory sequence upstream of a CAAX box. Recently, this protein was shown to be geranylgeranylated by GGTase-1 even though its CAAX box terminates in methionine, which is not the preferred substrate for geranylgeranylation.2 Studies with chimeric proteins indicated that the high affinity of K-RasB for GGTase-1 was attributable in part to a polylysine sequence immediately upstream of the CAAX box.2 Inasmuch as RhoB does not have a polylysine sequence, this explanation cannot suffice for this protein. The unusual ability to transfer different prenyl groups to different protein acceptors renders GGTase-1 highly unusual among transferase enzymes. Further studies are clearly needed to define the mechanism for this selectivity, and eventually to find the structural basis.

Twenty percent of the CpG sites are nonmethylated, and these sites are distributed in a nonrandom manner to generate a pattern of methylation that is site-, tissue-, and gene-specific(1Razin A.

An activity that has a widespread impact on the genome such as DNA MeTase is a good candidate to play a critical role in cellular transformation. This hypothesis is supported by many lines of evidence that have demonstrated aberrations in the pattern of methylation in transformed cells. While many reports show hypomethylation of total genomic DNA (11Feinberg A.P. Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Ehrlich M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1159-1161PubMed Google Scholar) as well as individual genes in cancer cells(12Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1983; 301: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), other reports have indicated that hypermethylation is an important characteristic of cancer cells(13El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D.

First, large regions of the genome such as CpG-rich islands (14Antequera F. Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 62: 503-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) or regions in chromosomes 17p and 3p that are reduced to homozygosity in lung and colon cancer, respectively, are consistently hypermethylated(15de Bustros A.

Zbar B. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1929-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Second, the 5′ region of the retinoblastoma (Rb) and Wilms Tumor (WT) genes are methylated in a subset of tumors, and it has been suggested that inactivation of these genes in the respective tumors resulted from methylation rather than a mutation(17Ohtani-Fujita N. Fujita T. Aoike A. Osifchin N.E. Robbins P.D. Sakai T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1063-1067PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the short arm of chromosome 11 is regionally hypermethylated in certain neoplastic cells(15de Bustros A. Nelkin B.D. Silverman A. Ehrlich G. Poiesz B. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5693-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Several tumor suppressor genes are thought to be clustered in that area(18Saxon P.J. Srivatsan E.S. Stanbridge E.G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3461-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). If the level of DNA MeTase activity is critical for maintaining the pattern of methylation as has been suggested before(8Szyf M. Kaplan F. Mann V. Giloh H. Kedar E. Razin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8653-8656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Bol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Szyf M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 64: 764-769Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), one possible explanation for this observed hypermethylation is the fact that DNA MeTase is dramatically induced in many tumor cells well beyond the change in the rate of DNA synthesis(13El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Chiu-Yen R.W. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 88: 3470-3474Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Kautiainen T.L. Jones P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is activated by the Ras-AP-1 signaling pathway (21Rouleau J. MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) is consistent with the hypothesis that elevation of DNA MeTase activity is an effect of activation of the Ras-Jun signaling pathway(22Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that forced expression of exogenous DNA MeTase cDNA causes transformation of NIH 3T3 cells supporting the hypothesis that overexpression of DNA MeTase can cause cellular transformation(23Wu J. Issa J.P. Herman J. Bassett D. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8891-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The critical question that remains to be answered is whether indeed the level of expression of the endogenous DNA MeTase plays a causal role in tumors that are induced by naturally occurring oncogenic signal transduction pathways. To address this question, we have chosen the adrenocortical carcinoma cell line Y1 as a model system. Y1 is a cell line that is derived from a naturally occurring adrenocortical tumor in LAF1 mice(24Yasumura Y. Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar). Y1 cells bear a 30-40-fold amplification of the ras proto-oncogene(25Schwab M. Alitalo K. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. George D. Nature. 1983; 303: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). If the level of expression of DNA MeTase activity is critical for the oncogenic state, then the transformed state of a cell should be reversed by partial inhibition of DNA methylation. We have previously demonstrated that forced expression of an “antisense” mRNA to the most 5′ 600 bp of the DNA MeTase message (pZαM) can induce limited DNA demethylation in 10T1/2 cells(7Szyf M. Rouleau J. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12831-12836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To directly test the hypothesis that the tumorigenicity of Y1 cells is controlled by the DNA MeTase, we transfected either pZαM or a pZEM control into Y1 cells. We demonstrate that inhibition of DNA MeTase activity causes demethylation of Y1 DNA and results in reversal of the tumorigenic phenotype suggesting that DNA MeTase plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Y1 cells were maintained as monolayers in F-10 medium which was supplemented with 7.25% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Immunocorp, Montreal)(23Wu J.

Y1 cells (1 × 106) were plated on a 150-mm dish (Nunc) 15 h before transfection. The pZαM expression vector (7Szyf M. Rouleau J. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12831-12836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the 5′ of the murine DNA methyltransferase cDNA (10 μg) was co-introduced into Y1 cells with 1 μg of pUCSVneo as a selectable marker by DNA-mediated gene transfer using the calcium phosphate protocol, and G418-resistant cells were cloned in selective medium (0.25 mg/ml G418)(26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley and Sons, New York1988Google Scholar). Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (1 × 103 cells) was as described previously(27Freedman V.H. Shin S. Cell. 1974; 3: 355-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was prepared from pelleted nuclei, and total cellular RNA was prepared from cytosolic fractions according to standard protocols(26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley and Sons, New York1988Google Scholar). MspI or HpaII restriction enzymes (Boehringer Mannheim) were added to DNA at a concentration of 2.5 units/μg for 8 h at 37°C. At least three different DNA preparations isolated from three independent passages were assayed per transfectant. To quantify the relative abundance of DNA MeTase mRNA, total RNA (3 μg) was blotted onto Hybond N+ using the Bio-Rad slot-blot apparatus. The filter-bound RNA was hybridized to a 32P-labeled 1.31-kb cDNA probe encoding the putative catalytic domain of the mouse DNA MeTase(3170-4480) (28Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and exposed to XAR film (Kodak). The relative amount of total RNA was determined by measuring the signal obtained after hybridization to an 18 S RNA-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide(29Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The autoradiograms were scanned with a Scanalytics scanner (one-dimensional analysis), and the signal at each band was determined and normalized to the amount of total RNA at the same point. Three determinations were performed per RNA sample. Two μg of DNA were incubated at 37°C for 15 min with 0.1 unit of DNase, 2.5 μl of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol from Amersham), 2 Kornberg units of DNA polymerase (Boehringer) were then added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 25 min at 30°C. Fifty μl of water were then added to the reaction mixture, and the nonincorporated nucleotides were removed by spinning through a Microspin S-300 HR column (Pharmacia). The labeled DNA (20 μl) was digested with 70 μg of micrococcal nuclease (Pharmacia) in the manufacturer's recommended buffer for 10 h at 37°C. Equal amounts of radioactivity were loaded on TLC phosphocellulose plates (Merck), and the 3′ mononucleotides were separated by chromatography in one dimension (isobutyric acid:H2O:NH4OH in the ratio 66:33:1). The chromatograms were exposed to XAR film (Eastman-Kodak), and the autoradiograms were scanned by scanning laser densitometry (Scanalytics one-dimensional analysis). Spots corresponding to cytosine and 5-methylcytosine were quantified. To determine nuclear DNA MeTase levels, cells were maintained at a nonconfluent state and fed with fresh medium every 24 h for at least 3 days prior to harvesting, and DNA MeTase activity was assayed as described previously(9Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Bol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) prepared from each transfectant was reverse-transcribed with either a sense primer corresponding to bases 1-30 in the published mouse DNA MeTase cDNA sequence(28Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), 5′ GCAAACAGAAATAAAAAGCCAGTTGTGTGA 3′ to detect antisense RNA or an antisense primer corresponding to bases 475-451, or 5′ CCACAGCAGCTGCAGCACCACTCT 3′ to detect sense DNA MeTase RNA using the conditions described above. RNA incubated with reverse transcriptase in the absence of primers was used as a control. The reaction was terminated by heating to 95°C for 10 min. The reverse-transcribed cDNA was subjected to amplification in the presence of both primers using the Hot Tub amplification protocol conditions described above. The DNA was amplified for 40 cycles of 2 min at 95°C, 2 min at 60°C, and 0.5 min at 72°C. The reaction products were separated on an agarose gel, Southern blotted onto Hybond N+ filter, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled internal oligonucleotide corresponding to bases 190-211: 5′ AAATGGCAGACTCAAATAGAT 3′. The conditions used (40 cycles of amplification) do not provide a quantitative assessment of the level of mRNA, but were used to exclude the possibility that small levels of antisense mRNA is present in the control transfectants. LAF-1 mice (Bar Harbor) (6-8-week-old males) were injected subcutaneously (in the flank area) with 106 cells. Mice were monitored for the presence of tumors by daily palpation. Mice bearing tumors of greater than 1 cm in diameter were sacrificed, while tumor-free mice were kept for 90 days. Cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde (2.5%) in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M) for 1 h and further fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. The samples were dehydrated in ascending alcohol concentrations and propylene oxide followed by embedding in Epon. Semithin sections (1 μm) were cut from blocks with an ultramicrotome and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Samples were analyzed using a Philips 410 electron microscope(30Maysinger D. Piccardo P. Flipovic-Grcic J. Cuello A.C. Neurochem Int. 1993; 23: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To directly inhibit DNA methylation in Y1 cells, we introduced either the DNA MeTase antisense expression construct pZαM (encoding 600 bp from the 5′ of the DNA MeTase cDNA in the antisense orientation) or a pZEM control vector (7Szyf M. Rouleau J. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12831-12836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into Y1 cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer as described under “Materials and Methods.” Six G418-resistant colonies were isolated and propagated for both constructs. All antisense transfectants (determined by a preliminary Southern blot analysis) exhibited distinct morphological differences from the pZEM transfectants or nontransfected Y1 cells. Based on Northern blot analysis of the antisense mRNA expression, three independent pZαM transfectants (4Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar, 7Szyf M. Rouleau J. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12831-12836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Bol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were selected for further characterization. To verify that the antisense mRNA strand is transcribed in the pZαM transfectants, we employed reverse-transcribed PCR analysis using strand-specific primers as described under “Materials and Methods.” The experiment presented in Fig. 1 demonstrates that when the sense oligonucleotide is used for reverse transcription (transcribing the antisense mRNA strand), the expected 0.475- kb amplification product is observed only in pZαM transfectants. As expected, the endogenous DNA MeTase sense mRNA is amplified in both pZEM and pZαM transfectants when the antisense oligonucleotide is used for reverse transcription (sense). Interestingly, a smaller amplification product (0.375 kb) is also seen in the pZαM lines suggesting that another splice variant of DNA MeTase mRNA is transcribed in these transfectants. The biological significance of the induction of the smaller variant in the pZαM transfectants is unclear. The mechanism responsible for inhibition of gene expression by antisense is still unclear; however, some models suggest that degradation of the hybrid RNA by RNase H might be involved. To determine whether expression of an antisense to the DNA MeTase can lead to a reduction in the steady state level of endogenous DNA MeTase mRNA, we isolated total RNA from the antisense transfectants and the pZEM controls. DNA MeTase activity is regulated with the state of growth of cells(8Szyf M. Kaplan F. Mann V. Giloh H. Kedar E. Razin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8653-8656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Bol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, all cultures were maintained at the logarithmic phase of growth and fed with fresh medium every 24 h for 3 days prior to harvesting. Total RNA isolated from the transfectants was subjected to a Northern blot analysis and sequentially hybridized with a probe to the putative catalytic domain of the mouse DNA MeTase mRNA (MET 3′) and an 18 S rRNA-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe as described under “Materials and Methods.” A result of such an analysis is presented in Fig. 2. Scanning of the autoradiogram indicates that the relative abundance of the 5-kb DNA MeTase mRNA (Fig. 2, top panel) relative to 18 S rRNA (Fig. 2, bottom panel) is reduced 2-fold in the three antisense transfectants. To quantify expression of DNA MeTase, the different RNA samples were subjected to a slot-blot analysis and sequential hybridization with the DNA MeTase and 18 S rRNA probes. The relative level of DNA MeTase mRNA in the different samples was determined by scanning densitometry. The results of such an analysis show that the pZαM transfectants exhibit an average decrease of 45% and a maximal decrease of 58% in the abundance of DNA MeTase mRNA relative to the pZEM controls (p < 0.001). The mean value for the control group was 0.480, S.D. = 0.104, the mean for the antisense group was 0.280, S.D. = 0.066. We next compared the DNA MeTase enzymatic activity present in nuclear extracts prepared from antisense transfectants relative to control pZEM transfectants using S-[methyl-3H]adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and a hemimethylated double-stranded oligonucleotide as a substrate. The results of two experiments with triplicate determinations each indicate that the three pZαM transfectants express a lower level of DNA MeTase activity than the control transfectants with an average inhibition of DNA MeTase activity of 42% and a maximum of 48% relative to control (p < 0.05). Whereas our experiments demonstrate that the DNA MeTase antisense transfectants bear a lower level of DNA MeTase activity than the control transfectants, it is important to note that we measured only steady state levels in the transfectants. It is hard to assess the actual level of inhibition of DNA MeTase activity at the time of transfection, when a higher copy number of DNA MeTase antisense RNA might have been present in the cell. The steady state level of DNA MeTase mRNA might reflect an equilibrium of different cellular regulatory controls over the level of DNA MeTase activity in the cell. To directly demonstrate that expression of the DNA MeTase antisense leads to inhibition of DNA methylation activity in the cell, we determined whether it leads to a general reduction in the level of methylation of the genome. We performed a “nearest neighbor” analysis using [α-32P]dGTP as described previously(6Razin A. Feldmesser E. Kafri T. Szyf M. Razin A. Cantoni G.L. Biochemistry and Biology of DNA Methylation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1985: 239Google Scholar). This assay enables one to determine the percentage of methylated and nonmethylated cytosines residing in the dinucleotide sequence CpG(6Razin A. Feldmesser E. Kafri T. Szyf M. Razin A. Cantoni G.L. Biochemistry and Biology of DNA Methylation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1985: 239Google Scholar). The results of three such experiments show that the mean value for the pZEM controls as a group was 9.7% nonmethylated cytosines, S.D. = 2.13, the mean value for the antisense lines as a group was 23.83% cytosine, S.D. = 5.88. p < 0.001. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that expression of an antisense to the DNA MeTase mRNA leads to partial inhibition of DNA MeTase mRNA and DNA MeTase enzymatic activities and a significant reduction in the level of genomic cytosine methylation. To further verify that expression of pZαM results in demethylation and to determine whether specific genes were demethylated, we resorted to a HpaII/MspI restriction enzyme analysis followed by Southern blotting and hybridization with specific gene probes. HpaII cleaves the sequence CCGG, a subset of the CpG dinucleotide sequences, only when the site is unmethylated, while MspI will cleave the same sequence irrespective of its state of methylation. By comparing the pattern of HpaII cleavage of specific genes in cells expressing pZαM with that of the parental Y1 or cells harboring only the vector, we determined whether the genes are demethylated in the antisense transfectants. We first analyzed the state of methylation of the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene (C21)(29Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Szyf M. Schimmer B.P. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6853-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This gene is specifically expressed and hypomethylated in the adrenal cortex, but is inactivated and hypermethylated in Y1 cells(29Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Szyf M. Schimmer B.P. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6853-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that hypermethylation of C21 in the Y1 cell is part of the transformation program that includes the shutdown of certain differentiated functions(29Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). DNA prepared from Y1, pZαM(4Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and pZEM (1 and 7) transfectants was subjected to either MspI or HpaII digestion, Southern blot analysis, and hybridization with a 3.8-kb BamHI fragment containing the body of the C21 gene and 3′ sequences (Fig. 3, bottom panel, for physical map). Full demethylation of this region should yield a doublet at ~1 kb, an 0.8-kb fragment, and a 0.4-kb fragment, as well as a number of low molecular weight fragments at 0.1-0.4 kb. As observed in Fig. 3, the C21 locus is heavily methylated in Y1 cells, as well as the control transfectant, as indicated by the high molecular weight fragments. Only a relatively weak digestion product is seen at 1.9 kb (Fig. 3). This pattern of hypermethylation of C21 which is observed in Y1 cells and different control transfectants, that were analyzed in our laboratory in the last 5 years, is markedly stable. On the other hand, the antisense transfectant's DNA is significantly hypomethylated at this locus as indicated by the relative diminution of the high molecular weight fragments and relative intensification of the partial fragment at 1.9 kb. The appearance of new partial fragments in the lower molecular weight range between 1 and 0.4 kb indicates partial hypomethylation at a large number of HpaII sites contained in the 3′ region of the C21 gene (see physical map)(29Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Szyf M. Schimmer B.P. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6853-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pattern of demethylation, indicated by the large number of partial HpaII fragments, is compatible with a general partial hypomethylation rather than a specific loss of methylation in a distinct region of the C21 gene. To determine whether demethylation is limited to genes that are potentially expressible in Y1 cells such as the adrenal cortex-specific C21 gene (29Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or if the demethylation is widely spread in the genome, we tested the methylation state of the MyoD (32Jones P.A. Wolkowicz M.J. Rideout III, W.M. Gonzales F.A. Marziasz C.M. Coetzee G.A. Tapscott S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6117-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and p53 5′ locus. Specific demethylation of MyoD and the p53 fragment was seen in the pZαM transfectants (data not shown). As the level of DNA MeTase activity is regulated with the state of growth and is induced in transformed cells and in tumors in vivo(8Szyf M. Kaplan F. Mann V. Giloh H. Kedar E. Razin A. J. Biol.

A comparison of pZαM transfectants and controls showed a small but statistically significant reduction in the growth rate of antisense lines relative to the Y1 controls especially at higher densities (which is statistically significant, p < 0.001). This may reflect contact-inhibited growth and increased serum requirements of the antisense lines (data not shown). The morpho"

A., and de Kruijff, B.(1993), FEBS Lett. 331, 19-24) second lipid binding site on SecA. Since removal of these residues completely abolished the property of SecA to cause aggregation of negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol vesicles, we conclude that the C-terminal 70 amino acid residues of SecA are involved in lipid-binding.

Moreover, in vivo studies showed that this region is essential for growth. SecB and a SecB-precursor complex were shown to inhibit the SecA-mediated lipid vesicle aggregation, suggesting that the overall acidic SecB protein binds at or near the second lipid binding site on SecA. This together with the observation that the SecA mutant protein lacking the C-terminal 70 residues had a strongly reduced ability to mediate binding of SecB-precursor complexes to inverted inner membrane vesicles demonstrates that the C terminus of SecA is also involved in SecB binding.

INTRODUCTIONProtein secretion in Escherichia coli is becoming increasingly better understood. Both genetic and biochemical approaches have led to the identification of a well defined secretion apparatus (for reviews see (1Jacq A. Holland B. Curr. Opp. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 541-546Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and (2Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) in which SecA, as a dimer(3Akita M. Shinkai A. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), plays a central role by coupling ATP hydrolysis to translocation and by interacting with several of the known components of this apparatus. It binds the precursor through interaction with both the signal sequence and the mature part of the preprotein(5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 6Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it recognizes the molecular chaperone SecB or precursor-SecB complexes(7Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The integral membrane protein SecY also interacts with SecA(8Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This protein forms, together with SecE and the acidic phospholipids, the high affinity binding site for SecA at the inner membrane(9Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The notion that acidic phospholipids play a direct role in the translocation reaction came from studies using strains deficient in the gene pgsA, which encodes an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of a precursor for the acidic phospholipids in E. coli(10Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using these strains, it was shown that both in vivo and in vitro translocations were severely hampered (11de Vrije T. de Swart R.L. Dowhan W. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Nature. 1988; 334: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Reintroduction of acidic phospholipids into inner membrane vesicles derived from these strains restored the translocation activity (12Kusters R. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8659-8662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SecA-acidic phospholipid interactions could partly explain the role of this lipid class in translocation(13Phoenix D.A. de Wolf F.A. Staffhorst R.W.H.M. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Phoenix D.A. Kusters R. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while signal sequence-acidic phospholipid interactions are also suggested to play a direct role in translocation(15Kusters R. Breukink E. Gallusser A. Kuhn A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1560-1563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Some insight into the role that SecA-acidic phospholipid interactions play in translocation was provided by the observation that the interaction of SecA with acidic phospholipids results in an increase of its ATPase activity (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and in a conformational change within the protein(16Shinkai A. Mei L.H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5827-5833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was furthermore shown that SecA could efficiently insert into model membranes containing acidic phospholipids(17Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Ulbrandt N.D. London E.L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This insertion was affected by nucleotides, an observation that led to the hypothesis of a SecA binding, insertion, and deinsertion cycle (17Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that SecA is able to cause aggregation of negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol vesicles(19Breukink E. Keller R.C.A. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This aggregation property was attributed to the existence of two different lipid binding sites present in the SecA monomer; one binding site being responsible for a more hydrophobic interaction leading to insertion of SecA into the lipid phase of the membrane, and the other binding site being responsible for a more electrostatic interaction with anionic lipids leading to a more superficial interaction of SecA with the opposing membrane.In this study, we attempted to localize the lipid binding sites within SecA using deletion mutants. We present evidence that the second lipid binding site lies, as proposed previously(19Breukink E. Keller R.C.A. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), within the extreme 70 C-terminal amino acid residues. We furthermore present evidence that the SecB binding site on SecA is also located within the C-terminal 70 amino acid residues and coincides with the second lipid binding site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDerivatives of strain RR1(20Bolivar F. Backman K. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), harboring plasmids that encode the SecA mutant proteins C95, C72, and C53, were a generous gift from Drs. Mizushima and Matsuyama. These plasmids code for SecA proteins lacking the amino-terminal 64, 267, and 438 amino acid residues respectively(21Matsuyama S. Kimura E. Mizushima S. J. Biol.

All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better.Construction of C-terminal Deletion MutationsStandard cloning procedures were performed as described(24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J.

Restriction endonuclease, Klenow enzyme, T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase treatments were carried out as suggested by the manufacturers of these enzymes (Pharmacia, New England Biolabs). Plasmid pT7-secA (25Schmidt M.G. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 643-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was in separate incubations digested with SnaBI, BstXI, XcmI, KpnI, NruI, EcoRV, BglII, AatII, and MluI and ligated to a synthetic linker, dTTAATTAATTAA, with stop codons in all three reading frames. The resulting plasmids encode N-terminal SecA fragments of 831, 790, 720, 557, 502, 441, 422, 322, and 237 amino acid residues long, respectively. Depending on the frame in which the linker was inserted, the SecA fragments have an extension of 2 or 3 extra amino acid residues (Fig. 1).For the in vivo experiments, the BamHI fragments encoding the entire secA sequences(26Schmidt M.G. Rollo E.E. Grodberg J. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), including the inserted linkers, were ligated into the BamHI site of pNEB193 (New England Biolabs), placing the (mutant) secA genes under control of the lac promoter. These plasmids were then used to transform the strains MM52 (27Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and MM66 (28Oliver D.B.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 0.2% casamino acids. When the cell culture reached an OD660 of 0.9-1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mM final concentration, and incubation was continued for 3 h. The cells were collected and washed once in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol (Buffer A), supplemented with 0.1 mM aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, and subjected to 15 sonication cycles of 20 s at 0°C using a tip-sonicator at 100 watts. During sonication, the temperature of the solution was never allowed to rise above 20°C. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 5000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. The N-terminal SecA fragment of 831 residues(N831) appeared to be soluble, while the other N-terminal fragments were overproduced as aggregates and were present in the pellet. These aggregates were subjected to a second sonification step, pelleted, and dissolved in 8 M urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and centrifuged at 240,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant containing the urea-dissolved N-terminal fragments was then subjected to two fast protein liquid chromatography-Mono Q 10/10 (Pharmacia) steps, yielding proteins of >90% purity. The purified proteins were stored at −20°C in 8 M urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 280 mM NaCl at a concentration ranging from 1.2 to 5.3 mg/ml.The mutant protein N790 needed an extra gel-filtration step using an fast protein liquid chromatography-Superose 6 preparation grade column (16/50, Pharmacia), equilibrated in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. This fragment was stored at −20°C in the elution buffer at a concentration of 0.7 mg/ml.N831 was purified from the supernatant after the two sonication steps, using the Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography-Mono Q 10/10 column equilibrated in Buffer A. The N831-containing fractions were pooled and ammonium sulfate-precipitated (0.40 g/ml), followed by a gel-filtration step using a Sephacryl S300 HR 16/100 column (Pharmacia), equilibrated in Buffer A, with a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The pooled N831 fractions were subjected to a final Mono Q 10/10 step yielding a >95% pure protein. The purified protein was stored at a concentration of 2.4 mg/ml at −80°C in Buffer A supplemented with 280 mM NaCl. All of the fast protein liquid chromatography steps described above were performed at room temperature. The mutant proteins with N-terminal deletions were isolated as described (21Matsuyama S. Kimura E. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified according to the protocol of the urea-dissolved C-terminal deletion proteins.ATPase AssayThe ATPase activity of the SecA mutant proteins was assayed using the method of Schiebel et al.(31Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The urea-dissolved SecA mutant proteins (5 μg) were renatured from urea at 0°C by dilution in 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of 4 mM ATP (total volume, 50 μl) followed by incubation for 1 h at 0°C. For control purposes, the wild-type SecA and N831, either as native proteins or denatured by the addition of urea to a concentration of 8 M, were incubated similarly. The ATPase activity was then assayed by incubating the samples for 15 min at 37°C. Translocation ATPase of wild-type SecA and of N831 was assayed essentially as described(5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), using urea-washed inner membrane vesicles derived from strain K003 (unc−)(32Yamane K. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2358-2362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1.1 μg of wild-type SecA or N831, 0.8 μg of SecB, 1.6 μg of prePhoE, 4 mM ATP. The ATPase reactions were assayed in 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 10.8 mM Mg2+-acetate, 28 mM K+-acetate, 2 mM dithiothreitol for 15 min at 37°C in a total volume of 50 μl.Translocation AssayIn vitro translocation was assayed according to Kusters et al.(22Kusters R. de Vrije T. Breukink E. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20827-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reaction mixtures (150 μl) contained 50 mM triethanolamine-OAc, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mM ATP, 0.03 mg/ml purified SecB, and inverted inner membrane vesicles (0.43 mg of protein/ml) of E. coli strain MM52, which were incubated at 42°C for 1 h in the presence of 12.5 mM sodium azide to abolish residual endogenous SecA activity. The residual azide concentration in the translocation mixture was below 0.25 mM. Purified [35S]prePhoE (4.5 μg) dissolved in 8 M urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to the reaction mixture at 0°C, and the translocation reaction was started by the addition of varying amounts of (mutant) SecA protein, and placing the reaction mixtures at 37°C. If required, the (mutant) SecA proteins were first renatured and incubated at 0°C for 1 h in 50 mM triethanolamine-OAc, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM bovine serum albumin and 4 mM ATP. At different time points, the translocation reactions were stopped by adding an aliquot (25 μl) of the reaction mixture to 2.5 μl of a 5 mg/ml proteinase K solution, previously cooled on ice. The samples were incubated on ice for 1 h and, after the addition of 0.5 μl of a 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride solution, they were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. For a 20% translocation standard, 5 μl of the reaction mixture was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The percentage of translocation was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the rehydrated excised protein bands of dried gels.Vesicle AggregationThe ability of SecA and mutant SecA species to induce aggregation of large unilamellar vesicles, prepared by extrusion through 400-nm diameter filters, was tested as described previously(19Breukink E. Keller R.C.A. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).For determining the effect of SecB on the SecA-induced vesicle aggregation, 30 μg of SecA was preincubated for 2 min at 0°C in 100 μl of Buffer V, supplemented with 39 μg of SecB in the presence or absence of 11 μg of prePhoE or mature PhoE (both rapidly diluted from 8 M urea upon the addition of the Buffer V, already containing the SecB protein). This leads to a molar ratio of SecA (dimer) to SecB (tetramer) to PhoE (monomer) of 1:4:2. This mixture was added to 900 μl of Buffer V containing 150 μM DOPG large unilamellar vesicles.Binding StudiesBinding of [14C]SecB to inner membrane vesicles derived from strain S.D.12 (33Shibuya I. Miyasaki C. Ohta A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (wild-type for translocation) was studied in Buffer B consisting of 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 10.8 mM Mg2+-acetate, 28 mM K+-acetate, and 2 mM dithiothreitol. 0.5 μg of prePhoE was diluted from 8 M urea in a final volume of 8 μl of Buffer B containing 0.88 μg of [14C]SecB and incubated for 10 min at 0°C. The SecB-prePhoE complex obtained was added to 17 μl of Buffer B containing 1.5 μg of SecA protein (wild-type or N831) and inner membrane vesicles (10.7 μg of protein). After continued incubation at 0°C for 20 min, the inner membrane vesicles were centrifuged through a 0.5 M sucrose cushion in Buffer B at 110,000 × g at 4°C in a Beckmann TL100 centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 12 μl of Buffer B and processed for liquid scintillation counting.MiscellaneousProtein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Monolayer experiments were performed essentially as described(17Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). SecB was 14C-labeled by the method of reductive methylation (35Dottavio-Martin D. Ravel J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), resulting in a protein that contained 2.5 [14C]methyl groups/SecB monomer. The labeled protein was fully active in a translocation assay as compared with unlabeled SecB (not shown). Mature PhoE was isolated from the outer membrane using a method based on trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and the pure protein was stored in 8 M urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. 2E.

RESULTSPurification and Characterization of Truncated SecA Mutant ProteinsTo search for the lipid binding sites on the SecA molecule, we constructed a series of deletions in the secA gene, resulting in proteins that lack parts of different length at the C terminus. Fig. 2 shows the end results of the purifications of the overproduced proteins.Figure 2:The purified N- and C-terminal SecA fragments.

Because most mutant proteins had to be isolated as denatured proteins, we first investigated the effect of urea treatment on the activity of wild-type SecA and N831, which were both isolated as native proteins. For this purpose, these proteins were first denatured, followed by renaturation in the presence of ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The endogenous ATPase activity of SecA (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) was then tested for 15 min at 37°C. The activity of the native wild-type SecA found in this assay was comparable with previously published data (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of the urea-denatured wild-type SecA and N831, after renaturation in presence of ATP, was only slightly lower than the activity of the native protein (Fig. 3). The endogenous ATPase activity of N831 was slightly higher than the activity of wild-type SecA. When the proteins were renatured in absence of ATP, wild-type SecA lost 45% of its native endogenous ATPase activity (26% in the case of N831). Apparently, ATP has a substantial stabilizing role during the refolding process. Interestingly, the mutant proteins N790 and N720 showed a greatly increased endogenous ATPase activity (Fig. 3) as compared with wild-type SecA. The apparently increased activity of N790 was due to the hydrolysis of ATP during the renaturation for 1 h at 0°C in the presence of ATP (data not shown). The ATPase activity of N790 when renatured in the absence of ATP was not higher than that of wild-type SecA (Fig. 3). Apparently, this protein folds in a conformation that is active in ATP hydrolysis at 0°C. All other proteins did not show an activity at 0°C (data not shown). These results suggest that the C terminus of SecA is not involved in the endogenous ATPase activity of SecA. The smaller deletion mutants (Fig. 3) showed no ATPase activity.Figure 3:ATPase activity of the C-terminally truncated SecA proteins.

The vesicles were preincubated at 42°C with azide to inhibit residual SecA activity. This treatment almost completely abolished the translocation activity of the MM52 vesicles when assayed for translocation activity in the absence of SecA (Fig. 4A, asterisk). Except for N831 (Fig. 4), all of the mutant proteins lacked translocation activity (data not shown). With both wild-type SecA and N831, the translocation of prePhoE was completed within 5 min after the start of the reaction (Fig. 4A). The total amount of translocated prePhoE in the presence of N831 was always lower than it was in the presence of wild-type SecA. Also the initial rate of the translocation, especially at high SecA concentrations, was lower in the presence of N831 (Fig. 4B).Figure 4:Translocation activity of wild-type SecA and N831.

B, the initial rate of translocation (i.e. the time span 1-4 min) of wild type SecA (opensquares) and N831 (filledsquares) as a function of the concentration of the two proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To gain more insight into the difference between N831 and wild-type SecA, a translocation ATPase assay was performed. The translocation ATPase activity (i.e. the ATPase activity of SecA under translocation conditions, corrected for the amount of hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of only membranes) of wild-type was 515 ± 16 pmol Pi/(μg•min), while that of N831 was 389 ± 18 pmol Pi/(μg•min) (n = 3). The membrane ATPase activity (i.e. the ATPase activity in the absence of prePhoE) did not significantly differ between wild-type SecA and N831, 395 ± 13 and 406 ± 8 pmol Pi/(μg•min) (n = 3), respectively. These results show that the difference in translocation activity between wild-type SecA and N831 is probably not caused by a difference in interaction with the inner membrane (i.e. SecY/E and the acidic phospholipids), but most probably due to a difference involving the interaction with the precursor protein.Activity of the Truncated SecA Proteins in VivoTo test the activity of the truncated SecA proteins in vivo, the mutant secA alleles were placed under control of the lac promoter of pNEB193. In these constructs, the expression of the (mutant) secA genes was not totally repressed during growth in absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. These plasmids were introduced in MM52, a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive secA mutation, secA51(Ts)(26Schmidt M.G. Rollo E.E. Grodberg J. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The activity of the truncated SecA proteins was checked by determining whether they could complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the MM52 strain. As expected, expression of wild-type SecA could complement the mutation in MM52 (data not shown). Of the C-terminally truncated SecA proteins, only N831 and N322 could complement the mutation in MM52 (not shown), suggesting that the C-terminal 70 amino acid residues of SecA are not essential for its function. However, since SecA is active as a dimer(3Akita M. Shinkai A. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the truncated SecA proteins could potentially form heterodimers with the chromosomally-encoded temperature-sensitive mutant protein, resulting in a SecA that is sufficiently active for cell viability. Therefore, it could also be argued that heterodimer formation in the case of N831 may have obscured the possible importance of the C-terminal 70 amino acid residues of SecA for its in vivo function.To avoid this problem, we also used strain MM66(28Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1982; 30: 311-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which has a secA amber mutation, in complementation assays. This strain carries a temperature-sensitive amber suppressor. When shifted to a growth temperature of 42°C, it cannot synthesize SecA, resulting in at least a 2-fold decrease of the cellular SecA concentration every generation. Whereas expression of the wild-type SecA complemented the temperature-sensitive phenotype of this strain, N831 as well as the control vector lacking the secA gene were incapable to complement the mutation (Fig. 5). Also N322 was incapable of complementing the secA amber mutation (data not shown).Figure 5:In vivo complementation test. Shown is strain MM66 (SecAam,(28Oliver D.B. Beckwith J.

https://openalex.org/W2066394990,"Stilbene (STS) and chalcone (CHS) synthases are homodimeric, related plant-specific polyketide synthases. Both perform a sequential condensation of three acetate units to a starter residue to form a tetraketide intermediate that is folded to the ring systems specific to the different products. Protein cross-linking and site-directed mutagenesis identified a subunit contact site in position 158, close to the active site (Cys169). This suggested that the active site pockets may be neighboring, possibly alternating in the condensing reactions rather than acting independently. This was investigated by co-expression of active site mutants with differently mutated, inactive proteins. With both STS and CHS, the heterodimers synthesized the end products, indicating that each subunit performed all three condensations. In co-action with a monomeric reductase, CHS also synthesizes 6′-deoxychalcone, but with the chalcone as second product when using plant preparations. The two enzymes expressed as single species in Escherichia coli synthesized both products, and both were also obtained with a CHS heterodimer containing a single active site. The results showed that 6′-deoxychalcone synthesis required no other plant factor and that the formation of two products may be an intrinsic property of the interaction between dimeric CHS and monomeric reductase."

Biochemical characterization of the 35-kDa kinase revealed that the core kinase conserved the major functional properties of the native receptor kinase domain. Activity of the 35-kDa kinase toward a synthetic peptide increased more than 200-fold upon autophosphorylation, which occurred exclusively at Tyr-1158, Tyr-1162, and Tyr-1163; the largest increase was observed between bis- and trisphosphorylation of the kinase. The activated 35- and 48-kDa kinases were similar with respect to specific activity and ATP and Mg2+ requirements for peptide phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W1969552935,"L1210 leukemia cells transport reduced folates and methotrexate via a well defined reduced folate carrier system and, in the absence of low folate selective pressure, do not express an alternate endocytotic route mediated by cell surface folate receptors. This laboratory previously described an L1210 leukemia cell line, MTXrA, with acquired resistance to methotrexate (MTX) due to the loss of mobility of the reduced folate carrier. We now report on the transfection of MTXrA with a cDNA encoding the murine homolog of the human folate receptor isoform of KB cells to produce MTXrA-TF1, which constitutively expresses high levels of FR-α. MTXrA-TF1 and L1210 cells were utilized to compare transport of methotrexate mediated by FR-α and the reduced folate carrier, respectively. Methotrexate influx in the two lines was similar when the extracellular level was 0.1 μM, but as the methotrexate concentration increased, influx via the reduced folate carrier increased in comparison to influx mediated by FR-α. Transport kinetics indicated both a ∼20-fold lower influx Kb and Vmax for MTXrA-TF1 as compared to L1210 cells. The two cell lines exhibited distinct influx properties. Methotrexate influx in MTXrA-TF1 was markedly inhibited by 50 nM folic acid and metabolic poisons. In L1210 cells, 1.0 μM folic acid did not affect MTX influx, and metabolic poisons either had no effect on or increased methotrexate influx. Removal of extracellular chloride markedly inhibited transport in MTXrA-TF1 but stimulated influx in L1210 cells. When the pH was decreased to 6.2, methotrexate influx was not altered in MTXrA-TF1 but was reduced in L1210 cells. Probenecid and sulfobromophthalein inhibit methotrexate influx in both L1210 and MTXrA-TF1 cell lines; however, inhibition in MTXrA-TF1 could be accounted for on the basis of inhibition of methotrexate binding to FR-α. The data indicate that the reduced folate carrier and FR-α function independently and exhibit distinct properties. FR-α expressed at sufficient levels can mediate influx of MTX and folates into cells at rates comparable to the reduced folate carrier and hence has pharmacologic and physiologic importance.

In eukaryotic cells, import of a folate vitamin is required to sustain enzymatic pathways leading to the synthesis of thymidine, purines, and amino acids. The folate-dependent enzymes have long been exploited as chemotherapeutic targets. For example, the folate analog methotrexate (MTX) 1The abbreviations used are: MTXmethotrexateBSPsulfobromophthaleinDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseFRfolate receptorKbaffinity constant of bindingHBSHepes-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidDNPdinitrophenol. is a successful chemotherapeutic agent due to its potent inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Newer antifolates that directly block folate-dependent purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis (reviewed in (1Fleming G.F. Schilsky R.L. Semin.

Membrane transport of antifolates such as MTX has been an area of considerable interest because of the role that this process plays as a determinant of the cytotoxicity, selectivity, and resistance to this class of agents(2Goldman I.D.

A cDNA encoding this carrier, or a component of the carrier system, has recently been cloned, and the sequence of the protein suggests that it is a member of a superfamily of membrane-spanning transporters(14Dixon K.H.

The second transport system mediates transport of folates by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored folate receptors (reviewed in (16Antony A.C.

Several folate receptor isoforms (designated FR-α, FR-β, and FR-γ) have been cloned from human and murine tissues in this and other laboratories(19Brigle K.E. Westin E.H. Houghton M.T. Goldman I.D.

The receptors have a very high affinity for folic acid (∼1 nM) and the reduced folates 5-formyl- and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (10-40 nM) and a lower affinity for MTX and other 4-amino-antifolates (0.15-1.7 μM) (16Antony A.C.

Folate receptors are highly expressed in some malignant tissues, suggesting a role in meeting cellular folate requirements and as determinants of antifolate cytotoxicity(26Ross J.F. Chaudhuri P.K.

The physiologic and pharmacologic properties of folate receptor-mediated transport have not been characterized with the same degree of quantitation and depth as for the reduced folate carrier. In this report we characterize, in detail, MTX transport mediated by FR-α, the murine homolog of the isoform expressed in KB cells(21Sadasivan E. Rothenberg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5806-5811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To exclude any contribution to transport via the reduced folate carrier, an L1210 leukemia line (MTXrA) was utilized in which the reduced folate carrier is not functional(29Schuetz J.D. Westin E.H. Matherly L.H. Pincus R. Swerdlow P.S. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16261-16267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This line was transfected with a cDNA encoding murine FR-α and a clonal subline, MTXrA-TF1, was isolated that constitutively overexpressed this receptor. MTX was utilized as the transport substrate because upon entering the cell it binds rapidly to DHFR, permitting very accurate influx determinations over long intervals obviating back-flux components that occur with natural folates(6Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 624-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The results of this study indicate that transport mediated by FR-α is fundamentally different from transport mediated by the reduced folate carrier in terms of energy, ion, and pH dependence. FR-α-mediated transport of MTX into cells was quite rapid; MTX influx in the MTXrA-TF1 line was equivalent to influx mediated by the reduced folate carrier in L1210 cells when the extracellular concentration was 0.1 μM. No evidence was found to support a linkage between these two transport processes. Inhibition of FR-α-mediated transport by agents that are inhibitors of transport via the reduced folate carrier (i.e. BSP and probenecid) could be attributed to inhibition of MTX binding to the folate receptor. The results of this study are consistent with the concept that folate receptor-mediated transport of folates and antifolates can achieve influx rates comparable to those achieved by the reduced folate carrier and can be a pathway of both physiologic and pharmacologic importance. [3′,5′,7-3H]MTX and [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals and purified by high performance liquid chromatography prior to use(30Matherly L.H. Barlowe C.K. Phillips V.M. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 710-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Sulfobromophthalein (BSP) and probenecid were purchased from Sigma. CI-920 was provided by Dr. David Fry, Warner-Lambert/Parke Davis Co., and racemic [3′,5′,7,9-3H]5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate was provided by Dr. Barton Kamen, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All other reagents were obtained in the highest purity available from various commercial sources. Murine L1210 leukemia cells and sublines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (containing 2.3 μM folic acid) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone), 2 mM glutamine, 20 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For some experiments, cells were cultured in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as above with 10% dialyzed bovine calf serum and 200 μM glycine, 100 μM adenosine, and 10 μM thymidine (GAT) 2-4 weeks prior to use. Prior to other experiments, MTXrA-TF1 (see below) was grown in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5 nM folic acid for 2-4 weeks. The MTX-resistant L1210 leukemia cell line, MTXrA was previously developed (29Schuetz J.D. Westin E.H. Matherly L.H. Pincus R. Swerdlow P.S. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16261-16267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from a single-step selection in 50 nM MTX and cloned in soft agar. MTXrA-TF1 was developed by transfecting MTXrA with an expression vector, pKJ-FR-α, encoding the full-length murine FR-α cDNA previously isolated from an L1210 subline up-regulated for folate receptor expression by growth in limiting 5-formyltetrahydrofolate(19Brigle K.E. Westin E.H. Houghton M.T. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector, pKJ-1, contains the gene for neomycin resistance (neor) under control of the constitutive murine phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, and was kindly provided by Dr. M. W. McBurney, the University of Ottawa, Canada(31McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra C.N. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5761-5775Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To construct the pKJ-FR-α expression vector, the neor cassette in pKJ-1 was removed by restriction with PstI and replaced with an NsiI fragment containing the FR-α coding region. Constructs were screened by restriction analysis and orientation confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. pKJ-FR-α was co-transfected with pKJ-1 into L1210 and MTXrA cells by electroporation and selected on 750 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks. The cell line MTXrA-TF1 was isolated by dilution cloning in complete RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of G418. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (Biotecx) and poly(A)+ RNA isolated using Quickprep (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.). Northern hybridizations were performed as described previously(19Brigle K.E. Westin E.H. Houghton M.T. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the FR-α transcript identified in the transfected cell line was derived from the pJK-FR-α expression vector, Northern blots were probed with an oligonucleotide which spans the pGK promoter-FR-α junction. The DHFR specific probe is the full-length murine cDNA for this enzyme(32Simonsen C.C. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The probe for the reduced folate carrier (RFC1) was generated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction utilizing RNA isolated from murine erythroleukemia cells using primers based on the sequence reported by Dixon et al.(14Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding of [3H]folic acid to FR-α was determined with whole cells at 0°C as described previously (33Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with the following minor modification. The assay mixture contained 1-4 × 106 acid-washed cells (0°C HBS at pH 4.5) and [3H]folic acid in HBS (20 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, pH 7.4). Following incubation for 10 min at 0°C, the samples were centrifuged (12,000 × g, 0°C, 2 min), the supernatant aspirated, and residual fluid removed by a second centrifugation and aspiration step. Cell pellets were processed and radioactivity determined as described previously(34Fry D.W. Goldman I.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 66: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At each concentration tested, specific binding was determined as the difference between [3H]folic acid bound in the absence and presence of 100 μM unlabeled folic acid. Specific binding of folic acid to FR-α in L1210 and MTXrA cell lines was not detected in this assay. Using this same assay, separate experiments were performed to determine the effects of specific agents (CI-920, BSP, or probenecid) on the binding of 0.1 μM [3H]MTX, 0.1 μM [3H]5-methyltetrahydrofolate, or 50 nM [3H]folic acid to MTXrA-TF1. Ligand and competitor were presented to the cells simultaneously. Under these conditions specific binding of MTX to the reduced folate carrier in L1210 and MTXrA is not detectable. Influx measurements were performed by methods described previously(34Fry D.W. Goldman I.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 66: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and acid washed to remove endogenous folates bound to FR-α at the cell surface. Cells were then washed twice with 0°C HBS, pH 7.4 (assay buffer, see above) and resuspended in this buffer to 1 × 107 cells/ml. The cell suspensions were equilibrated at 37°C for 10 minutes, uptake initiated by the addition of [3H]MTX, and samples taken over the indicated intervals. Influx was terminated by injecting 1.0 ml of the cell suspension into 10.0 ml 0°C acid HBS (pH 4.5). Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 0°C HBS (pH 7.4), and processed for determination of intracellular tritium as described previously (34Fry D.W. Goldman I.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 66: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Influx intervals were adjusted so that [3H]MTX uptake did not exceed the DHFR binding capacity assuring that unidirectional uptake conditions were sustained. For experiments at pH 6.2, MBS buffer was used (20 mM MES, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM glucose)(35Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments NaCl was removed from HBS and replaced with HEPES or other salts. All buffers were adjusted to 290 ± 10 mosm/liter as assessed on a Osmette A osmometer (Precision Systems, Inc., Natich, MA). For growth studies, 0.2-ml cultures (8.0 × 104 cells/ml) in 96-well plates were continuously exposed to the appropriate concentrations of MTX, folic acid, or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate for 72 h, following which cell numbers were determined by hemocytometer count and viability determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were cultured for at least 10 generations in RPMI 1640 medium prior to the analyses of MTX growth inhibition or for 15 generations in folate-free RPMI medium containing GAT prior to assessment of folic acid or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate growth requirements. These studies utilized a derivative L1210 leukemia cell line, MTXrA, which is resistant to MTX due to a loss of mobility of the reduced folate carrier(29Schuetz J.D. Westin E.H. Matherly L.H. Pincus R. Swerdlow P.S. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16261-16267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this line, the carrier is present at the cell surface in unchanged number with unchanged affinity for the drug, but translocation of MTX into the cell does not occur(29Schuetz J.D. Westin E.H. Matherly L.H. Pincus R. Swerdlow P.S. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16261-16267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, MTXrA was transfected with an expression vector containing the L1210-derived cDNA encoding the murine folate receptor FR-α(19Brigle K.E. Westin E.H. Houghton M.T. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following selection on G418, clones were isolated, expanded, and analyzed for constitutive high level expression of FR-α. Several clones were identified, and one of these, MTXrA-TF1, was used for all subsequent studies. As shown in Fig. 1, the FR-α transcript was highly expressed in this line but was not detected in either the L1210 or MTXrA cell lines. In contrast, each cell line expressed similar levels of message for DHFR and the reduced folate carrier transcript (RFC1) recently identified(14Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the MTXrA line, this observation is consistent with previous biochemical studies that indicate a present but nonfunctional reduced folate carrier(29Schuetz J.D. Westin E.H. Matherly L.H. Pincus R. Swerdlow P.S. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16261-16267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MTXrA-TF1 transfectant expresses a functional membrane FR-α at a level of 8.9 ± 0.6 nmol/g dry weight of cells (or 1.3 ± 0.1 pmol/106 cells) as assessed by [3H]folic acid binding at 0°C. Based on Scatchard analysis (Fig. 2), the Kb for [3H]folic acid binding was 1.9 ± 0.5 nM, in agreement with values for endogenous murine and human FR-α(33Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Wang X. Shen F. Freisheim J.H. Gentry L.E. Ratnam M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1898-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Over the concentration range of 10 nM to 1 μM, no specific binding of folic acid to L1210 or MTXrA could be detected consistent with the lack of expression of FR-α in these lines (Fig. 1). Consistent with the high affinity of FR-α for folic acid(33Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Wang X. Shen F. Freisheim J.H. Gentry L.E. Ratnam M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1898-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), expression of FR-α in MTXrA-TF1 resulted in a 400-fold lower folic acid growth requirement compared to L1210 or MTXrA (Fig. 3, upper panel). The very small increase in the folic acid growth requirement observed for MTXrA, which lacks a functional reduced folate carrier, compared to L1210 cells demonstrates that the reduced folate carrier is not a major uptake route for folic acid in either cell line. Compared to MTXrA, both the MTXrA-TF1 and L1210 cell lines exhibited a 35-fold lower growth requirement for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, a good substrate for both FR-α (33Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Wang X. Shen F. Freisheim J.H. Gentry L.E. Ratnam M. Biochem.

Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 11Henderson G.B.

Pharmacol. 1979; 28: 2993-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, middle panel). Overexpression of FR-α at the level achieved in the MTXrA-TF1 line appears to compensate completely for the loss of the reduced folate carrier in meeting cellular demands for folate, even at concentrations of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate comparable to physiologic 5-methyltetrahydrofolate levels. When grown in the presence of 2.3 μM folic acid (RPMI 1640 medium), the high level of MTX resistance in the MTXrA line is maintained in the MTXrA-TF1 transfectant (Fig. 3, lower panel). An extracellular folic acid concentration of 10 nM (a level which fully supports growth of MTXrA-TF1; Fig. 3, upper panel) resulted in only a small increase in the sensitivity of the MTXrA-TF1 transfectant to MTX (data not shown). These observations are consistent with transport studies (see below) demonstrating that low levels of folic acid abolish MTX uptake mediated by FR-α. When grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.3 μM folic acid, influx of [3H]MTX in the MTXrA-TF1 transfectant was negligible compared to L1210 cells (data not shown). However, when folate was first stripped from FR-α by pretreating cells with acid HBS (pH 4.5) at 0°C, influx of 0.1 μM [3H]MTX in the transfected line was restored to a level identical to that of L1210 cells (Fig. 4). Acid washing is not a requirement for restoration of transport since similar results were obtained in MTXrA-TF1 cells grown in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with either 0.5 nM folic acid or GAT. [3H]MTX influx in L1210 or MTXrA was not altered by the acid wash or growth in folate-free medium; transport was always present in L1210 cells and always absent in MTXrA cells. At an extracellular MTX concentration of 0.1 μM, influx in MTXrA was less than 1/75 that of L1210 or MTXrA-TF1 cells. The [3H]MTX associated with MTXrA-TF1 cells was within the intracellular compartment and not simply bound to FR-α on the cell membrane since an HBS acid wash (pH 4.5) following [3H]MTX uptake removed only a trivial amount of drug (data not shown). The ratio of [3H]MTX influx in MTXrA-TF1 to L1210 cells decreased as the extracellular MTX concentration was increased (Fig. 5), suggesting that transport in MTXrA-TF1 cells saturates at a lower MTX concentration with a lower influx Vmax than in L1210 cells. This was indeed the case. As shown in Table 1, the measured influx, Kt, for MTX in the MTXrA-TF1 transfectant (0.21 μM) is 1/20 that of L1210 cells (4.2 μM), and is consistent with the MTX Kb for FR-α (0.14 μM)(33Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The influx Vmax for MTX in the MTXrA-TF1 line (0.18 nmol/g dry weight/min) is 1/16 that observed for L1210 cells (2.9 nmol/g dry weight/min). The level of expression (MTX Bmax) of FR-α in MTXrA-TF1 (8.9 nmol/gram dry weight) is 6 times that observed for the reduced folate carrier in L1210 cells (1.5 nmol/g dry weight)(29Schuetz J.D. Westin E.H. Matherly L.H. Pincus R. Swerdlow P.S. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16261-16267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence the cycling rate for the reduced folate carrier in L1210 cells is 100 times faster than the cycling rate for FR-α in MTXrA-TF1. 2The maximum cycling rate for each transporter is equal to: (Vmax(nmol of MTX transported/g dry weight/min))/(Bmax(nmol MTX binding site/g dry weight)) × 60 = mol transported/mol binding site/h. In contrast, influx of MTX in the MTXrA line was consistently less than 2% (1/75) of influx in L1210 cells at extracellular MTX concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μM (Fig. 5). This is consistent with a similar Kt (3.9 μM) and greater than 90-fold lower Vmax for MTX influx in MTXrA in comparison to L1210 cells (Table 1).Table I Open table in a new tab To further characterize the mechanism of MTX transport in the transfected line, influx was measured in the presence of either folic acid or the reduced folate carrier inhibitors BSP, probenecid, or CI-920. A concentration of 0.1 μM MTX was used because of the equivalent influx in L1210 and MTXrA-TF1 cells at this level of drug, while MTX influx in MTXrA cells is negligible (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). Influx of [3H]MTX in the MTXrA-TF1 transfectant is markedly inhibited by folic acid. While the addition of 1.0 μM folic acid abolishes [3H]MTX influx in this line, it has no effect on in"
https://openalex.org/W2029773018,"Absolute metabolic fluxes in isolated perfused hearts have been determined by a nonlinear least squares analysis of glutamate labeling kinetics from [1-13C]glucose, [4-13C]β-hydroxybutyrate, or [2-13C]acetate using 13C NMR spectroscopy. With glucose as substrate, the malate-aspartate shuttle flux was too slow to account for the reducing equivalents generated by glycolysis and to predict the observed oxygen consumption rate. For acetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, the malate-aspartate shuttle had to be reversed for the network to agree with the observed oxygen consumption and glutamate labeling. Thus, an additional redox shuttle was required to reoxidize the NADH produced by cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase. Using this model there was good agreement between the experimentally determined oxygen consumption and glutamate labeling and the calculated values of these parameters from the model for all substrates. The contribution of exogenous substrate to the overall tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux, 89.6 ± 6.5% (mean ± S.D.) as measured in the tissue extracts compared well with 91.4 ± 4.2% calculated by the model. The ratio of TCA cycle flux to oxygen consumption for acetate, was 2.2 ± 0.1, indicating that NADH production is principally accounted for by TCA cycle flux. For glucose or β-hydroxybutyrate, this ratio was 2.9 ± 0.2, consistent with the existence of other NADH producing reactions (e.g. glycolysis, β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation). Absolute metabolic fluxes in isolated perfused hearts have been determined by a nonlinear least squares analysis of glutamate labeling kinetics from [1-13C]glucose, [4-13C]β-hydroxybutyrate, or [2-13C]acetate using 13C NMR spectroscopy.

As 13C-enriched substrates are metabolized, the 13C label is transferred to various metabolic intermediates. The specific location of the label is dependent on the chemistry of the enzyme reactions, and the rate of incorporation is determined by the flux through particular metabolic pathways. If the concentration of the intermediates is high enough (approximately 10−3M), the time course of 13C label incorporation can be determined using 13C NMR spectroscopy. In many biological systems the intermediates in glycolysis and the TCA 1The abbreviations used are: TCAtricarboxylic acidMVO2oxygen consumptionfluxTCA cycle fluxRFO2ratio of MVO2 to flux. cycle are below the limit of detection by NMR. However, glutamate is present in sufficient concentration for detection by NMR and is in exchange with the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate, via two transaminase reactions. There have been many studies that have analyzed the steady state 13C labeling of glutamate to determine the relative contribution of various substrates to the overall TCA cycle flux(8Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M.H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Lewandowski E.D.

These approaches, however, are limited in that they do not provide estimates of absolute metabolic fluxes, which can be obtained by analysis of 13C labeling kinetics(22Chance E.M. Seeholzer S.H. Kobayashi K. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13785-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). tricarboxylic acid oxygen consumption TCA cycle flux ratio of MVO2 to flux. If glutamate is in rapid exchange with the TCA cycle, measurement of the time course of 13C label incorporation into glutamate by 13C NMR spectroscopy may provide a means for noninvasively determining the oxygen consumption of an organ in vivo. However, such an analysis is critically dependent on knowing the mechanism by which the glutamate pool is labeled, since only a small fraction of the total glutamate pool is in exchange with α-ketoglutarate. Consequently, there has been much interest in analyzing the kinetics of isotopic incorporation in order to estimate TCA cycle fluxes in vivo. Such calculations of absolute fluxes cannot be made from the measurement of steady state enrichment data and external fluxes alone, due to the complexity of the reaction networks involved. In this study, we have built upon the earlier work by Chance et al.(22Chance E.M. Seeholzer S.H. Kobayashi K. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13785-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that modeling of 13C NMR kinetic data from rat hearts perfused with [2-13C]acetate and [3-13C]pyruvate lead to accurate estimates of the TCA cycle flux and the aspartate and alanine aminotransferase reaction rates. We have developed a mathematical description encompassing both glycolysis and the TCA cycle and analyzed the rate of labeling of glutamate in the isolated perfused heart with three different labeled substrates. Analysis of the kinetics of glutamate labeling in combination with measured values for pool size, fractional enrichments, and oxygen consumption have enabled us to show how small unlabeled influxes affect the end point enrichments and increase the accuracy of the calculated fluxes, yielding insight into the nature of the network of significant reactions that occur in the intact heart. Randomly fed, male Sprague-Dawley rats, 300-350 g (Charles River, Laboratories, Wilmington MA) were heparinized (500 units/100 g, intraperitoneal) and anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Hearts were rapidly excised and the aorta cannulated for retrograde perfusion with a Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer at 37°C. The buffer contained (in mM): NaCl, 118; KCl, 6; Mg2SO4, 1.2; CaCl2,1.25; Na2HCO3, 25; and was equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2 to saturate the perfusate with oxygen and maintain a pH of 7.4. A balloon was inserted into the left ventricle through the mitral valve for continuous measurement of left ventricular pressure. Balloon volume was adjusted to obtain a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 5 mmHg. An additional pressure transducer was connected to the aortic perfusion line for continuous monitoring of coronary perfusion pressure, and flow was adjusted to maintain a constant perfusion pressure of 76-80 mmHg. Left ventricular pressures and coronary perfusion pressure were recorded on a Gould 3400 recorder (Gould, Inc., Billerica, MA). A total of six hearts were perfused under one of four substrate conditions: 1) glucose, 5 mM plus insulin (0.05U/ml), n = 2; 2) β-hydroxybutyrate, 11 mM plus glucose, 5 mM and insulin (0.05 unit/ml), n = 2; 3) acetate, 11 mM, n = 1 or 4) acetate, 11 mM plus glucose, 5 mM, and insulin (0.05 unit/ml), n = 1. After approximately 30-min equilibration with unlabeled substrates the perfusate was switched to that containing 13C-labeled substrates: 1) [1-13C]glucose, 5 mM; 2) [4-13C]β-hydroxybutyrate, 11 mM plus glucose, 5 mM; 3) [2-13C]acetate, 11 mM; or 4) [2-13C]acetate, 11 mM plus glucose, 5 mM. In all experiments the composition of the perfusate before and after switching to labeled substrates was identical except for the presence of the 13C label. In each group the 13C-labeled substrates were 99% enriched. In the groups with two substrates (i.e. β-hydroxybutyrate plus glucose and acetate plus glucose) the glucose was unlabeled. The 13C-labeled glucose and acetate were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Woburn, MA), and the [4-13C]β-hydroxybutyrate was purchased from Isotech Inc. (Miamisburg, OH). In a parallel set of experiments cardiac oxygen consumption was determined over a range of work loads (rate pressure product varied between 5,000 and 35,000 mmHg min−1). Effluent from the pulmonary artery was directed through a micro-flow-through electrode (model DO-166FT, Lazar Research Laboratories, Inc., Los Angeles, CA) for determination of oxygen content. Oxygen consumption was calculated from the difference between the oxygen content in the aortic cannula and the pulmonary artery, normalized to the coronary flow and wet weight of the heart. From these experiments a linear relationship between rate pressure product and oxygen consumption was obtained. This relationship was used to calculate the oxygen consumption of the hearts used in the NMR experiments. We found no differences in this relationship between the various substrates. The relationship between oxygen consumption and the rate pressure product determined in this study was very similar to that reported by Weiss et al.(23Weiss R.G. Gloth S.T. Kalil-Filho R. Chacko V.P. Stern M.D. Gerstenblith G. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 392-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in acetate-perfused hearts. The perfused hearts were placed in a remotely switched dual-tuned (13C and 31P) 20-mm commercial probe, and spectra were obtained with a Bruker AM 360-WB NMR spectrometer (8.5T, 89-mm diameter bore). Magnetic field homogeneity was optimized by observing the water signal using the 1H decoupling coil. 31P NMR spectra were recorded at the beginning and end of each experiment to assess the bioenergetic status of the hearts. 31P spectra were collected with bi-level 1H decoupling as described previously (12Chatham J.C. Forder J.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 1203-1213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Chatham J.C. Cousins J.P. Glickson J.D. J. Mol. Cell.

Acta. 1992; 1138: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) using a 2-s relaxation delay and a 60° pulse in 5 min and stored in 1K data blocks. After four natural abundance 13C NMR spectra were recorded, hearts were perfused with buffer containing 13C-labeled substrates, and 13C spectra were acquired continuously for 40-55 min. 13C NMR spectra were collected in 5-min intervals using a 1-s delay and a 60° pulse and stored in 2 K data blocks. High resolution 13C NMR spectra of heart extracts were collected using a Bruker MSL-500 NMR spectrometer equipped with an 11.74T magnet (89-mm diameter bore) and a commercial 10-mm probe. Extract spectra were obtained under fully relaxed conditions (8-s total interpulse delay, 12 μs (60°) pulse) with a 25 KHz sweep width, and stored in 32K data blocks. Spectra were proton decoupled using composite pulse decoupling during data acquisition only (to avoid nuclear Overhauser enhancement). 13C NMR spectra of the perfused heart were processed on a SUN computer using a nonlinear least squares fitting routine in the time domain developed by Barker and Sibisi(26Barker P.B. Sibisi S. Nonlinear Least Squares Analysis of in Vivo P NMR Data, Ninth Annual Scientific Meeting, August 18-24, 1990, New York. Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, New York1990Google Scholar). Prior to analysis, natural abundance 13C spectra were subtracted from those obtained following perfusion with labeled substrate; thus, the resonance intensities obtained were those that increased as a result of metabolism of the labeled substrate. High resolution spectra of extracts were analyzed using standard integration routines. Spectra were zero-filled to 64 or 128K and filtered with a 2-Hz line broadening prior to Fourier transformation. At the end of the NMR experiments each heart was freeze-clamped between liquid nitrogen-cooled aluminum blocks. Each heart was pulverized into a fine powder under liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar. The powder was then homogenized with 3 volumes of 6% perchloric acid using a Tekmar Tissumizer (Tekmar Company, Cincinnati OH) for 5 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed from the protein pellet and neutralized with a mixture of KHCO3 (3 M) and KOH (1 M). An aliquot (1 ml) of the neutralized supernatant was frozen for subsequent assay of total glutamate based on the conversion of NADH to NAD+ via glutamate dehydrogenase(27Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1985Google Scholar). The remainder of the supernatant was mixed with chelating resin (Sigma) to remove paramagnetic metal ion contamination and centrifuged once more. The supernatant was freeze-dried and the lyophilized heart extract dissolved in D2O (99.9%). The pH was adjusted to 7.0 using 5 M HCl, the sample treated with chelating resin once more and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and high resolution NMR spectra of the extracts were recorded as described above. The approach used was similar to that described in detail previously(22Chance E.M. Seeholzer S.H. Kobayashi K. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13785-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the basic reactions of the TCA cycle, we have added malic enzyme, cytoplasmic transaminase, and malate-aspartate shuttle reactions. Since metabolite pool sizes remain constant over the time course of these experiments, the number of unknowns reduces to the number of endogenous and exogenous influxes and the flux through the transaminase reactions. The TCA cycle reaction networks used to analyze the 13C incorporation experiments are shown in Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:. Oxygen consumption (MVO2) was calculated from the algebraic sum of the fluxes of oxidizing and reducing equivalents (i.e. the sum of the fluxes through the TCA cycle, malate-aspartate shuttle, glycerol phosphate shuttle, glycolysis, β-oxidation, and proteolysis) divided by two.Figure 2:Reaction network used to analyze the kinetics of glutamate labeling for one of the experiments with [4-13C]β-hydroxybutyrate and unlabeled glucose as substrates and the calculated steady state enzyme velocities (β-HB Exp. 1 from Table 2).

Although it was evident that the glutamate pool size would effect the flux calculations, it was not clear what effect differences in TCA cycle intermediate pool sizes would have on these calculations. An extensive sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the effect of changes in these pools on the calculated fluxes. We found that if the intermediate pool sizes were small relative to glutamate, changes in pool size had no effect on the calculated fluxes. Since these intermediates were below the limits of detection in the 13C NMR spectra from both the intact heart and the tissue extracts, it was felt appropriate to assume that they were small relative to glutamate. Consequently the pool sizes for most of the TCA cycle intermediates were taken from the earlier work of Chance et al.(22Chance E.M. Seeholzer S.H. Kobayashi K. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13785-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and converted to micromoles/g of wet weight. For TCA cycle intermediates that were not measured in that paper, such as succinate, fumarate, and oxaloacetate, an arbitrary value of 0.1 μmol/g of wet weight was used. One of the other uncertainties in the model was the distribution of metabolites between the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments. To determine whether this distribution was important in calculating the fluxes the ratio of these compartments was varied between 5 and 40%. This covers the range of values for the fraction of the total cell volume occupied by the mitochondria in skeletal and cardiac muscle (28Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1991Google Scholar). Analysis indicated that the relative sizes of these two compartments over this range did not have a significant effect on the calculated fluxes. The reactions used in construction of the model along with the number of differential equations necessary to describe each reaction are listed in Table 1. The total number of differential equations required to describe the network of reactions is 340. The reason for this large number of equations is that one equation is used to describe the reaction between two specific labeled intermediates. The number of possible labeled species for any intermediate is 2n, where n is the number of carbon atoms. For example, a total of 32 differential equations are required to describe the interconversion between α-ketoglutarate and glutamate via one aminotransferase reaction.Table I Open table in a new tab The 13C-labeled substrates enter the network as influxes and are assumed to be the principle sources of energy and of 13C label in the system. Due to the cleavage of the [1-13C]glucose and [4-13C]β-hydroxybutyrate molecules into 3- and 2-carbon fragments, respectively, the maximum possible fractional enrichment at acetyl-CoA C-2 is 50% (in contrast to that of [2-13C]acetate, which is 100%). In order to account for our observation that end point enrichments of glutamate were significantly less than the maximum possible enrichment, additional unlabeled endogenous influxes had to be included in the network. Isotopic dilution at glutamate C-4 originates from influxes into the acetyl-CoA pool; this is a common end point of many different pathways. Two principal pathways that could be responsible for isotopic dilution of acetyl-CoA are glycolysis (Fgl) and β-oxidation of endogenous fatty acids (Fb). Depending on the perfusion conditions, Fgl could arise from unlabeled glucose or from glycogen breakdown; it is not possible to distinguish between these pathways in our network. Entry of unlabeled substrates into the TCA cycle other than via acetyl-CoA, such as metabolism of amino acids, was represented by a single unlabeled influx (Fs) at succinyl-CoA. It should be noted that since succinyl thiokinase is freely reversible, both succinate and succinyl-CoA were treated as a single pool in our model. Although Fs has been restricted to influx at succinyl-CoA, the network cannot discriminate between unlabeled substrate influx here or via other anaplerotic pathways; the net result is the same i.e. dilution of glutamate C-3 enrichment relative to C-4 In order to maintain constant pool size in the TCA cycle intermediates and to allow the possibility of achieving a steady state, a branch point in the network at the malate pool via malic enzyme had to be included. Malic enzyme has been shown to be active in rat heart mitochondria by a number of workers(29Newsholme E.A. Williams T. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Brdiczka D. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Nolte J. Brdiczka D. Pette D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 284: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Nagel W.O. Dauchy R.T. Sauer L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3849-3854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In terms of the reaction network, the branching opens an alternative pathway from malate to citrate with different fates for the individual carbon atoms. It would be impossible to maintain constant pool sizes if the pathway from mitochondrial malate to mitochondrial pyruvate were omitted from the network. Examination of the networks in Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3: indicates that the absence of malic enzyme in combination with proteolysis would lead to the flux into acetyl-CoA being less than cycle flux and the flux into oxaloacetate being greater than TCA cycle flux. The result of this would be a decrease in acetyl-CoA and malate pools and an increase in oxaloacetate and citrate. A depletion of acetyl-CoA would ultimately lead to a cessation of the TCA cycle due to the lack of entry of 2-carbon fragments and thus a decline in function and ultimately an imbalance in the demand and supply of ATP. However, cardiac function and high energy phosphates are stable in our experiments. It is possible that the additional acetyl-CoA moieties could be supplied by β-oxidation; if this were the case then the fractional enrichment of glutamate C-4 would be significantly less than we measured. Furthermore, if there was an accumulation of citrate this would be evident in the NMR spectra as a resonance at approximately 45 ppm, which was not observed. It therefore seems justified to include the malic enzyme in the network. All the reactions in the network are considered to be irreversible with the exception of the transaminases and fumarase. The reverse flux of the cytosolic transaminase was varied as an unknown parameter. The best agreement between the experimental and calculated results was obtained when the reverse reaction was slow compared with the forward reaction, indicating that the cytosolic transaminase is out of equilibrium. High forward and backward rates for fumarase relative to the TCA cycle were required to maintain a positive velocity and to achieve and maintain the fumarate and malate pool sizes at their equilibrium values. Although there is evidence of pyruvate carboxylase activity in the heart(19Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6964-6971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Davis E.J. Spydevolt Ø. Bremer J. Eur. J.

Flux through this enzyme is usually activated in response to an increase in TCA cycle intermediate pool sizes as occurs following potassium arrest or alterations in available substrates(34Peuhkurinen K.J. Hassinen I.E. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Peuhkurinen K.J. Nuutinen E.M. Pietiläinen E.P. Hiltunen J.K. Hassinen I.E. Biochem.

J. 1981; 194: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In our experiments metabolite pool sizes are constant; thus, it is unlikely that there is significant flux through pyruvate carboxylase. Furthermore, even if there was a small flux through pyruvate carboxylase, in the experiments with unlabeled glucose plus 13C-labeled acetate or β-hydroxybutyrate, this flux would be accounted for by Fs, as the net result would be a dilution of glutamate C-2 and C-3 enrichment. Although metabolism of [1-13C]glucose via pyruvate carboxylase would initially lead to an inequality in the enrichments of glutamate C-2 and C-3, the high forward and backward rates of fumarase will result in complete randomization in the labeling of glutamate C-2 and C-3. Therefore, a small contribution from pyruvate carboxylase to the overall TCA cycle flux cannot be ruled out. However, even if there is a small flux through pyruvate carboxylase, this would not affect the calculated MVO2, the exchange of reducing equivalents between the mitochondria and the cytosol or the labeling of the glutamate pool via the malate-aspartate shuttle. The nonlinear least squares analysis of the kinetics of glutamate labeling was carried out using FACSIMILE (ARC Scientific, Oxford, United Kingdom), a computer program specially designed for the solution of large networks of simultaneous, ordinary differential equations(37Chance E.M. Curtis A.R. Jones I.P. Kirby C.R. FACSIMILE: A Computer Program for Flow and Chemistry Simulation and General Initial Value Problems. H. M. Stationary Office, London1977Google Scholar). The use of FACSIMILE overcomes many of the problems inherent in the solution of large networks of differential equations. It uses the laws of mass action to derive the differential equations based on the network provided by the user. Furthermore since the program uses vectors of variables, operations of large arrays can be executed as a single instruction. This approach also enables changes in the network to be carried out with ease. Previously, the solution of such networks of differential equations required a main frame, large scale, sequential processor(22Chance E.M. Seeholzer S.H. Kobayashi K. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13785-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, as a result of advances in both hardware and software, the analyses presented here were carried out on a 486-DX2, 50 MHz laptop in less than 3 min. A typical series of 13C NMR spectra recorded from a heart perfused with [4-13C]β-hydroxybutyrate is shown in Fig. 4. The label first appeared in the C-4 position of glutamate and subsequently in the C-2 and C-3 positions; no other resonances were observed. With [1-13C]glucose as substrate the only differences were the additional incorporation of the 13C label into lactate, alanine, and glycogen.

The most striking observation is that the actin-tropomyosin filament appears to be regulated as a single unit. At pCa 9.0, addition of up to 4 nM troponin causes the proportion of filaments motile to decrease from >85% to 20% with no dissociation of the filaments from the heavy meromyosin surface or change in velocity. Increasing Ca2+ concentration causes the filaments to be switched back on with half-maximal increase in the proportion of filaments motile at pCa 5.8-6.0 and a modest increase in filament velocity. This is an “all or none” process in which an entire filament, up to 15 μm long, switches rapidly as a single cooperative unit. Thus, the effect of Ca2+ upon the thin filament is to recruit motile filaments. In striated muscles, contractility is controlled by Ca2+ binding to the regulatory protein complex troponin, which is a component of the thin filaments.

INTRODUCTIONThe Ca2+ regulation of actomyosin in vitro by troponin and tropomyosin has been studied intensively over the last 25 years, and a generally accepted mechanism for control of contractility has emerged (reviewed in (1Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and (2El-Saleh S.C. Warber K.D. Potter J.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1986; 7: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). Tropomyosin plays the central role in regulation by moving its position relative to actin, such that when the thin filament is switched “on,” it does not impede cross-bridge cycling. To switch the thin filament “off,” tropomyosin moves to prevent access to the “strong” myosin binding sites on actin, thereby blocking the ATPase cycle. This movement of tropomyosin relative to actin (3Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) is controlled by the inhibitory component of troponin, troponin I, which acts as an allosteric inhibitor, and this effect is regulated in response to Ca2+ via the Ca2+ binding component of troponin, troponin C(1Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In vitro, troponin regulates the Vmax of actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin Mg2+-ATPase while the Km is virtually independent of the degree of activation(4Chalovich J.M. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2432-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In intact muscle, Ca2+ primarily controls the force and does not regulate unloaded velocity(5Brenner B. Jacob R. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1980; 75: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Brenner B. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1986; 81: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At first glance, the observations in vitro and in live muscle seem to be contradictory; however, it should be remembered that both types of experiments measure different properties of bulk material. Analysis of the performance of individual contractile filaments would provide the opportunity to elucidate the mechanism in greater molecular detail.In principle, the study of the movement of single actin filaments over myosin in vitro is an ideal technique for investigating the protein switches that regulate actomyosin. Rather, little work has been done on Ca2+-dependent regulation of individual filaments by skeletal muscle troponin and tropomyosin. Honda and Asakura (7Honda H. Asakura S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) observed fluorescently labeled actin filaments moving within an actomyosin gel. They showed that reconstituted rabbit skeletal muscle thin filaments moved at either maximal or zero velocity but described little detailed analysis. Wang et al.(8Wang F. Martin B.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3776-3780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studied the troponin from Limulus muscle and observed that high concentrations of troponin halted actin-tropomyosin filament movement, while Harada et al.(9Harada Y. Sakurada K. Aoki T. Thomas D.D. Yanagida T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) noted a similar effect using rabbit skeletal muscle “native tropomyosin.”We have used the in vitro motility assay devised by Kron and Spudich (10Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) to make a detailed quantitative analysis of skeletal muscle troponin-tropomyosin control of actin filament movement over immobilized heavy meromyosin (HMM). 1The abbreviations used are: HMMheavy meromyosinϕrhodamine-phalloidin. We found that under suitable conditions, where 85% of actin-tropomyosin filaments were motile, incorporation of troponin at low Ca2+ concentrations controlled the proportion of filaments that were moving without affecting velocity or displacing actin from myosin. At a fixed inhibitory concentration of troponin, increasing Ca2+ concentration released the inhibition largely by increasing the proportion of filaments, which were motile back to the level observed with actin-tropomyosin alone.MATERIALS AND METHODSActin, troponin, myosin, and tropomyosin were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle by standard procedures(11Eisenberg E. Kielley W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4742-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ebashi S. Ebashi F. Kodama A. J. Biochem.

Studies from the Institute of Medical Chemistry. Vol. 2. University of Szeged, 1942: 3-16Google Scholar). HMM was prepared from myosin, and skeletal muscle F-actin was labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin (ϕ) as described by Kron et al.(15Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). F-actin•ϕ-tropomyosin and F-actin•ϕ-tropomyosin-troponin complexes were formed at 10× assay concentration. 100 nM F-actin•ϕ, 100 nM skeletal muscle tropomyosin, and 0-80 nM troponin were mixed in 50 mM KCl, 25 mM Imidazole-HCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, and incubated for 30-60 min. The complexes were diluted 10-fold immediately prior to infusion into the motility cell.All experiments were carried out using coverslips coated with silicone by soaking in 0.2% dichloromethylsilane in chloroform. A flow cell was prepared from a freshly siliconized coverslip and a microscope slide as described by Kron et al.(15Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Assay components and buffers were infused into the flow cell at 30-60-s intervals.HMM was pretreated to minimize the presence of “rigor heads,” which show ATP insensitive binding to actin filaments. HMM, F-actin, and ATP were mixed to final concentrations of 200 μg/ml, 150 μg/ml, and 1 mM, respectively, and incubated on ice for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet F-actin with associated “rigor heads,” leaving HMM in the supernatant suitable for use in the motility assay for several hours. Two 50-μl aliquots of HMM at 100 μg/ml were infused in buffer A (50 mM KCl, 25 mM Imidazole-HCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) to provide a coating of immobilized HMM on the coverslip. This was followed by 2 × 50 μl of buffer B (A + 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and then 2 × 50 μl of 10 nM actin•ϕ± associated tropomyosin-troponin in buffer A. 50 μl of buffer C (B + 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.5% methylcellulose, ± troponin at assay concentration) and 50 μl of buffer D (C + 1 mM ATP) were then infused. Ca2+ concentration was varied by incorporating Ca2+-EGTA buffers in the final assay buffers C and D.The movement of actin•ϕ-tropomyosin filaments over the immobilized skeletal muscle HMM was observed under a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (63/1.25 objective) with a DAGE-SIT-68 camera and recorded on video tape. We only collected data from cells in which at least 80% of actin•ϕ or actin•ϕ-tropomyosin filaments were motile.For analysis of filament movement, a sequence of 10 images was collected at 0.65-s intervals via a frame grabber installed in a Macintosh IIci computer. 20 filaments were chosen at random from a printout of the first image and were tracked manually using custom made software (ME Electronics, Reading, United Kingdom), which yielded x and y coordinates, velocity, and time for each step in the sequence.We determined standard errors in velocity measurements with increasing numbers of actin filaments moving at an average of 3.4 μm/s. Standard error reduced from 0.07 to 0.03 between 5 and 20 filaments tracked but was only reduced by a further 0.013 in tracking another 150 filaments. Velocity, standard error or proportion of motile filaments showed no significant alteration in tracking filaments from separate sequences in the same assay or through longer time intervals.The density of filaments attached to heavy meromyosin was determined using a subroutine of the filament analysis program. From each assay, five images were collected randomly from different areas of the flow cell, and filament number was counted. The overall average provided a measure of the filament density in each 100 μm2 of the assay cell.DISCUSSIONThe mechanism of Ca2+ control of striated muscle by troponin and tropomyosin has been determined from studies of bulk material in solution or in intact muscle fibers. The motility assay provides an ideal system to extend these studies at the level of the individual thin filament. Studies to date (7Honda H. Asakura S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Wang F. Martin B.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3776-3780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Harada Y. Sakurada K. Aoki T. Thomas D.D. Yanagida T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) have shown that troponin, tropomyosin, and low Ca2+ concentrations stop filaments moving; however, those experiments have usually involved rather high concentrations of tropomyosin and troponin, and little analysis of movement quality has been attempted.In this study, we have investigated troponin-tropomyosin control of thin filament motility based on the following criteria. 1) We have demonstrated that tropomyosin and troponin are actually bound to the actin filaments at motility assay conditions. 2) We have set experimental conditions such that at least 80% of filaments are motile in control assays. 3) Results obtained from different motility cells under the same conditions are consistent (see Table 1). 4) Filaments are randomly chosen for analysis of movement; thus, there are no a priori selection rules that might bias results. 5) A complete analysis of filament movement is made on a second-to-second time scale, from which we have determined velocity, proportion of filaments motile, and density of filaments attached to the HMM substrate.Effect of Tropomyosin on MotilityTropomyosin binding is reported to be highly cooperative with 50% bound at 0.2-2 μMin vitro from equilibrium measurements(16Heeley D.H. Watson M.H. Mak A.S. Dubord P. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2424-2430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It might be expected, therefore, that formation of actin-tropomyosin complexes at the 10 nM concentration required for the motility assay would not be possible. In practice, however, we found that tropomyosin and troponin remained bound to the actin at the low concentrations employed in the assay, provided that the proteins were premixed at 10× assay concentration (100 nM of each) and then diluted prior to use (Fig. 1). The apparent disagreement with the equilibrium binding experiments may indicate a kinetic barrier to tropomyosin dissociation during our experiments.The skeletal muscle actin-tropomyosin complex is largely in the “off” state under typical test tube experimental conditions (18Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and consequently gives a lower activation of myosin Mg2+-ATPase than actin itself. We observed a corresponding effect in the motility assay at 25°C where the incorporation of tropomyosin “switched off” a considerable proportion of the actin filaments. The problem could be avoided by using tropomyosin from smooth muscle, which is predominantly in the “on” state at normal ionic strengths(20Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2070-2072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively we found that by increasing the assay temperature to 28°C, which favors the “on” state with skeletal muscle tropomyosin(22Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we could obtain a satisfactory and consistent level of motility with >85% of the filaments motile.The Effect of the Troponin Complex on MotilityLow concentrations of troponin, at 10ϕM Ca2+, stopped actin-tropomyosin filaments moving but did not displace the filaments from the HMM surface. Analysis of the movement clearly showed that troponin had no effect on filament velocity; the major effect being on the proportion of filaments that were motile. This “switch off” of filaments was virtually complete at 5 nM troponin and indicated an apparent affinity in the order of 0.5 × 109M−1 for troponin binding to actin-tropomyosin. Higher concentrations of troponin produced a displacement of filaments from the HMM, but since this occurred both in the absence and presence of tropomyosin, displacement was clearly not directly related to troponin control of actin-tropomyosin filament motility.The motility of actin-tropomyosin-troponin filaments was regulated by Ca2+, and the major effect of increasing Ca2+ was to increase the proportion of filaments that were motile. Ca2+ also had a significant effect upon the velocity of filament movement. Since this velocity change did not occur when troponin was titrated against actin-tropomyosin, it seems likely that the velocity effect was due to a separate Ca2+-dependent process. It is known that there is a Ca2+-dependent interaction between troponin T and troponin C that influences ATPase activity(23Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10587-10592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24van Eerd J-P. Kawasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4972-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When we examined Ca2+ control of the motility of actin-tropomyosin-troponin I-troponin C filaments (Table 1), we found the same effect on % motility as with whole troponin but no effect upon velocity, thus supporting the hypothesis of dual regulatory effects mediated by troponin I and troponin T.The troponin regulation results from the motility assay may readily be interpreted in terms of the mechanism established from solution experiments. Since troponin switches off actin filaments without causing them to dissociate from the HMM•ADP•Pi surface, the troponin-tropomyosin switch does not appear to control weak cross-bridge binding states; thus, the immobile filaments remain attached to myosin via these weak binding sites. Troponin and tropomyosin must therefore control strong cross-bridge binding states in the in vitro motility assay as predicted by experiments in solution and in intact muscles(18Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Brenner B. Eisenberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3542-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 26Brenner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 27Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1279-1285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The results show that troponin acts upon actin-tropomyosin in an “all or none” fashion to switch the filament between the “on” and “off” states, and there is no evidence for intermediate states(1Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2El-Saleh S.C. Warber K.D. Potter J.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1986; 7: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Solution experiments have indicated a regulatory unit of 7-14 actins controlled by one troponin-tropomyosin complex(1Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2El-Saleh S.C. Warber K.D. Potter J.D. J. Muscle Res.

J. 1994; 67: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), while indirect experimentation in muscle fibers has suggested that cooperativity may extend over the entire thin filament(29Brandt P.W. Diamond M.S. Rutchik J.S. Schachat F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the motility assay, we can see the behavior of individual actin filaments directly, and it is clear that the troponin-tropomyosin switch is extremely cooperative such that the entire filament is controlled as a single unit. This phenomenon is independent of the length of the filament (from <2 to 15 μm). We do not know whether this is due to positive cooperativity of troponin binding, such that filaments are either saturated with troponin or troponin-free, or due to cooperative interactions along the thin filament(17Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Brandt P.W. Diamond M.S. Rutchik J.S. Schachat F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The apparently high cooperativity may also relate to effects induced by myosin cross-bridge binding(1Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 28Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Our results are in accord with the observations that Ca2+ primarily controls maximum isometric force in permeabilized muscle fibers rather than unloaded contraction velocity (5Brenner B. Jacob R. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1980; 75: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Brenner B. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1986; 81: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and moreover indicate that it does so by recruiting thin filaments in an “all or none” fashion. It is, however, not certain whether the latter prediction is compatible with current models of the dynamics of muscle regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2060815384,"A purification scheme for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was designed which maximized the yield of all forms of the DNA while minimizing damage to the DNA during its isolation. Treatment of intact mitochondria with DNase I removed nuclear DNA and the avoidance of phenol and the isolation by CsCl density gradients in the absence of ethidium bromide and subsequent detection by Southern Hydridization dot-blots minimized DNA damage. Four different mtDNA forms free of apparent nuclear DNA were obtained: closed circular (I), open circular (II), linear (III), and a large multimer complex (C) which were characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Using this procedure, mtDNA was obtained from both whole cells or intact mitochondria treated with H2O2. Significant fragmentation was observed after treatment at 37°C, but not at 0°C, and more damage was observed when treating whole cells than isolated mitochondria. Very low levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were observed in all cases. However, at doses of H2O2 which were just lethal, neither increased DNA damage nor inactivation of cytochrome c oxidase was observed.

Treatment of intact mitochondria with DNase I removed nuclear DNA and the avoidance of phenol and the isolation by CsCl density gradients in the absence of ethidium bromide and subsequent detection by Southern Hydridization dot-blots minimized DNA damage. Four different mtDNA forms free of apparent nuclear DNA were obtained: closed circular (I), open circular (II), linear (III), and a large multimer complex (C) which were characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Using this procedure, mtDNA was obtained from both whole cells or intact mitochondria treated with H2O2. Significant fragmentation was observed after treatment at 37°C, but not at 0°C, and more damage was observed when treating whole cells than isolated mitochondria. Very low levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were observed in all cases. However, at doses of H2O2 which were just lethal, neither increased DNA damage nor inactivation of cytochrome c oxidase was observed.

Mitochondria consume more than 90% of the cell's oxygen, and the respiratory chain in mitochondria is a major source of oxygen radicals (Chance et al., 1979). mitochondria DNA 2-2′-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) agarose gel electrophoresis ethidium bromide 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine phosphate buffered saline polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) base pair(s) high performance liquid chromatography kilobase pair(s). The mitochondrial genome in animals has a high rate of mutation possibly because mtDNA is not complexed to histones and hence may be more susceptible to attack by active oxygen than chromosomal DNA (Richer, 1992; Brown et al., 1979; Clayton, 1984). Therefore, to study mitochondrial DNA damage, a method for the purification of mtDNA from cells or tissues without the introduction of such damage during the isolation is needed. Most procedures for the isolation of mtDNA take advantage of the unique physical properties of the closed circular form of mtDNA. However, such procedures result in the isolation of only a subset (less than 50%) of the mtDNA; most of the DNA is actually in a nicked or more complex state. Indeed these latter molecules may contain the majority of the damages. Moreover, the use of ethidium bromide or phenol in commonly used procedures for mtDNA isolation may introduce oxidative damages. We thus undertook to devise a procedure which recovers all forms of mtDNA in good yield and which avoids the use of potential free radical-generating chemicals. We then used the procedure to test the effect on mtDNA of treatment of HeLa cells or purified mitochondria from these cells with H2O2. H2O2, thought to be a source of oxidative damage to cellular membranes, proteins, and DNA, is by itself relatively inactive with these cellular constituents. However, in the presence of reduced transition metals such as Fe2+ and Cu+ it generates •OH and related species that are highly reactive with organic compounds (Fenton, 1894; Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1990). Such damaging species can also be generated with Fe3+ and NADH in lieu of Fe2+ (Imlay and Linn, 1988). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. DNase I, ABTS, horseradish peroxidase, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and NADH were obtained from Sigma, snake venom phosphodiesterase and Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase were from Worthington, proteinase K, DNase-free RNase A, and P1-nuclease were from Boehringer Mannheim. Reagents for PCR were from Perkin Elmer and Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol. HeLa cells (109 cells) were grown in spinner culture in 4 liters of Joklik's minimum essential medium modified for suspension culture (JRH BioSciences) containing 4.5 g of glucose/liter supplemented with 5% newborn bovine serum. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 revolutions/min in a Sorvall H-6000 rotor for 10 min, washed twice with PBS by centrifugation at 2600 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 20 ml of MgRSB buffer (10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), allowed to stand at 4°C for 10 min, and then disrupted with a Dounce glass homogenizer, type 1A, with 15-20 strokes. Disruption was verified by microscopic examination. Twenty-six ml of 2.5 × MSB buffer (0.525 MD-mannitol, 175 mM sucrose, 12.5 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was added, and diluted homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant fluid was further centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min in a GSA rotor, and the pellet was suspended in 5 ml of EDTA-free MSB containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was digested with 6,000 Kunitz units of DNase I (Sigma) at 37°C for 30 min. After digestion, the suspension was washed three times in 10 volumes of MSB by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The washed pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of MSB and applied on top of sucrose layers consisting of 15 ml of 1.5 M sucrose (lower layer) and 15 ml of 1 M sucrose (upper layer), both containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA. After centrifugation at 25,000 revolutions/min for 30 min in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 4°C, the interface fraction was collected and washed twice with 4 volumes of MSB by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet (mitochondrial fraction) was suspended in 3 ml of STE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and solubilized at 37°C for 10 min by the addition of 330 μl of 10% SDS. CsCl (0.75 g) was added to the solubilized suspension, and the mixture was chilled to 0°C for 10 min after dissolving the CsCl completely. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, an additional 2.8 g of CsCl was added, and the volume was adjusted to 4.5 ml with STE to give a final CsCl concentration of 4.5 M. After centrifugation at 45,000 revolutions/min in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor for 24 h at 20°C, the material in the tube was divided into 18-20 equal fractions by drop collection, and the fractions were monitored for mtDNA by dot-blot Southern hybridization. mtDNA fractions were dialyzed extensively against STE. For cases where ethidium bromide was used, 500 μg of ethidium bromide was added to the CsCl sample solution for ultracentrifugation. After centrifugation, the bands which were visualized under UV light (366 nm) were collected by aspirating with a syringe. After removing ethidium bromide by three extractions with n-butanol, the DNA fraction was dialyzed against STE. For cases where phenol/chloroform extraction was used, the mitochondrial fraction was suspended in 3 ml of STE and incubated with 330 μl of 10% SDS and 400 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) at 50°C for 3 h. After incubation, the digest was extracted with 3 ml of phenol saturated with TE (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) by shaking gently for 30 min. The extraction was repeated twice and then once with 3 ml of phenol/chloroform (1:1). The DNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated by the addition of 370 μl of 3 M sodium acetate and 8 ml of 99.5% ethanol followed by incubation for 30 min at −80°C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with 3 ml of 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in STE. mtDNA fractions were treated with 3 μg of RNase A (DNase free) at 37°C for 2 h, and then the digest was loaded onto a Sephadex G-150 column (0.7 × 18 cm) previously equilibrated with STE to remove the digested RNA. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 60 μl/min, and mtDNA was monitored by dot-blot Southern hybridization. Purified mtDNA was stored at −20°C. HeLa cells (109 cells) were suspended in 167 ml of PBS and exposed to 3 mM H2O2 once at 0 min or three times at 0, 6, 15 min. After a total incubation of 30 min, the cells were washed twice with PBS by centrifugation and mtDNA isolated. To treat mitochondria, the organelles prepared from 109 HeLa cells were suspended in 167 ml of PBS and treated with H2O2 under the same conditions as whole cells. mtDNA was isolated immediately after treatment. mtDNA (0.2-0.5 μg) was dissolved in a mixture of 9 μl of TE and 1 μl of gel loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF, 30% (v/v) glycerol), and then loaded into a well of a 0.5% agarose gel in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Electrophoresis was performed in TBE for 50 min at 80 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml in TBE) and photographed. A HindIII digest of a DNA or a 1-kb DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used as size markers. After electrophoresis, agarose gels were placed in an appropriate volume of 0.25 M HCl until the dye changed color and then left for an additional 10 min. After washing with distilled water, the gel was placed on a wick made from two sheets of Whatman 3MM chromatographic paper and solvated with alkali transfer buffer (0.4 M NaOH). Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.) was cut to the exact size of the gel and placed on top of it. Two sheets of 3MM paper were also cut to size, wetted with alkaline transfer buffer, and placed on top of the membrane together with three sheets of dried 3MM paper. For dot-blot Southern hybridization of samples from CsCl density gradient centrifugations and Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, 2 μl of the fractionated sample solution was heated at 95°C for 5 min, chilled in ice-water, and spotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane which was prewetted with 5 × SSPE (50 mM sodium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.9 M NaCl, pH 7.7) according to the manual accompanying the Hybond N+ membranes. The membrane was then dried, placed onto two thicknesses of Whatman 3MM filters soaked in denaturing solution (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH), left for 5 min, and then transferred to filter papers soaked in neutralizing solution (1.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2), and dried under air. Next, the membrane was placed on a pad of filter paper (two to three pieces thick) soaked in 0.4 M NaOH for 30 min to be fixed, and then rinsed briefly by immersion in 5 × SSPE for less than 1 min and dried under air. After transfers were complete, the membranes were placed in plastic bags filled with hybridization buffer (5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution containing 0.1% Ficoll 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrolidone, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% SDS) supplemented 20 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA and prehybridized in a shaking water bath at 65°C for at least 60 min. After prehybridization, the membranes were hybridized in hybridization buffer at 65°C for 15 h with a 32P-labeled mtDNA probe which had been denatured by boiling for 5 min. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice with 2 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and finally with SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 15 min. The membrane was subjected to autoradiography with Kodak x-ray film and an intensifying screen at −80°C. The nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides for PCR primers were Primer A, L11778m AACTACGAACGTATTCACAG(C+T)CG; Primer B, H12625m GAATTCTATGATGGATCA(G+T)GT, where L and H, correspond to the light and heavy strands, respectively, of mitochondrial DNA (m), and the accompanying number reflects the position of the 3′-end according to the numbering system for human mtDNA (Anderson et al., 1981). The 847-bp probe (nucleotides 12625-11778) was amplified from 0.1 ng of human mtDNA purified from HeLa cells with a GeneAmp amplification reagent (Perkin-Elmer) together with the four nucleotides (0.2 mM each) in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) using the following cycle profile: denature at 93°C for 1 min, anneal at 55°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 1 min, for a total of 30 cycles. The mtDNA probe was labeled with 30 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) during the PCR reaction. The labeled DNA fragment was purified with a Quick Spin column (Boehringer Mannheim) packed with Sephadex G-50. The DNA concentration was adjusted to 2 μg/ml with 5 mM HEPES KOH and 10 mM MgCl2, pH. 7.5, and cytochrome c was added to the final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and samples were spread by the aqueous drop method of Thresher and Griffith (1992). A 20-μl sample was loaded onto a 400-mesh copper-tabbed grid and allowed to sit for 1 min. Two μl of 10 × spermidine buffer (25 mM spermidine, 750 mM NaCl, 500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 mM CaCl2) was added to the sample and then after 30 s, 20 μl of 1% uranyl acetate was added and the grid was put immediately into distilled water for 3 min. The sample was dehydrated stepwise with 25, 50, 75, and 100% ethanol for 5 min each and placed onto filter paper to dry. The DNA was then observed with a JEOL 1200 EXII transmission type electron microscope. Five to 10 μg of mtDNA dissolved in 150 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2 was digested with 3 units of DNase I at 37°C for 30 min, then with 0.9 unit of P1-nuclease for 60 min after adding 4.8 μl of 1 M sodium acetate to the digestion solution. Finally, digestion was completed with a mixture of 0.5 unit of snake venom phosphodiesterase and 1.45 units of bacterial alkaline phosphatase for 30 min after adjusting the digestion solution to pH 8.0 with 1 M Trizma (Tris base). The digested mtDNA solution was stored at −20°C until use. 8-OH-dG analysis by HPLC was carried out according to Shigenaga et al.(1990) with a Water Associates model 625 HPLC solvent delivery system. Separations were performed with a linear gradient of 2.5-6.25% methanol in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 5.5, over 20 min and a Supelco (Bellefonte, PA) LC-18DB Supelcosil 3 μm column (4.6 mm × 15 cm) equipped with a LC-18DB precolumn cartridge assembly at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a back pressure of approximately 2400 pounds/square inch. Electrochemical detection of 8-OH-dG utilized an ESA (Bedford, MA) model 5100 Coulochem detector equipped with a 5011 analytical cell with potentials of electrodes 1 and 2 adjusted to 0.1 and 0.4, respectively. UV detection at 260 nm utilized a Kratos (Westwood, NJ) UV detector. Quantitation of H2O2 was by the ABTS-horseradish peroxidase method described by Putter and Becker(1983). One-hundred μl of sample solution was added to 900 μl of ABTS-horseradish peroxidase reaction mixture (2.5 mM ABTS, 0.2 unit of horseradish peroxidase, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.7). The mixture was allowed to stand at 37°C for 20 min, and then the absorbance of the mixture was measured at 420 nm. Colony forming ability was used as a cytotoxic assay. HeLa cells (3.6 × 106 cells) were suspended in 600 μl of PBS and then treated with H2O2 as described. After treatment, 500 cells from each sample were plated onto a dish (55 cm2) in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g glucose/liter and 10% fetal calf serum and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 in humidified air for 7 days. Colonies of more than 50 cells were fixed with 50% methanol, stained with 0.2% crystal violet, and counted. Mitochondria suspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, were disrupted by freezing and thawing three times as described above. Reduced cytochrome c solution prepared as described by Darly-Usmar et al.(1987) was placed in a cuvette at a concentration of 0.5-10 μM in 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.3% Tween 80, and the spectrum was recorded from 500 to 600 nm to ensure that cytochrome c was fully reduced. An appropriate amount of mitochondrial homogenate prepared as above was added to the cuvette, and the rate of decrease in absorbance at 550 nm was monitored. In order to study damage accumulated in mtDNA, it was necessary to devise a purification method which would account for all forms of the DNA (not just the covalently closed circular molecules), yet not introduce damage into that DNA. The procedure which was developed and several alternatives for comparison are summarized in Fig. 1. HeLa cells were disrupted in hypotonic buffer by Dounce homogenization and, after removing nuclear and membrane fractions by centrifugation, nuclear DNA was digested away with DNase I. The mitochondrial fraction was then isolated by stepwise sucrose density gradient centrifugation and solubilized with 1% SDS. Three subsequent methods were then compared, particularly for monitoring the presence of mtDNA damage. The first procedure used proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction. The second used CsCl density gradient centrifugation with ethidium bromide. The third used CsCl equilibrium centrifugation without ethidium bromide and Southern hybridization dot-blotting to detect the mtDNA fraction after the centrifugation. All methods concluded with RNase A digestion and Sephadex G-150 filtration. When the CsCl-ethidium bromide gradients containing mitochondria lysed with SDS were visualized under UV illumination (366 nm), two bands were observed, a heavy one, band a, and a lighter one, band b. As described below, band a contained covalently closed, circular mtDNA which had little contamination with nuclear DNA. Band b contained nuclear DNA and relaxed circular, linear, and complex forms of mtDNA. Band a had approximately 5-7% the amount of DNA of band b in the case of DNA prepared without DNase I treatment of the mitochondria. By treating the mitochondrial fraction with DNase I before the solubilization with SDS, however, most contaminating nuclear DNA in band b was removed and band b had only nicked or complex forms of mtDNA (see Fig. 2, lane 6 below). mtDNAs obtained by the three purification procedures schematized in Fig. 1 were subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and visualized simultaneously with ethidium bromide (Fig. 2, left) and by Southern hybridization with a 847-bp mtDNA probe (bp 11,778-12,625) (Fig. 2, right). Four bands of mitochondrial DNA are resolved: bands I, III, and II migrate to positions expected for closed circular, linear, and open circular unit length mitochondrial genomes (see also discussion of Fig. 3, below). In addition, a large amount complex mitochondrial DNA remains at the top of the gel which appears to be made up of multimers and possible replication and/or recombination intermediates (see below). Without DNase I treatment of intact mitochondria, large amounts of contaminating nuclear DNA are present (lanes 1, 4, and 7). This contamination could be removed by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl-EtBr (lane 3), but then Forms I and III DNA are lost (lane 3) and some mitochondrial DNA appears to band with the nuclear DNA in band b (lane 4). The loss of Forms I and III may have been due to the presence of EtBr during visualization, since Forms I and III were recovered if bands a and b were located by Southern hybridization (lanes 5 and 6). Since bands a and b both appeared to have mitochondrial DNA and since there appeared to be a risk of damage to DNA by ethidium bromide plus light, the safest procedure appeared to be to eliminate the EtBr from the CsCl gradients and to monitor the presence of the mtDNA with Southern blots (lane 8). Note that treatment of solubilized, DNase I-treated mitochondria with proteinase K and then phenol gave reasonable preparations of mitochondrial DNA (lane 2). This procedure might be practical when maximum yields of total mtDNA in all forms is desired and the problem of the potential for some oxidative damage due to contaminants in the phenol is not important. mtDNA obtained using DNase I treatment and dot-blot Southern hybridization after CsCl density gradients was analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion. The human mtDNA genome has one BamHI site, two PstI sites, three HindIII sites, and five XbaI sites as shown in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, when the mixture of all of mtDNA forms (I-III and complex, lane 1) is treated with BamHI, only a single, 16.6-kbp band is formed (lane 2), i.e. Forms I, II, and C have each been converted to unit length, linear Form III molecules. In a similar manner, PstI produced two fragments 14.5 and 2.0 kbp), HindIII produced three fragments (10.2, 5.5, and 0.89 kbp), and XbaI produced five fragments (7.5, 4.5, 2.0, 1.8, and 0.8 kbp) (Fig. 3B), and, as shown in Fig. 3C, the corresponding autoradiogram indicated only the presence of the single band which would be expected to hybridize to the probe made up of nucleotides 11,778-12,625 (see Fig. 3A). The lack of other apparent material in any of these digests (neither bands nor random sized pieces) shows that Form C consists largely of multimers, virtually complete, unresolved replication intermediates, or, conceivably, recombination intermediates. The mtDNA was also examined by electronmicroscopy. Fig. 4 shows a sample micrograph. The Form C molecule would be exactly 2 unit lengths if the length of the linear portion is doubled. Many such molecules have been observed with varying ratios of size of the circular compared to the linear portions, although the two circular portions on a given molecule are equal in size. These could be recombination intermediates or unresolved replication products which had collapsed into a four-stranded structure. The distributions of the four forms of mtDNA by observation in the electron microscope correspond well with the relative amounts of each mtDNA band on AGE of the same preparation (data not shown). The preparation procedure outlined above was applied to the study of damage to mtDNA after treatment of HeLa cells with hydrogen peroxide under various conditions. First, the fate of hydrogen peroxide added to the incubation medium (PBS) of HeLa cells was investigated (Fig. 5). After the addition of hydrogen peroxide to 3 mM to 6 × 106 HeLa cells/ml, the H2O2 concentration became undetectable within 5 min at 37°C. When the 3 mM H2O2 was replenished at 6 and at 15 min after the first addition, the concentration reduced similarly in each case (Fig. 5, open circles). If the medium were made 3 mM H2O2 at 0°C, however, the H2O2 reduction was slower than that at 37°C, becoming roughly 0.9 mM at 6 min and 20 μM 30 min after the addition (Fig. 5, closed circles). If H2O2 were replenished at 6 and 15 min (at 0°C), the total consumption was 8.6 mM. Hence there was no loss of efficiency in H2O2 degradation during the 30 min at 0°C. In parallel studies the effect of the exposure to H2O2 on viability was examined by monitoring colony-forming ability (Table 1). Cells treated with 3 mM H2O2 at 37°C lost colony-forming ability 15 min after treatment. However, if treated three times with 3 mM H2O2 at 0°C (at 0, 6, and 15 min) cells had about 40% survival (as judged by colony-forming ability) 30 min after the first addition of H2O2. Hence, loss of colony-forming ability is quite temperature-dependent: even though H2O2 is more rapidly removed at 37°C, toxicity is more apparent at that temperature.Table I Open table in a new tab In these experiments, colony-forming ability, the most quantitative method for determining killing, was utilized. However, 7 days are required to monitor colony formation. Microscopic examination of the cells shortly after the exposure to H2O2 and trypan blue exclusion observations suggested that many cells, though committed to die during the 7-day period and unable to divide, were not immediately killed. This behavior is similar to that observed with E. coli exposed to H2O2 at these doses. In that case, limited filamentous growth occurred following treatment, suggesting that the cells suffered high levels of DNA damage which ultimately resulted in their death (Imlay and Linn, 1987). mtDNAs were prepared by the procedure used for the sample of Fig. 3, lane 8, after treatment of HeLa cells with H2O2, and then analyzed by AGE (Fig. 6). Cells treated at 0°C exhibited no apparent mtDNA degradation by this technique. Likewise, cells treated once at 37°C showed no apparent mtDNA degradation, in spite of a severe loss of viability (Table 1). However, cells treated three times at 37°C showed severe degradation of the mtDNA. From these results we conclude that within the sensitivity of this assay, strand breaks do not occur with exposures to H2O2 that kill the cells (37°C, one exposure). Evidently, strand breaks occur only with multiple exposures, perhaps arising after cells have become unable to replicate. To investigate a base modification of mtDNA after treatment of HeLa cells with H2O2, 8-OH-dG was determined in the mtDNA, by enzymatic hydrolysis followed by HPLC and electrochemical detection. The 8-OH-dG/dG ratios in mtDNA from HeLa cells treated with H2O2 under various conditions are given in Table 2. The level of 8-OH-dG was quite low and was not increased significantly by exposure to H2O2, even when treated three times with 3 mM H2O2 at 37°C. Hence, even under conditions for which no viable cells remain (Table 1) and the DNA is extremely fragmented (Fig. 6), no significant increase in the dG analog was observed.Table II Open table in a new tab As an independent assessment of the disruption of mitochondria after treatment of whole cells with H2O2, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase activity was examined (Table 3). In all cases the cytochrome c oxidase activity was not significantly changed. Hence, the mitochondria seem to have been essentially biologically functional.Table III Open table in a new tab The effect on mtDNA of H2O2 treatment of isolated mitochondria at 37 and at 0°C was examined (Fig. 7). No observable fragmentation of the mtDNA was seen even under conditions for which treatment of whole cells gave DNA fragmentation. It appears that mtDNA is considerably more resistant to H2O2 treatment of isolated organelles than of whole cells. Finally, the effect on mtDNA integrity of exposing isolated mitochondria to H2O2 plus iron and/or NADH was examined (Fig. 8). DNA from mitochondria treated three times with 3 mM H2O2 in the presence of NADH and ferrous iron showed severe degradation at 37 and 0°C, with somewhat more at 37°C. Fe3+/NADH was less effective, while H2O2 alone did not induce damage as expected from the experiment in Fig. 8. Evidently, H2O2 treatment of mitochondria effectively degrades mtDNA damages only if exogenous iron and a reductant is provided. Several methods for the isolation and purification of mtDNA are in general use (Palva and Palva, 1985; Bogenhagen and Clayton, 1974; Myers et al., 1988). In order to maximize the yield of all forms of mtDNA and to minimize damage to the DNA during the process, we altered these procedures. Hypotonic buffer together with the D-mannitol as a scavenger of oxygen radicals were used with Dounce homogenization to open the cells. DNase I treatment of the intact mitochondria prior to their isolation by sucrose gradient centrifugation was used to remove all detectable contaminating nuclear DNA. Whereas phenol-chloroform extraction of crude solubilized mitochondria produced mtDNA which appeared similar by AGE to that obtained by CsCl equilibrium centrifugation without EtBr, it has been reported that phenol-chloroform extraction of DNA and UV irradiation increases the frequency of 8-OH-dG in DNA 20- and 60-fold, respectively (Claycamp, 1992; Fischer-Nielson et al., 1992). Therefore phenol-chloroform extraction and/or exposure to UV light would be unsuitable for the investigation of DNA base modification caused by oxidative stress. Likewise, dot-blot Southern hybridization was used to detect mtDNA after CsCl density gradient centrifugation in order to avoid mtDNA damage induced by the UV radiation necessary to detect the ethidium bromide•DNA complexes. Audic and Giacomoni (1993) have reported that UV irradiation introduces DNA nicking especially in the presence of iron and oxygen, and we find that EtBr also enhances this nicking. mtDNA prepared from HeLa cells by the method described in this paper contains four different forms. Proteinase K treatment of the mtDNA preparation did not change the relative distribution of among mtDNA of these forms, but restriction enzyme digestion converted each of them totally to unit length, linear molecules. Therefore, Forms I-III and C each appear to consist of such unit length molecules or integral multiples of such. In particular, there is no evidence that Form C is either bound to protein or aggregated due to an association with proteins. Radloff et al.(1967) observed complex mtDNA in HeLa cells during the first serious characterization of mtDNA structure. However, later characterization in Mouse L cells suggested that these forms contained intermediates in all stages of replication (Robberson et al., 1972), i.e. of different sizes. However, a preponderance of dimer molecules was noted in leukocytes from patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia, but not normal leukocytes (Radloff et al., 1967). It would be worthwhile, with the current availability of the Southern hybridization technique and restriction enzymes, to reinvestigate quantitatively and to compare the structures of these complex forms in normal blood, leukemic blood, and cultured cell lines in order to resolve these apparently conflicting observations. Hydrogen peroxide added to the medium of HeLa cells to 3 mM disappeared within 5 min at 37°C. At 0°C virtually all of the H2O2 was gone in 30 min. Temperature-dependent enzymes such as catalase in the peroxisome and GSH peroxidase in the cytoplasm and mitochondria are presumably responsible for this depletion. What was unexpected, however, was that even at doses of H2O2 which were lethal, DNA damage as measured by strand breaks or 8-OH-dG induction were minimal. Indeed, the levels of 8-OH-dG were considerably lower than those observed by Richter et al.(1988) to be present in rat liver mtDNA without exogenous oxidative stress. Possibly the damage was introduced to the rat liver mtDNA during its isolation, or possibly there is a good deal more 8-OH-dG in rat liver mtDNA, than in HeLa mtDNA. However, we would not expect that if a repair system for 8-OH-dG were operative (Tchou and Grollman, 1993), so many as several such residues/mitochondrial genome (Richter et al., 1988) would normally be present. Cytochrome c oxidase is present in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It has reported that cytochrome c oxidase activity dropped by more than 40% when exposed to 600 nmol of •OH/mg of inner mitochondrial membrane protein during γ-radiation (Zhang et al., 1990). In the case of exposure of HeLa cells to H2O2, the activity of cytochrome c oxidase was not changed significantly. This result suggests that oxidative stress by the exogenous H2O2 was not strong enough to damage cytochrome c oxidase even at lethal doses. mtDNA was not fragmented by the treatment of isolated mitochondria three times with 3 mM H2O2 at 37°C, indicating that some intracellular, extramitochondrial factor(s) are needed to induce mtDNA damage. While these factors are unknown, Fe2+ or Cu+ ions are required for Fenton-type reactions with H2O2. Indeed, H2O2 induced mtDNA fragmentation even at 0°C when Fe2+ or Fe3+ and NADH were also included. Apparently, a cellular environment for the mitochondria must be present for reduced transition metals to be available in the mitochondria. The increased damage at 37°C of mtDNA in whole cells could reflect a requirement for metabolism to generate this reduction, or it could mean that after H2O2 treatment, mitochondrial DNases (Beaufay et al., 1959; Linn 1994; Curtis and Smellie, 1966; Low et al., 1987) or topoisomerase (Lin and Castora, 1991) are disrupted from their controlled state and act to damage mtDNA. In conclusion, it would appear that damage to mtDNA is not a primary factor in cell toxicity by H2O2. However, these studies were done in cell culture with an immortal polyploid cell line, HeLa. They now should be repeated with whole animal tissues before extrapolations from cultured cell- to tissue mitochondria can be drawn. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1964718302,"In order to investigate the involvement of amino acids in the catalytic mechanism of the soluble epoxide hydrolase, different mutants of the murine enzyme were produced using the baculovirus expression system. Our results are consistent with the involvement of Asp-333 and His-523 in a catalytic mechanism similar to that of other α/β hydrolase fold enzymes. Mutation of His-263 to asparagine led to the loss of approximately half the specific activity compared to wild-type enzyme. When His-332 was replaced by asparagine, 96.7% of the specific activity was lost and mutation of the conserved His-523 to glutamine led to a more dramatic loss of 99.9% of the specific activity. No activity was detectable after the replacement of Asp-333 by serine. However, more than 20% of the wild-type activity was retained in an Asp-333 → Asn mutant produced in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. We purified, by affinity chromatography, the wild-type and the Asp-333 → Asn mutant enzymes produced in Trichoplusia ni cells. We labeled these enzymes by incubating them with the epoxide containing radiolabeled substrate juvenile hormone III (JH III). The purified Asp-333 → Asn mutant bound 6% of the substrate compared to the wild-type soluble epoxide hydrolase. The mutant also showed 8% of the specific activity of the wild-type. Preincubation of the purified Asp-333 → Asn mutant at 37°C (pH 8), however, led to a complete recovery of activity and to a change of isoelectric point (pI), both of which are consistent with hydrolysis of Asn-333 to aspartic acid. This intramolecular hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartic acid may explain the activity observed in this mutant. Wild-type enzyme that had been radiolabeled with the substrate was digested with trypsin. Using reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography, we isolated four radiolabeled peptides of similar polarity. These peptides were not radiolabeled if the enzyme was preincubated with a selective competitive inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase 4-fluorochalcone oxide. This strongly suggested that these peptides contained a catalytic amino acid. Each peptide was characterized with N-terminal amino acid sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry. All four radiolabeled peptides contained overlapping sequences. The only aspartic acid present in all four peptides and conserved in all epoxide hydrolases was Asp-333. These peptides resulted from cleavage at different trypsin sites and the mass of each was consistent with the covalent linkage of Asp-333 to the substrate.

INTRODUCTIONEpoxide hydrolases (EC 3.3.2.3) are enzymes that convert epoxides to diols via addition of water. They have been found in all mammalian species tested and found in most organs. Based on subcellular localization and substrate specificity, five distinct enzyme groups have been defined: 1) microsomal epoxide hydrolase, 2) soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), 1The abbreviations used are: sEHsoluble epoxide hydrolase4-FCO4-fluorochalcone oxideRP-HPLCreverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisJH IIIjuvenile hormone IIIBSAbovine serum albuminIEFisoelectric focusing. 3) cholesterol epoxide hydrolase, 4) leukotriene A4 epoxide hydrolase, and 5) hepoxilin epoxide hydrolase. In mammals the majority of research has focused on microsomal epoxide hydrolase and sEH. Induction of hepatic microsomal epoxide hydrolase in rats and mice by a variety of foreign compounds suggests an involvement in xenobiotic metabolism(1Oesch F.

The broad spectrum of substrates utilized by sEH also suggests a detoxifying function(8Wixtrom R.N. Hammock B.D. Zakim D. Vessey D.A. Biochemical Pharmacology and Toxicology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 1-93Google Scholar). sEH might also participate in the metabolism of endogenous substrates since sEH hydrolyzes epoxides of fatty acids more rapidly than many other substrates(9Halarnkar P.P. Wixtrom R.N. Silva M.H. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Halarnkar P.P. Nourooz-Zadeh J.T. Kuwano E. Jones A.D. Hammock B.D. Arch.

Hammock B.D. Belknap W.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and mouse-eared cress (Arabidobsis thaliana)(19Kiyosue T. Beetham J.K. Pinot F. Hammock B.D. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 1994; 6: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Knowledge of these sequences enabled authors to perform sequence homology analyses(20Lacourciere G.M. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 10466-10467Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Arand M. Grant D.F. Beetham J.K. Friedberg T. Oesch F. Hammock B.D.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). They noted that certain regions of the epoxide hydrolases showed significant sequence similarity to a bacterial haloalkane dehalogenase HLD1(23Janssen D.B. Pries F. van der Ploeg J. Kazemier B. Tersptra P. Withold B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6791-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HLD1 and by inference epoxide hydrolases belong to a group of enzymes known as the α/β hydrolase fold family(24Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). α/β hydrolase fold enzymes are hydrolytic enzymes; all have a catalytic triad consisting of a nucleophile, a histidine, and an acid. Until recently, the most accepted hypothesis concerning the mechanism of action of EH was a general base catalysis involving a histidine that was thought to form a hydroxyl anion by attracting a proton from a molecule of water. The anion would then attack the oxirane. Recently, catalytic amino acids of HLD1 have been identified by x-ray crystallography(25Verschueren K.H.G. Seljee F. Rozeboom H. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Catalysis by HLD1 proceeds by a two-step mechanism, where the substrate is covalently bound to the enzyme via an ester bond with Asp-124. The ester bond is then hydrolyzed by a molecule of water activated by the His-289-Asp-260 pair in the active site. It is noteworthy that the amino acids which form the catalytic triad are conserved in all sEH enzymes so far cloned(22Beetham J.K. Grant D.F. Arand M. Garbarino J.E. Kiyosue T. Pinot F. Oesch F. Belknap W.R. Shinozaki K. Hammock B.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore the hypothesis for a similar mechanism involving an ester intermediate in the mechanism of action of EH seems more likely than the general base catalysis hypothesis. This new hypothesis received additional support recently. Low turnover experiments with H218O provide evidence for this hypothesis with the microsomal epoxide hydrolase of rat liver (20Lacourciere G.M. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 10466-10467Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although trans-stilbene oxide is the most commonly used substrate with sEH, we recently chose the epoxide containing substrate juvenile hormone (JH III) in order to test the hypothesis of a two step mechanism involving an ester intermediate in the catalysis by sEH(26Hammock B.D. Pinot F. Beetham J.K. Grant D.F. Arand M.E. Oesch F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Its characteristics increased our chance to demonstrate the presence of an ester intermediate during catalysis. This substrate has a high affinity for sEH(27Mumby S.M. Hammock B.D. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 11: 275-284Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar); moreover, like other trisubstituted epoxides, it is turned over more slowly than di- and monosubstituted epoxides(27Mumby S.M. Hammock B.D. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 11: 275-284Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After a brief incubation of radiolabeled JH III with murine sEH, we isolated a covalently bound substrate enzyme intermediate. Chemical analysis of this complex revealed that it was an α-hydroxyacyl enzyme (Fig. 1). We also showed that the binding of the substrate to the enzyme was inhibited by a selective competitive inhibitor of sEH, 4-fluorochalcone oxide.The goal of the work described in this paper was to study the mechanism of action of sEH. With knowledge of the amino acids involved in the catalytic mechanism of HLD1, we used site-directed mutagenesis to evaluate the catalytic importance of different amino acids of recombinant murine sEH. Wild-type sEH was radiolabeled with a substrate (JH III) and digested with trypsin, allowing us to isolate radiolabeled peptides from this protein. These peptides are thought to correspond to the hydroxyacyl intermediate. Determination of their partial sequence and molecular mass allowed us to position these peptides within the protein sequence and thus identify a putative catalytic nucleophile in the protein.MATERIALS AND METHODSCompoundsJuvenile hormone III (JH III) (481 GBq/mmol) was purchased from DuPont. Non radiolabeled juvenile hormone III was purchased from Sigma. The selective competitive sEH inhibitor 4-fluorochalcone oxide (4-FCO) was prepared as described previously (28Mullin C.A. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Enzyme Preparation and Activity MeasurementAn expression system composed of baculoviruses and cells from Trichoplusia ni (Tn5B1-4) or Spodoptera frugiperda (SF21) previously described for the production of human sEH(17Beetham J.K. Tian T. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), was used in order to produce the murine enzyme(16Grant D.F. Storms D.H. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17628-17633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expressed murine sEH was purified from cell lysate by affinity chromatography(29Wixtrom R.N. Silva M.H. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Construction of the MutantsSequence numbers are based on the sEH sequence (GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank accession number L05781 (1994)). Mutants of murine sEH were prepared using sEH in the transfer plasmid pAcUW21 according to the method of Kunkel(30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar). The following mutants and oligonucleotides were used: (His-237 → Asn)-5′-ATGACGTCAGCAATGGATATGTGAC-3′; (His-263 → Asn)-5′-CTATGCCTTTGCAATGGGTTTCCTG-3′; (His-332 → Asn)-5′-GTGTTCATTGGCAATGACTGGGCTG-3′; (Asp-333 → Asn)-5′CAGTGTTCATTGGTCATAACTGGGCTGGTG-3′; (Asp-333 → Ser)-5′CAGTGTTCATTGGTCATAGCTGGGCTGGTGTG-3′; (His-523 → Gln)-5′-CATTGAAGACTGCGGCCAGTGGACACAGAT-3′.Underlined residues have been modified to generate the corresponding mutations and to add or delete restriction sites in order to select for mutants by restriction digest. Restriction site changes were designed to give the same amino acid in the mutant protein as is found in the wild-type protein. All mutants were confirmed by restriction digest and dideoxy sequencing across the mutation site.Measurement of Specific ActivitySpecific activity of the purified enzymes was measured using 3H-labeled trans-stilbene oxide as described previously(8Wixtrom R.N. Hammock B.D. Zakim D. Vessey D.A. Biochemical Pharmacology and Toxicology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 1-93Google Scholar). The same assay protocol was followed using baculovirus-infected whole SF21 cells in order to compare the specific activity of the unpurified wild-type and mutant enzymes. The assays were generally run for 10 min but were extended to 1 h for the Asp-333 → Ser and the His-523 → Gln mutants. Total protein concentrations for all assays were made constant by the addition of baculovirus-infected cells expressing a control (LacZ) protein. Protein concentrations were determined with BCA reagent from Pierce using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (31Laemmi U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) using 4% stacking and 10% resolving gels. Immunoblotting was performed according to Burnette (32Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar) using 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot cell. After overnight transfer (35 V, room temperature), blots were blocked by shaking for 15 min in 1% BSA, then twice for 15 min each in blotting buffer (10 mM KH2PO4, 14 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.25% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Primary antiserum to sEH diluted 5000-fold was incubated with the blot for 2 h with shaking at room temperature. Bound IgG was detected as described by Blake et al.(33Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar), using alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 in blotting buffer, Fisher).Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed in an LKB Multiphor electrophoresis apparatus with precast polyacrylamide gels (Ampholine PAGplate, pH 4.0-6.5; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Gels were cooled to 3°C and focused for 1 h prior to loading. Aliquots of 15 μg of purified protein were loaded in each lane. Focusing was carried out at pH 4.0-6.5 at 2000 V, 25 watts, 25 mA for 2.5 h. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and pH gradients were calibrated using IEF marker samples (Pharmacia). In some cases the gel lanes were sliced into 1-mm sections and incubated overnight in 200 μl of sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4), and the supernatant assayed for epoxide hydrolase activity.Labeling of the EnzymeA 10−2M ethanolic solution of the substrate juvenile hormone III (C10 3H JH III) with a specific radioactivity of 33 × 10−2 Bq/pmol was prepared by diluting labeled with unlabeled juvenile hormone III. One μl of this solution was added with a Hamilton repeating dispenser to 100 μl of sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4) containing either 10 μg of sEH (160 pmol) or bovine serum albumin in a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube on ice. The incubation solution was mixed using a Vortex mixer for 3 s at room temperature and the reaction was stopped by precipitating the protein with addition of 11 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid solution. The precipitated protein was then pelleted by centrifuging the microcentrifuge tube (4 min at 16,000 × g) at 4°C. The pellet was washed twice with 100 μl of cold acetone, resuspended in 100 μl of double distilled water containing 1% acetic acid, and then reprecipitated and washed as described above. After the final wash the pellet was dissolved in 5% (w/v) SDS (50 μl), and 1.4 ml of scintillation liquid was added to measure the radioactivity incorporated into the protein, all counts were corrected for differential quenching with a Wallac 1409 Liquid Scintillation Counter. To measure the effect of the selective competitive inhibitor 4-FCO on the labeling by juvenile hormone III, the same procedure was performed after preincubating the enzyme with 100 μM 4-FCO on ice for 5 min.Tryptic DigestThe enzyme (100 μg) was labeled and precipitated as described above. Then, 25 μl of 8 M urea, 500 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added to the dry protein in the polypropylene microcentrifuge tube which remained at room temperature for 10 min. Following addition of 45 mM dithiothreitol (5 μl) and vortexing, the mixture was incubated at 50°C for 15 min. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 60 μl of distilled water and 5 μg of trypsin (in 5 μl of water) were added. After vortexing, digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C and was stopped by freezing or by injecting directly onto a RP-HPLC column. Increasing the time of digestion or the amount of trypsin did not increase the yield of the digest or change the size or relative patterns of the HPLC profile.Purification of the Radiolabeled PeptidesA tryptic digest of the radiolabeled enzyme was subjected to RP-HPLC analysis. A Perkin-Elmer Diode-Array system was used with a Vydac C4 (4.6×250 mm, 5 μm) column. Fragments were eluted with a gradient as follows: 100% A from 0 to 2 min, increased to 75% B in 110 min, then to 100% B in 3 min, followed by 15 min at 100% B (A and B were H2O/trifluoroacetic acid (99.94:0.06, v/v) and H2O/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (19.95:80: 0.05; v/v/v), respectively). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Peptides were monitored by following the UV absorbance at 215 nm and 280 nm. A Gilson model 203 fraction collector was used to collect 500-μl fractions, 150 μl of each fraction was transferred to a scintillation vial, and all counts were corrected for differential quenching with a Wallac model 1409 liquid scintillation counter.Radiolabeled peptides were collected and pooled from eight tryptic digests (800 μg total) in order to determine their amino acid sequence and molecular mass. The pooled fractions containing each peptide were concentrated with a Savant Speed-Vac concentrator prior to analysis. Automated Edman degradation with precolumn PTH derivatization was used for peptide sequencing. An Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequenator (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) coupled to an Applied Biosystems model 120A PTH analyzer and M900 data system was employed. Prior to each separate sequence analysis, the chromatographic system was calibrated with PTH-derivative standards.Mass SpectrometryElectrospray mass spectra of peptides were generated using a VG/Fisons Quattro-BQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Biotech, Altricham, United Kingdom) using acetonitrile/H2O (50:50, v/v) as the mobile phase. An Isco 500-μl syringe pump delivered the mobile phase at 5 μl/min. Solutions of purified peptides were analyzed by direct flow injection using an injection volume of 10 μl. Spectra were obtained in positive ion mode using a capillary voltage of +3.5 kV, a cone voltage of 50 V and a source temperature of 65°C. Spectra were scanned over the range of 200-2000 Da/e at a rate of 20 s/scan from 20 scans were combined using the VG MGA acquisition mode. Molecular mass were determined by using the maximum entropy deconvolution algorithm (MaxEnt™) to transform the range of 500-1500 Da/e to give a true mass scale spectrum. Mixed polyethylene glycols were used for mass calibration.RESULTSExpression and Activity of the Different MutantsIn order to test the hypothesis of a sEH catalysis similar to the HLD1 catalysis where a His-Asp pair has been shown to be involved, we made different mutants of the enzyme. Mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, and proteins were produced using baculovirus and SF21 cells as an expression system. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of wild-type and mutant sEHs demonstrated equivalent expression of all enzymes and retention of immunoreactivity despite the mutations (Fig. 2). We measured sEH activity of the mutants and compared these activities to that of the wild-type enzyme. To minimize any effects which the mutations may have had on protein stability during cell lysis and purification, enzyme activity was measured in whole cells 4 days after infection. This time of harvest yielded the maximum expression of sEH. The same trends of catalytic activity were observed with lysed cells. As shown in Table 1, each mutation had different effects. While mutation of the His-237 to an asparagine did not alter the activity of the enzyme, the same mutation at His-263 led to a loss of approximately half the activity compared to wild-type. When His-332 was replaced by an asparagine, 3.3% of the activity was retained, and after conversion of the conserved His-523 to glutamine only 0.1% of the activity remained. No activity was detectable after the replacement of Asp-333 with a serine. However, if this amino acid was changed to an asparagine more than 20% of the activity was retained.Figure 2:Expression of wild-type and mutant sEH in baculovirus-infected SF21 cells. For SDS-PAGE (A), all lanes contain 20 μg of cellular protein, and for Western blot (B), all lanes contain 50 ng of protein. sEH is affinity-purified murine sEH (lane1).

Seljee F. Rozeboom H. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our previous results showed that JH III binds covalently to the wild-type enzyme(26Hammock B.D. Pinot F. Beetham J.K. Grant D.F. Arand M.E. Oesch F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We investigated the possible role of Asp-333 in the formation of such an intermediate. The Asp-333 → Asn and the wild-type sEHs were purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography from our expression system using Tn5B1-4 cells instead of SF21 because of higher expression levels. We compared the abilities of these two enzymes to bind the substrate JH III. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also incubated with radiolabeled JH III as a control. As shown in Fig. 3, both sEH proteins were radiolabeled. However, after correcting for the radioactivity in the BSA pellet due to nonspecific binding, we found that the amount of JH III bound to the Asp-333 → Asn mutant was only 6% of the JH III that bound to the wild-type sEH. We also compared the specific activity of these two enzymes, the mutant having only 8% of the specific activity of the wild-type: 186 ± 33 and 2300 ± 160 nmol/min/mg for mutant and wild-type, respectively. These results suggest that the specific activity of the enzyme correlates with its ability to covalently bind the substrate.Figure 3:Labeling of wild-type and Asp-333 → Asn mutant sEHs by the radiolabeled substrate JH III. The proteins (10 μg) were incubated with the radiolabeled JH III. After 3 s of incubation, the protein was precipitated. The pellets were washed, dissolved in 5% SDS (w/v), and transferred to counting vials in order to monitor radioactivity bound to the protein. The same protocol was followed using BSA as a control. Each value is the mean of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. Assuming one catalytic site per monomeric subunit (62,527 Da), this procedure resulted in the complete labeling of the protein molecules by substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Asp-333 → Ser mutant had no activity, whereas the Asp-333 → Asn mutant had 8% or up to 20% wild-type activity when produced in Tn5B1-4 or in SF-21 cells, respectively. A possible explanation for this observation is that the Asn-333 in the mutant is being intramolecularly hydrolyzed back to the Asp-333 by activated H2O. To test this latter hypothesis, we incubated the wild-type and the Asp-333 → Asn mutant proteins at 37°C at pH 8. After different times of preincubation, their specific activities were measured. The mutant recovered activity as a function of preincubation time (Fig. 4); after 48 h, the recovery of activity was complete compared to the wild-type. In addition to recovering catalytic activity, the mutant was able to covalently bind JH III at the same level as the wild-type (not shown). Furthermore, analytical IEF demonstrated that the pI of the mutant was altered from a major band at 5.48 and a minor band at 5.44 before preincubation to a major 5.44 band after preincubation, which is the pI that was determined for the wild-type. IEF gels were also cut into slices, proteins were eluted by incubation overnight in buffer and the supernatant assayed for activity. Before preincubation of the Asp-333 → Asn mutant, the major 5.48 band had no catalytic activity, while the 5.44 band was catalytically active. After preincubation the 5.44 band had catalytic activity indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme.Figure 4:Effect of preincubating the wild-type and the Asp-333 → Asn mutant sEHs on the specific activity.

Xanthine-oxidizing enzymes are inactivated by cyanide in a reaction that removes an essential sulfur atom from the molybdenum to give the nonfunctional desulfo-form of the enzyme(10Massey V. Edmondson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Desulfoxanthine oxidase occurs naturally and is present in all standard preparations but can be removed by affinity chromatography(11Nishino T. Nishino T. Tushima K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Nishino T. Tsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11242-11246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for the existence of the desulfo-form was provided by Massey et al. (13) with the study of the interaction of the enzyme and the inhibitor, allopurinol. The sulfur atom necessary for catalytic activity has been shown by x-ray absorption spectroscopy to be present as a Mo=S group(14Bordas J. Bray R.C. Garner C.D. Gutteridge S. Hasnain S.S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Cramer S.P. Wahl R. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 7721-7727Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Cramer S.P.

Bray R.C. Diakun G.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Mo=O and Mo=S groups dominate the coordination sphere in oxidized enzyme, with the remainder of the ligand positions occupied by thiolate or thioether. On reduction, the Mo=S group becomes protonated to form Mo-SH and is considered to be the group that accepts the C-8 proton from xanthine in the course of its conversion to uric acid(18Turner N.A. Bray R.C. Diakun G.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of the substrate with the molybdenum center and the chemical steps involved in its conversion to product are poorly understood(9Hille R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 143-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The interaction of xanthine oxidase with an inhibitor is of interest not only from the aspect of the mechanism of enzyme reaction, but also from the medical aspects. First, as the enzyme is involved in the final steps of uric acid production, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase is useful for remedy of hyperuricemia or gout(19Elion G.B. Callahan S. Nathan H. Bieber S. Rundles R.W. Hitching G.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1963; 12: 85-93Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Second, as the O2-dependent type of the enzyme produces hydrogen peroxide and superoxide (O2−), the conversion from the NAD-dependent type to the O2-dependent type is hypothetically proposed to be responsible for causing post-ischemic reperfusion injury(20McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4941) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is valuable to examine whether prior treatment of tissue with an inhibitor is effective in attenuating post-ischemic tissue injury. Allopurinol, a pyrazolopyrimidine derivative, is a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase and has been used for effective remedy for hyperuricemia or gout. It has been reported that treatment of tissue with allopurinol is effective in attenuating ischemic tissue injury(21Shlafer M. Kane P.F. Wiggins V.W. Kirsh M.M. Circulation. 1982; 66: 186-192Google Scholar, 22Roy R.S. McCord J.M. Greenwald R.A. Cohen G. Oxy Radicals and Their Scavenger System. Vol. 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam1983: 145-153Google Scholar, 23Parks D.A. Granger D.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: G285-G289PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of inhibition of xanthine oxidase by allopurinol was studied in detail, indicating that oxipurinol, a product from allopurinol by xanthine oxidase, bound stoichiometrically to the reduced molybdenum (IV)(13Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the inhibitor binds very tightly to the enzyme, the inhibition is time dependent(13Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Spector T. Johns D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5079-5085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, therefore, it takes some time to inhibit the enzyme completely. Furthermore, it is necessary to maintain an effective concentration of the inhibitor to the organ because the inhibitor dissociates from the enzyme by spontaneous oxidation of molybdenum to Mo(VI), with a half-life of 300 min at 25°C, with concomitant recovery of enzyme activity(13Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the experiments of post-ischemic reperfusion injury, the maintenance of an effective concentration of the inhibitor makes it difficult to discriminate whether the inhibitor is effective due to the inhibition of xanthine oxidase or due to the scavenging of O2− because allopurinol has been reported to be a direct scavenger of superoxide anion(25Moorhouse P.C. Grootveld M. Halliwell B. Quinlan J.G. Gutteridge J.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of the enzyme in reperfusion injury is still controversial. Many other inhibitors of xanthine oxidase have been reported since allopurinol has been introduced(26Hille R. Massey V. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1981; 14: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, none of them except allopurinol has been used for remedy of hyperuricemia or for experimental studies, probably because of less effectiveness than allopurinol or because of possible side effects of the inhibitor on animals or humans. Recently, a new potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase has been introduced and found to be an effective inhibitor even in vivo. Its inhibitory effects on liver xanthine oxidase in vivo have been found to last longer than allopurinol (27Sato S. Tatsumi K. Nishino T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 309A: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of inhibition and the strength of binding of the inhibitor have not been reported. Here, we report the inhibitory effects of this compound on xanthine oxidase in vitro and the mechanism of inhibition of this compound. Milk XO was purified by the methods of Ball(28Ball E.G. J. Biol.

The prepared enzyme was more than 90% active, i.e. it exhibited an activity to flavin ratio (AFR) of more than 190 (fully active enzyme has a value of 210)(10Massey V. Edmondson D. J. Biol.

Before use, xanthine dehydrogenase was previously incubated with 10 mM dithiothreitol and was passed through Sephadex G-25 to remove dithiothreitol. The dehydrogenase/oxidase activity ratio of xanthine dehydrogenase as defined by Waud and Rajagopalan (6Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem.

Sodium-8-(3-methoxy-4-phenylsulfinylphenyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]-1,3,5-triazine-4-olate monohydrate (BOF-4272) was a generous gift from the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory Inc. (Naruto, Japan). This material contained isomers as shown in Fig. 1. The method of synthesis of BOF-4272 and the chemical nature will be described elsewhere. 2K. Hashimoto and M. Kido, personal communication. The isomers were separated by HPLC using a Chiralcel OD column (Daisel Chemical Co., Tokyo) and a solution of hexane, ethanol, and formate (700:300:4) as a solvent. In this chromatography, the(-)-isomer was eluted at an earlier retention time than the other (+)-isomer, which was confirmed with the authentic synthesized non-racemic compounds, which were provided by the Ohtsuka Pharmaceutical Factory Inc. The separated compounds were used for experiments. The concentration of BOF-4272 was checked by determination of the absorbance at 320 nm using the molar absorption coefficient of 23,500. Absorption spectra were recorded with an Hitachi U-3200 spectrophotometer. Fluorescent spectra were recorded with an Hitachi 650-60 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Stopped-flow experiments were performed with an Applied Photophysics apparatus. All activity measurements were performed at 25°C. For kinetic analysis, xanthine-oxygen reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the absorbance at 295 nm in 0.1 M pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.2 mM EDTA and various concentrations of xanthine and inhibitor under air-saturated conditions. Kinetics with different concentrations of xanthine in the phenazine methosulfate-linked reduction of cytochrome c were performed by following the absorbance change at 550 nm in 0.1 M pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 μM phenazine methosulfate (Wako, Osaka), 16.7 μM cytochrome c (horse heart, Boehringer Mannheim), 3.5 nM milk xanthine oxidase, and various concentrations of xanthine and BOF-4272. Before use, the phenazine methosulfate solution was kept on ice and in the dark. Activities with 0.15 mM xanthine as an electron donor and various artificial substrates as electron acceptors were determined spectrophotometrically by following the reduction of the substrate as follows: NAD (0.5 mM) at 340 nm, methylene blue (0.02 mM) at 665 nm, potassium ferricyanide (0.4 mM) at 420 nm, DCPIP (0.05 mM) at 600 nm, or cytochrome c (0.025 mM) at 550 nm. All these reactions were performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) under aerobic conditions except for methylene blue. Reaction with methylene blue was performed under anaerobic conditions. Activities were also measured in the presence of 0.05 mM NADH as an electron donor under the same conditions. As BOF-4272 has a strong fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 412 nm), which is greatly decreased on formation of the enzyme-BOF-4272 complex, it can be used for titration with the enzyme. The dissociation constant, Kd value, was calculated for mixtures of BOF-4272 and XO near equivalency according to Equation 1, Kd=[I][E]/[EI](Eq. 1) where [EI], [E], and [I] represent the concentrations of the enzyme-BOF-4272 complex, free enzyme, and free BOF-4272, respectively. Fluorescence intensity (Fluor) is due to both EI and I and is given by the equation Fluor=kEI[EI]+kI[I](Eq. 2) and by the equation for concentration of BOF-4272, [I]O=[EI]+[I](Eq. 3) where kEI and kI represent the fluorescence intensity coefficient due to EI and I, respectively, and [I]O represents the concentration of BOF-4272 added to the mixtures. Rearrangement of and brings about Equation 4: [EI]=(Fluor-kI[I]O)/(kEI-kI)(Eq. 4) The value of kEI was obtained from the initial slope of titration curves at lower concentrations of inhibitor in the presence of XO and kI from the slope of the plot of Fluorversus BOF-4272 in the absence of enzyme. [EI]x, i.e. at any concentration of added BOF-4272, was calculated by measuring fluorescence, [I]free and [E]free were obtained by differences, and Kd was calculated by substitution into the standard (). After 10 μM active XO (AFR = 193) or inactive desulfo-enzyme (AFR = 0) was incubated with 25 μM racemic compound of BOF-4272 in 0.1 M pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.5) for 30 min at room temperature, the solution was passed through an Ampure SA column (Amersham Corp.) equilibrated with 5 mM pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.5) to remove excess BOF-4272. The eluted enzyme-BOF-4272 complex was heated at 100°C for 3 min followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. 200 μl of the supernatant solution was subjected to HPLC (Hitachi 655-A) equipped with an LC-18-T column (Spelco). The sample was eluted with a gradient mixture of buffer A (10 mM NH4H2PO4, pH 3.0) and buffer mixture B (80% 10 mM NH4H2PO4, pH 3.0, and 20% acetonitrile). The fraction containing BOF-4272 was then passed through SEP-PAC C-18 (Millipore) to exchange the buffer to acetonitrile and was further subjected to HPLC using a Chiralcel OD column to separate the isomers. The inhibitory effect of allopurinol on XO is known to be time dependent; the activity decreases gradually after mixing the enzyme with allopurinol. Such time-dependent inhibition is due to tight binding of oxipurinol, the oxidized product of allopurinol by reaction with XO, to the reduced form of molybdenum in the enzyme(13Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to allopurinol, BOF-4272 did not show such time-dependent inhibition; the activity did not change during the incubation time, as shown in Fig. 2. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of BOF-4272 on the activity of xanthine oxidase, steady state kinetic analyses were performed with various concentrations of xanthine and the inhibitor under air-saturated conditions. As there are isomers of BOF-4272, the experiments were performed with both compounds after separation of the isomers by HPLC using a Chiralcel OD column, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results show that both of the isomers of BOF-4272 are mixed type inhibitors. A representative kinetic pattern obtained with(-)-isomer is shown in Fig. 3. A plot of slopes from the primary plot versus inhibitor concentration indicates a Ki value of 1.2 × 10−9M for the(-)-isomer, while a plot of the apparent 1/Vmaxversus the inhibitor concentration indicates a Ki′ value of 9 × 10−9M for the same isomer. A similar pattern was obtained with (+)-isomer (not shown), but 2 orders of magnitude higher values were obtained with this isomer, i.e. Ki = 3 × 10−7M and Ki′ = 9 × 10−6M. On the other hand, steady state analysis with xanthine and phenazine methosulfate as substrates showed that the inhibition with(-)-isomer was a competitive type with a Ki value of 2 × 10−9M (Fig. 4). As xanthine oxidase acts via a ping-pong mechanism, alternating between oxidized and reduced forms(30Massey V. Brumby P.E. Komai H. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1682-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Olson J.S. Ballou D. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4350-4362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a plausible explanation for the mixed type inhibition with oxygen as a substrate and the competitive type inhibition with phenazine methosulfate is that BOF-4272 binds both the oxidized and reduced forms but binds more tightly to the oxidized form. The competitive inhibition with phenazine methosulfate as a substrate might be due to the fact that the inhibitor does not bind to Mo(IV) because phenazine methosulfate reoxidizes Mo(IV) very rapidly, resulting in negligible formation of Mo(IV) during steady state turnover as in the case of allopurinol(13Massey V.

(13) that upon binding of pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives to the Mo(IV) of xanthine oxidase, the spectra of the inhibited enzyme changes significantly from that of native enzyme. However, no spectral changes were observed mixing either the oxidized or reduced form of the enzyme with BOF-4272 (data not shown), suggesting no direct interaction of the inhibitor with the molybdenum sphere, in contrast to the results with pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives. The effects of BOF-4272 on various artificial substrates were studied (Table 1). When xanthine was used as an electron donor, the reactions were effectively inhibited with BOF-4272 regardless of the electron acceptor used. These are consistent with the conclusion described below, that BOF-4272 binds in close proximity to the molybdenum site and therefore prevents the binding of or reduction with xanthine. No apparent difference was observed between XO and xanthine dehydrogenase. On the other hand, the activities of xanthine dehydrogenase using NADH as electron donor, which were inhibited with BOF-4272, depended on the electron acceptor used. NADH-methylene blue activity was not at all inhibited, while NADH-DCPIP and NADH-cytochrome c activities were partially inhibited. As it was found from the stopped-flow experiments that BOF-4272 did not affect the reduction of xanthine dehydrogenase by NADH, the partial inhibition of the activity observed when using DCPIP or cytochrome c as an electron acceptor might be due to the interaction site of these electron acceptors being the same in part as the BOF-4272 binding site. The interaction sites of these electron acceptors to the enzyme could be the molybdenum or other redox centers.Table I Open table in a new tab To know the effect of BOF-4272 on the reduction of the enzyme with xanthine or NADH, xanthine dehydrogenase (AFR = 120) was mixed with xanthine or NADH under anaerobic conditions in the presence of an excess amount of BOF-4272, and the absorbance change was followed at 450 nm with a stopped-flow apparatus. The traces of reduction with these substrates are shown in Fig. 5. Reduction of xanthine dehydrogenase with xanthine was effectively blocked by BOF-4272, while no effect on the reduction of the enzyme was observed with NADH as substrate. The rates of absorbance change at 450 nm with various concentrations of NADH were not affected by the presence of BOF-4272 (data not shown), indicating that the inhibitor does not bind to the NADH binding site. These are consistent with the conclusion that BOF-4272 interacts with the xanthine binding site of the enzyme. As BOF-4272 has a strong fluorescence with a peak at 412 nm when excited at 320 nm and the fluorescence is quenched by binding to the enzyme, fluorescence intensity can be used for measuring the strength of interaction of BOF-4272 with XO. Almost fully active enzyme (AFR = 200) and KCN-treated desulfo-type of XO (AFR = 3) were titrated with various concentrations of BOF-4272(-)-isomer. The patterns of the titration of(-)-isomer with active XO and desulfo-type enzyme are shown in Fig. 6, A and B, respectively. As the fluorescence increased just after an equimolar amount of BOF-4272 with the enzyme, the binding of BOF-4272 and xanthine oxidase has a stoichiometry of 1:1. The Kd values of the active and desulfo-forms of XO for BOF-4272(-)-isomer were calculated to be 2 ± 0.3 × 10−9M and 7 ± 5 × 10−9M, respectively, from each plot. The value with the active enzyme is in reasonable agreement with the Ki values estimated from the steady state kinetic studies. Fig. 6C shows the binding titration of oxipurinol-bound XO with(-)-isomer. The fluorescence increased almost linearly with the concentration of BOF-4272, indicating essentially no binding of BOF-4272 to the oxipurinol-bound XO. This clearly shows that oxipurinol and BOF-4272 binding sites are the same or strongly overlapping, and oxipurinol blocks the binding of BOF-4272 to the enzyme. Minor binding of BOF-4272 to the oxipurinol-treated enzyme might be due to the presence of a minor amount of the desulfo-form, which still existed in the sample having an AFR 200 value. It is known that the desulfo-form of XO cannot be reduced with allopurinol, and therefore it could not be an oxipurinol-bound form(13Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the result of steady state analysis that the(-)-isomer binds to the enzyme more tightly than the (+)-isomer and to know whether BOF-4272 is oxidized by XO, analysis of the compound was performed by HPLC after liberation from the enzyme-BOF-4272 complex, obtained by previous equilibration of XO with excess of the racemic compound, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The amount of BOF-4272 liberated from the complex was determined by HPLC using an LC-18-T column to be 0.75 and 0.65 per mol of active form and desulfo-form of enzyme, respectively. These results are consistent with the finding that BOF-4272 binds more tightly to the active form of the enzyme. The fractions that contained BOF-4272 were collected and were analyzed by HPLC using a Chiralcel OD column as described under “Materials and Methods.” Both samples, which were obtained either from an active or desulfo-enzyme-inhibitor complex, had a large peak of(-)-isomer and a negligible peak of (+)-isomer, as shown in Fig. 7. These results agree well with the previous conclusion from the steady state analysis that the(-)-isomer has a Ki value 2 orders of magnitude lower than the (+)-isomer. It can also be concluded that this compound was not oxidized by XO because the BOF-4272 compounds liberated from the complexes were eluted in both HPLCs at the same retention time as authentic BOF-4272 compounds. Furthermore, no difference of absorption spectrum was observed between the samples eluted from enzyme complexes and the authentic compounds. This conclusion is consistent with the result that no reduction of XO was observed spectrophotometrically under anaerobic conditions. The results presented here show that BOF-4272 is a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. All the data are consistent with the conclusion that BOF-4272 binds to the xanthine binding site, not to the NADH binding site. As xanthine or oxipurinol interacts with the molybdenum, it was strongly suggested that the inhibitor binds in close proximity to the molybdenum. However, due to the lack of spectral change upon incubation of BOF-4272 with either the reduced or oxidized form of enzyme and due to the fact that BOF-4272 binds tightly to both active and desulfo-forms of enzyme, it is likely that no atoms of BOF-4272 are in the coordination sphere of the molybdenum. Rather, steric factors between the inhibitor and the enzyme protein around the molybdenum seem to be important for tight binding. As the enzyme has been recently crystallized and the x-ray analysis of the crystal is now in progress (33Eger B.T. Eikmanns U. Pai E.F. Sato M. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1994: 727-729Google Scholar), it will also be interesting to crystallize the enzyme-inhibitor complex for analysis of the interaction between the inhibitor and the molybdenum site. As BOF-4272 binds tightly to both oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme, it can be expected to inhibit the enzyme for longer periods than allopurinol in vivo, since the oxipurinol-inhibited enzyme can be reactivated by spontaneous reoxidation of the Mo(IV) to the Mo(VI) state. Actual in vivo studies showed that BOF-4272 inhibited rat liver xanthine dehydrogenase very effectively for a longer period than allopurinol(27Sato S. Tatsumi K. Nishino T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 309A: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The advantages of using this compound for experimental studies are that the inhibitory effect of the compound is not time dependent, and it can be used at relatively low concentrations because of its strong inhibitory effects on xanthine dehydrogenase or XO. In addition, the compound is not a strong scavenger of superoxide radicals. 3S. Sato, personal communication. Furthermore, since this compound has a (+)-isomer, which is a much weaker inhibitor than the other(-), it may be used as a valuable control reagent for study of the role of xanthine-oxidizing enzymes in pathogenesis. Such usage of these compounds for experimental studies was recently reported(34Suzuki H. Suematsu M. Ishii H. Kato S. Miki H. Mori M. Ishimura Y. Nishino T. Tsuchiya M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Vincent Massey at the University of Michigan for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."

Several forms of CPE have been previously detected in neuroendocrine cells, including a form which is soluble at pH 5.5 (S-CPE), a form which can be extracted from membranes with 1 M NaCl at pH 5.5 (M1-CPE), and a form which requires both 1% Triton X-100 and 1 M NaCl for extraction from membranes at pH 5.5 (M2-CPE).

One mechanism that has been proposed to be important for sorting of regulated pathway proteins is Ca2+ and pH-induced aggregation. CPE purified from bovine pituitary membranes aggregates at pH 5.5 when the concentration of CPE is 0.3 μg/μl or higher, but not when the concentration is 0.01 μg/μl. Aggregation of CPE is pH-dependent, with very little aggregation occurring at pH 6 or above. At pH 5.0-5.5, the M2 form of CPE shows a greater tendency to aggregate than the other two forms. At pH 6, Ca2+ concentrations from 1-30 mM increase the aggregation of M1- and M2-CPE, but not S-CPE. The aggregation of M2-CPE does not explain the apparent membrane binding of this protein since the aggregate is solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 at pH 5.5 or by pH 6.0, whereas M2-CPE is not extracted from membranes under these conditions. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model in which the decreasing pH and increasing Ca2+ levels in the trans Golgi network induce the aggregation of CPE, which contributes to the sorting of this protein into regulated pathway secretory vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W1986370112,"Phagocytic cytochrome b558 is a unique heme-containing enzyme, which catalyzes one electron reduction of molecular oxygen to produce a superoxide anion with a six-coordinated heme iron. To clarify the mechanism of the superoxide production, we have analyzed oxidation-reduction kinetics of cytochrome b558 purified from porcine neutrophils by stopped-flow and rapid-scanning spectroscopy. Reduced cytochrome b558 was rapidly reoxidized by O2 showing spectral changes with clear isosbestic points, which were also observed during the reduction of ferric cytochrome b558 with Na2S2O4 under anaerobic conditions. The single turnover rate for the reaction with O2 linearly depended on the O2 concentration but was not affected by addition of CO. The rate of the reaction decreased with an increase of pH giving a pKα of 9.7. Under complete anaerobic conditions, ferrous cytochrome b558 was oxidized by ferricyanide at a rate faster than by O2. The thermodynamic analysis shows that the enthalpic energy barriers for the reactions of cytochrome b558 are significantly lower when compared to the autoxidation of native and modified myoglobins through the formation of the iron-O2 complex. These findings are most consistent with the electron transfer from the heme to O2 by an outer-sphere mechanism.

Molecular oxygen is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation and other important chemical reactions in living cells. In many processes of the metabolism, O2 is transformed to reduced or activated forms by heme-containing enzymes. Phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages also use O2 to produce activated oxygen species, including hypochlorous acid and hydroxyl radicals, for killing microorganisms during phagocytosis. The consumption of O2, called “respiratory burst,” is accompanied by oxidation of NADPH and production of superoxide anions (O2−) (1Babior B.M. N. Engl. J.

In stopped-flow measurements, the reduced form of cytochrome b558 was reoxidized to the ferric form by O2 according to a second-order reaction with a rate constant (k2) of ~107M−1 s−1 at 10°C. From these results, we have concluded that the heme in a six-coordinated low spin state catalyses one electron reduction of O2. midpoint reduction potential tetrazole myoglobin. All known heme-containing enzymes involved in reduction or activation of O2, such as cytochrome c oxidase or cytochromes P-450, have a heme in which the five coordination sites of iron are occupied by intrinsic ligands, and the sixth coordination site is opened for binding O2 or other extrinsic ligands. The heme of these enzymes forms an iron-O2 complex during the reduction of O2, or forms the complexes with respiratory inhibitors. On the other hand, the respiratory burst has been known to be insensitive to the respiratory inhibitors, and cytochrome b558in situ does not form a complex with CO(15Iizuka T. Kanegasaki S. Makino R. Tanaka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12049-12053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Judging from spectroscopic data, the heme of cytochrome b558 is in a low spin six-coordinate state in both the ferric and ferrous forms(12Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 14Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Makino R. Iyanagi T. Orii Y. J. Biol.

Moreover, we confirmed that the respiratory inhibitors gave no effect on the absorption spectra nor on the catalytic activity of purified cytochrome b558 in the reconstituted system(14Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Makino R. Iyanagi T. Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4025-4031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These facts indicate strong coordination of both the axial ligands to the heme iron and suggest that cytochrome b558 reduces O2 by a unique mechanism distinct from those of other heme-containing enzymes. The purpose of this study is to examine whether an oxygenated intermediate is formed during the reduction of O2 by ferrous cytochrome b558 or not and to clarify the mechanism of the reaction. The reduced cytochrome was mixed with an oxygenated solution under various conditions, and the spectral changes during the reaction were measured on the millisecond time scale by rapid-scanning spectroscopy. The temperature and pH dependence of the reaction was determined. Under anaerobic conditions, the ferrous cytochrome showed the ability to react with artificial oxidants. The properties of the reactions by cytochrome b558 are compared with those by other heme proteins. The results obtained here, together with our previous ones(13Isogai Y. Shiro Y. Nasuda-Kouyama A. Iizuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13481-13484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Makino R. Iyanagi T. Orii Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 12049-12053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the reduction of O2 by cytochrome b558 occurs via a peripheral process, i.e. electrons being transferred from the heme to O2 at or near the heme edge without formation of the iron-O2 complex. Superoxide-producing cytochrome b558 was purified from porcine neutrophils according to the method described previously(14Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Makino R. Iyanagi T. Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4025-4031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the gel filtration chromatography was performed with Superdex 200 pg (Pharmacia) packed into a 1.6 × 60-cm column. The final purification step with heparin affinity chromatography was omitted. The purified preparation was depleted of flavins (FAD/heme <0.01) as described previously(14Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Makino R. Iyanagi T. Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4025-4031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of cytochrome b558 was determined using a reduced-minus-oxidized extinction coefficient of 21,600 M−1 cm−1 at 558 nm(18Cross A.R. Higson F.K. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Tetrazole myoglobin (Tet-Mb) was prepared and purified according to Shiro et al.(19Shiro Y. Iwata T. Makino R. Fujii M. Isogai Y. Iizuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19983-19990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kamiya N. Shiro Y. Iwata T. Iizuka T. Iwasaki H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 1826-1829Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The time course of autoxidation of Tet-Mb was measured by following the absorbance change at 570 nm as described previously(19Shiro Y. Iwata T. Makino R. Fujii M. Isogai Y. Iizuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19983-19990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of spectral changes of cytochrome b558 in a time range of milliseconds were carried out with a stopped-flow and rapid-scanning spectrophotometer, Unisoku type RSP-601. The purified cytochrome was diluted with a buffer solution containing 100 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 0.1% sucrose monolaurate, unless otherwise noted in the text. The sample solution was depleted of O2 by gently bubbling N2 gas in one of the two reservoirs of the stopped-flow mixer. In the other reservoir, the buffer solution containing reagents mentioned in the text was bubbled with a gas mixture of N2 and O2, which was prepared with a Estec SGD-SC standard gas divider, for at least 15 min. In measurements of the reactions with artificial oxidants, both the solutions also contained 100 mM glucose, 10 units/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma), 2 units/ml catalase (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml superoxide dismutase (Sigma) and were bubbled with N2 gas to completely remove O2. The rapid-scanning recording of a spectrum took 1 ms/208 nm, and 512 spectra were measured with or without time intervals after mixing of the solutions. The dead time was estimated at about 6 ms based on the time course of reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol by ascorbate in separate measurements under the experimental conditions used. Concentration of O2 in the reaction mixture was estimated by amounts of oxygenated myoglobin(Fe2+) formed after mixing deoxy myoglobin(Fe2+) with an oxygenated buffer in other separate measurements. Temperature was controlled by circulating water maintained at constant temperature with a Lauda thermostat type RM6 around the reserved solutions and the flow lines inside the mixer. The time course data for the oxidation of ferrous cytochrome b558 by oxidants were analyzed according to the equation based on second-order reactions as described previously(14Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Makino R. Iyanagi T. Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4025-4031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in concentration of cytochrome b558 from the ferrous form to the ferric form was estimated based on the reduced-minus-oxidized extinction coefficient at 426 nm of 110,000 M−1 cm−1. The ferric form of cytochrome b558 was rapidly reduced to the ferrous form with absorption maxima at 558, 528, and 425 nm after mixing with an excess amount of Na2S2O4 under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1). The spectral changes clearly showed isosbestic points at 417.4 and 438.2 nm. The time course data were fitted with a single exponential curve based on a pseudo-first-order reaction (not shown), and the apparent rate constant was estimated at 3.6 s−1 under the experimental conditions (see the legend of Fig. 1). The ferrous form of cytochrome b558 prepared by addition of a slight excess of Na2S2O4 was mixed with an oxygenated solution prepared at a low concentration of O2, and the spectral changes during the reaction of cytochrome b558 with O2 were measured on the millisecond time scale (Fig. 2). The initial spectrum of the ferrous form was gradually replaced with that of the ferric form in the time domain. Clear isosbestic points were observed at 417.6 and 437.6 nm, which were identical with those in the spectral changes during the reduction with Na2S2O4 under the anaerobic conditions within the wavelength resolution of the spectrophotometer (see Fig. 1). The effect of O2 concentration on the time course for the reaction was examined as shown in Fig. 3, a~d. The apparent rate increased with the O2 concentration in the tested range. The addition of CO did not affect the reaction (Fig. 3, e). The second-order rate constants (k2) were almost constant under these conditions and were estimated at 8.2~9.5 × 106M−1 s−1 (see the legend to Fig. 3). Effects of the addition of CN−, N3−, and pyridine were not observed (not shown). The effect of pH on the reaction of ferrous cytochrome b558 with O2 was examined between pH 7 and 11. In this pH range, little change in absorption spectra for the ferric and ferrous forms was observed with the variation of pH. The rate constant of the reaction was almost constant over a pH range from 7 to 9, and decreased above pH 9 (Fig. 4). The pH dependence gives a single pKα of 9.7. The ability of ferrous cytochrome b558 to react with artificial oxidizing agents was examined under completely anaerobic conditions (Fig. 5). We found that cytochrome b558 was highly reactive with ferricyanide (Em = +420 mV). The spectral changes during the reaction (Fig. 5A) show clear isosbestic points, which are also observed in the reaction with O2. k2 for the reaction with ferricyanide was estimated at 6.4 ± 0.4 × 107M−1 s−1 (4 measurements) at 10°C. In addition, p-benzoquinone (Em = +285 mV), a rather hydrophobic agent, was able to oxidize cytochrome b558. The reaction, however, was much slower than that with ferricyanide (Fig. 5B), and k2 was estimated at 3.5 ± 0.3 × 102M−1 s−1 (three measurements) at 10°C. The temperature dependence of the reactions of ferrous cytochrome b558 with O2 and ferricyanide was determined at pH 7.4 (Fig. 6). For comparison, the dependence of autoxidation of deoxy Tet-Mb was also determined under similar experimental conditions. The thermodynamic parameters of activation for these reactions were obtained on the basis of the transition state theory (21Glasstone S. Laidler K.J. Eyring H. The Theory of Rate Processes. McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York1941Google Scholar) and listed in Table 1 with those for the reduction of ferric cytochrome c by O2−, which were calculated based on the data of Butler et al.(22Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”).Table I Open table in a new tab From the k2 value at 30°C, the oxidation rate of ferrous cytochrome b558 by O2 is estimated at about 8000 s−1 under air-saturated conditions, which is hundreds of times faster than the rate of the steady state turnover, 1~20 s−1 in the catalytic production of O2−in situ or in our reconstituted system(13Isogai Y. Shiro Y. Nasuda-Kouyama A. Iizuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13481-13484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Makino R. Iyanagi T. Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4025-4031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of ferric cytochrome b558 under anaerobic conditions was considerably slower ((13Isogai Y. Shiro Y. Nasuda-Kouyama A. Iizuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13481-13484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). 2Y. Isogai and Y. Orii, unpublished results. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a process following the reduction of O2, such as product release, is rate-limiting because the lifetime of O2−, even in proteins, should not be so long as the heme reduction. Thus, the rate-limiting step in the catalytic reaction is the transfer of NADPH-derived electrons to the heme, and the single turnover reaction rather than the steady state one should be measured to investigate the properties of the reaction of cytochrome b558 with O2 or to examine the effects of respiratory inhibitors. The rate of the oxidation of ferrous cytochrome b558 linearly depends on the O2 concentration, indicating that the reaction proceeds through a bimolecular process. During the reaction, the spectra of only the two (ferrous and ferric) forms of cytochrome b558 could be detected, and no intermediate species could be observed. This indicates that the reaction intermediate, if any, transiently forms and is rapidly decomposed to O2− and the ferric heme. Otherwise, the absorption spectrum of the intermediate is indistinguishable from those of the ferrous and ferric forms under the wavelength resolution. Neither the spectra of the ferric and ferrous cytochrome nor the reaction with O2 were affected by addition of CO, CN−, and N3−. Artificial oxidizing agents, ferricyanide and p-benzoquinone, can react with ferrous cytochrome b558 apparently through an outer sphere mechanism. The rate of oxidation of ferrous cytochrome b558 by ferricyanide was even larger than by O2. The thermodynamic analyses show that the set of the activation parameters for the reaction with ferricyanide is similar to that for the reaction with O2, suggesting that the reaction with O2 occurs by a mechanism similar to that with ferricyanide (Table 1, and also see below). The site for the reaction with ferricyanide appears to be located at a solvent accessible position on the protein and may be common with the site for the reaction with O2. On the other hand, the site for the reaction with p-benzoquinone may be different from that for the reaction with O2 and may be located at a position more distant from the heme. The higher redox potential of ferricyanide may contribute to the higher rate of the reaction. All of these results suggest that the coordination of both the internal axial ligands to the heme iron in cytochrome b558 is so strong that O2 does not bind to the iron by replacing any internal ligand during the reaction and that the reaction with O2 proceeds via an outer sphere mechanism. Support for our idea mentioned above is provided by comparing the thermodynamic parameters in the oxidation of cytochrome b558 by O2 and ferricyanide with the reactions of cytochrome c and Tet-Mb (Table 1). It was suggested that the reduction of ferric cytochrome c by O2− takes place at or close to the solvent accessible heme edge on the basis of the thermodynamic and kinetic studies(22Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tet-Mb, in which the distal histidine (His E7) of myoglobin is site-specifically modified with tetrazole anion (-CN4−), can catalyze reduction of O2 to O2− in the presence of an enzymatic reduction system(19Shiro Y. Iwata T. Makino R. Fujii M. Isogai Y. Iizuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19983-19990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tet-Mb exhibits a low oxidation reduction potential (Em,7 = −193 mV), which is comparable to that of cytochrome b558, and has the six-coordinated heme iron in the ferric state by coordination of the tetrazole group as the internal sixth ligand(20Kamiya N. Shiro Y. Iwata T. Iizuka T. Iwasaki H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 1826-1829Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast with cytochrome b558, the ferrous heme iron of Tet-Mb can bind CO and forms an iron-O2 complex in the reduction of O2. Therefore, the mechanisms for the reactions of cytochrome b558 and Tet-Mb with O2 seem to mainly depend on the bond strength of the axial ligand to the sixth coordination site of the heme iron. In any of these reactions listed in Table 1, the contributions of the entropic terms (TΔS≠) to the total energy barriers (ΔG≠) are small and the enthalpic contributions (ΔH≠) are predominant. However, ΔH≠ is much more predominant in the reaction by Tet-Mb than in those by cytochrome c and cytochrome b558, whereas the TΔS≠ values for the four reactions are similar to each other. The large ΔH≠ value for the reaction of Tet-Mb is similar to that for the autoxidation of native myoglobin by the formation of the iron-O2 complex (85-150 kJ/mol)(23Sugawara Y. Shikama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since ΔH≠ is a measure of the energy barrier which must be overcome to break and make bonds in the formation of the transition state from the reactants, it seems reasonable that the lower enthalpic barriers in the reactions by cytochrome c and cytochrome b558 arise from the weaker interactions of O2− with the ferric heme and of O2 (or ferricyanide) with the ferrous heme, respectively, in these transition states. The results obtained here, together with our previous data(13Isogai Y. Shiro Y. Nasuda-Kouyama A. Iizuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13481-13484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Isogai Y. Iizuka T. Makino R. Iyanagi T. Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4025-4031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Iizuka T. Kanegasaki S. Makino R. Tanaka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12049-12053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are best understood assuming an outer sphere mechanism for the reduction of O2 by cytochrome b558. The reaction can occur at or near the heme edge by a “peripheral-π-process,” which has been proposed for the autoxidation of coordinately saturated iron porphyrin complexes by Castro and co-workers(24Chu M.L. Castro C.E. Hathaway G.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Castro C.E. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. Vol. V. Academic Press, New York1978: 1-27Google Scholar). In this process, O2 weakly interacts with the porphyrin π plane of the ferrous heme followed by the electron transfer. The weak interaction between O2 and the iron-porphyrin system is similar to those in peripheral π complexes of metalloporphyrins with aromatic compounds(26Fulton G.P. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the heme of cytochrome b558, the strong and symmetrical coordination of the axial ligands can enhance the interaction between iron d and porphyrin π electrons to make the rapid O2 reduction possible. The weak interaction of O2 with the heme of ferrous cytochrome b558 may be stabilized by hydrogen bonding with a basic amino acid residue near the heme pocket since the reaction slows down by increase of pH above 9 (Fig. 4) as follows (Fig. S1). In this scheme, BH+ indicates the protonated basic residue. We have obtained no spectroscopic evidence for such a loosely associated complex of the heme with O2. This seems to be inevitable since the formation of such a complex should be transient (half-time <1 ms) and/or the weak interaction can induce only slight changes in the absorption spectra that are not expected to be detectable under the experimental conditions. It is also possible that a positive charge of an ionizable group near the heme rises the redox potential and gives higher reactivity with O2 in the neutral pH range. The major type of oxidases and oxygenases contains five-coordinated heme iron and catalyzes reduction of O2 bound to its sixth coordination site to generate H2O or oxygenated products. Some of these enzymes also catalyze production of O2− or H2O2 in their uncoupled or abnormal reactions (27Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism for the O2 reduction may be common in autoxidation of cytochromes with 6-coordinated hemes and also in bimolecular reactions of deoxy myoglobin and hemoglobin with O2 under specific conditions (30Wallace W.J. Houtchens R.A. Maxwell J.C. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4966-4977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brantley R.E. Smerdon S.J. Wilkinson A.J. Singleton E.W. Olson J.S. J.

It appears that phagocytic cytochrome b558 has evolved the coordination structure of the heme to be specifically adapted for the rapid production of O2− even under low concentration of O2."

Mercuric acetate treatment was used prior to carbohydrate analysis to identify unambiguously the saturated from the unsaturated disaccharides. The chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains from these aggrecan preparations contained: (<i>a</i>) an internal disaccharide composition of unsulfated (3-4 per chain), 4-sulfated (~32 per chain), 6-sulfated (~1 per 14 chains), and 4,6-sulfated disaccharides (~1 per 6 chains) and (<i>b</i>) a nonreducing terminal composition of 4-sulfated GalNAc (~4 out of every 7 chains), 4,6-disulfated GalNAc (~2 out of every 7 chains), and GlcUA adjacent to a 4-sulfated GalNAc residue (~1 out of every 7 chains). Thus, the vast majority of these CS chains terminated with a sulfated GalNAc residue. The presence of 4,6-disulfated GalNAc at nonreducing termini is 60-fold more abundant than 4,6-disulfated GalNAc in interior disaccharides. This observation is consistent with the suggestion that disulfation of terminal GalNAc residues is involved in chain termination."

https://openalex.org/W2024408717,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and potentiates the cellular uptake of lipoproteins. These LPL-lipoprotein associations could involve only protein-lipid interaction, or they could be modulated by apolipoproteins (apo). ApoB is the major protein component of chylomicrons, VLDL, and low density lipoprotein (LDL). ApoB100, a large glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 550 kDa, is composed of several functional domains. A carboxyl-terminal region of the protein is the ligand for the LDL receptor. There are several hydrophobic domains that are believed to be important in lipid binding. The relatively hydrophilic amino-terminal region of apoB, however, has no known function. Using solid phase assays we quantified LPL-lipoprotein complex formation. On a molar basis, severalfold greater amounts of LPL bound to LDL and VLDL than to high density lipoprotein at all the concentrations of LPL tested (0.9-55 nM).To assess the roles of LDL protein versus lipid, we performed competition and ligand blotting experiments. LDL and an amino-terminal fragment of apoB competed better for 125I-LPL binding to LDL than did lipid emulsion particles. Delipidation of LDL-coated plates did not alter LPL binding. On ligand blots, LPL bound to amino-terminal fragments of apoB generated by thrombin digestion but not to apoA1, apoE, or carboxyl-terminal fragments of apoB. Further evidence for LPL interaction with the amino-terminal region of apoB was obtained using anti-apoB monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies directed against the amino-terminal regions of apoB blocked LPL interaction with LDL, whereas those against the carboxyl-terminal region of apoB did not inhibit LPL interaction with LDL. Thus, we conclude that a specific interaction between LPL and the amino-terminal region of apoB may facilitate LPL association with circulating lipoproteins. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and potentiates the cellular uptake of lipoproteins. These LPL-lipoprotein associations could involve only protein-lipid interaction, or they could be modulated by apolipoproteins (apo). ApoB is the major protein component of chylomicrons, VLDL, and low density lipoprotein (LDL). ApoB100, a large glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 550 kDa, is composed of several functional domains. A carboxyl-terminal region of the protein is the ligand for the LDL receptor. There are several hydrophobic domains that are believed to be important in lipid binding. The relatively hydrophilic amino-terminal region of apoB, however, has no known function. Using solid phase assays we quantified LPL-lipoprotein complex formation. On a molar basis, severalfold greater amounts of LPL bound to LDL and VLDL than to high density lipoprotein at all the concentrations of LPL tested (0.9-55 nM). To assess the roles of LDL protein versus lipid, we performed competition and ligand blotting experiments. LDL and an amino-terminal fragment of apoB competed better for 125I-LPL binding to LDL than did lipid emulsion particles. Delipidation of LDL-coated plates did not alter LPL binding. On ligand blots, LPL bound to amino-terminal fragments of apoB generated by thrombin digestion but not to apoA1, apoE, or carboxyl-terminal fragments of apoB. Further evidence for LPL interaction with the amino-terminal region of apoB was obtained using anti-apoB monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies directed against the amino-terminal regions of apoB blocked LPL interaction with LDL, whereas those against the carboxyl-terminal region of apoB did not inhibit LPL interaction with LDL. Thus, we conclude that a specific interaction between LPL and the amino-terminal region of apoB may facilitate LPL association with circulating lipoproteins. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) 1The abbreviations used are: LPLlipoprotein lipaseVLDLvery low density lipoproteinLDLlow density lipoproteinHDLhigh density lipoproteinTGtriglyceridePBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminTBSTris-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibody. is primarily responsible for hydrolyzing chylomicron and VLDL triglycerides (TG). This enzyme is synthesized in a variety of tissues and cells including adipose, muscle(1Nilsson-Ehle P. Garfinkel A.S. Schotz M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 667-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), brain(2Eckel R.H. Robbins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7604-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and macrophages(3Khoo J.C. Mahoney E.M. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7105-7108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After synthesis, the enzyme is transported across the endothelium to its site of activity on the luminal surface of endothelial cells(4Eckel R.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The enzyme binds to this site via electrostatic interactions with cell surface proteoglycans (5Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17516-17521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shimada K. Lanzillo J.J. Douglas W. Fanburg B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 710: 117-121Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and, perhaps, via protein-protein interaction involving a non-proteoglycan binding protein(7Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). lipoprotein lipase very low density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein high density lipoprotein triglyceride phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline monoclonal antibody. A number of experimental observations suggest that LPL has a greater affinity for LDL than for HDL. LPL is primarily a triacylglycerol hydrolase, and its enzymatic actions are usually assayed using a TG-rich substrate(8Hietanen E. Greenwood M.R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 480-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet LPL-mediated hydrolysis of LDL, a cholesteryl ester-rich lipoprotein, and VLDL, a TG-rich lipoprotein, had a lower Km than HDL(10Deckelbaum R.J. Eisenberg S. Levy E. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Circulation. 1985; 72: III93Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further evidence that LPL does not bind indiscriminately to all classes of lipoproteins was obtained from studies of human postheparin plasma. Most active LPL in postheparin plasma elutes during gel filtration in a major peak that precedes the peak of LDL cholesterol(11Goldberg I.J. Kandel J.J. Blum C.B. Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although Vilella et al.(12Vilella E. Joven J. Fernandez M. Vilaro S. Brunzell J.D. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1555-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that some LPL was also associated with HDL, HDL-associated LPL was less active than the LPL on apoB-containing lipoproteins. Thus, active LPL is associated primarily with LDL or buoyant LDL size lipoproteins in the circulation. In addition to its enzymatic actions, LPL can anchor lipoproteins to cell surface and matrix proteoglycans. This molecular bridge has been postulated to increase lipoprotein retention by subendothelial cell matrix and increase cellular lipoprotein uptake. Both Saxena et al.(13Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and Eisenberg et al.(14Eisenberg S. Sehayek E. Olivecrona T. Vlodavsky I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) showed that LPL anchors apoB-containing lipoproteins to subendothelial cell matrix. Saxena et al.(13Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were unable to show any increase in LPL-mediated HDL binding to matrix. In contrast, Eisenberg et al.(14Eisenberg S. Sehayek E. Olivecrona T. Vlodavsky I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) reported that LPL caused a small increase in HDL association with matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This increase in HDL binding was almost an order of magnitude less than that found for LDL or VLDL. Saxena et al.(13Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) performed their experiments in media containing serum lipoproteins that could have competed for LPL binding to HDL. This might explain the disparity between results. Nonetheless, LPL appears to preferentially anchor apoB-containing particles. How does LPL interact with lipoproteins? One hypothesis is that LPL has several hydrophobic regions that bind to lipid molecules on the surface of large particles containing a TG core(15Yang C-Y. Gu Z-W. Yang H-X. Rohde M.F. Gotto A.M. Pownall H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16822-16827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL, however, does not associate well with protein-free lipid particles. Fielding and Fielding (16Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 620: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported a method of partial LPL purification by incubating postheparin plasma with 5 mg/ml TG derived from 20% Intralipid in low ionic strength buffer. Even with this protocol in which the TG concentration was severalfold greater than the usual plasma cholesterol or TG concentrations, less than 50% of the LPL activity was recovered with the lipid. Additional studies have shown that LPL associates better with apoB-containing lipoproteins than with Intralipid. In the studies of Rumsey et al.(17Rumsey S.C. Obunike J.C. Arad Y. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the LPL-mediated increase in emulsion particle binding to the surface of fibroblasts was much less than that found using LDL. Thus, optimal LPL association with lipoproteins may require more than just lipid. In the experiments presented in this paper, we studied LPL interaction with lipoproteins and lipid emulsions. Using a solid phase plate assay, we assessed the interaction between LPL and lipoproteins in a system that was free of lipoprotein receptors and cell surface proteoglycans. Because more LPL associated with LDL than HDL or lipid emulsions, we studied the roles of apoB and lipoprotein lipid in this process. Our data support a role for apoB, specifically the amino-terminal region of apoB, in LPL interaction with lipoproteins. Human LDL (d 1.019-1.063 g/ml) and HDL (d 1.063-1.21 g/ml) were isolated from EDTA-containing plasma by ultracentrifugation(18Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein patterns of all the lipoprotein preparations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Total protein concentration of lipoproteins was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. A 6507-base pair EcoRI fragment encoding the amino-terminal 46% of human apoB was subcloned from a pCMV5 vector containing the apoB78 cDNA (a gift from Brian Blackhart and Brian McCarthy) into the EcoRI site of pBluescript M13+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to form pBS-B46. A 2569-base pair BamHI fragment from this vector was then inserted into the BamHI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pAcYM1, yielding pAcB17. This plasmid was cotransfected with the wild-type baculovirus genome (Autographacalifornica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-21 cells. Recombinant viruses were then selected, plaque-purified, and titered as described(20Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar, 21Miller D.W. Safer P. Miller L.K. Genetic Engineering. Plenum Press, New York1986: 277-298Crossref Google Scholar). These viruses encode the 27-amino acid apoB signal peptide as well as the amino-terminal 782 amino acids of mature apoB. Tissue culture supernatants from expressing and nonexpressing cells were harvested, and cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0.001% and benzamidine at 0.3 mg/ml were added to the supernatant. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) followed by either Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting (23Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5916) Google Scholar) with anti-human apoB monoclonal antibodies 1D1 and CC3.4 (24Pease R.J. Milne R.W. Jessup W.K. Law A. Provost P.

In some experiments, amino-terminal fragments of apoB were generated by thrombin digestion of human LDL as described by Cardin et al.(26Cardin A.D. Witt K.R. Chai J. Margolius H.S. Donaldson V.H. Jackson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8522-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesteryl ester-rich lipid emulsions were prepared as reported previously (17Rumsey S.C. Obunike J.C. Arad Y. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) by adding 40 mg of triolein (Nu-Check, Elysian, MN) and 40 mg of cholesteryl oleate to 80 mg of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL). LPL was purified from fresh bovine milk as described previously using the method of Socorro et al.(27Socorro L. Green C.C. Jackson R.L. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single band with a molecular mass of approximately 55 kDa was identified on a Coomassie staining (data not shown). Enzyme activity was assayed using a method described by Nilsson-Ehle and Schotz(9Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was stored at −70°C. Purified LPL was radioiodinated (7Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase enzymes (Sigma) as reported(7Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical preparation had a specific activity of about 800-1000 cpm/ng LPL, and more than 90% of the counts were precipitable by 10% trichloroacetic acid. LPL was biotinylated as described by Sivaram et al.(28Sivaram P. Wadhwani S.W. Klein M.G. Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of biotin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to purified LPL and incubated for 10 min at 4°C. Biotinylated LDL was then purified from the mixture using a heparin-agarose column, and fractions were characterized by ligand blotting using streptavidin. LPL activity was also measured, and active fractions containing biotinylated LPL were pooled and stored in aliquots at −70°C. Either ascites containing the hybridoma antibodies or purified IgG was used. The monoclonal antibodies mAb 3 and mAb 19 have determinants in the amino-terminal region of apoB(29Curtiss L.K. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 15213-15221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAb 47 recognizes the LDL receptor binding site of apoB close to the carboxyl terminus(24Pease R.J. Milne R.W. Jessup W.K. Law A. Provost P. Fruchart J-C. Dean R.T. Marcel Y.L. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 553-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed using polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5% SDS(22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) using a Milliblot SDE semidry blotting system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and then incubated overnight in PBS containing 3% BSA at 4°C. The membrane was then incubated with biotinylated LPL for 2 h at 4°C and then washed six times with PBS containing 0.3% BSA. Proteins bound to biotinylated LPL were visualized by incubation with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase followed by development with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (peroxidase substrate)(7Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solid phase plate assays were performed as described by Williams et al.(30Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Stricklands D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For binding studies, LDL, HDL, or VLDL, diluted in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) containing 5 mM Ca2+ was added to 96-well plates and incubated at 4°C overnight. The unbound lipoproteins were removed, and the plates were washed three times with 0.3% BSA in TBS. Then the plates were incubated with 3% BSA in TBS, 5 mM Ca2+ for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. After washing with 0.3% BSA in TBS, 125I-LPL in TBS, 5 mM Ca2+, 3% BSA was added and incubated for 24 h at 4°C. Again, the plates were washed, and 200 μl of 0.1 N NaOH was added. An aliquot of 150 μl was counted. For competition studies, LDL (50 μg/ml protein, 91 nM) was bound to 96-well plates overnight at 4°C. The experimental protocol used in this experiment was identical to the one described for the binding experiments except that 125I-LPL (5 μg/ml, 45 nM) was added along with competitors. After incubating for 2 h at room temperature, unbound 125I-LPL was removed, and radioactivity bound to the well was measured. Binding to BSA-coated wells was determined in each assay as a control. Competition studies were performed using Intralipid (20%) (Vitrum, Stockholm) and cholesteryl ester-rich emulsions. The molar concentration of Intralipid was calculated using a diameter of 300 nm/lipid particle. Cholesteryl ester-rich lipid emulsion concentration was calculated based on the total neutral lipid concentration (i.e. 30 μg/ul) and assuming that 1 μmol of the particle contains 5 × 106μg. The protein molecular masses of 550 kDa for LDL, 150 kDa for HDL, and 110 kDa for LPL dimers were used to calculate the concentrations of these lipoproteins. For VLDL we estimated that the total molecular mass of VLDL was approximately 1 × 104 kDa and that 10% of this would be the protein mass; thus, we used 1 × 103 kDa as a molecular mass of VLDL. To determine the binding of apoB17 to LPL, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed using a monoclonal antibody against the amino-terminal region of apoB (mAb 19). Briefly, LPL or BSA at 5 μg/ml was incubated at 4°C overnight in microtiter plates. After washing the plates four times with 0.3% BSA in PBS and blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h, various concentrations of apoB17 were added. The plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, washed four times, and then incubated for another 2 h at room temperature with primary antibody (mAb 19 diluted to 1:500 in PBS). Unbound antibodies were removed, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at 1:500 dilution was added. One and a half hours later, 100 μl of substrate solution containing o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), 5 μl of 50% H2O2 in 0.1 M citric acid (pH 6) was added to each well. After 20 min at room temperature the absorbance at 492 nm was measured. 125I-LPL binding to LDL-, HDL-, and VLDL-coated plates was determined. We first measured the amounts required to saturate the binding sites of the plate. To do this, 125I-LDL, 125I-HDL, or 125I-VLDL at various protein concentrations (1-100 μg/ml) were incubated overnight at 4°C in microtiter plate wells. After washing, labeled lipoprotein in each well was assessed. Approximately 10 μg/ml LDL or HDL and 25 μg/ml VLDL were required to saturate the plate. At this concentration, 2.3 × 10−4 nmol of LDL protein, 6.1 × 10−4 nmol of HDL protein, and 2.43 × 10−4 nmol of VLDL protein were bound to each well. Thus, severalfold more HDL than LDL or VLDL bound to the plate at all concentrations of lipoproteins. We next assessed 125I-LPL binding to the lipoprotein-coated plates. First, we examined the time course of LPL binding to these lipoproteins. LPL binding reached equilibrium after overnight incubation at 4°C (data not shown). LPL binding to albumin-coated plates was assessed and used as an estimate of nonspecific binding. Data shown in Fig. 1 were obtained after coating the plates overnight at 4°C with 50 μg/ml HDL or LDL. This is a concentration above that required to saturate the plate. The data are expressed in terms of nanomoles of lipoprotein on the plate. 125I-LPL (0.9-55 nM) binding to LDL (opencircles) was significantly greater than to HDL (solidcircles). Using 14 nM LPL, approximately 5-fold more LPL bound to the LDL-coated plates than to the HDL-coated plates. At 14 nM125I-LPL the molar ratio of LPL binding to LDL was 1:1. Although using greater LPL concentrations increased the molar ratio of LPL to LDL (e.g. to 1.6 using 55 nM125I-LPL), the rate of increase of this additional LPL binding was less steep. This suggests that a second, lower affinity process exists. Binding of LPL to VLDL was similar to that of LDL. At each concentration of 125I-LPL used, nonspecific binding to BSA-coated plates was <10% of the total binding, and this was subtracted. The experiments above suggested that LPL has a greater affinity for LDL than for HDL. We next tested whether LPL interaction with LDL was competed by excess unlabeled LDL or Intralipid. In these experiments, we used a short 2-h incubation at room temperature to minimize the hydrolysis of TG in Intralipid. Plates were coated overnight at 4°C with LDL (50 μg/ml), and then 125I-LPL at 45 nM was added alone or with various concentrations of competitors. 125I-LPL binding to LDL was blocked by >95% by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled LPL (data not shown). This demonstrates the specificity of the interaction between 125I-LPL and LDL. Unlabeled LDL at 9 × 102 nM inhibited LPL association with the plate by 65% (Fig. 2). In contrast, using a similar protocol and molar concentration of Intralipid particles, only about 20% inhibition was observed. Furthermore, inhibition of lipase activity with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not result in any difference in the competition between LDL and Intralipid for LPL binding (data not shown). These data suggested that LPL interaction with LDL involved more than a simple protein-lipid interaction. To assess the role of LDL lipid in LPL-LDL interactions, we studied the effects of delipidation of LDL on LPL interaction with LDL. Plates were coated with [3H]cholesteryl ester-rich emulsion particles and were delipidated by incubating with an acetone:ethanol (1:1) mixture for 1 h at −20°C. Approximately 80% of the 3H-lipid was removed by this method (data not shown). This protocol was then used to assess 125I-LPL binding to delipidated LDL-coated plates. As shown in Fig. 3(inset), LDL binding to control and LDL binding to delipidated plates were virtually identical. Fig. 3 shows data comparing LDL competition studies performed using control and delipidated LDL-coated plates. 181 nM unlabeled LDL inhibited the binding of 125I-LPL to LDL-coated plates by approximately 50% in both control and delipidated plates. Thus, delipidation did not result in a significant reduction in 125I-LPL binding to LDL nor was its binding to LPL more easily disrupted by competition with LDL in solution. These data further suggest that apoB, not LDL lipid, mediates LPL binding. These experiments were repeated with a method described by Patton et al.(31Patton J.G. Alley M.C. Mao S.J.T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 55: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v), which was shown to remove 95% of cholesteryl ester and TG. The results were identical to those obtained with acetone:ethanol (1:1). In a separate experiment, we examined the role of phospholipid components of LDL in LPL binding using microtiter plates coated with sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, or lysolecithin. Binding of LPL to these phospholipids was less than 20% of the LPL binding to LDL (data not shown). These data suggest that LDL-LPL interaction is not mediated by interaction between phospholipid and LPL. To test whether LPL would bind to apoB and other apolipoproteins, ligand blotting was performed. Twenty μg of apoA1, apoE, and thrombin-digested human LDL were applied to 3-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and probed with biotinylated LPL. Among these proteins, only thrombin-digested fragments of apoB were recognized by LPL (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the positive reaction was confined to amino-terminal parts of apoB, in agreement with the previous data(32Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither apoA1, apoE, nor the carboxyl-terminal regions of apoB were recognized on ligand blots. To further characterize the interaction between LPL and apoB, we used several monoclonal antibodies against apoB. In this experiment microtiter plates were also coated with LPL (90 nM) at 4°C. Following washing and blocking, 125I-LDL (18 nM) was added with antibodies (1:50 dilution of ascites) and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. As shown in Fig. 5, both mAb 3 and mAb 19 inhibited 125I-LPL binding to LDL by 80%, whereas mAb 47 inhibited binding by only 25%. In other experiments we showed that this concentration of mAb 47 inhibited specific LDL binding to fibroblasts by >90%. To further assess the role of the amino-terminal region of apoB versus LDL lipid in LPL-LDL interaction, we performed competition experiments using apoB17 and cholesteryl ester-rich emulsion particles. In these experiments, 125I-LPL binding to LDL-coated plates was competed with apoB17 and cholesteryl ester-rich emulsions. BSA was also used as a negative control, and it did not inhibit the 125I-LPL binding to LDL (data not shown). ApoB17 competed; apoB17 at 1.7 × 103 nM decreased LPL binding to the plates by 74%. In contrast, cholesteryl ester-rich emulsion particles at 1.8 × 103 nM inhibited 125I-LPL binding to LDL-coated plates by approximately 30% (Fig. 6A). We then determined the binding of apoB17 to LPL using LPL-coated plates. The apoB17 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described under “Materials and Methods.”Fig. 6B shows binding of apoB17 (0-1 μg/ml, 45 mM) to LPL- and BSA-coated plates. At 0.1 μg/ml (4.5 nM) approximately 10-fold more apoB17 bound to LPL-coated plates than to BSA-coated plates. Thus, several types of experiments support the hypothesis that LPL binding to LDL is modulated by apoB and that this process involves a specific interaction with the amino-terminal region of apoB. The present experiments suggest a new role for the amino-terminal region of apoB as a mediator of LPL interaction with lipoproteins. Data supporting this conclusion were obtained by several different methods. When 125I-LPL was added to LDL- or HDL-coated plates and incubated at 4°C overnight to achieve equilibrium, severalfold more LPL bound to LDL- than to the HDL-coated plates (e.g. approximately 6-fold with 55 nM125I-LPL). Binding of LPL to VLDL was similar to that of LDL, indicating that protein-protein interaction between LPL and apoB is more important than protein-lipid interaction. In these experiments, we did not calculate the kinetic parameters using a method such as Scatchard analysis (33Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar) for several reasons. First, LPL aggregates at higher concentrations. Second, LPL dimers dissociate over time. Thus, it is likely that monomerization and denaturation of the LPL occurred during the overnight incubation. Because active dimeric LPL is more likely to associate with LDL and inactive LPL associates with HDL(12Vilella E. Joven J. Fernandez M. Vilaro S. Brunzell J.D. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1555-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Kd for active LPL binding to LDL might be lower and the Kd for HDL higher. Nonetheless, we conclude that LPL interaction with LDL is greater than with HDL and hypothesize that this is due to the presence of apoB on LDL. Further support for this hypothesis was obtained using ligand blots. LPL bound to amino-terminal fragments of apoB generated by thrombin digestion but not to apoA1, apoE, or carboxyl-terminal fragments of apoB. Thus, the reason LPL preferentially associates with LDL in plasma and on cell surfaces might result from LPL association with apoB. Apolipoproteins other than apoB may interact with LPL. Both apoCIII (34Brown W.V. Baginsky M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and apoE (35Ekman R. Nilsson-Ehle P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1975; 63: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have been reported to decrease LPL activity when added to some in vitro assay systems. ApoE, however, did not interact with LPL on ligand blots (Fig. 4). ApoE shares two properties with apoB that make it unique among plasma apolipoproteins; both bind to LDL receptors and both interact with a variety of glycosaminoglycans including heparin(36Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.V. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hui D.Y. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1804-1807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the homologous areas of apoB and apoE are near the carboxyl-terminal region of apoB (38Milne R. Theolis Jr., R. Maurice R. Pease R.J. Weech P.K. Rassart E. Fruchart J.C. Scott J. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19754-19760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LPL binds to the amino-terminal portion of apoB, it is not surprising that apoE did not directly bind to LPL on ligand blots. ApoCII is the obligatory activator for LPL hydrolysis of lipoprotein TG, but the mechanism of apoCII-LPL interaction is uncertain. Surprisingly, Shirai et al.(39Shirai K. Matsuoka N. Jackson R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that addition of apoCII to phospholipid emulsion particles decreased LPL association with the emulsion. Thus, LPL interaction with apoB appears to differ from its interaction with other apolipoproteins. A second lipoprotein component that might affect LPL-lipoprotein interaction is lipid. Lipoproteins contain both core and surface lipid. In addition to affecting the size and geometry of the lipoprotein surface, some hydrophobic core lipids (TG and cholesteryl ester) are thought to be exposed on the lipoprotein surface(41Deckelbaum R.J. Shipley G.G. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 744-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of lipids in LPL binding to particles, LPL binding to LDL was competed with Intralipid (a TG-rich, protein-deficient emulsion) and a cholesteryl ester-rich emulsion. LPL binding to LDL was inhibited by excess LDL and by the amino-terminal fragment of apoB. Less inhibition was observed with the same or greater molar concentrations of lipid emulsion particles. Further evidence that lipid is not critical for LPL-LDL interaction was obtained by comparing LPL binding to LDL- and delipidated LDL-coated plates. Binding and competition studies using these two LDL-coated plates were indistinguishable. Thus, neither the core nor surface lipids interacted with LPL in the same manner as apoB. Active LPL is thought to be a noncovalently linked homodimer, and each subunit molecular mass is approximately 55 kDa. This enzyme contains five functional sites (15Yang C-Y. Gu Z-W. Yang H-X.

Olivecrona T. Bjursell G. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) including (a) a catalytic site containing an active serine residue, (b) an interfacial substrate recognition site consisting of hydrophobic basic residues, (c) a heparin binding site, (d) an apolipoprotein CII binding site, and (e) a site for subunit-subunit interaction. Although it has been suggested that LPL interaction with lipoproteins involves the hydrophobic lipid recognition sites, there are several studies that do not support this hypothesis. Hydrophobic interactions are potentiated by high ionic strength solutions; however, LPL is dissociated from lipoproteins and lipid particles in high salt solutions(11Goldberg I.J. Kandel J.J. Blum C.B. Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although LPL appears to interact with polar lipid, i.e. phospholipid, our studies using phospholipid-coated plates (data not shown) and previously published data (17Rumsey S.C. Obunike J.C. Arad Y. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) demonstrate that such an interaction is much weaker than LPL association with lipoproteins. It is not clear whether LPL interaction with apoB is required for lipolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins. In our preliminary experiments, a monoclonal antibody against apoB, mAb 19, did not inhibit LPL hydrolysis of VLDL, suggesting that this interaction is not required for lipolysis (data not shown). However, Connelly et al.(40Connelly P.W. Maguire G.F. Vezina C. Hegele R.A. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20554-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that lipolysis of VLDL by LPL was noncompetitively inhibited by LDL and intermediate density lipoproteins. Thus, LPL may associate with LDL or intermediate density lipoproteins, and this in turn prevents the association of LPL with VLDL. ApoB100, a large glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 550 kDa, is virtually the only protein component of LDL particles. The carboxyl-terminal region of apoB is involved in binding to LDL receptors, and this region also contains five of seven apoB heparin binding sites(43Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11097-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under physiologic ionic conditions, however, LDL binds weakly to heparin(44Iverius P.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2607-2613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating the importance of tertiary structure in apoB interaction with other molecules. ApoB also contains numerous hydrophobic domains throughout its length that are believed to be important in lipid binding (45Olofsson S.O. Bjursell G. Bostrom K. Carlsson P. Elovson J. Protter A.A. Reuben M.A. Bondjers G. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 1-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and multiple proline-rich sequences predicted to form amphipathic β-sheets and β-turns that are thought to have high lipid binding potential(46Knott T.J.

Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1455-1465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences, however, are not found in the amino-terminal 1000 amino acids. In addition, apoB contains 25 cysteine residues of which 12, in disulfide form, are located in the first 500 amino acids. Thus, the amino-terminal region of apoB is thought to be a globular structure that extends away from the lipid core of lipoproteins(48Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of apoB varies as a function of the size, lipid composition, and, perhaps, apolipoprotein content of lipoproteins. Galeano et al.(49Galeano N.F. Milne R. Marcel Y.L. Walsh M.T. Levy E. Ngu'yen T. Gleeson A. Arad Y. Witte L. Al-Haideri M. Rumsey S.C. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol.

Similarly, McKeone et al.(51McKeone B.J. Patsch J.R. Pownall H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1926-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TG induced structural changes in apoB remote from the receptor binding region. These changes included differences in immunoreaction with antibody mAb 3 and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease cleavage at approximately the first 100 kDa of apoB. Whether such differences in the conformation of the amino-terminal region of apoB alter LPL-lipoprotein association remains to be established. LPL-apoB interactions could play a role in efficient catabolism of circulating lipoproteins. The initial event in lipoprotein TG hydrolysis may be apoE binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, a process that anchors circulating lipoproteins to the endothelial cell surface. Data supporting this function of apoE have been reported by several laboratories(52Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

We postulate that a secondary interaction that further approximates the lipoprotein and LPL is LPL interaction with the amino-terminal region of apoB.

This IL-6 mutant could be used as an IL-6 receptor antagonist on human HepG2 cells and the human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line CESS, but it had full activity on the more sensitive human XG-1 cells when applied at sufficiently high concentrations. 2F. D. de Hon, unpublished results. In the present study, we subdivided the region 2a into two parts (2a1, residues 43-49; 2a2, residues 50-55) to analyze which part is the most important for the interaction with gp130. We exchanged each part in the human IL-6 against the corresponding murine sequence. In the next step, we wanted to construct an IL-6 molecule that should bind to the IL-6Rα, but which should not activate gp130. In addition, this IL-6 protein should block the IL-6Rα and thereby inhibit human IL-6 activity on the highly sensitive human myeloma cell line XG-1. For this reason, we combined the murine residues 43-49 or 50-55 with the two point mutations (Q159E/T162P) in the beginning of the D-helix, which also decrease the interaction of the IL-6•IL-6Rα complex with gp130 (16Savino R.

In addition, we introduced point mutations in the end of the D-helix (F170L/S176R) that increase the affinity to the IL-6Rα(12Leebeek F.W.G. Kariya K. Schwabe M. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol.

For the construction of the human/murine chimeric IL-6 cDNAs 2a1 and 2a2, discrete regions of the human IL-6 cDNA were replaced by homologous murine IL-6-cDNA fragments. To construct the plasmid pRSET 5d-huIL-6-2a2, four oligonucleotides were fused and ligated into EcoNI-NheI-digested pRSET 5d-huIL-6. The oligonucleotides were 5′-GAAAGGAGACATGTAACAAGAGT-3′ sense, 5′-ATGTTACTCTTGTTACATGTCTCCTTT-3′ antisense, 5′-AACATGTGTATGAACAACGATGATGCG-3′ sense, and 5′-CTAGCGCATCATCGTTGTTCATACAC-3′ antisense. Construction of pRSET 5d-huIL-6-2a1 was as follows. Since there was no common restriction site in the human or murine IL-6-cDNA, we introduced the unique restriction site SacI at analogous positions using synthetic oligonucleotides. These nucleotide exchanges did not result in changes of the amino acid sequence. Chimeric human and murine IL-6-cDNA fragments were then produced by PCR using pRSET 5d-huIL-6 or pRSET 5d-huIL-6-2a as template(14Van Dam M. Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Brakenhoff J.P.G.

The oligonucleotides hybridizing to the pRSET 5d vector, the human IL-6 cDNA or the mutant 2a cDNA, were 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ sense (vector), 5′-CTCAGCTTCCTTTCGG-3′ antisense (vector), 5′-TGTGAGAGCTCCAAAGAGGCAC-3′ SacI sense (human IL-6), and 5′-CATCGGAGCTCTCACAATCAGA-3′ SacI antisense (mutant 2a). To introduce the two point mutations, F170L and S176R, into the huIL-6-Q159E/T162P cDNA (short designation, huIL-6-EP), a XbaI-Bsu36I fragment encoding the F170L and S176R substitutions was created with PCR technology. pRSET 6d-huIL-6-EP was used as a template, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into XbaI-Bsu36I-digested pRSET 6d-huIL-6-EP. PCR was carried out with Pyrococcus furiosus polymerase (Stratagene) under the following conditions: denaturation, 90 s at 95°C; annealing, 60 s at 55°C; extension, 60 s at 72°C, 30 cycles. The following primers were used: a sense primer carrying the XbaI site (5′-GAATCTAGATGCAATAACCACC-3′) and an antisense primer encoding the two substitutions and the Bsu36I site (5′-GAAGAGCCCTCAGGCTGCGCTGCAGGAACTCCTTAAGGCTGCGCAGAATG-3′). The pRSET 6d-huIL-6-EP-F170L/S176R was called pRSET 6d-huIL-6-EP-LR. The vectors pRSET 6d-huIL-6-EP-2a1-LR and pRSET 6d-huIL-6-EP-2a2-LR were constructed by ligating an NcoI-XbaI cDNA fragment from pRSET 5d-huIL-6-2a1 or −2a2 into NcoI-XbaI-digested pRSET 6d-huIL-6-EP-LR. The integrity of all constructs was verified by restriction fragment analysis and DNA sequencing(18Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The IL-6 variants were expressed, purified, and quantified as described(15Ehlers M. Grötzinger J. de Hon F.D. Müllberg J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Liu J. Wollmer A. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1744-1753PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IL-6 proteins to a soluble form of IL-6Rα, ternary complex formation of IL-6 proteins with soluble forms of IL-6Rα and gp130, and the assay with human hepatoma HepG2 cells were done as previously described (15Ehlers M.

The biological assays with the murine cell line B9 and the human myeloma cell line XG-1 were performed as in (17Brakenhoff J.P.J. deHon F.D. Fontaine V. tenBoekel E. Schooltink H. Rose-John S.

In previous studies with human/murine IL-6 chimeric proteins, we have defined a region mainly comprising the beginning of the A-B loop of human IL-6 (residues 43-55, region 2a) as being important for the interaction of the IL-6•IL-6Rα complex with the signal-transducing protein gp130(15Ehlers M.

To more precisely map this interaction site, we subdivided this region into two parts: 2a1 (residues 43-49) and 2a2 (residues 50-55) and introduced the corresponding murine residues into the human IL-6 protein. First, we measured displacement of human 125I-IL-6 binding to a soluble form of the IL-6Rα protein(14Van Dam M. Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Brakenhoff J.P.G. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C.

As shown in Fig. 1A, human IL-6 displaced 125I-IL-6 binding to 50% when used in a 10-20-fold molar excess. In contrast, murine IL-6 failed to compete with human 125I-IL-6 for binding. Chimera 2a showed half-maximal displacement at an excess of approximately 60-fold whereas chimera 2a1 and 2a2 showed similar affinity to the IL-6Rα as human IL-6. Human and murine IL-6 and the mutants 2a, 2a1, and 2a2 stimulated the proliferation of murine B9 cells to a similar extent (data not shown), which demonstrated that their structures were intact. On human myeloma XG-1 cells, human IL-6 but not murine IL-6 induced proliferation (Fig. 1B). The specific activity of chimera 2a was reduced by a factor of approximately 300. Chimera 2a1 was 5-fold and chimera 2a2 30-fold less active than human IL-6. These results indicate that the properties of chimera 2a reside mainly in part 2a2. A similar result was obtained when we examined the induction of the acute phase protein gene haptoglobin by 10 ng/ml of the IL-6 variants in human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Untreated cells and cells treated with murine IL-6 and chimera 2a showed no haptoglobin mRNA induction (Fig. 1C). Stimulation of cells with human IL-6 led to full stimulation of haptoglobin mRNA expression. Chimera 2a2 was less active than chimera 2a1. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between binding of chimeras 2a1 and 2a2 to the IL-6Rα and their reduced bioactivity on human cells could be a reduced interaction of the IL-6•IL-6Rα complex with gp130. To measure ternary complex formation of the IL-6 mutants with soluble forms of IL-6Rα and gp130(19Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T.

The complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. No precipitation of sIL-6Rα occurred without IL-6 (Fig. 1D). In the presence of human but not of murine IL-6, the sIL-6Rα subunit was coprecipitated with soluble gp130. The 2a mutant did not induce measurable complex formation between IL-6Rα and gp130. Chimera 2a1 led to a slightly reduced and chimera 2a2 to a more reduced ternary complex formation. Therefore, region 2a2 is more important for the interaction of the IL-6•IL-6Rα complex with the gp130 molecule than region 2a1. Whether this region is part of a binding side for gp130 or it is necessary for stabilizing other epitopes responsible for gp130 interaction remains open. Recently, we showed that the introduction of two point mutations (Q159E/T162P; short designation, EP) into the human IL-6 protein also resulted in highly reduced IL-6Rα-dependent complex formation with gp130(17Brakenhoff J.P.J. deHon F.D. Fontaine V. tenBoekel E. Schooltink H. Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Content J. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 86-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of this mutant to the IL-6Rα was only 3-4-fold reduced. This IL-6 protein proved to be an inhibitor of human IL-6 activity on HepG2 and CESS cells but not on XG-1 cells, where it showed full activity when applied at sufficiently high concentrations. This activity could be inhibited by anti-gp130 mAbs.2 So far, it is not clear why the sensitivity of IL-6-responsive cells varies by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Cells that proliferate in response to IL-6 show a half-maximal response at 1-20 pg/ml, whereas cells that differentiate or express acute phase proteins have a half-maximal response at 1-5 ng/ml(14Van Dam M. Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Brakenhoff J.P.G. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15285-15290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ehlers M.

This, however, cannot be explained by different receptor numbers(1Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). It cannot be excluded that there are differences in signal transduction or that the presence of additional receptor subunits on cells that proliferate in response to IL-6 renders these cells more sensitive to the cytokine. This phenomenon of differential sensitivity of different cell types has of course important implications for the therapeutic application of IL-6 receptor antagonists. Fig. 2 shows a ribbon representation of the IL-6 model (15Ehlers M. Grötzinger J. de Hon F.D. Müllberg J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Liu J. Wollmer A. Rose-John S. J.

In our model, the two point mutations (EP) and the regions 2a1 and 2a2 are in close proximity. Recently, the substitution of two amino acids in the A-helix (Y31D/G35F) (Fig. 2) also lead to a reduced affinity of the IL-6•IL-6Rα complex to gp130(28Savino R. Lahm A. Salvati A.L. Ciapponi L. Sporeno E. Altamura S. Paonessa G. Toniatti C. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the ligand-induced receptor complex consists of two molecules of each, IL-6, IL-6Rα, and gp130(22Stoyan T. Michaelis U. Schooltink H. Van Dam M. Rudolph R. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K. Hammacher A. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23286-23289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So far, it is unclear whether the mentioned regions are all involved in the interaction with one gp130 or whether one IL-6 protein touches two gp130 proteins or two IL-6 proteins touch each other. We introduced the murine region 2a2 and 2a1, respectively, into the mutant IL-6-EP together with the two point mutations (F170L/S176R; short designation, LR), which increase the affinity of human IL-6 to the IL-6Rα. The two resulting IL-6 mutant proteins were called IL-6-EP-2a1-LR and IL-6-EP-2a2-LR. Both mutants showed similar affinity to the IL-6Rα as human IL-6 (Fig. 3A). Mutant IL-6-EP-2a1-LR and IL-6-EP-2a2-LR fully induced proliferation of IL-6-dependent B9 cells albeit at 10-100-fold higher concentrations (data not shown). For mutant IL-6-EP-2a2-LR, no bioactivity on human XG-1 (Fig. 3B) and HepG2 (Fig. 3C) cells and no IL-6Rα-dependent ternary complex formation with gp130 (Fig. 3D) was detected. Mutant IL-6-EP-2a1-LR showed residual bioactivity on XG-1 cells. This was in line with the higher specific activity of 2a1 compared with 2a2. To test for antagonistic activity, we added IL-6-EP-2a1-LR and IL-6-EP-2a2-LR at increasing concentrations, respectively, to human myeloma cells (XG-1) in the presence of 100 pg/ml human IL-6 (Fig. 4A). Mutant IL-6-EP-2a2-LR completely inhibited the bioactivity of IL-6 at an 100,000-fold excess, whereas mutant IL-6-EP-2a1-LR at this concentration only led to 70% reduction of cell proliferation. By increasing the amounts of human IL-6 to XG-1 cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml IL-6-EP-2a1-LR or IL-6-EP-2a2-LR, we observed that high concentrations of human IL-6 could completely overcome the antagonistic effect of both IL-6 variants (Fig. 4B). IL-6-EP-2a2-LR behaved as a potent IL-6 receptor antagonist on XG-1 cells. Introduction of additional point mutations into IL-6 may further increase the affinity to IL-6Rα. This will reduce the amount of this antagonist necessary to inhibit IL-6 activity. IL-6 plays a role in a variety of diseases, such as plasmacytoma/myeloma, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, and AIDS(1Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The administration of IL-6-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to patients with rheumathoid arthritis and multiple myeloma has highly improved the conditions of the patients for several weeks(30Klein B. Wijdenes J. Zhang X.G. Jourdan M. Boiron J.M. Brochier J. Liautard J. Merlin M. Clement C. Morel-Foumier B. Lu Z.Y. Mannoni P. Sany J. Bataille R.

But then the symptoms returned because the high stability of antibodies in plasma increased the level of IL-6, which normally is cleared from the circulation within several minutes(32Castell J.V. Klapproth J. Gross V. Walter E. Andus T. Snyers L. Content J. Heinrich P.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). No beneficial effect can be expected by using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6Rα(33Sato K. Tsuchiya M. Saldenha J. Koishihara Y. Ohsugi Y. Kishimoto T. Bendig M.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 851-856PubMed Google Scholar). A natural soluble form of this receptor subunit together with IL-6 has been shown to behave as an agonist(19Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Neutralizing antibodies could lead to an accumulation of the soluble IL-6Rα in the plasma. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the signal transduction protein gp130, which is also part of the receptor of leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, and IL-11(34Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), could provoke a lot of side effects in vivo. We therefore believe that the construction of IL-6 receptor antagonists is the most promising strategy to neutralize IL-6 activity in vivo. We have obtained such an IL-6 receptor antagonist, which can completely inhibit human IL-6 activity on human myeloma cells. The availability of such an antagonist may offer an approach to specifically inhibit IL-6 activity in vivo. We thank Dr. P. Freyer for the synthesis of oligonucleotides, Christa Gerlach for help with the cell culture, Marcel Robertz for excellent assistance with the artwork, and Manfred Dewor for help with the amino acid analysis."

In HCO3− buffer, glucose produced a steady-state increase in pHi that required metabolism of the sugar and was concentration-dependent between 0 and 10 mM (Km∼ 5 mM) before plateauing at a maximum value of ∼0.2 pH units. In HEPES buffer, glucose concentrations above 7 mM caused an initial rise followed by a secondary decrease and an eventual return to about initial values. Inhibition of Ca2+ influx had little effect on the pHi changes produced by glucose in HCO3− medium, but unmasked an alkalinizing effect in HEPES buffer. Raising cytoplasmic Ca2+ by 30 mM potassium caused a larger acidification in HEPES than in HCO3− buffer, but a subsequent rise in glucose now increased pHi in both types of buffer. In the presence of 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS; inhibitor of HCO3−/Cl− exchange), the effect of glucose on pHi in HCO3− buffer became similar to that in HEPES buffer. After inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger by dimethylamiloride, glucose produced a marked and sustained fall in pHi in HEPES buffer. A similar fall was seen in HCO3− buffer only when DIDS and dimethylamiloride were present together. However, if Ca2+ influx was prevented when both exchangers were blocked, glucose increased pHi. In conclusion, the metabolism of glucose tends to increase pHi in B-cells, whereas the concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i exerts an acidifying action. In HEPES buffer, this acidifying effect of Ca2+ is offset by the operation of the Na+/H+ exchanger. In physiological HCO3− buffer, the activity of the HCO3−/Cl− exchanger overcompensates and leads to an increase in pHi.

The mechanisms by which it stimulates insulin release involve regulation of a number of ionic events through changes in B-cell metabolism(1Henquin J.-C. Kahn C.R. Weir G.C.

The major events can be summarized as follows. Glucose entry in B-cells is followed by an acceleration of glycolysis and glucose oxidation, which generates signals that close ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the plasma membrane. The resulting decrease in K+ conductance leads to depolarization with subsequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ influx through these channels increases, causing a rise in free cytoplasmic calcium [Ca2+]i, 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]ifree cytoplasmic calciumpHicytoplasmic pHBCECF2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidDMA5-N,N-dimethylamiloride. which serves as the triggering signal for the exocytosis of insulin granules. The metabolism of glucose also augments insulin release by amplifying the effectiveness of [Ca2+]i on the secretory machinery(7Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). free cytoplasmic calcium cytoplasmic pH 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid 5-N,N-dimethylamiloride. It has been speculated that protons might be one of the signals produced by glucose metabolism and that changes in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) in B-cells might influence certain steps of stimulus-secretion coupling(8Pace C.S.

Therefore, several studies have examined the effect of glucose on B-cell pHi, but rather contradictory results have been obtained probably because of the use of different preparations (whole islets, dispersed islet cells, tumoral cell lines), of different methods of pHi measurement, and of different buffers. The weight of the evidence, however, indicates that glucose produces a slight alkalinization of B-cells(12Lindström P. Sehlin J. Biochem.

The current hypothesis that it is brought about by an activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger with overcorrection of the acidifying action of glucose metabolism (16Juntti-Berggren L. Arkhammar P.

In this study, intact pancreatic islets from normal mice were loaded with the pH-sensitive dye BCECF and examined by microspectrofluorometry. Our aim was to monitor pHi in islet cells over longer periods of time than in previous studies, during stimulation by various concentrations of glucose in the presence and absence of HCO3−, Ca2+, and inhibitors of the Na+/H+ and HCO3−/Cl− exchangers. A bicarbonate-buffered medium (HCO3− medium) and a HEPES-buffered medium (HEPES medium) were used. The HCO3− medium contained 120 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 24 mM NaHCO3 and was gassed with O2/CO2 (94:6) to maintain pH at 7.4. The HEPES medium contained 135 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KOH, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES and was gassed with O2. Its pH was adjusted to 7.4 at 37°C with NaOH. When the KCl concentration was raised to 30 mM, the concentration of NaCl was decreased accordingly. In Ca2+-free solutions, MgCl2 was substituted for CaCl2, and 50 μM EGTA was added. All solutions contained 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Boehringer Mannheim). DIDS and DMA (Sigma) were added from 133 and 100 mM stock solutions in Me2SO, respectively. All experiments were performed with islets isolated by collagenase digestion of the pancreata of fed female NMRI mice. The isolation procedure was carried out in HCO3− buffer containing 10 mM glucose and supplemented with 5 mM HEPES. After isolation, the islets were cultured for 18-48 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mM glucose(17Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured islets were first loaded with BCECF during 40 min of incubation at 37°C in 2 ml of medium supplemented with 0.5 μM BCECF acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) added from a 0.5 mM stock solution in Me2SO. The medium had the same composition (HCO3− or HEPES) as that to be used during the experiment and always contained 3 mM glucose. Loaded islets were then transferred into a temperature-controlled perifusion chamber (Applied Imaging, Sunderland, United Kingdom) with a bottom made of a glass coverslip. They were held in place by gentle suction with a glass micropipette and perifused at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. The dead space of the system corresponded to 2 min and has been corrected for in the figures. Perifusion solutions were kept at 37°C in a water bath, and the temperature controller ensured a temperature of 37.2 ± 0.3°C close to the islet as monitored by a thermistor placed near the tissue. The perifusion chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) used in the epifluorescence mode with a ×20 objective. BCECF was successively excited at 440 and 490 nm by means of two narrow band-pass filters mounted on a computer-controlled motorized filter wheel placed in front of a 75-watt xenon lamp. A dichroic mirror centered at 510 nm reflected the UV light to the perifusion chamber and transmitted the emitted fluorescence, which then passed through another filter of 535 nm. Fluorescent images were obtained with a CCD video camera (Photonic Science Ltd., Tunbridge Wells, UK) at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels. They were then digitized into 256 gray levels and analyzed with the MagiCal system (Applied Imaging). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, eight consecutive 40-ms frames were averaged at each wavelength before ratioing. The time interval between successive series of 440-490 images varied according to the length of the experiment, being 3.5 s over 15 min and 7.0 s over 30 min. Hence, the period of exposure to the excitatory light was the same irrespective of the duration of the experiment. The pHi was calculated from an in vitro calibration curve constructed from the ratio values obtained by perifusing solutions of different pH values (ranging between 5 and 9.5) containing 1.8 μM BCECF-free acid (the concentration giving a similar intensity of signal as that of BCECF-loaded islets). The medium had the following composition: 136 mM KCl, 4 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES. Bovine serum albumin was omitted to prevent its precipitation at high pH values. After preincubation, cultured islets were transferred, in batches of 20, into a previously described perifusion system(18Henquin J.-C. Nature. 1978; 271: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Insulin was measured (19Henquin J.-C. Lambert A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 231: 713-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the effluent fractions collected every minute. The results of pHi measurements are presented as traces that are the means ± S.E. for the indicated number of islets. Several islets from the same culture were tested with the same protocol, but each protocol was tested on at least three different cultures. For insulin release, each protocol was repeated four to five times with islets from different cultures. The statistical significance between means was assessed by analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test or by unpaired t test when only two groups were compared. Basal islet cell pHi values (in 3 mM glucose) averaged 6.98 ± 0.01 (n = 189) and 6.95 ± 0.01 (n = 134) in HCO3− and HEPES buffers, respectively. This small, statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference was observed in all experimental series, as will be seen in the figures. It is, however, important to emphasize that these values correspond to steady-state pHi. Sudden omission of HCO3−/CO2 by changing to HEPES buffer was followed by a rapid increase in pHi before the secondary decrease below initial values. Conversely, changing from HEPES buffer to HCO3− buffer initially caused a transient acidification (data not shown). Qualitatively similar observations have been made with single mouse B-cells(20Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When the islets were perifused throughout with HCO3− medium containing 3 mM glucose, pHi only marginally decreased with time. A larger fall occurred when glucose was omitted from the medium (Fig. 1A). In contrast, raising the concentration of glucose from 3 to 7 mM and above provoked an increase in pHi that consistently displayed a biphasic pattern (Fig. 1, B and C). A rapid increase was followed by a small transient decrease and then by a larger sustained increase. Because the small decrease varied in size and timing, the biphasicity of the pHi change is sometimes masked by pooling results obtained in different islets (e.g.Fig. 4).Figure 4:Influence of the omission of extracellular Ca2+ on pHi in mouse islets. BCECF-loaded islets were perifused with HCO3− medium (solidline) or HEPES medium (brokenline). The concentration of glucose (G) was increased from 3 to 15 mM after 5 min. Ca2+ was omitted, and 50 μM EGTA added between 15 and 25 min. The traces are the means ± S.E. for 9 and 10 islets, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the absence of HCO3−, the decrease in pHi that followed the omission of glucose from the perifusion medium (Fig. 1A) was again larger (p < 0.01) than that occurring spontaneously when the islets were perifused with a medium containing 3 mM glucose throughout. A small monophasic rise in pHi was observed on the change from 3 to 7 mM glucose (Fig. 1B). When the glucose concentration was raised to 10 mM and above, islet pHi changed in three phases: a transient rise was followed by a decrease and an eventual return to about initial values (Fig. 1C). Fig. 2 illustrates the concentration dependence of the glucose-induced rise in islet pHi. The measurements were made at steady state, 15 min after the change from 3 mM glucose to a medium containing another glucose concentration. They are presented as absolute pHi values (Fig. 2A) or as the change in pHi within the same islet (Fig. 2B). In a HCO3− buffer, the relationship was hyperbolic with a Km of ∼5 mM and a maximum at ∼15 mM glucose. In the absence of HCO3−, the relationship was more complex. pHi increased between 0 and 7 mM glucose, while the size of the pHi rise became smaller at higher glucose concentrations (Fig. 2B). Because of the distinct effects of high glucose concentrations on pHi in islets perifused with HCO3− or HEPES medium, we checked that the discrepancy was not due to local alkalinization of the HCO3− medium by CO2 loss in the open perifusion chamber. In the first series, the flow rate of the HCO3− solution was doubled, but this did not prevent 15 mM glucose from increasing pHi by 0.10 ± 0.02 units compared with 0.11 ± 0.01 units at the usual flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. In the second series, 5 mM HEPES was added to the HCO3− buffer. Under these conditions, 15 mM glucose still increased pHi by 0.10 ± 0.01 units. These values are not statistically different. These experiments were done in a HCO3− medium only. 3-O-Methylglucose is transported in B-cells like glucose, but is not metabolized(21Zawalich W.S. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The addition of a 12 mM concentration of this analogue to a medium containing 3 mM glucose did not influence pHi (data not shown). When the concentration of glucose was raised from 3 to 15 mM in a medium supplemented with 20 mM mannoheptulose, an inhibitor of glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase(21Zawalich W.S. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), practically no increase in pHi occurred (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, the effect of glucose was reproduced by the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetone (Fig. 1E). Ketoisocaproic acid, a leucine derivative that is metabolized only in the mitochondria, produced a biphasic increase in pHi similar to that caused by glucose (data not shown). Finally, the rise in pHi brought about by glucose was reversed by 2 mM azide, a mitochondrial poison (data not shown). Glucose metabolism in B-cells leads to closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the plasma membrane, depolarization, stimulation of Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and a rise in cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i. Hypoglycemic sulfonylureas, like tolbutamide, trigger the same sequence of events without changing B-cell metabolism(3Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 4Cook D.L. Taborsky G.J. Rifkin H. Porte D. Diabetes Mellitus: Theory and Practice. 4th Ed.

In contrast to a rise in glucose concentration, the addition of 200 μM tolbutamide to a HCO3− medium containing 3 mM glucose decreased islet pHi by 0.05 ± 0.004 units (n = 9). Tolbutamide (1 mM) has previously been reported to lower B-cell pHi in HEPES buffer(20Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Diazoxide opens ATP-sensitive K+ channels without interfering with metabolism and thereby prevents glucose from depolarizing B-cells and from increasing [Ca2+]i(17Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). When the concentration of glucose was increased from 3 to 15 mM in the presence of diazoxide, a sustained rise in pHi was observed not only in HCO3− buffer, but also in HEPES buffer (Fig. 3A). When the B-cell membrane was depolarized and cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i was increased by 30 mM potassium in the presence of 3 mM glucose and diazoxide (7Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), a fall in pHi occurred (Fig. 3B). This fall was much larger in HEPES than in HCO3− buffer. A subsequent rise in the glucose concentration to 15 mM was followed by a sustained rise in pHi in both types of solutions (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, the rise in glucose does not affect steady-state [Ca2+]i(7Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Omission of extracellular Ca2+ during stimulation with 15 mM glucose markedly lowers [Ca2+]i in islet cells(17Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Theler J.-M. Mollard P. Guérineau N. Vacher P. Pralong W.F. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18110-18117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This did not result in any major change in pHi when the islets were perifused with HCO3− buffer, but caused a marked alkalinization in HEPES buffer (Fig. 4). Ca2+ reintroduction into the medium was followed by an acidification only in HEPES buffer. Inhibiting the Na+/H+ exchanger with 40 μM DMA in HCO3− buffer had no significant effect on pHi in the presence of 3 mM glucose and did not interfere with the alkalinizing effect of 15 mM glucose (Fig. 5A). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with 100 μM DMA. The rise in pHi brought about by 15 mM glucose amounted to 0.12 ± 0.02 and 0.09 ± 0.02 in the presence of 40 and 100 μM DMA, respectively. These values are not significantly different (p = 0.3) from those obtained in the absence of DMA (0.11 ± 0.01). In HEPES medium, when no HCO3−/Cl− exchanger is operative, DMA caused a decrease in pHi in the presence of 3 mM glucose (Fig. 5A). On raising the concentration of glucose to 15 mM, there occurred a transient rise in pHi, as that seen under control conditions, but the subsequent fall in pHi was of a greater magnitude and showed no sign of reversing as observed over the same time course in the absence of DMA (compare with Fig. 1C). As expected, DIDS did not affect pHi in HEPES buffer, when no HCO3−/Cl− exchanger is operative. DIDS was also without effect in HCO3− buffer containing 3 mM glucose, but profoundly modified the changes in islet pHi induced by 15 mM glucose (Fig. 5B). These became similar to those observed in HEPES medium without DIDS (compare with Fig. 1C). The combination of DMA and DIDS produced essentially similar effects in HCO3− and HEPES buffers (Fig. 5C). There occurred a decrease in pHi in 3 mM glucose, and the rise in glucose concentration to 15 mM produced a small initial increase in pHi followed by a marked decrease. Finally, we evaluated the contribution of [Ca2+]i to the fall in pHi caused by glucose when both Na+/H+ and HCO3−/Cl− exchangers are inhibited. The [Ca2+]i rise normally produced by glucose was prevented by diazoxide (17Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by blocking Ca2+ channels with nimodipine(24Warnotte C. Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.-C. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). When diazoxide was present in HCO3− medium supplemented with DIDS and DMA or in HEPES medium containing DMA, pHi no longer decreased, but increased following the rise in the glucose concentration from 3 to 15 mM (Fig. 6). An increase in pHi was also produced by 15 mM glucose in HEPES medium supplemented with DMA and nimodipine (data not shown). The acidification of islet cells, produced by glucose when the Na+/H+ and HCO3−/Cl− exchangers are inhibited, can thus be ascribed to the rise in [Ca2+]i that glucose causes. Raising the glucose concentration from 3 to 15 mM in HCO3− medium triggered a rapid increase in insulin release followed by a sustained second phase (Fig. 7A). In HEPES buffer, the increase in release was delayed and displayed a monophasic pattern. At steady state, however, the rate of insulin release was similar in both types of buffer. These results differ somewhat from those obtained previously with freshly isolated rat islets, from which insulin release was decreased during both phases when the glucose stimulation was applied in the absence of HCO3−(19Henquin J.-C. Lambert A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 231: 713-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amiloride has been reported to decrease or increase insulin release from rat islets(8Pace C.S. Tarvin J.T. Smith J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: E3-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Biden T.J. Janjic D. Wollheim C.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C207-C213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lebrun P. van Ganse E. Juvent M. Deleers M. Herchuelz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 886: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and DIDS has been reported to decrease it(8Pace C.S. Tarvin J.T. Smith J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: E3-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, DMA potentiated and DIDS decreased glucose-induced insulin release in a similar way in HCO3− and HEPES buffers (Fig. 7, B and C). Although unknown effects of the pharmacological agents on the releasing process are possible, no correlation can thus be found between the changes in pHi and those of insulin release. Intact pancreatic islets, which contain ∼80% insulin-secreting B-cells, were loaded with BCECF and perifused for 25-30 min with both HCO3− and HEPES buffers to study the transient and sustained changes in pHi brought about by glucose. In previous studies, static systems, a single type of buffer, and/or dispersed pancreatic cells have generally been used for relatively short periods of time(11Best L. Flatt P.R. Nutrient Regulation of Insulin Secretion. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 157-171Google Scholar). The existence of Na+/H+ exchangers in islet cells is established, but the presence and possible function of HCO3−/Cl− exchangers are less clear (review in (11Best L. Flatt P.R. Nutrient Regulation of Insulin Secretion. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 157-171Google Scholar)). Experiments using the ammonium prepulse technique (27Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) showed that both types of exchangers contribute to the recovery from an imposed acid load in mouse B-cells. 2R. M. Shepherd and J.-C. Henquin, unpublished data. This study further shows that both the Na+/H+ and HCO3−/Cl− exchangers also participate in the control of basal pHi. When the islets were perifused with HCO3− medium containing 3 mM glucose, pHi was little affected by separate blockade of the exchangers. A stronger acidification occurred when DMA and DIDS were combined in HCO3− buffer or when DMA was added to HEPES buffer, in which DIDS alone was without effect, as expected. We therefore felt it important to compare the effects of high glucose concentrations in HCO3− buffer (when both exchangers are operative) and in HEPES buffer (when the HCO3−/Cl− exchanger is not operative). In physiological HCO3− buffer, glucose produced a biphasic increase in islet cell pHi. The dose-response relationship was hyperbolic with a Km of ∼5 mM. A similar relationship has been observed when pHi was measured using the 5,5-dimethyl[2-14C]oxazolidine-2,4-dione technique(12Lindström P. Sehlin J. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the contention that an acceleration of islet cell metabolism is essential for the alkalinizing effect of glucose. First, the nonmetabolized 3-O-methylglucose (21Zawalich W.S. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) did not affect pHi. Second, inhibition of glucose phosphorylation with mannoheptulose (21Zawalich W.S. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) prevented the effect of glucose on pHi, as already shown by others(12Lindström P. Sehlin J. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Third, inhibition of ATP production by mitochondria reversed the effect of glucose. Fourth, the effect of glucose was mimicked by dihydroxyacetone and by ketoisocaproic acid. Glucose metabolism in B-cells leads to closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, membrane depolarization, and rise in [Ca2+]i. This study shows that the alkalinizing effect of glucose does not depend on closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and B-cell depolarization because it persisted when both events were prevented by diazoxide (5Henquin J.-C. Debuyser A. Drews G. Plant T.D. Flatt P.R. Nutrient Regulation of Insulin Secretion. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 173-191Google Scholar, 22Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and was not reproduced by tolbutamide, which depolarizes B-cells by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels(5Henquin J.-C. Debuyser A. Drews G. Plant T.D. Flatt P.R. Nutrient Regulation of Insulin Secretion. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 173-191Google Scholar, 22Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The alkalinization is also independent of the membrane potential itself because it occurred when glucose was added to both polarized B-cells (4.8 mM potassium + diazoxide) and depolarized B-cells (30 mM potassium + diazoxide). Finally, the rise in pHi produced by glucose is not secondary to the [Ca2+]i rise because it occurred under conditions where glucose is known not to increase [Ca2+]i (4.8 mM potassium + diazoxide) (17Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to only transiently decrease an already elevated [Ca2+]i (30 mM potassium + diazoxide)(7Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Omission of extracellular Ca2+ was also without significant effect. It should be noted, however, that the rise in pHi brought about by 15 mM glucose did not display a biphasic pattern when glucose could not also raise [Ca2+]i. Recent experiments have shown that the rise in [Ca2+]i lags slightly behind the rise in pHi in single B-cells(28Juntti-Berggren L. Civelek V.N. Berggren P.-O. Schultz V. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14391-14395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further experiments will be necessary to determine whether it is involved in this biphasic change. We also wish to point out that, before starting the pH experiments, the quality of all islet preparations was assessed by measuring glucose-induced [Ca2+]i changes. Oscillations in [Ca2+]i similar to those previously reported (17Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were consistently seen. On the other hand, no oscillations in pHi were detected even when the data acquisition rate was identical to that at which [Ca2+]i oscillations could easily be identified.2 We cannot exclude the possibility that pHi oscillations escaped detection with our technique or could not be seen in a multicellular preparation because they are asynchronous in different cells. These effects were substantially different from those produced in physiological HCO3− buffer. Glucose also dose-dependently increased pHi, but the maximum effect was reached at ∼7 mM. The smaller effect of higher concentrations may be ascribed to an acidifying action of [Ca2+]i for the following reasons. Omission of extracellular Ca2+ from a medium containing 15 mM glucose, which results in a fall in [Ca2+]i(17Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Theler J.-M. Mollard P. Guérineau N. Vacher P. Pralong W.F. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18110-18117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was followed by a prompt rise in pHi, which attained values similar to those measured in HCO3− buffer. Moreover, when the glucose-induced [Ca2+]i rise was prevented with diazoxide, a rapid sustained alkalinization was caused by 15 mM glucose. This alkalinization also occurred in the presence of high potassium and diazoxide, when glucose does not increase the already elevated [Ca2+]i(7Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Finally, the relationship between glucose concentration and pHi in HEPES and HCO3− buffers started to diverge above 7 mM, i.e. above the threshold for membrane depolarization and stimulation of Ca2+ influx(1Henquin J.-C. Kahn C.R. Weir G.C. Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus. 13th Ed. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia1994: 56-80Google Scholar, 4Cook D.L. Taborsky G.J. Rifkin H. Porte D. Diabetes Mellitus: Theory and Practice. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1990: 89-103Google Scholar, 5Henquin J.-C. Debuyser A. Drews G. Plant T.D. Flatt P.R. Nutrient Regulation of Insulin Secretion. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 173-191Google Scholar). The stronger acidifying effect of [Ca2+]i in HEPES compared with HCO3− buffer is also evidenced by the larger fall in pHi produced by 30 mM potassium in the former buffer. Our results therefore show that the genuine effect of glucose is similar in the absence or presence of HCO3−. The difference in the pHi changes results from the masking of the alkalinization by a strong [Ca2+]i-induced acidification that is normally prevented by the HCO3−/Cl− exchanger. Further support for this interpretation is provided by the experiments using blockers of the exchangers (see below). That the HCO3−/Cl− exchanger is somehow activated in the presence of high glucose is compatible with the observations that glucose stimulates HCO3− uptake by (29Deleers M. Lebrun P. Malaisse W.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Cl− efflux from (30Sehlin J. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E501-E508PubMed Google Scholar) islet cells and that a fraction of this stimulation is Ca2+-dependent, even though the interpretation of this dependence is not straightforward. DMA is a potent and relatively selective blocker of the Na+/H+ exchanger. At a concentration of 20 μM, it blocks the exchanger completely in other systems (31Vigne P. Frelin C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Lazdunski M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 131-136PubMed Google Scholar, 32L'Allemain G. Franchi A. Cragoe Jr., E. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4313-4319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 40 μM DMA did not prevent 15 mM glucose from increasing pHi in islets perifused with physiological HCO3− buffer. Even at 100 μM, DMA reduced the effect of glucose by no more than 20%, yet 40 μM DMA was very effective in HEPES buffer or when combined with DIDS in HCO3− buffer. Under these conditions, glucose provoked a small rise in pHi followed by a marked acidification. The effectiveness of DMA is also supported by its strong effects on recovery from an acid load in the presence of DIDS or in HEPES buffer.2 We therefore cannot support the previous conclusion that the alkalinizing effect of glucose is caused by a stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger(16Juntti-Berggren L. Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Rorsman P. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23537-23541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggestion was primarily based on the observation that glucose decreased mouse islet cell pHi in HEPES buffer containing ethylisopropylamiloride. This observation is confirmed here, but we also show that the acidifying effect of glucose does not occur in physiological HCO3− buffer and, as discussed below, can be explained differently. On the other hand, we have no explanation for the observation that glucose provoked a small decrease in rat islet pHi when 100 μM amiloride, a much weaker inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger(31Vigne P. Frelin C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Lazdunski M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 131-136PubMed Google Scholar, 32L'Allemain G. Franchi A. Cragoe Jr., E. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4313-4319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was present in HCO3− buffer(13Deleers M. Lebrun P. Malaisse W.J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1985; 17: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whether this reflects a species difference or a limitation of the technique used in these early measurements is unclear. The important role of the HCO3−/Cl− exchanger is strikingly demonstrated by the effects of DIDS. This blocker of the exchanger (33Cabantchik Z.I. Knauf P.A. Rothstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 289-302Google Scholar, 34Frelin C. Vigne P. Ladoux A. Lazdunski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) was without effect in HEPES buffer, when the exchanger is not functioning because of the absence of HCO3−. On the other hand, in HCO3− buffer supplemented with DIDS, the response to glucose became similar to that occurring in HEPES buffer. After a transient rise, pHi decreased slightly before returning to levels similar to those measured before the concentration of glucose was raised. This stabilization of pHi at steady state is obviously achieved by the Na+/H+ exchanger. Thus, when both exchangers were inhibited, either by combination of the pharmacological blockers or by addition of DMA alone to HEPES buffer, the initial small increase in pHi produced by 15 mM glucose was followed by a marked acidification. To determine whether this acidification is a proper effect of glucose or is the consequence of the rise in [Ca2+]i, the latter was prevented with diazoxide or nimodipine. Under these conditions, glucose increased pHi. It is thus clear that the genuine effect of glucose is to increase pHi, not to decrease it, when the Na+/H+ and HCO3−/Cl− exchangers are not operative. The decrease in pHi is caused by the rise in [Ca2+]i that glucose also produces. It has been often stated that increased cellular metabolism generates acidic products, but it has generally been overlooked that ATP synthesis consumes protons, whereas ATP hydrolysis is the predominant source of intracellular acid load(35Busa W.B. Nuccitelli R. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R409-R438PubMed Google Scholar). An acceleration of aerobic metabolism with an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio is usually accompanied by an alkalinization. We suggest that a similar mechanism explains the increase in islet cell pHi that occurs upon stimulation with glucose. The possibility that changes in B-cell pHi play a role in stimulus-secretion coupling has aroused much interest and prompted several, sometimes divergent hypotheses, which have been reviewed elsewhere(11Best L. Flatt P.R. Nutrient Regulation of Insulin Secretion. Portland Press Ltd., London1992: 157-171Google Scholar). Our experiments show that, during steady-state stimulation with glucose, similar rates of insulin secretion are measured in the face of sometimes substantial differences in pHi. With the reservation that pHi might exert opposite effects on different steps of stimulus-secretion coupling, this study does not support the hypothesis that the changes in pHi play a significant role in the B-cell secretory response to glucose."

A ClpA variant (referred to as ClpAT) carrying threonine in place of the 169th methionine has recently been shown to be highly soluble but indistinguishable from the wild-type, 84-kDa ClpA in its ability to hydrolyze ATP and to support the casein-degrading activity of ClpP. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate mutations in either of the two ATP-binding sites of ClpAT (i.e. to replace the Lys220 or Lys501 with Thr). ClpAT/K220T hydrolyzed ATP and supported the ClpP-mediated proteolysis 10-50% as well as ClpAT depending on ATP concentration, while ClpAT/K501T was unable to cleave ATP or to support the proteolysis. Without ATP, ClpAT and both of its mutant forms behaved as trimeric molecules as analyzed by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column. With 0.5 mM ATP, ClpAT and ClpAT/K501T became hexamers, but ClpAT/K220T remained trimeric. With 2 mM ATP, however, ClpAT/K220T also behaved as a hexamer. These results suggest that the first ATP-binding site of ClpA is responsible for hexamer formation, while the second is essential for ATP hydrolysis. When trimeric ClpAT/K220T was incubated with the same amount of hexameric ClpAT/K501T (i.e. at 0.5 mM ATP) and then subjected to gel filtration as above, a majority of ClpAT/K220T ran together with ClpAT/K501T as hexameric molecules. Furthermore, ClpAT/K501T in the mixture strongly inhibited the ability of ClpAT/K220T to cleave ATP and to support the ClpP-mediated proteolysis. Similar results were obtained in the presence of 2 mM ATP and also with the mixture with ClpAT. On the other hand, the ATPase activity of the mixture of ClpAT and ClpAT/K220T was significantly higher than the sum of that of each protein, particularly in the presence of 2 mM ATP, although its ability to support the proteolysis by ClpP remained unchanged. These results suggest that a rapid exchange of the subunits, possibly as a trimeric unit, occurs between the ClpAT proteins in the presence of ATP and leads to the formation of mixed hexameric molecules.

Protease Ti, also called Clp, consists of two different multimeric components, both of which are required for ATP-dependent proteolysis in Escherichia coli(1Chung C.H.

While component A (ClpA) contains the ATP-hydrolyzing sites, component P (ClpP), which is a heat shock protein(5Kroh H.E. Simon L.D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6026-6034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contains the serine active sites for proteolysis. The isolated ClpA shows protein-activated ATPase activity, which in the reconstituted enzyme is linked to protein breakdown. The clpA gene has recently been shown to contain dual initiation sites for translation and therefore to encode two polypeptides with different sizes (i.e. 84- and 65-kDa subunits), of which the smaller polypeptide is derived from the internal start site(6Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29468-29473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, mutagenesis of the 5′-end AUG codon results in an exclusive synthesis of the 65-kDa protein, while mutation at the internal 169th AUG codon (Met) to ACG (Thr) produces only the 84-kDa protein (henceforth referred to as ClpAT). In addition, the purified ClpAT has been found to be highly soluble and to show little or no nonspecific interaction with gel filtration matrices, unlike the wild-type, 84-kDa ClpA(7Hwang B.J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, ClpAT is indistinguishable from the 84-kDa ClpA in its ability to cleave ATP and to support the ClpP-mediated protein degradation(6Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29468-29473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated ClpAT behaves as a trimer in the absence of ATP but as a hexameric complex in its presence(6Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol.

ClpA is a member of a family of highly conserved proteins that have two regions of particularly high homology, each of which contains a consensus sequence for an adenine nucleotide binding(10Gottesman S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7886-7893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gottesman S. Squires C. Pichersky E. Carrington M. Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Dalryple B.

Both of the ATP-binding regions are characterized by the presence of Gly-X2-Gly-X-Gly-Lys-Thr elements, of which the lysine residue interacts with one of the phosphoryl group of the bound nucleotide(12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay J.N. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar, 13Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). hsp104 is also a member of the highly conserved protein family and contains the two consensus ATP-binding sites(14Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzer J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The isolated hsp104 exists predominantly as monomer or dimer in the absence of ATP but oligomerizes to form a hexameric complex in its presence(15Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mutational analysis has revealed that both of the ATP-binding sites of hsp104 are necessary for its in vivo function, such as tolerance to high temperatures and high concentrations of ethanol(14Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzer J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the second ATP-binding site is primarily responsible for the oligomerization of hsp104(15Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine the structural and functional relationship of ClpA, we generated two mutant forms of ClpAT, in which the Lys220 or Lys501 residue in the ATP-binding sites was replaced with Thr, and examined the effects of the mutations on the ATPase activity of ClpAT and on its ability to support the ATP-dependent proteolysis by ClpP. We also examined whether any of the mutations affected the hexamer formation of ClpAT in the presence of ATP. In addition, we examined the effects of the ClpAT mutant proteins on the structure and function of ClpAT. Construction of the Bluescript KS+ plasmid carrying the clpA gene and replacement of the 169th AUG codon (methionine) with ACG codon (threonine) in the gene were performed as described previously(6Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29468-29473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant plasmid was referred to as pClpAT. An E. coli clpA null mutant SG21118 (clpA319::Δkan) that was originally constructed by Drs. S. Gottesman and M. R. Maurizi (National Institutes of Health) was obtained from Dr. A. L. Goldberg (Harvard Medical School). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 384A). [3H] Methyl casein was prepared as described(16Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 246: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Single-stranded, uracil-containing phagemids of pClpAT were prepared by infecting E. coli strain CJ236 (dut−ung−) with helper phage R408(17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to replace Lys220 of ClpAT with Thr (primer 1, 5′-GGTGTCGGTACCACCGCGATTG-3′ or Lys501 with Thr (primer 2, GGGGTCGGGACCACAGAGGTGA) and to generate new restriction sites for facilitating mutant isolation. The mutated nucleotides are indicated by boldface letters, and the newly created restriction sites for KpnI and AvaII, respectively, in primers 1 and 2, are underlined. The primers were annealed to the template DNA and extended(18Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The double-stranded mismatch plasmids were then transformed, and the mutated vectors were confirmed by restriction and DNA sequence analysis (data not shown). ClpP was purified as described previously(8Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification of ClpAT and its mutant forms, appropriate E. coli cells (10 g) in 50 ml of 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer (pH 6.5) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% (w/v) glycerol were disrupted by French press at 14,000 p.s.i. and centrifuged for 2 h at 120,000 × g(6Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29468-29473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatants were dialyzed against the same buffer and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (1.5 × 5 cm). After extensively washing the column with the buffer, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1-0.4 M phosphate. Aliquots of the fractions were electrophoresed in 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels containing SDS, and proteins in the gels were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. The fractions containing the 84-kDa proteins were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 M NaCl, and 20% glycerol. Each of the protein samples was then chromatographed on a heparin-agarose column (1 × 8 cm) equilibrated with the Tris buffer. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2-0.4 M NaCl, and the fractions containing the 84-kDa proteins were pooled and kept frozen at −70°C for further use. ATPase activity was assayed by incubating the reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) containing appropriate amounts of the mutated ClpA proteins and ATP, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA(19Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubating the mixtures at 37°C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.1 ml of 1% SDS. The inorganic phosphates released were then determined as described (20Ames B. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). Protein degradation was assayed by incubating similar reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) containing [3H]casein for 1 h at 37°C(8Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the incubation, radioactivity released into trichloroacetic acid-soluble products was counted using a scintillation counter. Proteins were assayed by their absorbance at 280 nm or by the dye-binding method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1The abbreviation used is: BSAbovine serum albumin. as a standard. bovine serum albumin. To investigate the importance of the two ATP-binding sites for ClpA function, either Lys220 or Lys501 in ClpAT was substituted with threonine by site-directed mutagenesis. The pClpAT plasmids carrying the mutations were transformed into E. coli clpA null mutant cells, and two mutant forms of ClpAT (ClpAT/K220T and ClpAT/K501T) were purified from the cells to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1). To determine the effects of the mutations on ATP hydrolysis, the purified proteins were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, ClpAT/K220T hydrolyzed ATP 10-50% as well as ClpAT, depending on ATP concentration. However, casein was still capable of stimulating the ATPase activity of ClpAT/K220T by about 2-fold, similar to that of ClpAT, indicating that the mutation shows little or no effect on the interaction of casein with the mutant protein. Upon double-reciprocal plot of the data obtained in the presence of casein, the Km for ATP was estimated to be 0.21 and 1.1 mM for ClpAT and ClpAT/K220T, respectively. In addition, the Vmax for ATP cleavage by ClpAT was estimated to be 0.51 nmol/min, and that by ClpAT/K220T was 0.26 nmol/min. In the absence of casein, the Vmax for each of the proteins was reduced to about one-half of the values seen in its presence while the Km values remained unchanged. Therefore, the mutation at the first of the two ATP-binding sites reduces not only the affinity of ClpAT to ATP but also its Vmax. On the other hand, ClpAT/K501T showed little or no ATPase activity regardless of whether casein was present (Fig. 2C). Thus, it appears that the ATPase activity of ClpA depends more strictly on the second ATP-binding site than the first. To determine the effects of the mutations on the ability of ClpAT in supporting the proteolytic activity of ClpP, the mutant proteins were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. Similar to the effects on ATP hydrolysis, ClpAT/K220T supported the ClpP-mediated casein hydrolysis 10-50% as well as ClpAT, depending on ATP concentration (Fig. 3). On the other hand, ClpAT/K501T, which is almost completely devoid of ATPase activity, was not at all able to support the casein hydrolysis by ClpP. These results support the previous finding that ATP hydrolysis is essential for protein degradation by protease Ti(7Hwang B.J. Park W.J. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5550-5554Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since ATP has been shown to induce hexamer formation of ClpA(6Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29468-29473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Maurizi M.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we examined which of the two ATP-binding sites is involved in the oligomerization. The purified ClpAT and its mutant forms were each subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column in the presence and absence of ATP. Because extents of the decrease in ATP cleavage by the mutation in the first site were dependent on ATP concentration (see Fig. 2), the gel filtration analysis was performed in the absence and presence of about one-half and twice the Km for ATP of ClpAT/K220T (i.e. 0.5 and 2 mM, respectively). As shown in Fig. 4(opensymbols), all of the ClpAT and its mutant forms ran as trimeric molecules without ATP. In the presence of 0.5 mM ATP, ClpAT/K501T as well as ClpAT behaved as hexameric molecules, while ClpAT/K220T remained trimeric. Both ClpAT/K501T lacking ATPase activity and ClpAT also behaved as hexamers in the presence of ADP (data not shown). Thus, hexamer formation of ClpA requires binding of the adenine nucleotides but not their hydrolysis. In the presence of 2 mM ATP, however, ClpAT/K220T also became a hexameric molecule. These results suggest that the first of the two ATP-binding sites in ClpAT is responsible for the hexamer formation and that the inability of ClpAT/K220T in hexamer formation at the low ATP concentration may be due to its reduced affinity to ATP. In order to determine whether the mutation in the first ATP-binding site may also influence the interaction of ClpAT with ClpP, ATP hydrolysis by ClpAT/K220T was assayed in the presence of ClpP, casein, or both, and 2 mM ATP. In the absence of casein, ClpP increased the extent of ATP hydrolysis by ClpAT/K220T by about 20%, while the same protein reduced that by ClpAT by about 30% (Table 1). In the presence of casein, however, ClpP increased the ATPase activities of both ClpAT/K220T and ClpAT to a greater extent than without casein. To clarify further this differential effect of ClpP, the ATPase activities of ClpAT and ClpAT/K220T were measured in the presence of increasing amounts of ClpP. In the absence of casein, ClpP increased the ATPase activity of K220T in a dose-dependent manner until a maximal effect was reached, unlike that of ClpAT (Fig. 5A). In the presence of casein, however, ClpP increased both of the activities (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in the casein-activated ATPase activity of ClpAT/K220T was significantly higher than that of ClpAT. Similar effects of ClpP were observed when the same experiments were performed in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP (data not shown). Thus, it appears likely that the mutation in the first ATP-binding site also somehow influences the interaction of ClpAT with ClpP.Table I Open table in a new tab Since it appears clear that the two ATP-binding sites play distinctive roles in the structure and function of ClpAT, we examined whether the ClpAT mutants can complement their defective roles with each other, such as in hexamer formation. When equal amounts of the ClpAT mutant proteins were mixed together in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP and subjected to gel filtration analysis as in Fig. 4, a majority of ClpAT/K220T, which alone behaves as a trimer at the ATP concentration, eluted together with ClpAT/K501T in the column fractions corresponding to the size of hexameric molecules (Fig. 6). Nearly identical results were obtained when the same experiments were performed with the mixture of ClpAT and ClpAT/K220T (data not shown). These results suggest that the hexameric ClpAT/K501T or ClpAT protein can interact with the trimeric ClpAT/K220T molecules and form a mixed hexameric complex. We then examined the effect of ClpAT/K501T on the casein-activated ATPase activity of ClpAT or ClpAT/K220T in the presence of ClpP. As shown in Table 2(experiment A), ClpAT/K501T strongly inhibited the ATPase activities of the latter proteins. Similar inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of 2 mM ATP, at which concentration all of the ClpAT proteins by themselves behave as hexameric molecules. On the other hand, the ATPase activity of the mixture of ClpAT and ClpAT/K220T was higher than the sum of that of each protein. Particularly in the presence of 2 mM ATP, ATP hydrolysis by the mixture of ClpAT and ClpAT/K220T was enhanced to an extent that could be seen by the doubled amount of ClpAT alone. Similar stimulatory or inhibitory effects of ClpAT/K220T or ClpAT/K501T, respectively, on the ATPase activity of ClpAT were observed when the same experiments were performed in the absence of casein, ClpP, or both (data not shown). Furthermore, the mixture of any of the two ClpAT proteins eluted in the fractions corresponding to a hexameric size from the Sephacryl S-300 column (data not shown). These results clearly suggest that the hexameric ClpAT proteins can also interact with each other and form hybrid molecules.Table II Open table in a new tab To determine whether the interaction between the ClpAT proteins may also influence their ability to support the ClpP-mediated proteolysis, casein hydrolysis was assayed by incubation of their mixtures in the presence of 0.5 and 2 mM ATP. Table 2(experiment B) shows that ClpAT/K501T strongly inhibited the ability of ClpAT or ClpAT/K220T to support the proteolytic activity of ClpP, similar to its effect on ATP cleavage. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of ClpAT/K501T occurred in a dose-dependent manner on the ability of ClpAT or ClpAT/K220T in supporting the ClpP-mediated proteolysis as well as in ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 7), again indicating that ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to protein breakdown by protease Ti. On the other hand, ClpAT/K220T showed little or no effect on the ability of ClpAT in supporting the proteolysis by ClpP at both of the ATP concentrations (i.e. the casein-degrading activity of ClpP in the presence of their mixture was nearly identical to the sum of that seen with each protein) (Table 2, experiment B). To clarify further the differential effect of ClpAT/K220T on casein hydrolysis from that on ATP cleavage, the same assays were performed as in Table 2(experiment B) but by varying the incubation period. As shown in Fig. 8, nearly the same results were obtained at all time points for ATP hydrolysis and for casein degradation. These results suggest that the mutation in the first ATP-binding site may indeed influence the interaction of ClpA with ClpP, and therefore the enhanced ATP hydrolysis by the mixture of ClpAT and ClpAT/K220T could not increase its ability to support the ClpP-mediated casein degradation.Figure 8:Effects of ClpAT/K220T on the ability of ClpAT in ATP hydrolysis (A) and in supporting the casein hydrolysis by ClpP (B). ATP hydrolysis was assayed by incubating 10 μg of casein and 0.2 μg of ClpAT (•), 0.2 μg of ClpAT/K220T (▴ ), 0.2 μg each of both (▪ ), or 0.4 μg of ClpAT (○) for various periods at 37°C in the presence of various amounts of ClpAT/K501T. The incubation mixtures also contained ClpP with one-half the amount of the ClpAT proteins. For casein hydrolysis, incubations were performed as above but in the presence of twice the amount of the Clp proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present studies have demonstrated that the first of the two ATP-binding sites in ClpA is responsible for the ATP-mediated hexamer formation, while the second site is critical for the ATPase function. The mutation in the first site (K220T) prevents hexamer formation of ClpAT at 0.5 mM ATP but not at 2 mM. Of interest is the finding that the mutation results in the reduction of not only the affinity of ClpAT to ATP but also the Vmax value for ATP hydrolysis and hence also decreases the ability of ClpAT to support the proteolytic activity of ClpP. It has been reported that the kinetics of proteolysis by protease Ti shows positive cooperativity with respect to ATP with a Hill coefficient of 1.6(9Maurizi M.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that binding of ATP to the first site influences the efficiency of its binding to the second site and thus the ability of ClpA to support the ClpP-mediated proteolysis. Noteworthy was the finding that the mode of interaction of ClpP with ClpAT/K220T appears to differ from that with ClpAT. We have previously shown that ClpP reduces the rate of ATP hydrolysis by ClpA in the absence of casein but increases the ATPase activity in its presence (8Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ATPase activity of the mutant form of ClpAT was found to be increased by ClpP whether or not casein was present. Furthermore, the extent of the increase in ATP hydrolysis by ClpAT/K220T was significantly greater than that by ClpAT. Therefore, it appears that the reduced ability of the mutant form of ClpAT in supporting the ClpP-mediated proteolysis may also be attributed to the change in the mode of its interaction with ClpP. On the other hand, the mutation in the second site (K501T) almost completely eliminated the ATPase activity of ClpAT but with little or no effect on the hexamer formation in the presence of 0.5 or 2 mM ATP. Furthermore, ClpAT/K501T can form a hexameric complex even in the presence of ADP, indicating that hexamer formation requires the binding but not the hydrolysis of the adenine nucleotides. Therefore, the mutation in the second ATP-binding site does not seem to exert any influence on the binding of ATP or ADP to the first site. Of particular interest was the finding that the hexameric ClpAT or ClpAT/K501T can interact with the trimeric form of ClpAT/K220T and generate a mixed hexameric complex. Furthermore, ClpAT/K501T inhibited the ability of ClpAT or ClpAT/K220T in ATP hydrolysis and in supporting the ClpP-mediated proteolysis. These inhibitory effects of ClpAT/K501T could also be seen in the presence of 2 mM ATP, at which concentration all of the ClpAT proteins by themselves and the mixtures of any two of them behave as hexameric molecules. In addition, the ATPase activity of the mixture of ClpAT and ClpAT/K220T was found to be significantly higher than the sum of that of each protein, although its ability to support the proteolysis by ClpP remained unchanged. Therefore, it appears likely that a rapid exchange of the subunits occurs between the ClpAT proteins in the presence of ATP and results in the formation of hybrid molecules. However, it is presently unclear whether the exchange of the subunits between the ClpAT proteins occurs at the level of a trimeric unit or otherwise. Upon the gel filtration analysis of hexameric ClpAT/K501T incubated with increasing amounts of trimeric ClpAT/K220T (i.e. at 0.5 mM ATP as in Fig. 6), we found that the right side shoulder of the protein peak increases much more significantly than the peak height itself (data not shown). These results suggest a possibility that each trimeric unit of hexameric ClpAT/K501T in the incubation mixture is interacting with a trimeric ClpAT/K220T to form a hybrid hexameric complex until all of the trimeric units of ClpAT/K501T are replaced and occupied by trimeric ClpAT/K220T molecules, and therefore the excess of ClpAT/K220T remains trimeric. This possibility is in part supported by the finding that the inhibitory effect of ClpAT/K501T on the ATPase activity of ClpAT or ClpAT/K220T does not reach completion even in the presence of a 2-6-fold excess of ClpAT/K501T (see Fig. 7A and data not shown). However, this possibility is based on the assumption that the hybrid molecule containing one of each trimeric unit of ClpAT and ClpAT/K501T should be partially active in ATP hydrolysis and in supporting the ClpP-mediated proteolysis. In addition another possibility, that the exchange of the subunits occurs at the level of a monomeric or dimeric unit and results in the formation of various kinds of hybrid molecules, cannot be totally excluded. In contrast to the present findings that the first ATP-binding site is responsible for hexamer formation of ClpA and the second is for ATPase activity, Lindquist and co-workers (15Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution in the second ATP-binding site eliminates hexamer formation of hsp104 with only a slight defect in ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, a mutation in the first site completely eliminates the ATPase activity of hsp104 without much influence on oligomerization. These reversed functions of the two ATP-binding sites are rather striking, because the sequences of each ATP-binding region containing the Gly-X2-Gly-X-Gly-Lys-Thr elements in ClpA and hsp104 are known to be highly homologous with each other (14Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzer J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and because in both studies the same lysine residue that interacts with one of the phosphoryl group of the bound nucleotide (12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay J.N. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar, 13Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) was substituted with threonine. Therefore, it appears that the distinctive functions (i.e. ATP hydrolysis and oligomerization) of the two ATP-binding sites may be determined by the tertiary structures of ClpA and hsp104, such as the proximity of any one of the two sites to the catalytic site for ATP hydrolysis or to certain unknown sequence(s) that is involved in oligomerization, but not by the sequences of the homologous ATP-binding regions themselves."

The enzymic hydrolysis of polysaccharides and glycosides is a critically important process in the metabolism of plants, animals, and microorganisms (Sinnott, 1990). The basic mechanistic assumption, supported with few exceptions by the available data, is that enzyme-mediated glycoside hydrolysis is initiated by protonation of glycosidic oxygen atoms via an active site-located general acid. Following protonation, the aglycon is released, and a positively charged oxycarbonium ion is stabilized by a nucleophilic amino acid, most often a carboxylate (reviewed by Svensson and S⊘gård(1993)). The exact mode of stabilization is not known but is thought to be either electrostatic or via a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate. Hydration of the stabilized oxycarbonium ion or, alternatively, hydrolysis of the covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate serves to regenerate the reducing terminus of the glycosyl moiety. Amino acids mediating in the protonation and stabilization are referred to as the catalytic acid and the catalytic nucleophile, respectively. Identification of such catalytic residues has been attempted in a number of enzymes using chemical modification (Svensson et al., 1990), x-ray crystallography (Anderson et al., 1981), or homology searches coupled with site-directed mutagenesis of residues thought to be involved (Trimbur et al., 1992). Due to theoretical and practical constraints in each of these techniques, a combined approach is required for a reliable definition of the functional importance of individual amino acids at the active sites of enzymes (Schimmel, 1993). To define the molecular basis for catalysis and substrate specificity in polysaccharide endohydrolases, we have employed a range of mechanism-based inhibitors to define geometric differences within the active sites of a family of β-glucan endohydrolases (H⊘j et al., 1989b, 1991, 1992). In particular, detailed investigations of 1,3-β-D-glucan glucanohydrolases (E.C. 3.2.1.39) and 1,3;1,4-β-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.73), two classes of polysaccharide hydrolases with closely related substrate specificities, led to the conclusion that the acquisition of distinct substrate specificities in the evolution of these related enzymes did not require the recruitment of novel catalytic amino acids but rather that it involved differences in the positioning of catalytic residues at the active site and/or changes in residues responsible for substrate binding (Chen et al., 1993a). A 1,3-β-glucanase, designated isoenzyme GII, 1The abbreviations used are: isoenzyme GII1,3-β-D-glucan glucanohydrolase isoenzyme GII from barley (Hordeum vulgare)isoenzyme EI and EII1,3-1,4-β-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase isoenzymes EI and EII from barley (H. vulgare)IPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosideMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidMBP-EIMBP-EII, and MBP-GII, fusion proteins of the E. coli maltose-binding protein and isoenzymes EI, EII, and GII, respectivelywtwild-typeX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactosidePCRpolymerase chain reaction. and a 1,3;1,4-β-glucanase, designated isoenzyme EII, have recently been crystallized (Chen et al., 1993b). Their three-dimensional structures reveal a complete spatial conservation of both the catalytic nucleophile (Glu231 in the 1,3-β-glucanase and Glu232 in the 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase) and the proposed general acid (Glu288 in both enzymes) (Varghese et al., 1994). To further investigate the structural basis for catalysis and substrate specificity in these enzymes, we have now established bacterial expression systems for both classes of enzyme and used site-directed mutagenesis of the 1,3-β-glucanase to determine the relative importance of these putative catalytic residues in enzyme action. Inspection of the three-dimensional structures reveals that the catalytic amino acids Glu231 and Glu288 are spatially close to the functional groups of Glu279 and Lys282. We have also tested the contribution of these two neighboring conserved residues (Glu279 and Lys282) and conclude they play an important role in binding and/or catalysis. This conclusion was independently corroborated by structural studies, which revealed that Glu279 and Lys282 are in intimate contact with a mechanism-based inhibitor covalently linked to the nucleophile Glu231. 1,3-β-D-glucan glucanohydrolase isoenzyme GII from barley (Hordeum vulgare) 1,3-1,4-β-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase isoenzymes EI and EII from barley (H. vulgare) isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid MBP-EII, and MBP-GII, fusion proteins of the E. coli maltose-binding protein and isoenzymes EI, EII, and GII, respectively wild-type 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside polymerase chain reaction. Escherichia coli BMH71-18 mutS (thi supEΔ(lac-proAB)(mutS::Tn10) F′(proAB+ lacIqlacZ ΔM15)) was supplied by Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and plasmid pMAL-c2 was supplied by New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. A cDNA encoding mature 1,3-β-glucanase isoenzyme GII was generated by PCR amplification of a full-length cDNA (H⊘j et al., 1989a) using VentR™ DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and two primers (A: 5′-ATCGGCGTGTGCTACGGCGTGATC-3′ and B: 5′-GCCGGAATTCCAGCTAGGTAGCTACACTAGAA-3′). Primer A is identical to the nucleotides encoding Ile1–8 of the 1,3-β-glucanase, while primer B is complementary to the 3′-end of the cDNA (nucleotides TTC1049 to GCT1067) but is extended to incorporate an EcoRI site in the PCR product. For PCR, reaction mixtures containing 30 ng of template, 150 pmol of each primer, 300 μM each of dNTPs, and 1 unit of VentR DNA polymerase in 50 μl of VentR buffer (consisting of 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100) were heated for 5 min at 94°C followed by 25 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 60 s), annealing (45 or 55°C, 60 s), and extension (72°C, 90 s). Amplified PCR fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, cut with restriction enzyme EcoRI, and ligated into the pMAL-c2 vector previously cut with XmnI and EcoRI to generate the 1,3-β-glucanase isoenzyme GII expression vector pMAL-c2-GII, which was used to transform E. coli strain DH5α (supE44ΔlacU169(ϕ80lacZΔM15)). Colonies were grown on an LB agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and restreaked onto a master LB ampicillin plate and an LB ampicillin plate containing 0.02% X-gal and 100 μM IPTG for selection of white colonies. This procedure was adopted because the presence of 100 μM IPTG on the first selection plate drastically reduced the number of transformants. Subsequent experiments revealed that reducing the IPTG concentration to 10 μM diminished this problem. Recombinant clones expressing the MBP-GII fusion protein were further selected by activity measurements and electrophoretic analysis of unpurified bacterial extracts. Expression vectors directing the synthesis of barley 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase isoenzymes EI and EII were constructed exactly as described above, using cDNAs encoding the respective enzymes (Fincher et al., 1986; Slakeski et al., 1990). The forward primer A for both cDNAs was 5′-ATCGGGGTGTGCTACGGCATGAGC-3′, and the reverse primers B for isoenzymes EI and EII were 5′-CCGGGAATTCCGTAGCTGCTACCTCATCAGAA-3′ and 5′-GGCGGAATTCCCGAGCACGAGCTCCGTCAGAA-3′, respectively. Strains expressing MBP-GII, MBP-EI, and MBP-EII are referred to as DH5αMBP-GII, DH5αMBP-EI, and DH5αMBP-EII, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 1,3-β-glucanase cDNA was carried out by the unique restriction enzyme site elimination procedure (Deng and Nickoloff, 1992) using a U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with double-stranded plasmid DNA (pMAL-c2-GII) as a template. The primers designed to introduce the desired mutations were E231Q, 5′-GTGGTGGTGTCGCAGAGCGGGTGGCCG-3′; E279Q, 5′-GCCATGTTCAACCAGAACCAGAAGACC-3′; E288Q, 5′-GGGGACGCCACGCAGAGGAGCTTCGGG-3′; and K282M, 5′-CGAGAACCAGATGACCGGGGACGCC-3′. The codons mutated are underlined. Two selection primers were made. The primer 5′-CAGACTAATTCGAGGCCTAACAACAACAACAA-3′, which converts the SacI site in the polylinker of the pMAL-c2 to an StuI site, was used to obtain mutants E279Q and E288Q. The primer 5′-CGGTATTTCACACCGGCTAGCGTGCACTCTC-3′, which is designed to convert the unique NdeI site in pMAL-c2 to an NheI site, was used to obtain mutants E231Q and K282M. The mismatched bases in the selection primers are underlined. All primers were phosphorylated at their 5′-end before use, and the mutagenesis procedure was performed essentially as prescribed by the manufacturer. Mutants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using a Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). E. coli strain DH5αMBP-GII carrying the pMAL-c2-GII wild-type vector or its mutated derivatives were grown overnight at 37°C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 10 ml of the culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB broth containing 0.2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37°C with vigorous shaking, and when A600 reached a value of 0.5, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce synthesis of the fusion proteins. Following 3 h of additional growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C (4000 × g for 30 min), suspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 M NaCl) per g of wet cells, and lysed with lysozyme (Sambrook et al., 1989) in a modified procedure that incorporated a single freeze-thaw step. The supernatant collected by centrifugation at 12000 × g at 4°C for 20 min was defined as the crude extract and used in further purification. For purification of the wild-type enzyme, crude extract from 1 liter of culture was diluted 10-fold with 15 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and applied at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min to a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow (Pharmacia) column (3 × 11.5 cm) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After washing the column exhaustively, bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0-250 mM NaCl gradient in 1.2 liters of equilibration buffer. Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled, desalted, and adjusted to 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, by ultrafiltration (Amicon PM10 filter) before application to a CM-Sepharose fast flow (Pharmacia) column (2 × 10.5 cm) equilibrated with 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. After exhaustive washing, bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0-200 mM NaCl gradient in 1 liter of equilibration buffer. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled to give 5.0 mg of active fusion protein. Mutant enzymes were purified by a single ion-exchange chromatography step employing a shallow salt gradient elution. The crude extract from 4-5 liters of culture was diluted 10-fold with 15 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and applied at a flow rate of 2.5-3.0 ml/min to a DEAE-Sepharose column (5 × 21 cm) equilibrated with 12.5 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5. After exhaustive washing, bound proteins were eluted with a 1.9-liter linear 0-80 mM NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Fractions containing pure fusion protein were located by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, concentrated, and adjusted to 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, by ultrafiltration before clarification by centrifugation. The yield of pure fusion protein varied between 10 and 20 mg, depending on the mutation introduced.

Diffraction data to 2.8 Å resolution were collected using a MarResearch detector and processed as described earlier (Varghese et al., 1994). For data 14-2.8 Å resolution and I ≥ 2σ, there were 20,800 observations, 13,134 reflections, and Rmerge = 0.076. From an Fo (complex) - Fo (native) Fourier map, two sites for the inhibitor were located in the 40 Å long glucan-binding cleft. They were the most significant features in the map (represented by all peaks 8-4.5 standard deviations), and one site showed electron density for a glucose unit and the aglycon covalently connected to the enzyme at Glu231. The other site appears to bind inhibitor non-covalently, the epoxide group of the aglycon probably being “inactivated” by the high level of (NH4)2SO4 in the crystallization medium during the prolonged soaking. For the initial model, R = 0.217 for data 6-2.8 Å resolution. Cycles of energy minimization and refinement of temperature factors (Brünger, 1992) were indispersed with inspection of difference density and 2Fo - Fc maps. During this procedure, additional water molecules were located, and R was reduced to 0.151. After simulated annealing and further energy minimization, the refinement was complete with R = 0.143. In the final model, the rms deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles were 0.017 Å and 2.02°, respectively, and there were 83 water molecules. Refined omit maps were used to confirm the location of inhibitor molecules. Enzyme activity was assayed at 37°C with the substrate laminarin (Sigma) as previously described (Chen et al., 1993a). 1 unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol of reducing equivalents per minute. The protein concentration of wild-type enzyme was measured with a BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The protein concentrations (relative to wt-MBP-GII) of mutant enzymes and the native 1,3-β-glucanase isoenzyme GII purified from barley were standardized by the method of Ball(1986). Kinetic parameters were determined at 37°C using laminarin as a substrate over the concentration range 0.4-4.0 mg/ml in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The Km, Vmax, and kcat values were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The pH dependence of enzyme activities was measured at pH 3.5, 4.3, 5.0, 5.7, and 6.5 (pH 3.5-5.0 in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer; pH 5.7 in 50 mM sodium succinate buffer; and pH 6.5 in 50 mM MES buffer). Thermostabilities of the purified enzymes were determined by measuring residual activity after incubation in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 50 or 55°C. Analytical gel filtration chromatography was carried out at room temperature using a Superose-12 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia) operated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in 35 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl. Attempts to synthesize the authentic, mature form of barley 1,3;1,4-β-glucanase isoenzyme EII in E. coli have not been successful (Olsen, 1990). For this reason, and to facilitate purification procedures, we decided to express recombinant barley β-glucanases as fusion proteins. Previously characterized cDNAs encoding mature 1,3-β-glucanase isoenzyme GII and 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase isoenzymes EI and EII were inserted downstream from the E. coli malE gene in pMAL-c2 plasmids with the view to employ a one-step purification of the fusion proteins on amylose resin and the subsequent release of β-glucanases from the fusion proteins by cleavage with factor Xa protease (Maina et al., 1988). All three constructs directed the synthesis of large amounts of a 74-kDa protein species in response to IPTG induction (Fig. 1); this corresponds to a fusion protein consisting of the maltose-binding protein (43 kDa) and the barley β-glucanase (approximately 32 kDa). The 1,3- and 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase activities were readily detected in crude bacterial lysates following IPTG induction, but not before induction. One-step purification of the fusion proteins on amylose resins was not successful. Although homogeneous preparations of the fusion proteins were obtained from the amylose column, yields of active enzyme were very low. A simple ion-exchange procedure was therefore employed to prepare larger quantities of active protein (Fig. 1). Attempts to cleave the purified fusion protein with factor Xa protease were unsuccessful, a result which can now be explained by inspection of the three-dimensional structures of the 1,3- and 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase. The amino-terminal residue of each enzyme is almost totally buried within the core of the α/β barrel structures (Varghese et al., 1994) (Fig. 2). Access of factor Xa to the scissile bond in the folded fusion proteins is therefore not possible. The high levels of active fusion protein and the relative ease of purification make them an attractive choice for the study of glucanase structure-function relationships. Although cleavage by factor Xa was not possible, it is unlikely that the MBP will affect glucanase function because the MBP is attached to the β-glucanase via the NH2-terminal isoleucine situated on the side of the α/β barrel that does not carry the substrate-binding groove (Fig. 2). Indeed, the enzymic and kinetic properties of the fusion proteins appear to accurately reflect the properties of the native enzymes. Thus, 1,3-β-glucanase isoenzyme GII isolated from germinating barley and MBP-GII do not differ significantly with respect to pH optima (Fig. 3), turnover number, or Km values (Table 1). In addition, relative differences in thermostability between 1,3- and 1,3-1,4-β-glucanases isolated from barley are accurately reproduced when MBP-GII and MBP-EII are compared (Fig. 4). These observations establish the efficacy of the system for introducing mutations into barley β-glucanases and for the evaluation of their functional consequences. The method has now been used to test the relative importance of four highly conserved amino acid residues, namely Glu231, Glu279, Lys282, and Glu288 (Fig. 5), as determinants of catalytic activity in 1,3-β-glucanase isoenzyme GII.Table I Open table in a new tab Figure 4:Thermostabilities of endoglucanases synthesized in germinating barley or in E. coli as fusion proteins.

No sequence errors were observed. Following expression in E. coli cells and purification of the expressed fusion proteins, about 5 mg of wild-type and 3-5 mg of mutant MBP-GII were obtained per liter of culture medium. The wild-type and mutant enzymes exhibited apparently identical chromatographic and electrophoretic behavior. Their Stokes' radii were indistinguishable as judged from analytical gel filtration, during which the proteins eluted as monomers with an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa and appeared to adopt a highly globular structure (data not shown). From these observations and from measurements of Km values (Table 1), we conclude that the overall topology of the MBP-GII enzyme has not been changed by the mutations introduced at these surface-located residues. We have previously employed mechanism-based inhibitors to identify Glu231 as the likely catalytic nucleophile at the active site of barley 1,3-β-glucanase isoenzyme GII and a less specific carbodiimide/glycine ethyl ester-labeling protocol to identify Glu288 as the putative catalytic acid (Chen et al., 1993a). The assignments were given additional weight by the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, which showed that Glu231 and Glu288 are located in a deep substrate-binding cleft with a distance between their O∊ atoms of 8.6 Å (Varghese et al., 1994) (Fig. 6). If the glycosidic oxygen were positioned midway between the two O∊ atoms, this distance would enable protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by the catalytic acid and subsequent stabilization of the oxycarbonium ion by the catalytic nucleophile (Varghese et al., 1994). However, as pointed out by Schimmel(1993), what appear to be straightforward rationales for the conservation of residues at a particular location may be secondary to alternative and more sophisticated considerations and that no matter how obvious the role of a particular residue may seem, it pays to make substitutions at such positions to test the effect on function, as illustrated by the analysis of Asn229 in thymilidate synthase (Liu and Santi, 1993). For these reasons the putative catalytic amino acid residues of the barley 1,3-β-glucanase were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, the enzymes were expressed in E. coli, and the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes were examined. When the putative catalytic nucleophile Glu231 was changed to a Gln residue in the E231Q mutant, the specific activity was reduced about 20,000-fold. At this level of activity, reliable estimates of Km and kcat could not be obtained. The effect of mutating the postulated general acid (Glu288) to a glutamine residue was less dramatic. The E288Q mutant exhibited a 350-fold reduction in kcat with no significant change in Km (Table 1). Both mutant enzymes exhibited bell-shaped pH profiles similar to that of the wild-type MBP-GII (Fig. 3), although one might anticipate that removal of either of the catalytic amino acids would alter the shape of the pH rate curve dramatically. This observation raised the possibility that the activity measured could be due to wt activity. The likelihood of contamination of the expressed enzyme with wt enzyme appears to be remote, given that individual cDNA clones were used in expression work. Translational misreading is a possibility (Schimmel, 1989), but spontaneous deamidation of the introduced Gln residue might be more likely (Planas et al., 1992). To address these possibilities, the thermal inactivation of the E288Q mutant was compared with that of the wt enzyme (Fig. 7). The activity loss of the E288Q mutant does not parallel that of the wt enzyme, and we therefore conclude that the activity measured in the mutant preparation is due to the abundant, low specific activity MBP-GII(E288Q) mutant enzyme itself and not due to a small amount of wt enzyme with a high specific activity. The relative impact on activity of mutations in the catalytic acid and the catalytic nucleophile was unexpected and not in line with commonly observed effects (Svensson and S⊘gård, 1993; Legler, 1993). Replacement of the general acid usually results in near complete loss of activity, as observed for Tyr503 in β-galactosidase (Ring and Huber, 1990), Glu35 in hen egg white lysozyme (Malcolm et al., 1989), and Glu179 in Aspergillus niger glucoamylase (Sierks et al., 1990), while low to significant residual activity usually remains after mutation of catalytic nucleophiles. For example, the D52N mutation in hen egg white lysozyme, in which Asp52 is the nucleophile, reduces kcat to 5% of wt activity on Micrococcus cells (Malcolm et al., 1989). In the case of MBP-GII, this trend is reversed. Substitution of the nucleophile led to an almost complete loss of activity, while significant levels of activity remained following mutation of the catalytic acid. Nevertheless, similar results have been recently recorded. The substitution of a Gln residue for the nucleophilic Glu358 in an Agrobacterium β-glucosidase (Withers et al., 1992) and Glu134 in a Bacillus licheniformis 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase (Planas et al., 1992) resulted in dramatic loss of activity, while the substitution of a potential, as yet unconfirmed, proton donor (Asp374) in the glucosidase had a somewhat less dramatic effect (Trimbur et al., 1992). As expected for catalytic amino acid residues, Glu231 and Glu288 are highly conserved in the primary structures of a wide range of eukaryotic 30-35-kDa β-glucanases (Chen et al., 1993a) (Fig. 5A). One exception is the anther-specific 53-kDa protein encoded by the developmentally regulated Brassica napus and Arabidopsis thaliana A6 gene, which despite a 30% sequence identity with isoenzyme GII is predicted to contain a glutamine residue (Gln341) at the equivalent position of Glu288 in isoenzyme GII (Hird et al., 1993) (Fig. 5B). Significantly, to date, no glucanase activity has been associated with the A6 protein when expressed prematurely in tobacco anthers or in E. coli (Hird et al., 1993). Therefore, these data support rather than undermine the importance of Glu288 and"
https://openalex.org/W2076223110,"Fibroblasts transformed by the v-Src oncoprotein exhibit elevated activity of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which binds to, and is activated by, a wide range of receptor tyrosine kinases as well as v-Src and transforming polyoma middle T/c-Src complexes. Here we consider the role of the v-Src homology (SH) domains, SH3 and SH2, and the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, in the stimulation of v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase activity in response to rapid activation of the oncoprotein. As shown by others, we find that the v-Src SH3 domain tightly binds the PI 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit in normal growing chicken embryo fibroblasts. However, we also find that in transformed cells there is additional efficient binding of PI 3-kinase to the v-Src SH2 domain in a catalytically active form. Furthermore, the binding of p85 to the SH2 domain, which is almost undetectable in quiescent cells, is rapidly stimulated upon activation of temperature-sensitive v-Src and consequent cell cycle entry, demonstrating that binding is a target for regulation. We also show that v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase differs considerably from PDGF receptor-associated enzyme by a different mode of binding, a lack of substantial allosteric activation, and a dependence on the tyrosine kinase activity of v-Src. The rapidly induced binding and activation of PI 3-kinase thus provides sensitive regulation of recruitment of PI 3-kinase to its substrates and into other signaling complexes at the cell membrane, which involves all the Src homology domains.

The c-src proto-oncogene, the cellular version of the v-src oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus, encodes the prototype of a family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases associated with the plasma membrane (reviewed by Courtneidge et al.(1993) and Fincham et al. (1994)). Src is also the prototype of proteins containing Src homology (SH) ( 1The abbreviations used are: SHSrc homologyPIphosphatidylinositolGSTglutathione S-transferaseCEFchicken embryo fibroblast(s)tstemperature-sensitiveHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPDGFplatelet-derived growth factor.) domains, i.e. SH1, the tyrosine kinase domain; SH2, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues; and SH3, which binds to proline-rich sequences in proteins. SH2 and SH3 domains have been found either alone, or in combination, in many proteins involved in signal transduction (reviewed by Pawson and Schlessinger, 1993). Src homology phosphatidylinositol glutathione S-transferase chicken embryo fibroblast(s) temperature-sensitive high performance liquid chromatography platelet-derived growth factor. There is no detailed understanding of the crucial signaling events that lead to transformation by the v-Src oncoprotein but it is clear that v-Src, transforming variants of c-Src, and activated tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, such as the one for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), share common binding partners like PI 3-kinase, and known substrates such as Shc (Fukui and Hanafusa, 1989; McGlade et al., 1992a, 1992b). Much recent attention has focused on PI 3-kinase as an important binding partner and target for v-Src (reviewed by Cantley et al., 1991, Downes and Carter, 1991, Parker and Waterfield, 1992, and Stephens et al., 1993). This lipid kinase can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI), PI 4-phosphate, and PI 4,5-bisphosphate in position D-3 of the inositol ring, giving rise to products whose cellular role is still little understood. The only clue as to their function comes from in vitro experiments in which PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate was found to activate protein kinase Cζ (Nakanishi et al., 1993). PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) and an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) (reviewed by Fry and Waterfield, 1993). p110 is a dual specificity enzyme, able to act not only as a lipid kinase, but also as a protein serine kinase. The phosphorylation on serine 608 in the inter-SH2 domain of p85 by p110 negatively regulates PI 3-kinase (Dhand et al., 1994). PI 3-kinase was first identified in anti-v-Src immunoprecipitates from lysates of Rous sarcoma virus-infected chicken fibroblasts (Sugimoto et al., 1984). It is also found associated with members of the protein tyrosine kinase family of growth factor receptors (Kaplan et al., 1987; Bjorge et al., 1990) and activated by proteins of the hemopoietic growth factor receptor family (Gold et al., 1994). The widespread activation of PI 3-kinase by growth factor receptors points to a common, fundamental function of this enzyme in growth factor signaling. There is strong evidence implicating PI 3-kinase in cell transformation. The transforming ability of the polyoma middle T antigen/c-Src complex depends on its association with PI 3-kinase (Whitman et al., 1985) and PI 3-kinase binds to v-Src as well as all transforming variants of c-Src (Fukui and Hanafusa, 1989). Mutations in the v-Src SH3 domain decrease the binding of PI 3-kinase and result in a partially transformed, fusiform morphology (Wages et al., 1992), suggesting that the v-Src SH3 domain may mediate the association with PI 3-kinase. More recently, PI 3-kinase was shown to bind directly to the v-Src SH3 but not the SH2 domain expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (Liu et al., 1993). In successive rounds of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations from cell extracts, however, the PI 3-kinase activity able to bind v-Src is depleted (Fukui and Hanafusa, 1991). This implies that tyrosine phosphorylation of the lipid kinase is required for efficient association with v-Src, presumably mediated by the v-Src SH2 domain. Thus, the exact role of the v-Src SH domains in binding and activation of PI 3-kinase and the mechanism of regulation of binding remain unclear. Here, we investigate in detail the role of the v-Src homology domains, SH2 and SH3 alone and in combination, and the tyrosine kinase domain, in the regulation of v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase. We conclude that all of these domains contribute and that the regulation of PI 3-kinase bound to v-Src differs from that associated with activated PDGF receptor. Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) uniformly infected with RCAN encoding the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant v-Src proteins LA 29, LA 29A2, or LA 32 were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 1% heat-inactivated chick serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.375% sodium bicarbonate, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine (all supplied by Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were made quiescent by serum deprivation (0.2% newborn calf serum, no tryptose phosphate, no chick serum) for 4 days. v-Src homology domains SH3 (amino acids 85-141), SH2 (amino acids 142-247), and combined SH3 and SH2 (amino acids 85-247) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were generated at the ends to facilitate cloning into pGex2t (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The cloning products were checked by sequencing. Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were isolated and bound to glutathione-agarose beads according to the method of Smith and Johnson(1988). Proteins were assayed using Coomassie reagent (Pierce). Semiconfluent cultures of CEF were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and lysed in modified PLC lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl containing 1.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and protein concentrations determined by the BCA method (Pierce). 300 to 500 μg of cell protein (with or without inhibiting proline-rich peptide) were preabsorbed with 200 μg of GST for 60 min at 4°C and the supernatant incubated with fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads for 60 min at 4°C in a volume of 1 ml. The beads were then washed four times with cold lysis buffer, proteins resolved in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blotting analysis performed as described below. For PI 3-kinase activation studies, biotinylated PDGF receptor peptide (donated by Zeneca) or GST fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads were added to CEF lysates and incubated at 4°C for 90 min. PDGF receptor peptide-bound PI 3-kinase was precipitated using streptavidin-agarose beads. Beads were washed and PI 3-kinase assays performed as described below. Equal amounts of clarified lysates were incubated with glutathione agarose-bound GST-fusion proteins for 2 h. The precipitates were then resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with monoclonal anti-p85 antibody. Detection was by ECL (Amersham Corp.) following manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of p85 binding to the fusion proteins was done by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer. To examine phosphotyrosine levels in the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase from cells expressing v-Src mutants, lysates were precipitated with anti-p85 antibody and then treated as above. Blots were then stripped following ECL instructions and reprobed with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). To deplete cell lysates of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, cell lysates were incubated for 6 h with excess (1:50) polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Affiniti) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Cells were grown to around 90% confluence at the appropriate temperature, washed, rapidly lysed in PLC lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl containing 1.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and protein concentrations determined by the BCA method. Equal amounts of clarified lysates were incubated either with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) coated with anti v-Src monoclonal antibody EC10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or control antibody (normal mouse IgG (ICN) or monoclonal anti-p85 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.)) for 16 h or with glutathione-agarose-bound GST fusion proteins for 2 h. Precipitates were washed once with lysis buffer, twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), twice with 100 mM Tris/HCl, 500 mM LiCl, pH 7.6, and twice with 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, and then incubated in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) with a 3:1 sonicated mixture of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine (0.02 mg/ml) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP, 10 mM MgCl2 as substrates for 30 min at 30°C. Reaction products were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography. After autoradiography the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate band was scraped off the plate, counted, and presented as counts/minute. The identity of the lipid product was verified by HPLC analysis. The PI 3-kinase assay was linear under these conditions. Lipid products of PI 3-kinase assays were deacylated and HPLC analysis performed as described previously (Carter and Downes, 1992). Since mutations in SH2 (Fukui and Hanafusa, 1989), as well as SH3 (Wages et al., 1992), have been shown to influence the v-Src association with PI 3-kinase activity, we tested the ability of isolated GST-SH3 and GST-SH2 domains of v-Src, as well as a GST-SH3-SH2 fusion, to bind p85 from extracts of growing chicken embryo fibroblasts. Bacterial fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with extracts of growing CEF and bound proteins immunoblotted with p85 antiserum (Fig. 1A shows a short and a longer exposure of the immunoblots). As previously reported (Liu et al., 1993), the SH3 of v-Src domain bound p85 (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-4). In contrast to this previous work, we found that the SH2 domain also bound, although much more weakly (less than 10% of the amount) than SH3 (Fig. 1, panel A, lanes 5-7 and panel B). Furthermore, the SH2 domain bound both a species that co-migrated with the SH3-binding form of p85 and a faster migrating species (Fig. 1, A and C). Whether the lower species is a different gene product or an alternatively modified form of the higher molecular weight species is not clear. When the v-Src SH3 and SH2 domains were fused, enhanced binding (approximately twice the quantity bound to SH3 and SH2 combined) of p85 was observed (Fig. 1, panel A, lanes8-10 and panel B). The enhancing effect of fusing the SH2 domain to SH3 could be either the result of direct binding of a population of p85 to SH2 or stimulation of binding to SH3 as a result of some conformational change. Thus, we examined the effect of the proline-rich peptide (amino acid residues 84-98 of bovine p85-α, SPPTPKPRPPRPLPV in single-letter amino acid code) on the binding of p85 to isolated and combined SH3 and SH2 domains (Fig. 1C). This peptide is an extended version of a peptide previously used by Liu et al. (1993) to demonstrate direct binding of the v-Src SH3 domain to this proline-rich region of p85. The peptide efficiently inhibited the SH3-p85 interaction (Fig. 1C, lanes2 and 3) and had no effect on the SH2-p85 interaction (Fig. 1C, lanes5 and 6). The peptide also inhibited the binding of p85 to the SH3-SH2 fusion (Fig. 1C, lanes8 and 9) albeit to a lesser extent. Inhibition of p85 binding by the proline-rich peptide, in the case of the SH3-SH2 fusion, did not reduce p85 binding to the level observed for the isolated SH2 domain (Fig. 1D). One possible explanation for this is that the combined SH3 and SH2 domains bind p85 with an increased affinity, which is greater than that for the peptide. The PI 3-kinase activity, which can associate with the non-catalytic domains of v-Src, was measured by incubating the GST-SH3, GST-SH2, and GST-SH3-SH2 fusion proteins with extracts prepared from growing CEF, followed by isolation of fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose. The ability of 1 mM proline-rich peptide to inhibit was also tested. This concentration was approximately 4 times that required for half-maximal inhibition of binding of PI 3-kinase activity to GST-SH3 (data not shown). We found PI 3-kinase activity associated with the SH2 domain similar to that bound to the SH3 domain (Fig. 2), despite the consistently lower binding of p85 found by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Possible explanations for this are that SH2-bound PI 3-kinase has a higher specific activity or that free p85 binds preferentially to SH3, while the catalytically active p85/p110 dimer binds both domains with similar efficiency. In addition, the activity bound to the SH3-SH2 fusion was considerably higher than that bound to either domain alone (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the observed increase in binding of p85 by the GST-SH3-SH2 fusion protein (Fig. 1A). The PI 3-kinase activity bound to SH3 and, to a lesser extent, SH3-SH2, but not isolated SH2, was inhibited by 1 mM proline-rich peptide from p85 (Fig. 2). We next addressed possible activation of PI 3-kinase by direct binding to the Src homology domains, and we compared this with the activation which occurs upon binding to a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to a PDGF receptor sequence that contains the PI 3-kinase binding site. This peptide is GGYMDMSKDESVDY∗VPMLDM (in single-letter amino acid code, where ∗ denotes a phosphorylated residue) and corresponds to residues 738-757 of the human PDGF receptor (Kazlauskas and Cooper, 1989). We measured PI 3-kinase activity present in extracts of growing CEF, which bound the GST-SH fusion proteins and the biotinylated receptor peptide bound to streptavidin-agarose. In addition, we measured the PI 3-kinase activity present in the extract before and after binding. The ratio of “activity bound” to the beads to the “activity removed” from the extract provided a measure of the enzyme activation that occurred as a direct result of binding. Binding to the receptor phosphopeptide resulted in activation of PI 3-kinase, considerably greater than that observed upon binding to the SH3, SH2, or SH3-SH2 domains (Fig. 3A). This implies that the substantial conformational activation, which occurs upon binding PI 3-kinase to the tyrosine phosphorylated PDGF receptor, mediated by the SH2 domain of p85 (Shoelson et al., 1993), does not occur to the same extent upon binding PI 3-kinase to the Src homology domains. Consistent with the activation as a direct result of binding, the PDGF receptor phosphopeptide-associated PI 3-kinase exhibited greater specific activity than that bound by the v-Src SH3 domain (Fig. 3B). A comparison of bound enzyme activity with amount of p85 associated with the agarose beads demonstrated clearly that the receptor phosphopeptide bound considerably more PI 3-kinase activity, despite binding only about 27% of the p85 associated with the v-Src SH3 domain (Fig. 3B). In contrast to our observations with the v-Src homology domains, including SH3, it has been shown recently that peptides containing the SH3 domains of Lyn and Fyn bind to a proline-rich region of p85 and augment PI 3-kinase activity 5-7-fold (Pleiman et al., 1994). This may reflect genuine differences between the v-Src and Lyn/Fyn SH3 domains or could be due to differences in the methodology used. The weaker activation of PI 3-kinase upon binding to the Src homology domains SH3, SH2 and SH3-SH2 compared with the PDGF receptor phosphopeptide suggests that PI 3-kinase activation in response to v-Src is mediated differently from the allosteric mechanism proposed for direct binding to receptor tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides (Shoelson et al., 1993). Therefore, we examined the PI 3-kinase activity associated with various ts mutants of v-Src in CEF at restrictive (41°C) and permissive (35°C) temperature. The mutants used were ts LA 29, which has a temperature-sensitive kinase, ts LA 29A2, a myristylation-defective version of ts LA 29, and ts LA 32, which has functional mutations in both the SH3 and catalytic domains, which, in combination, produce a fusiform transformed morphology at permissive temperature (Stoker et al., 1984, 1986; Catling et al., 1994). CEF were uniformly infected with the replication-competent RCAN vector or RCAN-29, RCAN-29A2, or RCAN-32 as described previously (Catling et al., 1993). v-Src was isolated from lysates of cells grown at restrictive and permissive temperatures by immunoprecipitation using the monoclonal antibody EC10, and associated PI 3-kinase activity determined. The PI 3-kinase activity bound to v-Src was temperature-dependent in each case (Fig. 4A), although the degree of temperature sensitivity varied between mutant proteins. In the case of ts mutants LA 29A2 and LA 32, v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase activity at restrictive temperature was not substantially above the background “vector only” control. The higher level of activity associated with LA 29 at restrictive temperature has probably arisen due to its relatively higher frequency of back mutation as cells are passaged at restrictive temperature, a consequence of which is the expression of non-ts v-Src proteins in some cultures. This implies that PI 3-kinase activity associated with v-Src in transformed cells is dependent on activity of the v-Src kinase. In order to test this directly, we expressed a kinase-defective version of the mutant protein LA 32, LA 32KD, derived by mutation of Lys to Arg in the ATP binding site (described by Catling et al., 1994). The PI 3-kinase activity associated with this transformation-defective v-Src protein, although consistently above the vector alone control, was substantially reduced (Fig. 4B). These results indicate a requirement for the v-Src kinase for maximal associated PI 3-kinase activity. We also examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 in cells expressing ts and kinase-defective v-Src mutant proteins by immunoprecipitating p85 from lysates of growing CEF at restrictive and permissive temperatures, blotting to nitrocellulose, and probing with both anti-p85 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Although the amount of both p85 forms immunoprecipitated was relatively invariant in the uniformly infected cultures, tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 proteins was temperature-dependent in the case of cells expressing ts mutants (Fig. 4C). In cells expressing the kinase-inactive v-Src protein (lane1), there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. Thus, association of active PI 3-kinase requires the v-Src tyrosine kinase in transformed cells and correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. Both species of p85 detected from CEF cell extracts by immunoblotting, which co-migrated with those bound to the SH domains (Fig. 1, A and B), are phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to v-Src. Phosphorylation of p85 on tyrosine has also been demonstrated in 3T3 cells in response to PDGF stimulation, although the way in which this tyrosine phosphorylation regulates its activity or interaction with other proteins remains to be established (Kavanaugh et al., 1992). In addition to its transforming activity, v-Src can act as an intracellular mitogen. In cells made quiescent by serum deprivation, activation of ts v-Src by temperature shift results in transition from G0 to G1 and on to S phase and mitosis in the absence of exogenous growth factors (Bell et al., 1975; Durkin and Whitfield, 1984; Welham et al., 1990; Catling et al., 1993). The temperature-dependent association of PI 3-kinase in cells transformed with ts v-Src implicates the lipid kinase as a potential downstream intermediate in the transduction of v-Src tyrosine kinase activity into its biological consequences. We therefore examined the kinetics of association of active PI 3-kinase with ts LA 29 v-Src in CEF that had been made quiescent at restrictive temperature and stimulated for various times by shift to permissive temperature. Fig. 5A demonstrates that there was a very rapid stimulation of v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase activity upon temperature shift. The kinetics of stimulation parallels the activation of the LA 29 v-Src tyrosine kinase, which is detectable at 10 min and continues to rise at 30 min and 1 h after shift to permissive temperature (shown by Catling et al., 1993). Thus, association of PI 3-kinase activity with v-Src is a rapid consequence of activating the v-Src kinase, suggesting that this may be an early event in the pathways leading to v-Src-induced mitogenesis and transformation. In addition, p85 tyrosine phosphorylation was increased upon temperature shift over the same time course (Fig. 5B), suggesting that this was responsible for the increase in v-Src-bound PI 3-kinase activity. In order to determine whether this increase was attributable to the SH3 or SH2 domain of v-Src, we examined the PI 3-kinase activity associated with GST-SH3 or GST-SH2 in response to activation of the v-Src kinase by temperature shift. The increase in v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase activity observed is almost certainly due to stimulated binding to the SH2 domain, since binding to GST-SH2 was similarly enhanced while binding to GST-SH3 was invariant (Fig. 6A). To test our hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 provides a mechanism for association with v-Src via the SH2 domain, lysates of CEF expressing ts LA 29 v-Src at permissive temperature were depleted of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody before incubation with GST-SH2 or GST-SH3. We found that p85 binding to SH2 but not SH3 requires tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 (Fig. 6B). In this experiment, the SH3 domain bound a small amount of the faster migrating form of p85 (Fig. 6B, top, short exposure). This was seen in some of our binding experiments and may reflect variations in the state of the cells or the experimental conditions. To establish whether activation of the v-Src kinase directly regulates binding to the SH3 and SH2 domains, we prepared protein extracts from CEF expressing ts LA 29 v-Src, which had been made quiescent at restrictive temperature and stimulated by shift to permissive temperature for various times. The ability of p85 to bind to GST-SH3, GST-SH2, and GST-SH3-SH2 was determined by incubation of the extracts with the bacterial fusion proteins, followed by elution and detection by immunoblotting (Fig. 7). The ability of p85 to bind the SH3 domain was detectable in quiescent cultures (Fig. 7, lowerpanel (long exposure), lane1) and largely unaffected by the activation of the v-Src kinase (closedarrow; Fig. 7, lanes4, 7, and 10), consistent with no regulation of the proline-rich sequence-mediated binding upon cell stimulation. However, p85 binding to the SH2 domain, which was detectable from lysates of growing CEF, was almost undetectable in quiescent cultures (Fig. 7, lowerpanel (long exposure), lane2), was rapidly stimulated by 30 min after shift to permissive temperature (Fig. 7, lane5) and remained elevated at 60 min and 120 min (Fig. 7, lanes8 and 11). In particular, the faster migrating form of p85 (arrow) was the more abundant species associating with the SH2 domain early after induction (Fig. 7, lowerpanel (long exposure), lanes5 and 8). Although the slower migrating form of p85 (closedarrow) from unstimulated cells bound the SH3-SH2 fusion, p85 binding to SH3-SH2 was responsive to activation of the v-Src kinase by stimulation of binding of the faster migrating form of p85 (arrow; Fig. 7, upperpanel (short exposure), lanes6, 9, and 12). We have shown that this species preferentially, but not exclusively, binds the v-Src SH2 domain (Fig. 1, 6B, and 7), implying that the increase in its binding to the SH3-SH2 fusion in response to activation of the v-Src kinase is mediated by the SH2 domain. Thus, the contribution of the SH2 domain to the binding of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase to the non-catalytic domains of v-Src varies according to the physiological growth state of the cells; in quiescent (Fig. 7) and exponentially growing normal cells (Fig. 1), binding is largely mediated by the SH3 domain, while in transformed cells soon after stimulation with an activating tyrosine kinase, the SH2 domain contributes significantly to p85 binding. Studies to date have implicated either the SH3 (Wages et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1993) or the SH2 domain (Fukui and Hanafusa, 1989) of v-Src in the interaction with PI 3-kinase. This led us to examine in detail the requirements for the binding and activation of PI 3-kinase by v-Src and to compare them to those proposed for the PDGF receptor. In the experiments presented, p85 from growing normal CEF bound to the v-Src SH3 domain and, although less strongly, to the SH2 domain. The SH2 domain bound a faster migrating form of p85 in addition to a species that co-migrated with the SH3-bound form. Both species were phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells transformed by v-Src. We also observed enhanced binding of p85 to fused SH3 and SH2 domains, as present in the intact v-Src protein. In line with these findings, an apparent synergism has been proposed for p56lck, where the presence of an adjacent SH2 domain facilitated binding of PI 3-kinase from T cells to the p56lck SH3 domain (Prasad et al., 1993). In cells fully transformed by v-Src, binding of p85 to the SH2 domain was considerably increased. Consistent with this, altered specificity has been observed for PI 3-kinase binding to p56lck, mediated by the SH3 domain in normal CEF and the SH2 domain in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF (Vogel and Fujita, 1993). The SH2 domain-associated PI 3-kinase had a higher specific activity, possibly as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit. Upon stimulation of CEF by activation of the v-Src tyrosine kinase, p85 binding to the SH2 domain was rapidly increased. In particular, the faster migrating form of p85 from transformed cells, which preferentially but not exclusively binds the SH2 domain, displayed enhanced binding to both SH2 and the SH3-SH2 fusion. This enhanced binding was reflected in an increase in the PI 3-kinase activity, which could associate with the SH2 domain in vitro and v-Src protein in vivo, implying that p85 binding to the non-catalytic domains of v-Src, in particular SH2, contributes to the formation of active v-Src-PI 3-kinase complexes at the cell periphery. The rapid increase in v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase activity demonstrates that the increased ability of p85 to bind SH2 is an early event that correlates with phosphorylation of p85 on tyrosine. This is supported by the observation that depletion of cell lysates of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins results in a considerable reduction in SH2- but not SH3-bound p85. Furthermore, these observations suggest that both SH3 and SH2 domains contribute to the binding of PI 3-kinase and that binding to the SH2 domain is responsive to intracellular signals. The proposed mode of interaction between PI 3-kinase and v-Src is quite distinct from that suggested for the binding of p85 to the PDGF receptor, which is mediated by interaction of the p85 SH2 domains with phosphotyrosine residues in the receptor tail. In addition to the different modes of binding, the apparent regulation of PI 3-kinase activity as a consequence of binding was also different. In the case of binding to a tyrosine phosphopeptide encompassing a PDGF receptor PI 3-kinase binding site, the enzyme was substantially activated, an effect that is obviously independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Activation of PI 3-kinase upon binding to the Src homology domains was much weaker. Thus, in contrast to PI 3-kinase binding to the PDGF receptor (Shoelson et al., 1993), allosteric activation of PI 3-kinase does not occur to any great extent upon binding to v-Src. We therefore addressed the role of the v-Src catalytic domain in stimulation of v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase activity. Using a kinase-defective and three ts mutants of v-Src, we demonstrated that v-Src tyrosine kinase activity is required for maximal v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase activity in transformed cells and correlates with phosphorylation of p85 on tyrosine. Since cellular PI 3-kinase bound directly to isolated v-Src SH domains, it seems likely that association of the small amount of PI 3-kinase activity consistently observed with the kinase-defective v-Src occurs through binding of active enzyme to its SH domains. These findings are consistent with the requirement for phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase by another Src family member, p56lck, in Jurkat T cells (von Willebrand et al., 1994). Thus, in addition to the differences in mode of binding and allosteric activation, v-Src-bound and PDGF receptor-associated PI 3kinase also differ in their tyrosine kinase requirement. Association with PI 3-kinase is likely to be of considerable importance for the biological activity of v-Src. Here we have refined the understanding of the regulation of v-Src-associated PI 3-kinase. We have demonstrated that all Src homology domains cooperate to positively regulate the binding of PI 3-kinase in response to activation of the oncoprotein. Before ts v-Src kinase activity is switched on, PI 3-kinase is bound predominantly by the SH3 domain. Upon activation of the v-Src tyrosine kinase, additional efficient binding to the SH2 domain occurs in a catalytically activated form. The rapid nature of the induced binding of activated PI 3-kinase thus provides a very sensitive means of recruiting the lipid kinase to the vicinity of its substrates and signaling complexes at the cell membrane. Any role for the SH3 and SH2 domains of p85 in the binding of PI 3-kinase to v-Src remains unknown. The activation of PI 3-kinase in response to the v-Src oncoprotein may also involve the catalytic subunit p110, a possibility that we have not addressed here.

The N-myristoylated peptides inhibited PKC and a phospholipid-independent catalytic-domain fragment of the enzyme by a reversible mechanism that involved binding of the inhibitor-peptide at the active-site, according to structure-activity studies and kinetic analysis(9Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKC also entailed interactions between the N-myristoylated peptides and the phospholipid cofactor of the enzyme(9Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Cys-containing analog N-myristoyl-RKRCLRRL (NmRKRCLRRL) was by far the most potent of the peptides examined in the inhibition of the catalytic-domain fragment, but its inhibitory potency was reduced by an order of magnitude in the presence of the sulfhydryl-reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (0.5 mM), providing evidence that its inhibitory mechanism may include an irreversible component(9Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NmRKRCLRRL appeared to be an active site-directed inhibitor, because of its structural relatedness to the peptide substrate NmRKRTLRRL, and because its Ki against the catalytic-domain fragment in the presence of DTT, i.e. under conditions of reversible inhibition (Ki = 50 ± 2 μM) agreed within a factor of two with the Km(app) of NmRKRTLRRL (Km(app) = 29 ± 2 μM)(9Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Cys residue present in the active-site of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and conserved in PKC isozymes (13Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar) is a likely target for active site-directed irreversible inactivators of PKC. Cys residues surrounded by multiple basic residues have been shown to be highly reactive in studies of disulfide exchange reactions(16Snyder G.H. Cennerazzo M.J. Karalis A.J. Field D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6509-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the DTT-sensitive inhibitory activity of NmRKRCLRRL against the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC could be due to the reactivity of the Cys residue in the sequence RKRCLRRL at the active site of PKC. In this report, we test the hypothesis by analyzing the effects of the peptide RKRCLRRL on PKC catalysis. We show that RKRCLRRL is a DTT-sensitive, active site-directed irreversible inactivator of PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment. This is the first report of irreversible inactivation of a protein kinase by a peptide-substrate analog composed entirely of naturally occurring, unmodified amino acids (12Salerno A. Lawrence D.S. J.

All assays were performed in triplicate and expressed as the mean value ± S.D. The peptide-substrate analog RKRCLRRL potently inhibited Ca2+- and PS-stimulated PKC-catalyzed histone phosphorylation (Fig. 1, closed circles), under conditions where the closely related peptides RKRALRRL (Fig. 1, triangles) and RKRTLRRL (15O'Brian C.A.

The inhibitory activity of RKRCLRRL was quenched by the sulfhydryl-reducing agent DTT (0.5 mM) (Fig. 1, open circles). Limited trypsinolysis of PKC produces a regulatory-domain fragment and an active catalytic-domain fragment, which is independent of the cofactors Ca2+ and PS(24Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2962-2972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the catalytic-domain fragment was purified from the regulatory-domain fragment and intact PKC by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography, potent inhibition of its Ca2+- and PS-independent histone kinase activity was achieved by RKRCLRRL (Fig. 2, closed circles), and the inhibitory activity of RKRCLRRL was abolished by the inclusion of 0.5 mM DTT in the reaction mixtures (Fig. 2, open circles). RKRCLRRL was equally effective against a catalytic-domain fragment preparation that contained the regulatory-domain fragment and residual intact PKC (data not shown). Neither RKRTLRRL (15O'Brian C.A.

New Drugs. 1991; 9: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) nor RKRALRRL (1-40 μM) antagonized the histone kinase activity of the catalytic-domain fragment. The DTT-sensitive nature of the inhibitory activity of RKRCLRRL against PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment and the lack of inhibitory activity observed with RKRCLRRL analogs containing single amino acid substitutions at Cys provide evidence that the inhibitory mechanism may involve the formation of a DTT-sensitive covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. Comparison of the inhibitory curves generated by RKRCLRRL in Figure 1:, Figure 2: reveals the similarity of the inhibitory potencies of RKRCLRRL against PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment. This supports an inhibitory mechanism that involves interactions between RKRCLRRL and the catalytic domain of PKC.Figure 2:DTT-sensitive antagonism of the histone kinase activity of the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC by RKRCLRRL. The Ca2+- and PS-independent histone kinase activity of the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of RKRCLRRL (•) and RKRCLRRL plus 0.5 mM DTT (○). The 100% activity value was 678 ± 34 nmol of 32P transferred per min/mg.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly test whether RKRCLRRL forms an irreversible complex with PKC, we determined the effect of dilution of preincubation mixtures containing the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC and RKRCLRRL on the inhibitory potency of RKRCLRRL in histone kinase assays. In these experiments, we preincubated the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC with inhibitory concentrations of RKRCLRRL, and then the preincubation mixture was diluted into histone kinase assay mixtures so that the final RKRCLRRL concentration would be weakly inhibitory or non-inhibitory. The ability of RKRCLRRL to inhibit the catalytic-domain fragment in the histone kinase assay following preincubation with the catalytic-domain fragment was compared with its inhibitory potency in the absence of preincubation. Table 1 shows that following preincubation with the catalytic-domain fragment, RKRCLRRL fully retained its inhibitory activity in the histone kinase assay, even when the final concentration of RKRCLRRL in the assay mixture was non-inhibitory. For example, when the catalytic-domain fragment was preincubated for 10 min at 30°C with 6 μM RKRCLRRL and then added to histone kinase assay mixtures at a final RKRCLRRL concentration of 0.2 μM, RKRCLRRL inhibited the histone kinase reaction by 83 ± 7%, but 0.2 μM RKRCLRRL was non-inhibitory when it was added directly to the histone kinase assay mixtures (Table 1). Following preincubation of the catalytic-domain fragment with RKRCLRRL, a similar degree of inhibition was observed in the histone kinase assay across a broad range of final RKRCLRRL concentrations (0.2-2.0 μM) (Table 1). These data show that RKRCLRRL inactivates PKC by forming an irreversible complex with the catalytic domain of the enzyme.Table I Open table in a new tab The structural similarity between RKRCLRRL and the PKC substrate RKRTLRRL (Km(app) = 20 μM) (15O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Liskamp R.M. de Bont D.B. Earnest L.E. van Boom J.H. Fan D. Invest. New Drugs. 1991; 9: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the PKC inactivator RKRCLRRL is active site-directed. To test this, we examined the ability of PKC substrates to protect the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC against inactivation by RKRCLRRL(12Salerno A. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13043-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic-domain fragment was preincubated with 6 μM RKRCLRRL as described in the legend to Table 1, except that various PKC substrates and substrate analogs were included in the preincubation mixture. These experiments were designed so that following dilution of the preincubation mixture into histone kinase assay mixtures, the substrate Mg-[γ-32P]ATP was present in the reaction mixtures at its standard concentration (6 μM [γ-32P]ATP), and the peptide-substrate analogs, FARKGALRQ and RKRALRRL, were present at a concentration (10 μM) where they had no inhibitory activity against the histone kinase reaction(9Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Table 2 shows that Mg-[γ-32P]ATP, Mg-[γ-32P]ATP plus FARKGALRQ, and Mg-[γ-32P]ATP plus RKRALRRL each afforded protection against inactivation of the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC by RKRCLRRL. The protection of the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC against RKRCLRRL that was afforded by Mg-[γ-32P]ATP alone and in the presence of defined peptide-substrate analogs provides evidence that RKRCLRRL is an active site-directed inactivator of PKC. As another test of whether the peptide operates as an active site-directed PKC inactivator, we examined the ability of the peptide to inactivate casein kinase II. Casein kinase II differs from PKC in that its substrate recognition motif does not include basic residues but instead requires acidic residues. In assays of the phosphorylation of casein by casein kinase II performed under conditions described in (25Sanghera S. Charlton L. Paddon H.B. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we found that RKRCLRRL did not inhibit casein kinase II activity at peptide concentrations up to and including 100 μM.Table II Open table in a new tab To identify structural features of RKRCLRRL that play important or essential roles in its DTT-sensitive inactivation of PKC, we examined the abilities of RKRCLRRL analogs to inactivate PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment in a DTT-sensitive manner. Among the peptides studied, RKRCLRRL was the most potent inactivator of PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment (Table 3). A truncated analog lacking the C-terminal Leu residue (RKRCLRR) was also a potent inactivator of PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment (Table 3). However, analogs lacking a single basic residue (KRCLRRL and RKRCLR) either failed to inactivate PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment or did so only very weakly, and KRCLR, which lacked two of the basic residues of the parent peptide, was inactive (Table 3). These results indicate the critical importance of the basic residues of RKRCLRRL in its DTT-sensitive inactivation of PKC. The failure of KRCLR to inactivate PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment could be due to weak reactivity of the Cys residue as a consequence of the limited number of basic residues in the peptide compared to RKRCLRRL (16Snyder G.H. Cennerazzo M.J. Karalis A.J. Field D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6509-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and/or to a weak affinity for the active-site of the enzyme compared to RKRCLRRL, since the closely related peptides RKRTLRRL and KRTLR serve as PKC substrates with Km(app) values of 20 and 300 μM, respectively(15O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Liskamp R.M. de Bont D.B. Earnest L.E. van Boom J.H. Fan D. Invest. New Drugs. 1991; 9: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26de Bont H.B.A. Liskamp R.M.J. O'Brian C.A. Erkelens C. Veeneman G.H. Van Boom J.H. Intl. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1989; 33: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The affinity of the N-myristoylated analog NmKRCLR at the active-site of PKC can be expected to be superior to that of KRCLR, because the related peptide NmKRTLR reversibly inhibits the histone kinase activity of the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC (IC50 = 200 μM), whereas KRTLR does not(27O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Liskamp R.M. de Bont D.B. van Boom J.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effects of NmKRCLR on the histone kinase activity of the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC, in order to determine whether the sequence KRCLR was sufficiently basic to provide the Cys residue with DTT-sensitive reactivity at the active-site of the enzyme. NmKRCLR effected 50% antagonism of the histone kinase activity of the catalytic-domain fragment at a concentration of 8 ± 2 μM in the absence of DTT and at a concentration of 27 ± 3 μM in the presence of 0.5 mM DTT. At 20 μM NmKRCLR, the loss of catalytic-domain fragment activity was 95 ± 9% in the absence of DTT and 33 ± 2% in its presence. These results provide evidence that NmKRCLR antagonizes the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC by a mixed mechanism that includes reversible and irreversible components. Thus, three flanking basic residues appear sufficient to endow the Cys residue of the peptide-substrate analog with the ability to undergo a reaction with the catalytic domain of PKC that irreversibly inactivates the enzyme in a DTT-sensitive manner. Table 3 shows that substitution of Cys with its D-isomer in RKRCLRRL weakened the peptide in the inactivation of PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment, indicating a degree of stereoselectivity in the inactivation of the enzyme by the peptide.Table III Open table in a new tab The studies described above were carried out using a purified preparation of a PKC isozyme mixture that contained PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ. These isozymes have closely related peptide and protein substrate specificities(28Huang K.P. Huang F.L. Nakabayashi H. Yoshida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Using preparations of the purified isozymes, we determined that RKRCLRRL effected DTT-sensitive inactivation of each isozyme with comparable efficacy. 50% inactivation of PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ was achieved at RKRCLRRL concentrations of 11 ± 2, 6 ± 2, and 4 ± 1 μM, respectively, and in each case, inactivation was quenched by 0.5 mM DTT. In this report, we present data in support of a mechanism of PKC inactivation by the peptide-substrate analog RKRCLRRL that most likely involves the formation of a covalent complex between the active site of the enzyme and the inhibitor peptide. Our evidence for this is as follows. 1) RKRCLRRL antagonized the histone kinase activity of PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment with similar efficacies, and in both cases activity was fully restored by 0.5 mM DTT. In addition, analogs of RKRCLRRL with single amino acid substitutions at Cys (RKRALRRL and RKRTLRRL) were non-inhibitory against the histone kinase activity of PKC and the catalytic-domain fragment. The unique ability of RKRCLRRL compared with other RKRXLRRL peptides to inactivate PKC provides evidence that the high reactivity of the Cys residue in the basic peptide environment compensates for the weak binding affinity of the peptide at the active site in the inactivation mechanism. 2) The inactivated complex of catalytic-domain fragment and RKRCLRRL was stable upon dilution. 3) Substrates and substrate analogs protected the catalytic-domain fragment of PKC against inactivation by RKRCLRRL. 4) The isozymes PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ each have a Cys residue that is homologous to a highly reactive active-site Cys residue in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase(13Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). RKRCLRRL inactivated PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ in a DTT-sensitive manner with similar efficacies. This is the first report of irreversible inactivation of PKC by an active site-directed peptide. S-Thiolation is the formation of mixed disulfides between proteins and low molecular weight thiols; this reaction has been observed between endogenous low molecular weight thiols and several cellular proteins, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase(30Ravichandran V. Seres T. Moriguchi T. Thomas J.A. Johnston R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25010-25015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Collison M.W. Thomas J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PKC appears to be a good candidate for S-thiolation, because a highly reactive active-site Cys residue present in cAMP-dependent protein kinase is conserved in PKC isozymes(13Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). In addition, the peptide-substrate analog RKRCLRRL appears to be a good candidate for an S-thiolation reaction at the active-site of PKC, because the reactivity of Cys residues has been shown to be increased by as much as 106-fold by flanking basic residues, in studies of disulfide-exchange reactions (16Snyder G.H. Cennerazzo M.J. Karalis A.J. Field D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6509-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). DTT reversal of the inactivation of PKC by RKRCLRRL provides evidence that the enzyme and synthetic peptide are linked in the inactivated complex by a disulfide bond. This supports an inactivation mechanism that entails S-thiolation of the active-site of PKC by the peptide. In view of these results, the possibility that cellular proteins subject to regulation by S-thiolation in vivo(30Ravichandran V. Seres T. Moriguchi T. Thomas J.A. Johnston R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25010-25015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Collison M.W. Thomas J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) may include PKC and perhaps other protein kinases deserves attention. Attempts to analyze the kinetics of PKC inactivation by RKRCLRRL revealed an extremely rapid reaction that was complete within several seconds, even at 4°C. 2N. E. Ward and C. A. O'Brian, unpublished observations. Thus, successful analysis of the kinetics of PKC inactivation by RKRCLRRL will require the development of an applicable continuous assay of PKC activity, e.g. an assay system based on spectral or fluorescent changes associated with product formation. However, even in the absence of kinetic analysis, it is clear that RKRCLRRL, which achieves >50% inactivation of PKC and its catalytic-domain fragment at a concentration of 10 μM (Figure 1:, Figure 2:), is a highly potent active site-directed peptidic inactivator of PKC. In addition, the Km(app) of the closely related peptide RKRTLRRL (Km(app) = 20 μM) (15O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Liskamp R.M. de Bont D.B. Earnest L.E. van Boom J.H. Fan D. Invest. New Drugs. 1991; 9: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) provides an estimate of the affinity of RKRCLRRL for the active-site of PKC. Recently, peptide-substrate analogs of cAMP-dependent protein kinase that contain an intrachain disulfide bond, e.g. Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Cys = Cys-Gly, were shown to affinity label the enzyme by undergoing a disulfide-exchange reaction at its active site(12Salerno A. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13043-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This report shows that the presence of a single cysteine residue at the phospho-acceptor position of a synthetic peptide-substrate analog containing multiple basic residues may result in novel active-site affinity labels of PKC and perhaps other protein kinases that phosphorylate highly basic sequences.

The Na+ activation, which takes place at the luminal side of the membrane, depended on the ATP concentration and the type of buffer used.

H,K-ATPase is an intrinsic membrane protein complex, which is located in the secretory vesicles of the gastric parietal cell and is able to generate a proton gradient of 106 across the membrane in exchange for potassium. Na,K-ATPase, present in plasma membranes of all mammalian cells, is responsible for the maintenance of the intracellular levels of potassium and sodium and can generate a Na+ gradient of about 101.2. The catalytic α-subunits of both ATPases have been cloned from several species and have a molecular mass of 112-114 kDa(1Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol.

Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase have additionally in common that they both contain a glycosylated β-subunit with a core mass of 33-35 kDa(5Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Such β subunit is absent in other related ATPases like Ca-ATPases from both sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane(3Schwarz W. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 77-80Crossref Google Scholar). Both Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase belong to the P-type ATPases as (i) the catalytic subunits can be phosphorylated at an aspartyl residue, (ii) they are inhibited by submicromolar vanadate concentrations, and (iii) two different enzyme conformations (E1 and E2) can be distinguished. The E1 form has high-affinity cation binding sites at the cytosolic side, whereas the E2 form has high affinity cation binding sites at the luminal side of the membrane. The Post-Albers scheme, which is based on the alternate formation of these two conformations, is often used to explain the reaction mechanisms of both Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase. In the overall H,K-ATPase reaction cycle(7Rabon E.C. Reuben M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Van Uem T.J.F. De Pont J.J.H.H.M.

Due to the common characteristics the ion specificities of the two ion transporting enzymes have been studied intensively. Proton-like effects of sodium on H,K-ATPase (a “Na,K”-ATPase activity) (9Polvani C. Sachs G. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 11899-11902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ljungström M. Wallmark B. Mardh S. Acta Chem. Scand. B. 1979; 33: 618-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 15Ljungström M. Vega F.V. Mardh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but the dephosphorylation reaction has been claimed to be either activated(16Wallmark B. Stewart H.B. Rabon E. Saccomani G. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5313-5319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or insensitive toward Na+(15Ljungström M. Vega F.V. Mardh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two studies (9Polvani C. Sachs G. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17854-17859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rabon E.C. Bassilian S. Sachs G. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19594-19599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that Na+ behaves more like H+ and drives the enzyme to an E1 conformation. In preliminary experiments De Jong (18De Jong, M. L., 1986, Ph.D thesis, Conformational changes of (K,H)-ATPase, p. 112, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.Google Scholar) observed that the K0.5 for ATP in the phosphorylation reaction was considerably increased by Na+. Such an effect of Na+ cannot easily be explained when Na+ behaves like H+. It could be explained, however, when Na+ behaves as a K+ analog. In that case the ion activates the dephosphorylation reaction and drives the enzyme into the E2 conformation. With the use of ion-tight H,K-ATPase vesicles, where no activation of the dephosphorylation process by extravesicular cations can occur(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and by comparing their properties with those of leaky vesicles, where such activation does occur, the effects of Na+ on the total ATPase reaction, the steady-state ATP phosphorylation level, the dephosphorylation reaction, and the E1 ⤔ E2 transition were investigated. The results show that Na+ displays K+-like actions under those reaction conditions, thus activating the dephosphorylation process at the luminal side of the membrane and driving the enzyme into an E2 conformation by interacting at the cytosolic side. Gastric H,K-ATPase was purified from pig gastric mucosa as reported previously(20Swarts H.G.P. Van Uem T.J.F. Hoving S. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fresh (ion-tight) H,K-ATPase vesicles were collected at the 0.25 M sucrose and 7% Ficoll (w/v) in 0.25 M sucrose interface and stored at 4°C. Leaky vesicles were prepared by diluting these ion-tight vesicles in 20 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0), followed by centrifugation (100,000 × g), resuspension in water and freeze drying. This preparation was stored at −20°C in 0.25 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0). In the experiments in which ion-tight H,K-ATPase vesicles were used the osmolarity was kept constant with 0.25 M sucrose and 50 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0). Protein was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All data was expressed in Lowry protein values which are 1.5 times higher than the Bio-Rad values(20Swarts H.G.P. Van Uem T.J.F. Hoving S. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The K+- and Na+-activated ATPase activities were determined with a radiochemical method. For this purpose 0.1-22 μg of H,K-ATPase was added to 100 μl of medium, which contained 0.01 μM to 5 mM [γ-32P]MgATP (specific activity 0.15-200 mCi•mmol−1), 0.1-5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ouabain, 20-50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and varying concentrations of either KCl or NaCl. After incubation for 1-30 min at 37°C the reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) charcoal in 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and after 10 min at 0°C the mixture was centrifuged for 10 s (10,000 × g). To 0.15 ml of the clear supernatant containing the liberated inorganic phosphate (32Pi), 3 ml of OptiFluor (Canberra Packard, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was added and the mixture was analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. In general, blanks were prepared by incubating the enzyme in the absence of KCl but in the presence of 0.1 mM SCH 28080. 1The abbreviations used are: SCH 280802-methyl-8-[phenylmethoxy]imidazo-1(1-2-a)pyrine-3-acetonitrileCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. 2-methyl-8-[phenylmethoxy]imidazo-1(1-2-a)pyrine-3-acetonitrile carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. H,K-ATPase (5-50 μg ml−1) was incubated at 22°C for 3-10 s in 100 μl of medium containing 20 μM [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity 0.03-0.3 Ci mmol−1, Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, UK), 0.12 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0). The reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in 0.1 M phosphoric acid. After filtration over a Schleicher & Schüll filter (type ME28, 1.2-μm pore width, Dassel, Germany) and washing with stopping solution, the 32P-protein content was determined. Blanks were prepared by denaturing the enzyme prior to incubation with the phosphorylation medium(20Swarts H.G.P. Van Uem T.J.F. Hoving S. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Under iso-osmotic conditions ion-tight H,K-ATPase vesicles were incubated at room temperature in 0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM MgCl2, and NaCl, KCl, or choline chloride in the concentrations indicated. After 10 s the ATP phosphorylation capacity was determined by incubation for another 3 s in the presence of 50 nM [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphoenzyme complex was collected as described above. After 10 s phosphorylation with 1 μM [γ-32P]ATP (see above), 10 volumes of 20 μM non-radioactive ATP and the ligand to test were added and incubated for 3-10 s at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml of stopping solution. The amount of [32P]phosphoenzyme was determined as described above. Dephosphorylation is expressed as the decrease in acid-stable phosphoenzyme during the incubation period (% hydrolysis). The Na+ and K+ contents of the enzyme preparations and media were determined flame photometrically (FCM 6343, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). When the K+ levels were determined in 125 mM NaCl solutions, the recovery of KCl was checked by the addition of 10 μM KCl as an internal standard. The recovery of K+ was 10.6 ± 1.6 μM (mean ± S.D., n = 6). The K+ concentrations of 125 mM CsCl, LiCl, NaCl, NH4Cl, RbCl, and choline chloride in 20 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0) were 6.8, 2.5, 4.8, 5.2, 320, and 3.6 μM, respectively. The homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose (BDH, Poole, UK), 20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.0) contained 4.4 μM K+. TlCl (10 mM), dissolved in this buffer, contained 6 μM K+. The K0.5 value is defined as the concentration of effector giving the half-maximal activation or phosphorylation level and the I50 as the value giving 50% inhibition of the activity or level. From data on the phosphorylation level (E-P) and ATP hydrolysis rate, v, the apparent dephosphorylation rate constant, k (turnover number), was calculated using the equation: v = k•[E-P](22Reenstra W.W. Bettencourt J.D. Forte J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (3.0 mCi mmol−1, Radiochemical Centre) was diluted with nonradioactive Tris-ATP (pH 7.0). Nigericin, valinomycin (Sigma), and CCCP (Aldrich) were dissolved in ethanol and diluted to their final concentrations of maximally 100 μM in 1% ethanol. SCH 28080 (2-methyl-8-[phenylmethoxy]imidazo-(1-2-a)pyridine-3-acetonitrile) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Wallmark, Hässle, Mölndal, Sweden. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Fig. 2A shows the combined effects of ATP and NaCl on the steady-state ATP phosphorylation level of gastric H,K-ATPase. At 22°C and pH 7.0, in the absence of NaCl the ATP affinity was very high, the K0.5 being about 0.01 μM(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Upon increasing the [Na+], the ATP affinity decreased. The maximal phosphorylation level tended to be slightly reduced at higher [Na+], indicating that the inhibition is not simply a competition between Na+ and ATP. If the effect of Na+ on the steady-state ATP phosphorylation was compared with its effect on the overall ATP hydrolysis rate, at 37°C, and in the presence of 20 μM ATP (Fig. 2B), it was observed that, whereas the ATP phosphorylation decreased (I50 = 150 mM) the ATPase activity was activated at low (K0.5 = 14 mM), and inhibited at high NaCl concentrations. These observations suggest that the rate-limiting step in the reaction cycle changes at the different [Na+] tested. From the data of Fig. 2B the turnover number of the enzyme can be calculated using the equation v = k•[E-P], where v represents the rate of ATP hydrolysis and k the dephosphorylation rate constant. NaCl increased this turnover number up to a value of 350 min−1 in the presence of 60 mM NaCl. This value is about 15% of the maximal activity obtained in the presence of 1 mM ATP and 10 mM K+(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). At high concentrations of NaCl (>100 mM) the turnover number decreased again. The stimulatory effects of Na+ suggest that this ion, like K+, increases the dephosphorylation rate, which is the rate-limiting step in the H,K-ATPase reaction cycle under normal conditions. The Na+-activated ATP hydrolysis rate, measured at 37°C in the presence of 50 mM NaCl, 20 μM ATP, 0.12 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0), was totally insensitive toward the specific Na,K-ATPase inhibitor ouabain, indicating that the activation of the ATP hydrolysis is not due to contamination with Na,K-ATPase. Moreover, the specific H,K-ATPase inhibitor SCH 28080 inhibited under these conditions the ATP hydrolysis by nearly 95% (I50 = 0.08 μM). Either in the presence of 1 mM KCl instead of 50 mM NaCl, or in the presence of both NaCl and KCl the I50 value for SCH 28080 increased to 0.2 μM, probably due the antagonism between SCH 28080 and K+. Although ouabain (1 mM) did not change the inhibition profile of SCH 28080, it was included in most experiments to ensure that any contaminating Na,K-ATPase activity was blocked. Corrections for the basal Mg-ATPase activity, which is the activity in the absence of K+ or Na+ and in the presence of 0.1 mM SCH 28080, were also made. The properties of the overall H,K-ATPase activity depend on the conditions in which the assay is performed(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that the maximal H,K-ATPase activity and the degree of K+ activation of the ATP hydrolysis depend on the ATP concentration. At low ATP concentration (5 μM), K+ activation occurred with a K0.5 value of 0.04 mM. The activity obtained with optimal K+ concentrations (0.4 mM) was about 20% of the maximal activity obtained with 0.5 mM ATP and 5 mM K+. At an ATP concentration of 5 mM the K0.5 value for K+ was 1.0 mM, which is 25 times the value at 5 μM ATP. High concentrations of K+ inhibited the ATP hydrolysis rate, the inhibition occurring at lower [K+] when less ATP was used. The activation of the ATPase activity by Na+ depended, like the K+-activation, on the ATP concentration (Fig. 3B). In the presence of 5 μM ATP we observed a K0.5 for Na+ of 10-20 mM while in the presence of 5 mM ATP this value increased to about 100 mM. The maximal Na+-ATPase activity reached levels of about 15-25 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg of protein per h, which is about 15% of the activity obtained in the presence of K+. The data of Fig. 3B show that the maximal “Na+”-ATPase activity hardly changed with the concentrations of ATP used. This indicates that the affinity for ATP is far below 5 μM. In the presence of 20 mM NaCl only one (high) affinity ATP site could be detected, K0.5 for ATP = 0.25 μM. High concentrations of ATP did not increase the Na+-ATPase activity further as they did in the presence of KCl. The inhibitory action at high cation concentrations apparently overruled the activation process. Imidazole, a tertiary amine, is an antagonist of the activation by K+ of the H,K-ATPase activity(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the presence of 20 μM ATP, 0.12 mM Mg2+ and 50 mM imidazole/acetate (pH 7.0), a K0.5 of 80 mM for Na+ was determined. This value is about five times higher than in the presence of 50 mM Tris acetate (see Fig. 3B). So, there is an antagonism between tertiary amines and Na+, which is similar to the antagonism between tertiary amines and K+. In order to test whether the activating effect of Na+ is due to Na+ itself or to a contamination by K+, two different types of experiments were carried out. First, the amount of K+ in the different media was determined with a flame photometer. The 125 mM NaCl stock solution used for most experiments contained only 4.8 μM K+. The extra addition of K+ to NaCl media was completely recovered, indicating that high [Na+] did not disturb the K+ determination. Since K+ at these concentrations had hardly any effect, this finding already suggests that the Na+ effect is not due to contaminating K+. Second, with the use of the K+ ionophores, valinomycin and nigericin, the K+ activation of ATPase activity was studied in ion-tight vesicles. In this type of H,K-ATPase vesicles the K+ activation site is located intravesicularly(20Swarts H.G.P. Van Uem T.J.F. Hoving S. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that in these vesicles the basal (Mg-ATPase) activity was very low and that activation by extravesicular (cytosolic) K+ was not possible. In the presence of nigericin, a K+ for H+ exchanger, the K+ activation profile was nearly identical to that of a leaky H,K-ATPase preparation, in which the K+ activation site is freely accessible (Fig. 3A). In the presence of the specific K+ ionophore valinomycin, however, there was only a slight activation, probably due to the ionophore-induced voltage difference across the vesicle membrane(23Lewis S.A. Wills N.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 715-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The lack of activation could partially be overcome by the extra addition of the protonophore CCCP. When similar experiments (Fig. 4B) were carried out in the presence of Na+, activation of the ATP hydrolysis was only observed in the presence of nigericin, which ionophore can also, but to a lesser extent, exchange Na+ for H+(23Lewis S.A. Wills N.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 715-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Valinomycin either alone or in combination with CCCP could not induce a Na+-activated Pi production due to the absolute selectivity of this ionophore for K+. These observations indicate that the activation of the ATP hydrolysis by Na+ is not due to a contamination by K+, but that Na+ itself activates the dephosphorylation process at the luminal (intravesicular) side of the membrane. The dephosphorylation reaction was studied in leaky H,K-ATPase preparations. Fig. 5A shows that both Na+ and K+ enhance its rate, with an apparent K0.5 of 10 and 0.02 mM, respectively (ratio Na+/K+ = 500). Choline chloride had no effect on the dephosphorylation process, excluding effects of ionic strength. In ion-tight vesicles Na+ was unable to activate the dephosphorylation reaction. In the presence of nigericin the dephosphorylation reaction was again activated. This shows directly that the activating Na+ site is located intravesicularly. Extravesicular (cytosolic) Na+ did not change the kinetics of the K+-activated dephosphorylation reaction (studied with valinomycin and CCCP, data not shown). Helmich-De Jong et al.(24Helmich-De Jong M.L. Van Emst-De Vries S.E. Swarts H.G.P. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), showed that ATP inhibits the basal and the K+-activated dephosphorylation reaction. With the use of ion-tight vesicles, in combination with valinomycin and CCCP it was possible to show that the site of inhibition is located at the extravesicular (cytosolic) side of the membrane. Parallel to K+, the Na+-activated dephosphorylation rate was also reduced in the presence of ATP (data not shown). In closed vesicles no activation of the luminal K+ (or Na+)-site by extravesicular ligands can occur, see above and (20Swarts H.G.P. Van Uem T.J.F. Hoving S. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At low ATP concentrations it is feasible to study the effects of these ligands on the E1⤔E2 transition by determining the steady-state ATP phosphorylation level(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), as only the E1 enzyme can be phosphorylated by ATP. Fig. 5B shows that both Na+ and K+, but not choline chloride, reduce the phosphorylation level at suboptimal ATP concentrations. In the presence of either 0.4 mM K+ or 35 mM Na+ (ratio Na+/K+ = 88) the amount of phosphoenzyme obtained was reduced by 50%. Other related monovalent cations such as Tl+, Rb+, NH4+, Cs+, and Li+ had I50 values of 0.005, 0.4, 0.5, 20, and 65 mM, respectively. This result indicates that Na+, like K+ and the other monovalent cations, drives the enzyme to the E2 conformation. When the extravesicular proton concentration in these experiments was reduced 10 times, by changing the pH to 8.0, the affinity for ATP in the steady-state ATP phosphorylation reaction decreased, K0.5 = 0.2 μM (Fig. 6) compared to 0.01 μM at pH 7.0 (see Fig. 2A, (19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)). Fig. 6 shows, in addition, that Na+ did not increase the phosphoenzyme level at suboptimal ATP concentrations, demonstrating the absence of any H+-like properties of Na+ under these conditions. Na+ only led to a decrease in the steady-state phosphorylation level (I50 values for Na+ were 6, 18, and 40 mM in the presence of 0.2, 2, and 20 μM ATP, respectively), underlining once more the ATP/Na+ antagonism. In this study data is presented which clearly shows that Na+ ions behave like K+ ions in the H,K-ATPase reaction cycle. Na+ activates the dephosphorylation reaction (steps 5 and 6, Fig. 1) in a preparation in which both cytosolic and luminal ion binding sites are accessible. In intact H,K-ATPase vesicles no enhancement of this process was observed, showing that the Na+-activation site, like the K+-site(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25Stewart B. Wallmark B. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2682-2690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is located intravesicularly (the luminal side). In ion-tight vesicles the phosphorylation capacity was used as a measure for the relative amount of the E1 form of H,K-ATPase, as only the E1 form can be phosphorylated and the dephosphorylation reaction cannot be activated by the ligands Na+ or K+. It was found that Na+, like K+(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), reduces the phosphorylation capacity of the enzyme, meaning that Na+ shifts the equilibrium to the E2 conformation (reactions −1 and −7). Even at low H+ concentrations no increase in the steady-state ATP phosphorylation level, measured at suboptimal conditions, could be observed, excluding H+-like properties of Na+. The observation that cytosolic Na+ has K+-like properties, driving the enzyme to the E2 form, is in line with the inhibition of the ATP phosphorylation rate (13Wallmark B. Mardh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11899-11902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ljungström M. Wallmark B. Mardh S. Acta Chem. Scand.

Acta. 1984; 769: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the reduction of the H+-transport rate (15Ljungström M. Vega F.V. Mardh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Stewart B. Wallmark B. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2682-2690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ray T.K. Nandi J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by this ion. Variable effects of Na+, in the absence of K+, on the overall H,K-ATPase activity (steps 1-7) have been reported(13Wallmark B. Mardh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11899-11902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ljungström M. Vega F.V. Mardh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These variations might be due to differences in assay conditions, since we demonstrate that high concentrations of ATP (Fig. 3B), Mg2+, and imidazole have marked effects on the Na+ (and the K+(19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)) affinity in the overall ATPase reaction. Moreover, high [Na+] inhibits the latter activity. In the overall ATPase experiments we were able to show that Na+, like K+, at relative low concentrations activated the hydrolysis of ATP, via the dephosphorylation reaction (steps 5 and 6), and inhibited the ATPase reaction at high concentrations by driving the E1⤔E2 equilibrium to the right (steps −1 and −7). The combination of both effects explains the increasing effect of Na+ on the K0.5 for ATP in the phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 1A). In both Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, K+ activates the dephosphorylation reaction. The role of K+ can be performed in both enzymes by Na+ ((27Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 855: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and (28Neufeld A.H. Levy H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6493-6497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and this study), although the affinity for Na+ is much lower than that of K+. In both enzymes K+ also drives the equilibrium E1⤔E2 to the E2 form, whereas Na+ (for Na,K-ATPase) and H+ (for H,K-ATPase) shifts the equilibrium to the E1 form. The present study shows that with H,K-ATPase Na+ can perform the latter role of K+, but not that of H+. With Na,K-ATPase there is no indication for an E2 promoting effect of Na+ in the absence of K+. The ion specificity of Na+ and H+ as E1 promoters in Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, respectively, is much more prominent. Neither an effect of H+ on the steady-state phosphorylation level of Na,K-ATPase (11Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. Swarts H.G.P. Helmich-de Jong M.L. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 854: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) nor of Na+ on this parameter of H,K-ATPase (this study) was observed. The data seems to conflict with studies by Rabon et al.(17Rabon E.C. Bassilian S. Sachs G. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19594-19599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who used a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled H,K-ATPase preparation to test the effects of Na+. The fluorescence of this modified enzyme, incapable of being phosphorylated by ATP, increased in the presence of Na+. Although an antagonism between H+ and Na+ was observed, the increase in fluorescence was interpreted as an increase in the E1 form of the enzyme, analogous to that with Na,K-ATPase. It has not been proven, however, that an increase in fluorescence under these circumstances actually means a shift of the E2⤔E1 equilibrium to the right. Another interpretation is that the E2Na form has a higher fluorescence than the E2K form. A comparable “H+-like” effect of Na+ has also been observed by Polvani et al.(9Polvani C. Sachs G. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17854-17859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who measured an increased 22Na uptake in H,K-ATPase vesicles, under special conditions of low [H+] (pH > 8.0), [Na+] between 2 and 5 mM, and the presence of intravesicular K+. The 22Na+ uptake and the ATP hydrolysis rates were in a 1:1 ratio activated by luminal K+. Cytosolic Na+ failed to increase the hydrolytic rate of ATP, what should have been the case if Na+ has H+-like properties. Therefore, it is most likely that they measured H+- and K+-activated ATP hydrolysis together with an exchange of cytosolic 22Na+ for luminal K+ (normally the K+-K+ exchange) and not a Na,K-ATPase activity. Our observation of an antagonism between ATP and either K+ or Na+ was not made by Wallmark et al.(16Wallmark B. Stewart H.B. Rabon E. Saccomani G. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5313-5319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main difference between their and our approach is that they used constant (2 mM) Mg2+ and we always used 0.1 mM Mg2+ in excess of [ATP]. In our experience the latter combination gives maximal activities. When we also used 2 mM Mg2+ we found the effect of ATP on the K0.5 for K+ activation to be reduced, e.g. at 20 μM ATP the K0.5 for K+ doubled from 0.16 mM at 0.12 mM Mg2+ (our conditions) to 0.33 mM at 2 mM Mg2+ (conditions of Wallmark et al.(16Wallmark B. Stewart H.B. Rabon E. Saccomani G. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5313-5319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The maximal H,K-ATPase activity was not affected. Hence, Mg2+ decreases the affinity of the enzyme for K+ and consequently the K+/ATP antagonism. Another fundamental question is: if Na+ can substitute for K+ as activating cation for H,K-ATPase, why then is the maximal activity only 15% of that with K+? The most likely explanation is the difference between the affinities at the luminal and the cytosolic K+ sites. Since Na+ has a higher affinity for the cytosolic site than for the luminal site (affinity ratios of 88 versus 500), the inhibitory action on the ATP hydrolysis overrules the stimulatory effect. We cannot exclude that an additional reason for the lower activity of H,K-ATPase in the presence of Na+ is due to a decreased maximal rate of dephosphorylation in the presence of the latter ion. In the Post-Albers model (Fig. 1) the activating K+ site (and/or Na+ site) is located at the luminal side of the membrane. Upon K+ binding to the E2-P complex the enzyme changes to a conformation with “low” affinity for K+ at the cytosolic side. Our findings indicate that the ligands (K+ or Na+) which are promoters of this “on reaction” (steps 5 and 6) are, at the same time inhibitors of the “off reaction” (steps 7 and 1).

https://openalex.org/W1990743214,"The effect of disruption of the Golgi apparatus on 25-hydroxycholesterol-mediated transcriptional suppression and activation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase was examined. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, brefeldin A (BFA) caused dose-dependent inhibition of 25-hydroxycholesterol-mediated suppression of mRNAs for four sterol-regulated genes: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase, and the low density lipoprotein receptor. BFA prevented suppression whether added prior to or following a 4-h pretreatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol. In the presence of BFA (1 μg/ml), 25-hydroxycholesterol-mediated suppression of mRNAs for HMG-CoA reductase, the low density lipoprotein receptor, and farnesyl-diphosphate synthase was almost completely blocked. HMG-CoA synthase mRNA was 80-90% suppressed by 25-hydroxycholesterol compared with 50-60% suppression in the presence of BFA. These effects of BFA were not due to alterations in mRNA stability. Disruption of the Golgi apparatus, as assessed by staining with a fluorescent lectin, correlated with concentrations of BFA that reversed mRNA suppression. Monensin was also found to block the effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol on suppression of HMG-CoA reductase. However, this ionophore decreased the other three sterol-regulated mRNAs to a similar degree as 25-hydroxycholesterol. In contrast to CHO cells, BFA-resistant PtK1 cells displayed normal down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase and an intact Golgi apparatus in the presence of BFA and 25-hydroxycholesterol. Cholesterol esterification in CHO cells was stimulated to a similar extent by BFA (1 μg/ml) and 25-hydroxycholesterol, and simultaneous treatment of CHO cells with both compounds was 60-70% additive. These results suggest that an intact Golgi apparatus is required for 25-hydroxycholesterol-mediated suppression of mRNA."

In this study we sought to identify regions of the CyRE, distinct from the STAT-binding site, which are important to CNTF/LIF-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by the CyRE in NBFL cells, and considered the C/EBP proteins as candidate transcription factors which may interact with these regions. We find evidence that IL-6, similar to the effects of the CNTF family of cytokines, activates transcription through the CyRE in NBFL cells. We identify sites within the CyRE which bind purified C/EBP proteins and demonstrate that these sites are important for activity of the CyRE. These C/EBP-related binding sites interact with nuclear proteins from NBFL cells, one of which is activated in a protein synthesis-dependent manner by CNTF/LIF. We find no evidence that C/EBP proteins from NBFL cells interact with these C/EBP-related sites. Thus, CNTF/LIF regulation of VIP gene expression depends on activation of protein synthesis-dependent and -independent nuclear signaling pathways interacting with multiple regions of the CyRE.

Plasmids containing mCyA, mCyB, and mCyC sites were constructed by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis as described by Ho et al.(63Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The following pairs of oligonucleotides were used to create the mutant sites within Cy1luc: mCyA: 5′-ACAAATTTCCAGACATGGTTAGGCTTAATTCATTTAATTT-3′ and 5′-AAATTAAATGAATTAAGCCTAACCATGTCTGGAAATTTGT-3′; mCyB 5′-GATTAGAAAATATGATGGATCGGAGCAGGATATTCTTTTA-3′ and 5′-TAAAAGAATATCCTGCTCCGATCCATCATATTTTCTAATC-3′; and mCyC 5′-TCCCAGTTGACAGCTGAGAATTGTACCAGAGTTCCTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACAGGAACTCTGGTACAATTCTCAGCTGTCAACTGGGA-3′. In each case these oligonucleotides were paired with oligonucleotide A1 or A4 with Cy1luc as a template, to create new fragments. These fragments were gel-purified and used as template in a subsequent polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides A1 and A4 as primers. The resultant 180-bp fragment was digested with KpnI and PstI, gel-purified, and ligated into KpnI-PstI-digested ΔeRSVluc (24Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol.

Each RNA sample was separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde, 1.4% agarose gels and electrotransferred onto GeneScreen membranes (DuPont NEN). Northern blots were hybridized as described previously (22Symes A.J. Rao M.S. Lewis S.E. Landis S.C. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blots were washed to 0.2 × SSC (1 × = 0.015 M NaCl, 0.0015 M sodium citrate pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS at 65°C. VIP mRNA was detected with a 580-bp HindIII-EcoRI fragment of human VIP cDNA(66Tsukada T. Horovitch S.J. Montminy M. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. DNA. 1985; 4: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with a probe for the unregulated internal reference gene cyclophilin(67Danielson P.E. Forss-Petter S. Brow M.A. Cavaletta L. Douglass J. Milner R.J. Sutcliffe J.G. DNA. 1988; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were digitized with a Microtek scanner and analyzed with the NIH Image 1.41 program. The relative densitometric readings were normalized to cyclophilin mRNA to account for loading differences between lanes. Synthetic complementary oligonucleotides with GGG or GATC overhangs were annealed and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Klenow fragment.

Nuclear extracts (approximately 15 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.5 ng of labeled probe (approximately 250,000 counts/min) for 20 min at room temperature before running on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1) in 0.5 × TBE at 200 V.

We have previously shown that treatment of NBFL cells with CNTF, LIF, and oncostatin M increases levels of VIP mRNA(22Symes A.J. Rao M.S. Lewis S.E. Landis S.C. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Rao M.S. Symes A. Malik N. Shoyab M. Fink J.S. Landis S.C. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the related cytokine IL-6 did not increase VIP mRNA(23Rao M.S. Symes A. Malik N. Shoyab M. Fink J.S. Landis S.C. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The failure of IL-6 to increase VIP mRNA may be due to differences in the signal transduction pathways among the different cytokines or to the absence of functional IL-6 receptors in NBFL cells. To test these hypotheses, NBFL cells were treated with a soluble form of the ligand-binding subunit of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). The sIL-6R has been shown to confer IL-6 responsiveness to IL-6-resistant cells (39Taga T. Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Miki D. Hamaguchi M. Davis S. Shoyab M. Yancopoulos G.D. Kishimoto T. Proc.

Yawata H. Kobayashi I. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 168-173PubMed Google Scholar). Together, IL-6 and sIL-6R induced VIP mRNA, but neither of these proteins alone did (Fig. 1A). VIP mRNA was induced 5-fold by IL-6 and sIL-6R, 8-fold by CNTF, 10-fold by LIF, and 11-fold by oncostatin M. This experiment suggests that the failure of IL-6 alone to induce VIP mRNA is due to the absence of functional IL-6 receptors in NBFL cells. Functional IL-6 receptors can be reconstituted by the addition of sIL-6R permitting induction of VIP mRNA in response to IL-6. We have previously mapped the CNTF, LIF, and oncostatin M-responsive region of the VIP promoter to a 180-bp CyRE(24Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish whether IL-6 induction of VIP mRNA was mediated through the same region as that utilized by CNTF, LIF, and oncostatin M, NBFL cells were transfected with the CyRE-luciferase reporter construct, Cy1luc(24Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cy1luc contains the 180-bp VIP CyRE upstream of a heterologous promoter ΔRSV and linked to the luciferase reporter gene. In the absence of sIL-6R, treatment"

The recombinant catalytic subunit was fully active and exhibited enzymatic properties similar to that of the native two-subunit enzyme including the possession of an associated 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity.

Calf thymus (Lee et al., 1984) and human (Lee et al., 1991) pol δ have been isolated to near homogeneity and consist of two subunits of 125 and 50 kDa. The 125-kDa polypeptide was demonstrated to be the catalytic polypeptide by activity staining (Lee et al., 1991). A central role of this enzyme activity in mammalian DNA replication has been established through the investigation of the in vitro replication of the SV40 genome. A complex array of accessory proteins are also involved. The functional insertion of pol δ at the replication fork requires the actions of replication factor C, which leads to the recruitment of PCNA to the primer template terminus followed by binding of pol δ. Replication protein A, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, further potentiates the activity of the pol δ complex. The replication of SV40 has now been reconstituted in vitro using isolated components (Waga et al., 1994). DNA polymerase δ proliferating cell nuclear antigen polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin. Because of the importance of the DNA polymerases, they have been intensively studied, and there is now a great deal of information on the primary structures of these enzymes from a wide range of organisms that span a broad evolutionary spectrum. Cloning of the human pol α cDNA showed that it is a member of a family of polymerases that include T4 DNA polymerase (Wong et al., 1988; Wang, 1991). cDNAs for the calf thymus (Zhang et al., 1991) and human (Chung et al., 1991; Yang et al., 1992) pol δ catalytic subunit have been cloned, as have the genes for the yeast homologues of pol δ (Boulet et al., 1989; Pignede et al., 1991). Mammalian and yeast pol δ are more highly conserved with each other than with their homologous pol α enzymes (Yang et al., 1992). Multiple sequence alignments have shown that there is a highly conserved central core region in the pol α family that is thought to contain most of the catalytic site (Wang, 1991). There is less conservation in the C-terminal regions, which, however, do contain two zinc finger regions that are thought to be involved in DNA binding. Analysis of the N-terminal regions show that there is some conservation among the members of the pol δ group of enzymes, and that these regions are conserved to some extent in herpes simplex virus type I DNA polymerase (Yang et al., 1992). The regions involved in the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of yeast pol δ have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis (Simon et al., 1991). Little is known of the regions of pol δ that are involved in its functional interactions with other proteins. We have attempted to develop a system for the overexpression of pol δ that will provide a ready means for the preparation of the enzyme and for study of its structure-function relationships. In this report we describe the successful expression of the active catalytic subunit of pol δ using a vaccinia virus/pTM1 expression system in BSC-40 cells. BSC-40 cells were a continuous line of African green monkey cells derived from BSC-1 cells (Hruby, et al., 1979). Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The recombinant vaccinia virus, which expresses the T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase (vvTF7-3) was grown in BSC-40 cells from plaque-purified stocks (Fuerst et al., 1986). Plasmid pTM1 contains the encephalomyocarditis virus untranslated leader region downstream of pT7. The NcoI site contains the translation initiation codon and can be used for insertion of 5′ end of the protein-coding segment (Moss et al., 1990). Plasmid pALTER-1 was purchased from Promega (Dotto et al., 1981, 1984; Dotto and Zinder, 1983). This plasmid is a phagemid, defined as a chimeric plasmid containing the origin of a single-stranded DNA bacteriophage. This phagemid produces single-stranded DNA upon infection of host cells with a helper phage. pALTER-1 contains two genes for antibiotic resistance. One of them, for tetracycline resistance, is always functional. The other, for ampicillin resistance, has been inactivated. An oligonucleotide restores ampicillin resistance to the mutant strand during the mutagenesis reaction. The pol δ cDNA was inserted in pALTER-1 with BamHI and HindIII cloning sites. The construct (pALTER-pol δ) was then used to transform E. coli JM109 competent cells. The single-stranded DNA was obtained after infection of the host cells with the helper phage R408. Two synthetic oligonucleotides (containing the corrected sequences based on the human DNA pol δ genomic sequence), 5′-ACCATCCCGCGGCTCCGT and 5′-AACTTGGCCATCAGCCGGGACAG, were annealed to the single-stranded DNA template at the same time as the oligonucleotide, which restores ampicillin resistance to the mutant strand during the mutagenesis reaction, and were subsequently treated with T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase to produce a double-stranded circular molecule. The DNA was transformed into a repair minus strain of Escherichia coli (BMH 71-18 Mut S), and the cells were grown in the presence of ampicillin. The ampicillin-resistant plasmids were purified and then used to transform E. coli JM109 competent cells. The correctness of the insertion (pALTER-pol δ) was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxynucleotide termination method (Sanger et al. 1977). PCR amplification was used for the insertion of the coding sequence of human DNA pol δ into the pTM1 vector at a site between the pT7 and T7 terminator. The template used for PCR was the pALTER-pol δ cDNA clone. The sense and antisense primers were based on the human DNA pol δ sequence. The primer 5′-AAGCGCCATGGATGGCAAGCGG was used for 5′ end of the coding sequence with an engineered NcoI site (underlined residues) at the initiating methionine codon. The second strand primer was 5′-GGCTGGGAGCTCCAGCCAGTT, which had a SacI site (underlined residues). The primers were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase before use. The PCR conditions used were 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min for 25 cycles. The product was a single band of about 0.8 kilobase pairs that provides the 269 amino acid residues of human DNA pol δ from the initiation site to the SacI site. After purification using a Centricon 100 filter followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, the PCR product was digested with NcoI and SacI and then ligated into the pTM1 vector, which had been previously digested with NcoI and SacI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The construct (pTM1-δ-5′) was then used to transform E. coli DH5α-competent cells. The correctness of the inserted DNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The human DNA pol δ cDNA clone (Yang et al., 1992) was digested with SacI and BamHI. After purification by agarose gel electrophoresis, the 2.7-kilobase pair fraction from SacI to termination codon was selected and then was ligated into pTM1-δ-5′, which had been previously digested with SacI and BamHI. After transformation of E. coli DH5α competent cells, the single colony harboring the full-length pol δ coding sequence in pTM1 (pTM1-δ) was selected. The DNA sequence of pTM1-δ was again confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977). BSC-40 cells were grown in 20 100-mm dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. When the cells had grown to 90% confluence, they were infected with vvTF7-3 with multiplicity of infection = 10 for 2 h. Innoculum was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10 ml) containing 5 mg/ml lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 15 μg of pTM1-δ was added to each dish. The culture was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The innoculum was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then were harvested into phosphate-buffered saline by using a rubber policeman. Cells were combined from all 20 dishes, centrifuged, and then were suspended in 40 ml of ice-cold isotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 10 min. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 18 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and were incubated on ice for 10 min. 50 μl of β-mercaptoethanol and 2 ml of 10% Triton X-100 were added. The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and then were centrifuged at 2000 rpm with Sorvall RT 6000 for 5 min. Centrifugation was repeated twice. The supernatant, which contains cytoplasm, was carefully pipetted for loading onto an immunoaffinity column. The pellet, which contains the nuclear portion, was resuspended in 20% ethylene glycol, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium bisulfate, pH 7.5, and was sonicated at 50 watts for 2 min on ice with intermittent cooling. It was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and then was used to load onto the immunoaffinity column. The extract (120 ml) was adjusted to a conductivity equivalent to 40 mM NaCl and was loaded onto a monoclonal DNA polymerase δ immunoaffinity column (10 × 1 cm), equilibrated with TGEE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.8). The column was washed with the same buffer containing 0.4 M NaCl. This was followed by elution of pol δ with elution buffer (30% ethylene glycol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.7 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, pH 7.9). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the fractions containing pol δ were identified by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting with C-terminal monoclonal antibody to pol δ, and assaying for pol δ activity. The pooled fractions (30 ml) were dialyzed against HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) and were then loaded on a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with HEPES buffer. The column was washed with same buffer. The enzyme was then eluted with a series of salt concentrations (85, 200, and 600 mM, and 1 M KCl) in the HEPES buffer at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and polymerase δ activity assay. Sparsely primed poly(dA)/oligo(dT) and poly(dA-dT) were used as the templates as described by Lee et al.(1984). For the poly(dA)/oligo(dT) assay, the standard reaction (100 μl) contained 0.25 OD units/ml poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (20:1), 200 μg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES, pH 6.0, 100 cpm/pmol [3H]TTP, and 0.2-0.4 units of pol δ in the presence of 0.2 μg of PCNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 37°C and were terminated by spotting onto DE81 filter papers. Filters were washed 4 times with 0.3 M ammonium formate, pH 7.8, and once with 95% ethanol and counted as described previously (Lee et al., 1991). For the poly(dA-dT) assay, the standard reaction (100 μl) contained 0.4 OD units/ml of activated poly(dA-dT), 100 μg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.04 mM dATP, and 100 cpm/pmol [3H]TTP and 10 μl of enzyme. After incubation for 37°C for 60 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate. The precipitates were collected, washed, and counted as described previously (Lee et al., 1991). 32P-5′-end labeled oligo(dT)16 was annealed to poly(dA)2000 (Midland Co.). The labeled template was purified on a Centricon 100 filter. The reaction mixture (60 μl) contained 0.33 OD units/ml [32P]poly(dA)/oligo(dT), 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 80 μM dTTP, 0.2 μg of PCNA, and 5 ng (about 1 unit) of pol δ activity. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 20 mM EDTA, 100 μg/ml salmon testes DNA. The DNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in deionized formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanole. The samples were heated at 100°C for 2 min, cooled on ice, and subjected to electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 8% urea. This was assayed by measuring the release of [3H]dTMP from [3H]dT50 as described previously (Lee et al., 1984). Each reaction mixture contained 2 μM [3H]dT50 (200-300 cpm/pmol), 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 0.005 mg of BSA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2-0.4 units of pol δ in a final volume of 0.06 ml. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and were terminated by spotting 20 μl onto DE81 filter papers. Filters were washed 4 times with 0.3 M ammonium formate, pH 7.8, and once with 95% ethanol and counted as described previously (Lee et al., 1984). This was performed using pol δ C-terminal monoclonal antibody (Zeng et al., 1994). After electrophoresis in 5-15% gradient gels, the protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Prestained protein standards (Sigma) were used as molecular weight markers and also to provide visual confirmation of efficient transfer. The nitrocellulose blot was incubated with 5% BSA in phosphatebuffered saline as a blocking agent. The blot was then incubated with pol δ C-terminal monoclonal antibody for 12 h at 25°C. After washing 3 times with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, the blot was incubated with biotinylated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin followed by incubation with streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxides complex. Color development was performed by incubation with 4-chloro-1-naphthol and hydrogen peroxide and was terminated with sodium azide. These were performed by the Bradford method(1976) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. We have characterized the gene structure of the 125-kDa catalytic polypeptide of human DNA pol δ 2L.-S. Chang, L. Zhao, L. Zhu, M.-L. Chen, and M. Y. W. T. Lee, submitted for publication. and have sequenced all of the exons. Comparison of the genomic nucleotide sequence for the coding regions with that of the pol δ cDNA, which we previously reported (Yang et al., 1992) revealed several differences, two of which result in changes in amino acid sequence. Both of these are in the N terminus; His-119 and Asn-173 in the cDNA sequence are Arg and Ser, respectively, in the genomic sequence. It is possible that these differences could represent polymorphic variations, but we are certain of the genomic sequences because we have now reexamined this region of the sequence using additional cDNA clones from libraries different from those we had previously used. We therefore mutated the cDNA sequence to the genomic sequence by construction of the Arg-119/Ser-173 variant. The corrected coding sequence of pol δ was inserted into the pTM1 vector. Subsequent reisolation and DNA sequencing showed that the insert contained the correct sequence. The pTM1 plasmid allows the insertion of a coding sequence for a given protein under the control of the T7 promoter and also contains the 5′-untranslated sequence of the encephalomyocarditis virus untranslated leader region. This plasmid was designed to allow expression of foreign messages in mammalian cells in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase following transfection with the plasmid. Eukaryotic expression is based on simultaneous infection with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vvTF7-3) that synthesizes the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Efficient translation of the uncapped mRNAs in mammalian cells is due to the presence of the encephalomyocarditis virus untranslated leader region (Nakano et al. 1991). For transient expression in mammalian cells, an infection/transfection protocol is performed with the plasmid and the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (Nakano et al., 1991). The insertion of the coding sequence for the 125-kDa catalytic polypeptide of pol δ into the pTM1 vector was found to allow its expression as a soluble protein in the cytosol of BSC-40 cells. The pTM1 vector without an insert was used as a control, and under the conditions used for Western blotting, pol δ was undetectable in cytosolic extracts of BSC-40 cells. The SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of crude cytosolic extract protein between control and experimental are shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, pol δ was detected only in the BSC-40 cell extracts that had been infected/transfected with vaccinia virus (vvTF7-3) and pTM1-δ. Further experiments confirmed that the expressed pol δ was largely present in the cytosol and not in the nucleus, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Based on the relative intensity of the blots, it is apparent that almost all of the expressed pol δ polypeptide is in the cytosolic extract. Assays for pol δ activity (using poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as a template in the presence of PCNA) in the crude extracts of cells that had been transfected with pTM1-δ and the control plasmid pTM1 showed that only the cytosolic extracts from cells expressing pol δ displayed activity. Estimation of the degree of expression based on the specific activity of the purified enzyme (see below) indicated that the pol δ polypeptide represented approximately 1% of the soluble cytosolic protein. Recombinant human DNA pol δ was purified to homogeneity by a procedure involving chromatography on immunoaffinity chromatography procedure, 3Y. Jiang, S.-J. Zhang, S.-M. Wu, and M. Y. W. T. Lee, submitted for publication. followed by chromatography on a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column. The purification was monitored by assay of pol δ activity, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. The elution profile on immunoaffinity chromatography is shown in Fig. 2. It is seen that the eluted enzyme has activity toward both poly(dA-dT) and poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as the templates. In the latter case, the activity was assayed in the presence of PCNA and was approximately 10-fold higher than the activity assayed using the poly(dA-dT) template. The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, a characteristic of DNA polymerase δ also co-eluted with the DNA polymerase activity. The SDS-PAGE and the Western blot across the peak of activity is shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that the activity peak is co-incident with the presence of a 125-kDa polypeptide that is strongly Western blotted by an antibody against pol δ. The peak fractions still contained a number of minor bands.Figure 3:Western blot analysis of the fractions obtained by immunoaffinity chromatography. Samples (50 μl) from the column fractions shown in Fig. 2 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained for protein with Coomassie Blue (lowerpanel) and Western blotted using a C-terminal antibody against pol δ (upperpanel; only the 125 kDa band is shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The peak fractions of the immunoaffinity column were then passed through a single-stranded DNA cellulose column. After this step, the recombinant protein was near homogeneous and was Western blotted by a monoclonal antibody to the C-terminal region of human pol δ (Fig. 4). The summary of the purification achieved is shown in Table 1. Approximately a 100-fold purification was required, i.e. the pol δ polypeptide is expressed at about 1% of the soluble cytosolic protein. The levels of enzyme activity and protein far exceed those present in the BSC-40 cytosol, so that contamination of the expressed protein with endogenous BSC-40 pol δ, or for that matter, with vaccinia virus DNA polymerase, is unlikely, particularly since it was purified by a specific immunoaffinity chromatography procedure.Table I Open table in a new tab Like the native enzyme, recombinant pol δ is inhibited by aphidicolin (Fig. 5). The recombinant and native human enzyme have the same sensitivity to KCl (Fig. 6). This is in marked contrast to the bacterial overproduced yeast polymerase δ, which is markedly stimulated by 250 mM KCl (Brown et al., 1993), whereas the wild-type yeast enzyme is inhibited by KCl. Recombinant and native human polymerase δ are both resistant to 10 μM BuAdATP (not shown).Figure 6:Inhibition of recombinant pol δ by KCl. Purified human placental pol δ (Lee et al. 1991) and purified recombinant pol δ were assayed using poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as the template in the presence of PCNA and in the presence of increasing amounts of KCl. The results were expressed as relative activities (squares, recombinant pol δ; circles, native pol δ.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The response of recombinant pol δ to PCNA was examined. The recombinant enzyme was sensitive to PCNA and was stimulated 4.5-fold by 300 ng of PCNA. A highly purified human placental pol δ preparation (Lee et al., 1991) purified by conventional means was stimulated 10-fold by the same amount of PCNA (Fig. 7). In the same experiments, examination of the reaction products showed that the stimulation of recombinant pol δ by PCNA is also due to an effect on processivity. In the course of the construction of the pTM1-δ vector, we used PCR amplification of the 5′ end (see “Experimental Procedures”). One of the full-length constructs was found to contain two PCR errors, such that nucleotide 467 was changed from A to G and nucleotide 473 was converted from T to C. This changed the amino acid sequence such that His-142 and Phe-144 were changed to Arg and Ser, respectively. The double mutant (H142R/F144S) was expressed and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and single-stranded DNA cellulose. This mutant exhibited DNA polymerase δ activity but was found to have lost its sensitivity to PCNA (Fig. 8). Assays in which the replication factor C, replication protein A, and ATP were added together with PCNA also did not restore PCNA sensitivity (not shown). The behavior of this fortuitous mutant in which there are two mutations in the N-2 region strongly suggests that this region in the N terminus is involved in PCNA binding. We report here the first successful overexpression of the catalytic subunit of human pol δ as a soluble active protein using a vaccinia virus/plasmid vector system. The amounts of protein expressed were estimated to be 1% of the soluble protein. In practical terms, about 22 μg of p125 could be prepared to near homogeneity using a simple 2-step procedure involving immunoaffinity chromatography and single-stranded DNAcellulose chromatography. Isolation of the mammalian pol δ is extremely tedious, and only microgram amounts of purified enzyme can be obtained (Lee et al., 1984, 1991). Only a handful of laboratories have ever reported preparations of demonstrable purity owing to the difficulties of its isolation, and even highly purified pol δ preparations commonly consist of multiple polypeptide components (Goulian et al., 1990; Feher and Mishra, 1994). There are no previous reports of the expression of mammalian pol δ, and we also have encountered extreme difficulty in expression of this cDNA in E. coli. Yeast DNA pol δ has been overexpressed in E. coli (Brown and Campbell, 1993) as an insoluble and inactive aggregate, and the recombinant enzyme was obtained after solubilization with urea and renaturation. These studies show that the vaccinia virus (vvTF7-3)/pTM1 system is effective for the expression of the human pol δ catalytic subunit. The use of the vaccinia virus/pTM1 infection/transfection system has been shown to allow for very efficient overexpression of genes in mammalian cells (Fuerst and Moss, 1989; Moss et al., 1990) and also allows for rapid screening of the mutants. Levels of the foreign transcripts have been estimated to be as high as 30% of the total steady-state RNA in the cytoplasm of the infected cells after 24 h as shown for T7-lac Z transcripts (Fuerst and Moss, 1989). The recombinant vv/T7 hybrid expression system offers certain advantages over the baculovirus system. For example, site-directed mutants of the target gene can be constructed rapidly in the expression vector pTM1, and their biological activities can be assayed by the infection/transfection protocol (Moss et al., 1990). In addition, protein synthesized in insect cells are likely to be different from those synthesized in mammalian cells with respect to some of post-translational modifications (Miller, 1988). Thus, the vaccinia virus system allows for overexpression in a mammalian cell context that provides some assurance that any post-translational modifications would be those normally encountered. Our studies show that the recombinant p-125 is almost exclusively found in the cytoplasm of the BSC-40 cells. Our findings differ from those of the adenovirus DNA polymerase, which was transiently expressed using the same vv/pTM1 expression system (Nakano et al., 1991) in that the recombinant adenovirus polymerase was distributed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. It may be possible that translocation of pol δ-p125 to the nucleus is a relatively slow process, or alternatively, it may be a regulated process. Recombinant pol δ was characterized and exhibited essentially similar catalytic properties as the native enzyme. However, we observed that its PCNA response was consistently lower than that of enzyme isolated from human placenta. It has been previously suggested that the catalytic polypeptide is not responsive to PCNA and that this property is conferred by the p50 subunit. The evidence is inferential and is based on isolation of enzyme preparations that consist only of the 125-kDa subunit and do not respond to PCNA. Mouse cells have been suggested to possess of two forms of pol δ, one consisting of only a 125 kDa, and the second having two subunits of 125 and 50 kDa. The first is not stimulated by PCNA, suggesting that the 50-kDa subunit is required for the interaction of polymerase δ with PCNA (Goulian et al., 1990). Rabbit reticulocyte pol δ was reported to have a single subunit of 122 kDa (Goscin and Byrnes, 1982). This form was later reported by Lu and Byrnes(1992) to be a PCNA-independent form. The same authors have also purified a PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase δ from rabbit bone marrow that is similar to the calf thymus DNA polymerase δ in consisting of two subunits and being responsive to PCNA. Chiang et al.(1993) purified a pol δ from Drosophila to near homogeneity, which consisted of a single 120-kDa polypeptide and is not stimulated by PCNA. Our results show that unequivocally the human p125 subunit does respond to PCNA. Our data agree with that of Brown and Campbell(1993), who showed that overexpressed yeast pol δ in E. coli is stimulated about 2.5-3-fold by PCNA. Nevertheless, our findings do indicate that the p50 subunit may be important in the response of the catalytic subunit to PCNA, since the degree of stimulation by PCNA was consistently lower than that of the native two subunit enzyme consisting of 125- and 50-kDa subunits. In other preliminary studies, we have shown by reconstitution experiments that the addition of the p50 subunit also potentiate the response of the recombinant p125 subunit to replication factor C and replication protein A in the presence of PCNA. The vv/pTM1 system thus provides a useful means for preparation of the catalytic subunit as well as a means for structure-function studies of pol δ by mutagenesis. Examination of an adventitious double mutant in which 2 residues in the N terminus, His-142 and Phe-144, were mutated to Arg and Ser, respectively, showed that its response to PCNA was severely attenuated. This strongly suggests that this region is involved in PCNA binding. This is the first report of a site-directed mutant that is affected in its PCNA binding and is consistent with other studies using synthetic peptides that suggest that the PCNA binding region of pol δ is localized to a region between residues 129 and 149 (Zhang et al., 1995)."

T cell activation with CD3 monoclonal antibody is accompanied by a decreased synthesis of phosphatidylserine due to the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum.

The second primers (21- to 30-mers), which contained the desired mutation, were D560C (5′-GATCACTTCACAACCGCGTCC-3′), V562C (5′-CGCCAGTTCGATACATTCATCACCGCGTCC-3′), E564C (5′-TGTTTTCGCCAGGCAGATCACTTCATC-3′), and D560C/V562C (5′-GCCAGTTCGATACATTCACAACCGCG-3′). (The underlined bases are those giving the desired mutation.) The EcoRI/AatII primer and the mutation primer were annealed to the parental plasmid template, and DNA syntheses were carried out as described(9Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA was subsequently transformed into mutS strain EM588, and the DNAs isolated from overnight cultures were digested with EcoRI and transformed into strain JM109. Plasmids isolated from individual colonies that failed to cut with EcoRI but that cut with AatII were candidates for DNA sequencing. Plasmid preparations and DNA sequencing were done by conventional methods(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pYYC184 carried two genes (one encoding D560C PoxB and the other encoding V562C PoxB) and was derived from plasmids pYYC170 and pYYC173. Plasmid pYYC170 was digested with PstI, resected to blunt ends with T4 DNA polymerase, and then digested with SacI. The PstI-SacI fragment containing the D560C PoxB gene was isolated from an agarose gel and cloned between the SmaI and SacI sites of plasmid pYYC173 giving pYYC184. The wild and mutant PoxB proteins were partially purified as described earlier (3Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4348-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cell pellets were suspended in buffer A (0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA) plus 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cells were broken by sonication and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was heated to 60°C for 5 min, and denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate fractionation was done on the heat-treated supernatant, and the 40-70% ammonium sulfate cut was fractionated on a DEAE-cellulose column as described previously(13Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 312-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the high level of enzyme production, the enzyme was found to be 90% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following column fractionation. The wild type enzyme was stored at −10°C in 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 6.0) containing 25% glycerol and was stable for 2 months. However, the cysteine-substituted PoxB proteins (especially V562C) tended to polymerize during storage and gradually lost activity. Oxidase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically with K3Fe(CN)6 as the electron acceptor(8Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity due to cross-linking was assayed by incubating the enzyme with pyruvate and TPP-MgCl2 in the absence of lipid activators. When the enzyme was cross-linked in the presence of Cu-PHT, the enzyme was first passed through a Speedy desalting column (bed volume, 5 ml; Pierce), and the eluant was collected into fractions and assayed. When the enzyme was cross-linked in the presence of DTTox, the reaction mixture could be assayed directly without desalting. Partially purified mutant PoxB (~10 μg of protein) was incubated with 0.1 M sodium pyruvate, 0.2 mM TPP, and 10 mM MgCl2 in a final volume of 10 μl for 5 min at room temperature. To this mixture was then added Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) to 25 mM and Cu-PHT (to 0.2 mM CuSO4 and 0.6 mM 1,10-phenanthroline). The reaction mixture (25 μl) was incubated at 37°C for various time intervals. When the high concentration of Cu-PHT was used, it was 0.4 mM CuSO4 plus 1.2 mM 1,10-phenanthroline. Triton X-100 (when added) was at a final concentration of 1%. When DTTox was used as an oxidizing reagent, the reaction mixture (10 μl) described above was supplemented with Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to 50 mM and DTTox to 0.1 M in a final volume of 25 μl followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C. After cross-linking, samples were withdrawn and an equal volume of NEM sample buffer (see below) was added. The samples were then heated to 100°C for 2 min and loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresis system was that of Laemmli(14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and dried, and the intensities of the cross-linked dimeric and the monomeric protein bands were measured by densitometry. The percentage of cross-linking was the integrated area of cross-linked protein band divided by the sum of the integrated area of cross-linked protein band plus that of monomeric protein band. NEM sample buffer contained 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mM EDTA, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 20 mM NEM, and the running buffer of Laemmli (25 mM Tris base, 0.192 M glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3). The NEM was added just before use. For reduction of the disulfide cross-links, the sample buffer contained 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme was cross-linked by DTTox as described above and was then partitioned between the aqueous and Triton X-114 phases as described previously(4Grabau C. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts from strains carrying plasmid pYYC180 or plasmid pYYC184 were prepared as described above to the heat step. The supernatants from the heat step with or without cross-linking were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and, following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride; pore size, 0.45 μm) (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was treated first with anti-PoxB antibody and then with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.). The protein bands were detected using 1-Step™ 4-CN (Pierce). The site-specific disulfide cross-linking approach, based on that of Falke and Koshland(15Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), was to introduce cysteine residues into the C-terminal region of PoxB and assay disulfide subunit cross-linking by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A potential difficulty in this approach was the 10 native cysteine residues of PoxB(1Grabau C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5449-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, prior chemical modification experiments indicated that 9 of these cysteine residues were in nonreactive environments and that the 10th was reactive only in the absence of TPP(16Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6023-6027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that disulfide cross-linking via the native cysteine residues should not complicate the analysis of cross-linking due to introduced cysteine residues. Indeed, no cross-linking of wild type PoxB subunits was observed upon oxidation with either O2 (catalyzed by Cu-PHT) (Fig. 1, lane 2) or DTTox (data not shown). We first converted Asp-560 of PoxB to cysteine because previous work showed that D560P PoxB was a fully functional enzyme(4Grabau C. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the D560C oxidase was fully active both in vivo and in vitro, and the lipid binding properties of the protein were unchanged. Upon addition of Cu-PHT, virtually no cross-linking of the D560C oxidase was observed in the absence of pyruvate and TPP-Mg2+, but, in the presence of pyruvate plus TPP-Mg2+, about half of the enzyme subunits were converted to disulfide-linked dimers (Fig. 1, lanes 6-9). Cross-linking was very rapid and essentially complete within 2 min of adding the oxidation catalyst (Fig. 1). Some cross-linking was observed in the absence of Cu-PHT, presumably due to oxidation catalyzed by metal ion impurities in the buffer. Qualitatively similar results were observed with two other cysteine-substituted proteins, V562C (Fig. 2) and E564C (data not shown), although these mutant proteins gave differing extents of subunit cross-linking. The extent of cross-linking of the V562C oxidase was 80% (Fig. 2), whereas E564C cross-linking was only 15%. Cross-linking was also catalyzed by a very mild oxidizing agent, the oxidized form of DTT (Fig. 3). The addition of DTTox gave similiar extents of cross-linking, although the rate of cross-linking was considerably slower than that seen with Cu-PHT (Fig. 3). Cross-links formed by either catalyst were readily reversed by addition of a reducing reagent (lanes 10 of Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Moreover, the D560C oxidase was efficiently cross-linked either when in aqueous solution or when bound to Triton X-100 micelles (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7 and Fig. 2, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). These results indicated that the paired C termini structure was compatible with both the aqueous and lipid bilayer environments.Figure 3:Cross-linking of the D560C and V562C oxidases by DTTox. Samples of partially purified D560C or V562C preparations were first incubated in the presence of pyruvate plus TPP-MgCl2 and subjected to oxidation by DTTox as described under “Materials and Methods.” At the time intervals indicated, samples were taken into an equal volume of NEM loading buffer and loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and dried, and the densities of the dimeric and monomeric protein bands in the cross-linked samples were measured by densitometry for calculation of the percentage of cross-linking.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lipid bilayer binding of E. coli pyruvate oxidase results in a significant increase in enzyme activity as assayed with artificial electron acceptors(2Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 756-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if disulfide cross-linking stabilizes a structure involved in lipid binding, cross-linking might then result in enzyme activation. Indeed, cross-linking led to activation of PoxB. Cross-linking the subunits of the D560C oxidase resulted in an increase in activity from the basal level to half of that given by chymotrypsin treatment in the absence of lipid activators (Table 1). The extent of enzymatic activation due to cross-linking was proportional to the degree of cross-linking. Enzymatic activation associated with cross-linking was also observed with a mutant protein defective in lipid binding/activation (D560C/E564P based on E564P) (4Grabau C. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1).Table I Open table in a new tab The cross-linked D560C species retained the ability to associate with lipid micelles. PoxB is known to partition into Triton X-114 in the presence of pyruvate plus TPP-Mg2+(4Grabau C. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both the uncross-linked and cross-linked D560C oxidase species retained this property (Fig. 4). Moreover, cross-linked D560C was protected by Triton X-100 from chymotrypsin digestion (data not shown). These results indicate that the cross-linked D560C structure was compatible with the formation of a stable protein-lipid complex. However, cross-linking did not correct the lipid binding defect of a mutant protein lacking this property. The D560C/E564P mutant protein cross-linked normally, but both the cross-linked and uncross-linked tetramers failed to partition into Triton X-114 (Fig. 4). Recent data that argue strongly that the PoxB monomers are arranged in tetrahedral symmetry within the tetramer (see “Discussion”) suggested that more than two subunits might be able to associate. To test this hypothesis we constructed a mutant PoxB containing cysteine substitutions at two positions within the PoxB C terminus. The cysteine residues were separated by only 1 residue, such that the geometric restraints of the peptide and disulfide bonds prohibit formation of intramonomer cross-links(17Sowdhamini R. Srinivasan N. Shoichet B. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this protein, PoxB D560C/V562C, a cross-linked dimer, could potentially cross-link to another monomer or a dimer. Western blot analysis of Cu-PHT-cross-linked D560C/V562C PoxB showed a significant new protein band that migrated more slowly than the dimer band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). This new protein band migrated faster than a 200-kDa standard protein, suggesting that it may be a cross-linked trimeric species. However, it was also possible that the new band was a dimer cross-linked at 2 different cysteine residues (e.g. cross-linking of D560C of one subunit to V562C of another subunit). Such heterologous disulfide cross-linking can give anomalous mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as has been observed in disulfide cross-linkings of the Tar chemotaxis receptor protein(18Simon M.I. Pakula A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4144-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In order to test this possibility, we constructed plasmid pYYC184, which carried two different poxB genes, one that encoded D560C PoxB and another that encoded V562C PoxB. Previous work (7Wang A.Y. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10959-10966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that when two PoxB gene alleles are co-expressed, heterotetrameric species are formed in addition to homotetramers, and thus heterologous disulfide cross-linking would occur in preparations from these cells. Western blot analysis of Cu-PHT-cross-linked crude extracts of a strain carrying plasmid pYYC184 showed only a single dimer protein band (Fig. 5, lane 4), indicating that the heterologous disulfide D560C-V560C dimers had the same mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as the individual homologous disulfide dimers. We believe the new band of Fig. 5 is the cross-linked trimer. Although other bands were present that migrated more slowly than the putative trimeric species, the trimer band was the most distinct and prominent band. Moreover, the putative trimer band was formed when the protein concentration was decreased during cross-linking (data not shown), indicating that it was due to cross-linking within tetramers rather between tetramers. Our results strongly argue that a required step in lipid bilayer binding of pyruvate oxidase involves a pairing of the C termini of two subunits. We and others have argued that a putative α-helix proposed to involve residues 558-572 is involved in lipid binding(4Grabau C. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Recny M.A. Grabau C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14287-14291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative helix is strongly amphipathic in character(19Recny M.A. Grabau C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14287-14291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a straightforward model for lipid bilayer binding would involve pairing of two helices at their hydrophilic faces followed by partition of the resulting hydrophobic paired structure into the lipid bilayer. This is consistent with the lipid binding properties of the isolated C-terminal segment(20Zhang T.-F. Hager L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the effects of introduction of a proline residue into the putative helix(4Grabau C. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the finding that PoxB-lipid interaction is driven by hydrophobic interactions(3Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4348-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Grabau C. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that the paired C termini structure penetrates deeply into the lipid bilayer because the strength of binding of PoxB to phosphatidylcholine bilayers depends on the length of the phospholipid acyl chain(3Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4348-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Grabau C. Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that more than two subunits can be cross-linked in double cysteine substitution mutants strongly suggests that the subunits of the PoxB tetramer are arranged in a tetrahedron. In the other possible arrangement, a square planar array, it would seem difficult for more than two C termini to become juxtaposed. Consistent with the proposed PoxB tetrahedron, the crystal structure of a Lactobacillus enzyme (also called pyruvate oxidase) has been solved at high (2.1 Å) resolution(21Muller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 22Muller Y.A. Schumacher G. Rudolph R. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This enzyme is not an analog of the E. coli PoxB, although it does share a number of its properties. (The identical names are a historical accident; both enzymes are misnamed.) The Lactobacillus enzyme, like PoxB, is a homotetramer. Each of the 66-kDa monomers binds FAD and TPP, the latter co-factor being bound via a magnesium ion. Like PoxB, the Lactobacillus enzyme decarboxylates pyruvate in an oxidative manner, but the products are different (acetyl phosphate and H2O2 rather than the free acetate and reduced quinone produced by PoxB). Most importantly, the Lactobacillus enzyme shows no lipid binding or activation. This lack of lipid interaction is expected, because the flavin is directly reoxidized by O2 rather than by quinone dissolved in the lipid bilayer (Lactobacilli lack the standard respiratory chain). The Lactobacillus amino acid sequence can be readily aligned with the PoxB sequence (Fig. 6). Excepting the extreme ends, the alignment proceeds over 500 residues with only six gaps that are all less than 3 residues. The sequences show 29-34% identical residues, depending on the gaps chosen. If we use the most significant set of residue substitutions given by Bardo and Argos (23Bardo S. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) for exchanges seen among topographical families of proteins, the similarity then rises to 50%. The only long segments of the two proteins lacking similarity are the C termini, a result consistent with the special lipid binding properties of PoxB. The x-ray structure shows that each subunit of the Lactobacillus protein is composed of three domains (Fig. 6). The protein core involved in subunit interaction is followed by the FAD binding domain, then the TPP binding domain, and finally a 50-residue C-terminal extension. The alignment gives 48% identical residues in the core, whereas the two co-enzyme binding domains contain 30% identical residues. The increased sequence identity in the core is expected from the lack of space available to accommodate amino acid side chain changes within protein cores. Indeed, when the Bardo-Argos (23Bardo S. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) set of core residue substitutions is used, the core similarity approaches 60%. Virtually all of the sequences postulated or shown to play important roles in the structure and function of the Lactobacillus enzyme are found in PoxB. The conservation of the FAD binding residues is of special interest because the Lactobacillus enzyme binds FAD by a novel use of the classic Rossmann dinucleotide fold structure(21Muller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 22Muller Y.A. Schumacher G. Rudolph R. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and thus this mode of FAD binding can be extended to PoxB and accounts for the lack of standard glycine dinucleotide fold fingerprint sequence in PoxB. Consideration of the Lactobacillus structure provides good explanations for many known properties of PoxB. First, the lack of reactivity of the PoxB cysteine residues can be attributed to their locations within the protein structure (Fig. 6). All 10 PoxB cysteines are in regions of strong alignment between the two proteins, but only 1 residue remains a cysteine in the Lactobacillus protein. By analogy with the Lactobacillus structure, five PoxB cysteines are buried within the core, whereas 2 residues are in the FAD binding region (known from spectral studies to be a hydrophobic environment)(24Mather M. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12887-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 3 are in the TPP binding region. One of these latter cysteine residues is adjacent to the DGG sequence involved in binding the pyrophosphate moiety of TPP and seems almost certain to represent the sole PoxB residue accessible to sulfhydryl reagents only in the absence of TPP or pyrophosphate(16Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6023-6027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the FAD domain of PoxB is the N-terminal half of the molecule consistent with our prior hybrid protein studies(25Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Third, the “business ends” of the two co-enzymes are in very close contact, consistent with previous spectral studies of PoxB(24Mather M. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12887-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Finally, the alignment also suggests that known protease-sensitive regions of PoxB reside in surface loops. Given the above data we expect that the overall structure of the Lactobacillus and PoxB enzymes are very similar. The Lactobacillus enzyme has D2 symmetry, and the structure is termed a dimer of dimers. PoxB dimers have been reported (27Recny M.A. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12878-12886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of these half-molecules indicate that, consistent with D2 symmetry, there is more than one type of bond between subunits. Moreover, the high degree of similarity in the core residues of Lactobacillus with PoxB together with the finding of unusually tight packing of the Lactobacillus core residues strongly suggests tetrahedral D2 symmetry for PoxB. It should be noted that, from preliminary electron micrographs, planar symmetry was suggested for PoxB(28O'Brien T.A. Shelton E. Mather M. Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, these micrographs also contain images consistent with tetrahedral symmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2002657952,"This work is aimed at understanding subunit assembly in the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex and the importance of the internal aldimine between pyridoxal phosphate and lysine 87 of the β2 subunit of tryptophan synthase for subunit association. We utilize a mutant form of the β2 subunit that is unable to form the internal aldimine because lysine 87 is replaced by threonine (K87T). The K87T α2β2 complex is inactive in reactions catalyzed by the β2 subunit but retains activity in the reaction catalyzed by the α subunit. We find that dialysis removes pyridoxal phosphate much more rapidly from the K87T β2 subunit and α2β2 complex than from the wild type counterparts. Activity measurements, gel filtration, and subunit interchange experiments show that the α subunit dissociates more readily from the K87T β2 subunit than from the wild type β2 subunit. The reaction of L-serine to form an external aldimine with pyridoxal phosphate at the active site of the K87T β2 subunit markedly increases the affinity for the α subunit and slows removal of pyridoxal phosphate by dialysis. We propose that the external aldimine between L-serine and pyridoxal phosphate bridges the N-domain and the C-domain in the K87T β2 subunit. This interdomain bridge may mimic the internal aldimine bond in the wild type β2 subunit and stabilize pyridoxal phosphate binding. The interdomain bridges formed by the internal aldimine with the wild type β2 subunit and by the external aldimine with L-serine in the K87T β2 subunit may further stabilize interaction with the α subunit because the α/β interaction site contains residues from both N- and C-domains of the β2 subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2004136634,"We have previously reported the presence of an endogenous inhibitory activity in bovine brain for the ADP-ribosylation of GTP-binding proteins catalyzed by pertussis toxin (PT) (Hara-Yokoyama, M., and Furuyama, S.(1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 160, 67-71). In the present study, we identified the inhibitor as a ganglioside. The screening of various gangliosides revealed that GQ1bα most effectively inhibited the ADP-ribosyltransferase activities of both the holoenzyme and the catalytic subunit of PT. GQ1bα is a ganglioside newly identified as one of the antigens recognized by the cholinergic neuron-specific antibody, anti-Chol-1α (Hirabayashi, Y., Nakao, T., Irie, F., Whittaker, V.P., Kon, K., and Ando, S.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12973-12978). GQ1bα also inhibited the PT-catalyzed NAD+ glycohydrolysis. Unlike PT activity, the ADP-ribosylation and the NAD+ glycohydrolysis catalyzed by the C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum type C were inhibited by GT1b and GQ1b. The ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by either PT or the C3 exoenzyme was not inhibited by ceramide, galactocerebroside, or sialic acid. In addition to the inhibitory action of gangliosides on ADP-ribosylation, the importance of gangliosides as regulators of NAD+ metabolism is discussed.

In addition to the inhibitory action of gangliosides on ADP-ribosylation, the importance of gangliosides as regulators of NAD+ metabolism is discussed. ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins whereby the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ is transferred to proteins as a monomer, oligomer, or polymer. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation occurs mostly in nuclei, and accumulating evidence indicates a close relationship between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and the regulation of chromatin activities(1Ueda K. Hayaishi O.

Interestingly, ADP-ribosyltransferases comparable to PT and the C3 exoenzyme have been found in human erythrocytes (23Tanuma S. Kawashima K. Endo H. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3075-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate how ADP-ribosylation is regulated, we aimed to characterize the endogenous modulator molecules. PT- and the C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was used as an assay system to detect modulatory activity for ADP-ribosylation. Previously, we reported the presence of an endogenous inhibitory activity of PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in rat liver (26Hara-Yokoyama M. Furuyama S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and in bovine brain (27Hara-Yokoyama M. Furuyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the inhibitory activity was present in the crude ganglioside fraction of bovine brain. Consequently, various species gangliosides, including newly identified species(28Hirabayashi Y. Nakao T. Matsumoto M. J. Chromatog. 1988; 445: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Ando S. Hirabayashi Y. Kon K. Inagaki F. Take S. Whittaker V.P. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12973-12978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were examined for their effects on the ADP-ribosylation. We found that GQ1bα, a minor ganglioside species recognized by a cholinergic neuron-specific antibody(30Hirabayashi Y. Nakao T. Irie F. Whittaker V.P. Kon K. Ando S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12973-12978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has a strong inhibitory activity for PT. On the other hand, gangliosides GT1b and GQ1b had inhibitory activity for the C3 exoenzyme. This is the first report that demonstrates the inhibitory effect of gangliosides on ADP-ribosylation. We propose that gangliosides are involved in the cellular NAD+ metabolism. [adenylate-32P]NAD+ (800 Ci/mmol) and [carbonyl-14C]NAD+ (25-40 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Neuraminidases from Arthrobacter ureafaciens and C. perfringens were from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Germany). Ceramide from bovine brain sphingomyelin (type III), galactocerebroside from bovine brain (type II), N-acetylneuraminic acid, GM1a, and GD1a were purchased from Sigma. Oligomers of N-acetylneuraminic acid were from Nakarai (Japan). PT was from Seikagaku Kogyo (Japan). To activate, 500 nM PT was preincubated for 15 min at 30°C with 50 mM dithiothreitol (31Krueger K.M. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12570-12578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 mM ATP(32Moss J. Stanley S.J. Burns D.L. Hsia J.A. Yost D.A. Myers G.A. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11879-11882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-proteins were partially purified from bovine brain membranes as described previously (33Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by successive chromatographies on columns of DEAE-Sephacel, ULTROGEL AcA34 (IBF Biotechnics, France), and heptylamine-Sepharose. The C3 exoenzyme was purified from a culture supernatant of C. botulinum type C, strain 6813, as described previously(18Moriishi K. Syuto B. Yokosawa N. Oguma K. Saito M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine brain was homogenized in 3 volumes of Buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was washed twice and suspended in the same buffer. This suspension was used as the membrane fraction. To make cholate extract, the membrane fraction (70 mg of protein) was suspended in Buffer A (10 ml) containing 1% sodium cholate, stirred on ice for 60 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The cholate extract was heated in boiling water for 5 min, dialyzed overnight against water, and concentrated using an Amicon YM5 membrane (extract A). Extract A was mixed with 40 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min. The chloroform/methanol layer (lower), water/methanol layer (upper), and the interface were separated. After evaporation, each fraction was suspended in 10 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The ganglioside fraction was prepared essentially according to Folch et al.(34Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane fraction (300 mg of protein in 5 ml) was suspended in 100 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) and was centrifuged. The first and the second extracts were combined, evaporated, and suspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). After filtration, one-fourth volume of water was added and the suspension was centrifuged. The upper layer (6 ml) was used as the crude ganglioside fraction. Total bovine brain gangliosides were applied to a Q-Sepharose column and fractionated into 23 fractions as described previously(28Hirabayashi Y. Nakao T. Matsumoto M. J. Chromatog. 1988; 445: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GT1aα and GQ1bα were purified as described previously(29Ando S. Hirabayashi Y. Kon K. Inagaki F. Take S. Whittaker V.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Hirabayashi Y. Nakao T. Irie F. Whittaker V.P. Kon K. Ando S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12973-12978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The typical reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 nM activated PT (5 μl), 2.5 μl of partially purified G-protein (0.1 mg/ml), and 1 μM [adenylate-32P]NAD+ (1 μCi/assay) in Buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mML-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine). The reaction was started by the addition of PT. After a 30-min incubation at 30°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4% SDS and 16% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were collected on a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell BA85) and were washed with 20 ml of 6% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were dried and the retained radioactivity was measured. The incorporation of the radioactivity into the protein was linear versus time within the 30-min incubation. To obtain the background level, PT was omitted from the reaction mixture. The incorporation in the absence of other additions was used as the control. After subtraction of the background value due to nonspecific binding, each value was expressed as a percentage of the control value. For the kinetic measurement, the reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 74 nM G-protein, 0.25-4.0 μM [adenylate-32P]NAD+ (50 Ci/mmol), and 10 nM activated PT in Buffer B. After the reaction was started by adding PT, aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at 20, 40, and 60 s. The S1 subunit of PT was prepared using a haptoglobin-Sepharose column(35Tamura M. Nogimori K. Murai S. Yajima M. Ito K. Katada T. Ui M. Ishii S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5516-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 36Moss J. Stanley S.J. Watkins P.A. Burns D.L. Manclark C.R. Kaslow H.R. Hewlett E.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The flow-through fraction contained only the S1 subunit. The fractions containing the S1 subunit were combined and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The S1 subunit (10 μl) was mixed with 10 μl of 25 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM ATP and was incubated for 15 min at 30°C for activation. The activated S1 subunit solution (20 μl) was used for the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity as described above. The final concentration of the S1 subunit in the reaction mixture was about 30 nM. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 10 nM C3 exoenzyme, 0.5 μl of the cholate extract of bovine brain membranes (3.0 mg/ml), and 0.06 μM [adenylate-32P]NAD+ (0.5 μCi/assay) in Buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM MgCl2). After incubation for 15 min at 20°C, the incorporation of the radioactivity into the protein was measured. The linearity of the incorporation versus time was confirmed. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 46 μM [carbonyl-14C]NAD+ (0.1 μCi/assay) and 50 nM activated PT or C3 exoenzyme in Buffer B or Buffer C, respectively. After a 2.5 h-incubation at 30°C, the reaction mixture was mixed with 5 μl of 50 mM NAD+ and 10 mM nicotinamide and was spotted onto Whatman No. 3MM paper. The paper was developed by 1 M AcONH4 (pH 5.0), 95% EtOH (3:7, v/v) as described previously(37Shima T. Hasegawa S. Fujimura S. Matsubara H. Sugimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6632-6635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NAD+ and nicotinamide were detected under UV light. The radioactivities in these spots were measured. The release of nicotinamide from NAD+ was linear up to 2.5 h of incubation. The ganglioside fraction from bovine brain (120 μl) was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 50 μl of 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and 10 μl of A. ureafaciens neuraminidase (0.1 unit) or H2O. Alternatively, the ganglioside fraction from bovine brain (30 μl) was dried up and redissolved in 6 μl of 1 M acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and either 54 μl of C. perfringens neuraminidase (0.8 unit) in 10 mM EDTA or 54 μl of 10 mM EDTA. After incubation for 24 h at 40°C, the fraction was boiled for 5 min, and their aliquots (10 μl) were used to examine the inhibitory activity. We have previously reported the presence of a heat-stable inhibitory activity of PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in the cholate extract of bovine brain membranes(27Hara-Yokoyama M. Furuyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As the inhibitory activity was also stable after treatment with chloroform (data not shown), lipids were extracted and fractionated from the cholate extract by the method of Folch et al.(34Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity in the upper layer (gangliosides) was higher than that in either the lower layer (phospholipids) or the interface (proteins) fraction (data not shown). The upper layer fraction was fractionated by gel permeation column chromatography using 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The activity emerged from the column just after 2,4-dinitrophenol-alanine (molecular mass of 260 Da), suggesting that the inhibitor is not a high molecular mass species (data not shown). No proteins or peptides were detected in the peak fraction by silver staining. On the other hand, the inhibitory activity in the cholate extract was concentrated after ultrafiltration using an Amicon YM5 unit (molecular mass cutoff about 5,000 Da). Similar results were obtained when the bovine brain membranes were extracted by the nonionic detergent nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide (MEGA9) or the ampholytic detergent CHAPS (data not shown). The inhibitor behaves as either a low or high molecular mass species depending on the conditions. These results suggest that the inhibitor is a ganglioside. The change in the apparent molecular mass may be explained by micelle formation, which is a characteristic property of gangliosides. To examine the involvement of a ganglioside, a crude ganglioside fraction was prepared from bovine brain membranes, according to Folch et al.(34Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of the crude gangliosides inhibited the PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The inhibitory activity of the ganglioside fraction was about one-fifth that of the cholate extract obtained from the same amount of membranes. About 50% of the inhibitory activity was relieved by treatment with neuraminidase from A. ureafaciens (Fig. 1B). The treatment with neuraminidase from C. perfringens led to a 30% attenuation of the inhibitory activity (data not shown). Therefore, ganglioside species are probably involved in the inhibition. For the screening of ganglioside species, crude ganglioside fraction from bovine brain was fractionated by Q-Sepharose column chromatography(28Hirabayashi Y. Nakao T. Matsumoto M. J. Chromatog. 1988; 445: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All fractions except for the flow-through fraction inhibited the PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (data not shown). The inhibitory activity was highest in the final fraction containing GQ1aα and GT1aα (Fraction 23). A similar result was obtained when the gangliosides were treated in alkaline conditions prior to the separation by Q-Sepharose column chromatography (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was inhibited by purified GQ1bα with an IC50 value of about 0.1 mg/ml (40 mM), but not by GT1aα. Dose-dependent inhibition by various purified gangliosides was shown in Fig. 2B. The inhibition was 95% when GQ1bα was added at 0.25 mg/ml, whereas the inhibition did not exceed 50 to 80% when either GM1a, GD1a, GT1b, or GQ1b was added up to 0.9 mg/ml. The inhibition depends on the concentration of NAD+ or L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. The kinetic analysis suggests that GQ1bα inhibits the PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in a competitive manner versus NAD+ (Fig. 3). The apparent inhibitory activity of GQ1bα in the absence of L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine was higher than that in the presence of L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (data not shown). GQ1bα was detected, by monoclonal antibody GGR-41, in the upper layer of the cholate extract as well as in the crude ganglioside fraction from bovine brain membranes (Fig. 4). The amount of GQ1bα in the cholate extract was larger than that in the crude ganglioside fraction.Figure 3:Effect of NAD+ concentration on the inhibition of PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation by GQ1bα. The PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was measured in the absence (○) or presence (•) of 0.1 mg/ml GQ1bα as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as Lineweaver-Burk plots.

Nogimori K. Yajimak M. Ase K. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6756-6761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A protomer is composed of a single S1 subunit containing the catalytic site of ADP-ribosyltransferase. The B oligomer is made up of five subunits (S2, S3, S4, and S5 in an 1:1:2:1 ratio) and is required for the binding of this toxin to the membranes of target cells(35Tamura M. Nogimori K. Murai S. Yajima M. Ito K. Katada T. Ui M. Ishii S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5516-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Tamura M. Nogimori K. Yajimak M. Ase K. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6756-6761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S2 and S3 subunits of the B oligomer contain carbohydrate recognition domains (39Saukkonen K. Burnette W.N. Mar V.L. Masure H.R. Tuomanen E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and bind to glycoproteins(40Brennan M.J. David J.L. Kenimer J.G. Manclark C.R.

Immun. 1989; 57: 3324-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even in the presence of ATP, which promotes dissociation of the PT subunits (42Burns D.L. Manclark C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4324-4327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), more than 80% of the S1 subunit is associated with the B oligomer(31Krueger K.M. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12570-12578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the inhibition by gangliosides is due to the direct interaction with the S1 subunit or with the carbohydrate recognition domains of the B oligomer, the S1 subunit of PT was isolated by a haptoglobin-Sepharose column chromatography. As shown in Fig. 5, gangliosides inhibited the S1 subunit-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. GQ1bα was more effective than either GM1a, GD1a, GM1a, GT1b, or GQ1b was. Therefore, the site of ganglioside action is identified as the S1 subunit. As shown in Fig. 1A, the ganglioside fraction from the bovine brain membranes inhibited the C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. The inhibitory activity was completely relieved by treatment with neuraminidase from C. perfringens (Fig. 1C). The effect of gangliosides separated by Q-Sepharose column chromatography on the C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was studied. In contrast to the effect on the PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, the C3-exoenzyme catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was inhibited by the fraction containing GM1a, GD1a, GT1b, or GQ1b, but not by GQ1b (Fraction 23, data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, GM1a, GD1a, GT1b, and GQ1b inhibited the ADP-ribosylation in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of GT1b and GQ1b were slightly greater than those of GM1a and GD1a. The amount of inhibitory activity of GQ1bα (Fraction 23) was smaller than that of GM1a, GD1a, GT1b, and GQ1b. The inhibition approached 80% by the addition of up to 0.9 mg/ml of the gangliosides. The inhibition of ADP-ribosylation can be explained by the interaction of gangliosides with ADP-ribosyltransferase or by the interaction with the substrate proteins. As the heterotrimeric form of G-protein is the preferred substrate of PT(43Neer E.J. Lok J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol.

The C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation is inhibited by the formation of the GTP-bound form of the Rho/Rac proteins with guanine nucleotides(44Aktories K. Frevert J. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the gangliosides directly interact on the C3 exoenzyme, we examined the effect of gangliosides on the NAD+ glycohydrolysis activity of the C3 exoenzyme. As shown in Fig. 7, GT1b and GQ1b inhibited the C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed NAD+ glycohydrolysis, indicating that these species act directly on the C3 exoenzyme. On the other hand, the addition of either GM1a, GD1a, or GQ1bα (Fraction 23) had no effect. The lack of inhibition of NAD+ glycohydrolysis with GQ1bα is consistent with its effect on the ADP-ribosylation. As for GM1a and GD1a, our data could not discriminate whether they act directly on the C3 exoenzyme. The crude ganglioside fraction also inhibited the C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed NAD+ glycohydrolysis. PT-catalyzed NAD+ hydrolysis was inhibited by the crude ganglioside fraction as well as by GQ1bα. Accordingly, GT1b/GQ1b and GQ1bα inhibit the ADP-ribosylation by interacting with the C3 exoenzyme and with PT, respectively. To investigate the structural requirement for the inhibitory effect of gangliosides, the effects of ceramide, galactocerebroside, and sialic acid were studied. Ceramide and galactocerebroside at 0.1-0.5 mg/ml did not inhibit the PT and C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (data not shown). Sialic acid species (monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer at 0.1-0.7 mg/ml) also did not inhibit either ADP-ribosylation (data not shown). Thus, both the lipid components and the sialic acid residues in the gangliosides are required for their inhibitory effect. In the present study, we demonstrated that gangliosides inhibit the ADP-ribosyltransferases of PT and the C3 exoenzyme. PT and the C3 exoenzyme modify different target proteins with distinct amino acid specificities, a cysteine residue (11West Jr., R.E. Moss J. Vaughan M. Liu T. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol.

Translation of 6-HDNO in FAD-supplemented reticulocyte lysate resulted in a protein that contained covalently incorporated FAD, exhibited enzyme activity, and was trypsin-resistant, a characteristic of the tight conformation of the holoenzyme. The attached mitochondrial presequence did not prevent folding, binding of FAD, or enzyme activity of the 6-HDNO moiety of the fusion protein (pre-6-HDNO). Pre-6-HDNO was imported into rat liver mitochondria and processed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase. Incubation of the trypsin-resistant pre-holo-6-HDNO protein with deenergized rat liver mitochondria demonstrated that upon contact with mitochondria, the protein was unfolded and became trypsin sensitive. Mitochondrial import assays showed that the unfolded pre-holo-6-HDNO with covalently attached FAD was imported into rat liver mitochondria. Inside the mitochondrion the holo-6-HDNO was refolded into the trypsin-resistant conformation. However, when pre-apo-6-HDNO was imported only part of the protein became trypsin resistant (approximately 20%).

We are investigating the biogenesis of enzymes with covalently attached FAD. As a model protein we employed 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase (6-HDNO), a bacterial enzyme with FAD attached to the polypeptide chain by a histidyl(N3)-8α-FAD linkage(8Möhler H. Brühmüller M. Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Folding of the guanidinium hydrochloride unfolded protein in vitro requires the activity of the chaperonins GroEL and GroES in the presence of ATP(9Brandsch R. Bichler V. Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The folding of the protein into its native conformation is followed by the autoflavinylation of the enzyme and attainment of enzyme activity(10Brandsch R. Bichler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19056-19062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of FAD into the apoprotein depends on a flavinylation competent conformational state of the polypeptide which can be induced allosterically in vitro by the presence of glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol-3-P)(10Brandsch R. Bichler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19056-19062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic cell there are several enzymes known with covalently attached FAD(11Decker K. Brandsch R. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 69-81PubMed Google Scholar), all located in subcellular organelles: monoamine oxidase on the outer mitochondrial membrane, succinate dehydrogenase in the inner mitochondrial membrane, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (Me2GlyDH), and sarcosine dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial matrix, L-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase in the microsomal cell fraction, the plant enzyme reticuline oxidoreductase (involved in the synthesis of the alkaloid berberin) in a special vacuolar compartment(12Dittrich H.

J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4448-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may form a subgroup of covalently flavinylated enzymes. These enzymes lack the NH2-terminal dinucleotide binding site characteristic of the majority of flavoenzymes (15Wierenga R.K. De Maeyer M.C.H. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1346-1357Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and exhibit similarities in the amino acid sequence surrounding the FAD-modified histidine (14August P.R. Flickinger M.C.

Kaamura-Konishi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 198: 793-799Google Scholar). In the work presented in this paper we investigated several aspects of the biogenesis of covalently flavinylated enzymes in the eukaryotic cell by fusing the mitochondrial targeting sequence of rat Me2GlyDH to 6-HDNO. We show that 1) the mitochondrial targeting sequence does not prevent folding, flavinylation, or enzyme activity of the fusion protein synthesized in the RL; 2) the fusion protein is imported into rat liver mitochondria and correctly processed; 3) the compact, trypsin-resistant conformation of the flavinylated precursor is unfolded upon interaction with the mitochondrion; and 4) flavinylation of the precursor does not prevent its import. FAD, FMN, riboflavin, glycerol 3-phosphate, trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and digitonin were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Federal Republic of Germany), rabbit reticulocyte lysate from Promega (Madison, WI) and [35S]methionine was from Amersham (Braunschweig, FRG). All other chemicals were of highest purity available. The 6-HDNO gene was cloned into pSPT20 BM (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, FRG) as a NcoI-endonuclease restriction fragment isolated from pLM 1702(18Bernauer H. Mauch L. Brandsch R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1809-18201Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A fusion between the presequence of Me2GlyDH and 6-HDNO was constructed by digestion of pSPT19-Me2GlyDH with NaeI/HindIII and replacement of the NaeI/HindIII Me2GlyDH fragment with the 6-HDNO gene. For convenience the chimeric construct was named pre-6-HDNO. Plasmids were multiplied in Escherichia coli strain JM109, and plasmid DNA was isolated from bacterial cells with the aid of a DNA isolation kit (Diagen, Hilden, FRG). Transcription with SP6 polymerase from pSPT20-6-HDNO and pSPT19-pre-6-HDNO and translation of the transcripts in the presence of [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was done according to the suppliers instructions (Promega). 4 μl of [35S]Met-labeled pre-6-HDNO translation product were incubated for 1 h at 27°C with 0.3 μg of a rat liver MPP preparation (19Kleiber J. Kalousek F. Swaroop M. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE. The MPP processing site of the Me2GlyDH presequence fused to 6-HDNO was determined by amino-terminal radiosequencing of products from processing substrate synthesized in the presence of [3H]leucine. Processing products were recovered and sequenced as described previously(20Isaya G. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Pre-6-HDNO was synthesized in rabbit RL supplemented with 10 μM FAD for 1 h at 30°C as recommended by the supplier of the RL (Promega) followed by incubation with 10 mM glycerol-3-P for 30 min at 30°C. 6-HDNO activity was measured as described previously(8Möhler H. Brühmüller M. Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Labeling of 6-HDNO and pre-6-HDNO holoenzymes with [14C]FAD was performed by translating the proteins in the presence of 10 μM [14C]FAD followed by incubation of the translation assays with 10 mM glycerol-3-P for 30 min at 30°C. The translation products were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE. To test for the presence of holoenzyme, translation products were digested with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin for 15 min at 0°C. Digestion was stopped by addition of 4 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared as described(21Conboy J.G. Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial import assays were performed by incubating 4 μl of radioactive RL translation product with freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria at a final concentration of 8 mg/ml. After incubation (60 min, 27°C) the mitochondria were sedimented by centrifugation, washed with 200 μl of HMS buffer (2 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 220 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose), and pelleted. Import assays were digested with 0.2 mg trypsin/ml at 0°C for 15 min. The digestion was stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (4 mg/ml) and the mitochondria washed and pelleted. The mitochondrial pellets were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. When required MPP was inhibited by incubation of mitochondria for 3 min at 27°C with 5 mM EDTA and 1 mMo-phenanthroline prior to import. The membrane potential ΔΨ was dissipated by the addition of 20 μM oligomycin, 0.5 μM valinomycin, and 0.8 μM antimycin A to the isolated mitochondria. For FMN supplementation, the isolated mitochondria were incubated before performing the import assays with 12 μM FMN for 3 min at 27°C. Fractionation of mitochondria into matrix and membranes was performed by freezing and thawing the washed mitochondria in liquid nitrogen four times followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 2°C for 30 min. The purity of the submitochondrial fractions was tested on Western blots with the aid of antibodies specific for a marker protein of the mitochondrial matrix. Densitometric quantification of the fluorographs was performed with an Image Master DTS from Pharmacia LKB (Freiburg, FRG). Mitochondrial matrix was prepared from isolated rat liver mitochondria by sonication for 3 min at 0°C and 100 watts. Mitochondrial membranes and matrix fraction were separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g and 4°C. 4 μl of [35S]Met-labeled pre-6-HDNO apoenzyme was incubated with 100 μg of mitochondrial matrix for 30 min at 30°C. For investigation of holoenzyme formation the assays were divided and half subjected to trypsin digestion (0.2 mg/ml) for 15 min at 0°C. Since the autocatalytic incorporation of FAD into 6-HDNO depends on the folding of the polypeptide into a flavinylation-competent conformation(10Brandsch R. Bichler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19056-19062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether 6-HDNO translated in the RL folds correctly and exhibits cofactor attachment and enzyme activity. The [35S]methionine-labeled RL translation products of 6-HDNO and pre-6-HDNO are presented in Fig. 1, panel A. They show the expected size difference in molecular weight between 6-HDNO and pre-6-HDNO. When 6-HDNO activity was measured in the translation assay, it was apparent that the endogenous content of FAD in the RL was insufficient to promote 6-HDNO holoenzyme formation and that supplementation of the RL with FAD was required for 6-HDNO activity (Fig. 1, panel B, lane 2). As shown previously(22Brandsch R. Bichler V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), holoenzyme formation of E. coli-expressed 6-HDNO required, besides FAD, supplementation with glycerol-3-P. The same observation was made with the RL translated 6-HDNO: addition of FAD and glycerol-3-P was necessary to convert the synthesized 6-HDNO into holoenzyme (Fig. 1, panel B, lane 3). RL translation assays performed with pre-6-HDNO gave identical enzyme activities to those performed with 6-HDNO (Fig. 1, panel B, pre-6-HDNO). Thus the presequence of Me2GlyDH did not prevent the folding of the 6-HDNO fusion protein into the flavinylation competent conformation, the incorporation of FAD into the polypeptide, or enzyme activity. We have shown previously that 6-HDNO activity requires covalently bound cofactor(10Brandsch R. Bichler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19056-19062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The covalent binding of FAD to the RL-translated 6-HDNO and pre-6-HDNO was directly demonstrated by supplementation of the RL with [14C]FAD and fluorography of the [14C]FAD-labeled 6-HDNO proteins (Fig. 1, panel C). Flavinylation of the apoenzyme and attainment of the native conformation of the holoenzyme is accompanied in vivo in E. coli cells by the achievement of protease resistance of 6-HDNO(23Brandsch R. Bichler V. Krauss B. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This observation applies to the 6-HDNO and pre-6-HDNO RL translation products as well. Holoenzyme formation of both 6-HDNO and pre-6-HDNO resulted in a protein conformation highly resistant to trypsin (Fig. 2), proteinase K, and chymotrypsin (not shown). Trypsin digestion of pre-holo-6-HDNO resulted in a molecular form that migrated on SDS-PAGE identical to the holo-6-HDNO form (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 8, respectively). Thus only the presequence remained accessible to proteolytic attack, and apparently the trypsin cleavage site must be close to the precursor processing site recognized by the MPP. The appearance of the trypsin-resistant form was taken as an indication for FAD incorporation and 6-HDNO holoenzyme formation. In order to establish the MPP cleavage recognition site of the Me2GlyDH signal sequence fused to 6-HDNO, we performed NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing on the in vitro [3H]L-leucine-labeled translation product, processed with purified MPP. From the amino acid sequence deduced from the Me2GlyDH-cDNA, the MPP processing site was predicted between Pro21 and Ser22, which would leave Arg20 in position −2 with respect to the cleavage site (Fig. 3, panel A, arrow). This site would agree with the Arg−2 rule established for the mitochondrial MPP recognition site(24Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It also predicted that the first leucine residue, which is also the first residue of the 6-HDNO fusion partner, would appear in the fourth cycle of the amino acid sequencing reaction. This was indeed the case (not shown). Fig. 3, panel B, shows the MPP digestion product of the RL translated pre-6-HDNO. Next we analyzed whether the Me2GlyDH presequence confers import competence to the fused 6-HDNO partner. [35S]Methionine-labeled, RL-translated pre-apo-6-HDNO and apo-6-HDNO were incubated with isolated rat liver mitochondria and tested for intramitochondrial location of the 6-HDNO proteins by trypsin digestion (Fig. 4, panel A). Apo-6-HDNO incubated with mitochondria remained, as expected, protease-sensitive (Fig. 4, panel A, lane 3). Pre-apo-6-HDNO, however, upon incubation with mitochondria, was processed to a lower molecular weight, trypsin-resistant, and, therefore, intramitochondrially located form (Fig. 4, panel A, lane 6). From this experiment we conclude that the fusion protein between the Me2GlyDH presequence and 6-HDNO was imported into rat liver mitochondria and correctly processed by the MPP. Only a fraction of the imported pre-apo-6-HDNO (approximately 20%) was transformed inside the mitochondria into the trypsin-resistant form characteristic for the holoenzyme, however (Fig. 4, panel B, lane 2). Does the intramitochondrial transformation of the imported apo-6-HDNO into holoenzyme require the simultaneous import of the flavin cofactor? To answer this question we performed import assays with rat liver mitochondria preincubated with FMN. The amount of trypsin resistant 6-HDNO formed in the mitochondrial matrix after import of pre-apo-6-HDNO did not increase after preincubation of mitochondria with FMN (Fig. 4, panel B, lane 4), nor when mitochondria were preincubated with FAD or riboflavin (not shown). The same import experiments were performed with pre-holo-6-HDNO (Fig. 5). Since the pre-6-HDNO holoenzyme form is protease-resistant (Fig. 5, panel A, lane 2), it was necessary to differentiate between a protein species that was only associated with mitochondria and a protein species located inside the mitochondria. Additionally, as the presequence of pre-holo-6-HDNO is removed by incubation with trypsin, it is not possible to distinguish between cleavage outside the mitochondria by trypsin or intramitochondrial processing by MPP. In order to make this distinction, we inhibited MPP by treatment with the chelators EDTA and o-phenanthroline. Following import the assay was treated with trypsin. Under these conditions the precursor protein is not cleaved (Fig. 5, panel A, lane 7) and therefore must be located intramitochondrially. Additional proof that the trypsin-resistant 6-HDNO form is intramitochondrially located is the finding that pre-holo-6-HDNO, upon contact with import incompetent mitochondria, is unfolded and becomes trypsin-sensitive (Fig. 5, panel A, lane 6). The matrix location of the processed pre-holo-6-HDNO was also supported by the fractionation of the mitochondria after import. The data showed that the processed 6-HDNO species was situated in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 5, panel B, lane 1). Trypsin digestion of the mitochondrial fractions demonstrated that the 6-HDNO protein recovered in the matrix was 80% protease-resistant and represented holoenzyme (Fig. 5, panel B, lane 2). Thus, pre-holo-6-HDNO with FAD covalently attached to the polypeptide was imported into mitochondria. Preincubation of mitochondria with FMN had no effect on import and recovery of the holoenzyme in the matrix fraction (Fig. 5, panel B, lane 4, and panel C). Incubation of apo-6-HDNO with mitochondrial matrix resulted in only partial formation of holo-6-HDNO as indicated by trypsin digestion of the protein (Fig. 6, lane 2). Addition of FAD only to the matrix increased the holoenzyme level (Fig. 6, lane 3); however, addition of both FAD and glycerol-3-P was required to induce a further increase in trypsin resistance of the 6-HDNO protein (Fig. 6, lane 5). Apparently the intramitochondrial FAD and effector concentration was insufficient to support flavinylation of the imported precursor. Flavoenzymes may be classified into two groups according to the nature of the cofactor attachment to the protein. The majority exhibits the flavin moiety tightly but noncovalently bound to the polypeptide. The second group of over 20 enzymes contains the cofactor covalently bound to an amino acid side chain of the protein(11Decker K. Brandsch R. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 69-81PubMed Google Scholar). The covalently flavinylated enzymes in eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized. This observation raises the question as to when and how during the biogenesis of these enzymes the covalent modification takes place. For monoamine oxidase it has been shown that the apoenzyme becomes catalytically active, i.e. incorporates FAD, upon contact with the outer mitochondrial membrane, but prior to its ubiquitinylation and ATP-dependent insertion into this membrane (25Zhuang Z. Marks B. Mc Cauley R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 591-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the expression of an enzymatically active bovine monoamine oxidase in yeast, it was inferred that covalent attachment of FAD to a cysteine residue of the enzyme proceeds autocatalytically(26Weyler W. Titlow C.C. Salach J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, the same conclusion was reached for the attachment of FAD to a tyrosine of p-cresol hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida expressed in E. coli(27Kim J. Fuller J.H. Cecchini G. Mc Intire W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown for succinate dehydrogenase that assembly of the enzyme complex did not require the flavinylation of the flavoprotein subunit(28Hederstedt L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Robinson K.M. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Lemire B.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There are no more detailed data available on the mechanism of flavinylation of these enzymes and the possible importance of this covalent modification for their biogenesis. Our results show that the 6-HDNO protein synthesized in the eukaryotic translation system was correctly folded and flavinylated. This fact demonstrates that in the heterologous RL system autoflavinylation of the enzyme proceeded unaltered. As in the case of the E. coli cell extract, supplementation of the RL with FAD only was not sufficient to transform all of the synthesized 6-HDNO into holoenzyme, but required the posttranslational addition of glycerol-3-P as well. It is generally considered that mitochondrial precursor proteins are maintained after completion of translation in a loosely folded, import-competent state by the interaction with molecular chaperones (1Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Evidence for the posttranslational interaction of precursor proteins with Hsp70 in the RL is still debated(5Lain B. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15588-15596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 28-kDa mitochondrial targeting factor and a 50-kDa presequence binding factor have been identified in RL, however(30Ono H. Tuboi S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Murakami K. Mori M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A loosely folded conformation might be expected to prevent trypsin resistance and enzymatic activity of a precursor protein. Although the apoenzyme forms of 6-HDNO and pre-6-HDNO are trypsin-sensitive and thus differ in their conformation from the holoenzyme, they are not recovered by immunoprecipitation from RL as complexes with Hsp70. Our results also demonstrate that attachment of the mitochondrial presequence of Me2GlyDH does not prevent flavinylation of the 6-HDNO moiety of the fusion protein and formation of a tightly folded enzymatically active and trypsin-resistant conformation. Folding of mitochondrial precursor proteins translated in RL into enzymatically active, native-like conformations has been documented before for other enzymes(5Lain B. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15588-15596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Murakami K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Reyes A.M. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial presequence apparently does not prevent folding of the precursor protein but makes its targeting to the mitochondrial import complex more specific(33Zara V. Palmieri F. Mahlke K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12077-12081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Me2GlyDH presequence conferred import competence to the fusion protein (pre-apo-6-HDNO), but only a fraction of the imported and processed apo-6-HDNO acquired trypsin resistance in the mitochondrial matrix. Addition of FAD and glycerol-3-P to the mitochondrial matrix fraction was required to transform apo-6-HDNO into the protease-resistant form. This finding suggests that the intramitochondrial flavin concentration was insufficient for complete 6-HDNO holoenzyme formation and that the flavinylation reaction was not performed by a mitochondrial protein factor, but required the conformational change induced by the allosteric effector. It was recently shown that import of flavin precursors into rat mitochondria takes place at the level of FMN and that FMN is transformed intramitochondrially into FAD(34Barile M. Passarella S. Bertoldi A. Quagliariello E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When we tried to increase the intramitochondrial FAD concentration by incubation of isolated rat liver mitochondria with FMN prior to pre-apo-6-HDNO import, there was no increase in the recovery of trypsin-resistant 6-HDNO. Apparently the intramitochondrial FAD concentration was still insufficient for the conversion of pre-6-HDNO into the holoenzyme. This observation is different for what was shown for the import of precursor molecules of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (35Nagao M. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17925-17932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the flavoenzyme subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (29Robinson K.M. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Lemire B.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) which were converted intramitochondrially into holoenzyme. The reduced level of intramitochondrial 6-HDNO holoenzyme formation may be explained by the absence of the specific allosteric effector from the mitochondrial matrix. It could also be explained by a low affinity of the 6-HDNO apoenzyme for FAD which would render the intramitochondrial FAD concentration insufficient for holoenzyme formation. Enzymes with a typical dinucleotide binding pocket, like acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and the flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase, may more avidly bind FAD than flavoenzymes lacking this particular FAD-binding domain and thus form holoenzymes at a lower cofactor concentration. The finding that the covalently flavinylated holo-pre-6-HDNO was imported into rat liver mitochondria was unexpected. The effect of cofactor attachment on the mitochondrial import of precursor proteins varies. It was shown in several instances that the bound cofactor blocks import of the precursor protein. Thus import of the cytoplasmic dihydrofolate reductase fused to a mitochondrial presequence was blocked when the ligands NADP and methotrexate, an antagonist of tetrahydrofolate, were attached to the protein(36Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 332: 228-232Crossref Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Studies on mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase have shown that formation of the holoenzyme prevented its import(5Lain B. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15588-15596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Import of cytochrome c, which does not require a presequence, is blocked by the covalent attachment of heme(4Voos W. Gambill B.D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast to these reports, but similar to findings described in this paper, biotinylated precursors are imported into 3T3-L adipocyte mitochondria(37Taroni F. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13267-13271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11425-11428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that the phosphopantotheine prosthetic group of the acyl carrier protein does not prevent import of the precursor protein into spinach chloroplasts(39Yang L.-M. Fernandez M.D. Lamppa G.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 244: 743-750Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). During import into mitochondria precursor proteins are unfolded(40Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This process seems to be mediated by their interaction with mitochondrial Hsp70(4Voos W. Gambill B.D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Besides mitochondrial Hsp70 translocation of precursor molecules requires an ΔΨ across the inner mitochondrial membrane(1Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). In the case of deenergized mitochondria, the interaction of the precursor with the import apparatus of the inner mitochondrial membrane should be inhibited. Thus a contact between the 6-HDNO precursor and mitochondrial Hsp70 should not take place. Therefore the observed unfolding of holo-pre-6-HDNO when incubated with ΔΨ-depleted mitochondria cannot be attributed to the postulated unfoldase activity of mitochondrial Hsp70(4Voos W. Gambill B.D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the interaction of mitochondrial proteins with phospholipid components of the mitochondrial membrane may lead to their unfolding (41Hartmann C.M. Gehring H. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings may explain our observation. We would like to hypothesize on a possible physiological consequence of the interaction between a cofactor and its precursor enzyme. Import into mitochondria in vivo is assumed to take place posttranslationally, at least to a considerable extent, although evidence for a cotranslational import has been provided(42Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Folding of proteins inside the cell apparently commences as they are translated, and completion of folding of the released protein takes place within seconds(43Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas the residing time of a precursor protein in the cytoplasm is considered to be a few minutes(1Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Thus it might be assumed that the folding of binding domains for small molecular ligands like cofactors are completed while the polypeptide is still in the cytoplasm and that cofactors may be bound to the protein. Unfolding of the precursor upon contact with the mitochondrion would release noncovalently bound cofactors from the protein. This could lead to an increase in the local concentration of the cofactor at the cellular organelle and an increased diffusion-driven or carrier-mediated import of the cofactor. In this way a functionally meaningful intracellular cotransport of the cofactor and the precursor enzyme to the place of their activity could be established. We thank Dr. W. Voos for fruitful discussions and A. Hebrok for critical support during the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2072941392,"Earlier we reported the generation of a conformation-specific antibody (Ab P2) to the β-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Bishayee, S., Majumdar, S., Scher, C. D., and Khan, S.(1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 3696-3702). Ab P2 is directed to a 16-amino acid peptide (GluGly-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Val-Asp-Glu-Glu-PheLeu-Arg) of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, and it recognizes the phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor but not the unphosphorylated receptor. We now report that Ab P2 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor and that the recognition is specific for a conformation induced by phosphorylation of the receptor; however, Ab P2 is not directed to phosphotyrosine. Studies conducted with P2-derived peptides suggest that the conformation-specific antibody is directed to an acidic tripeptide, Asp-Glu-Glu, and this sequence is also present in the cytoplasmic domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor. With respect to the C terminus amino acid or ATP-binding site, Asp-Glu-Glu is located in different regions in these receptors; nevertheless, this tripeptide along with the surrounding amino acids is cryptic in the unphosphorylated receptor, and tyrosine phosphorylation uncovers this site. This suggests that the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence may be important in receptor functions. Earlier we reported the generation of a conformation-specific antibody (Ab P2) to the β-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Bishayee, S., Majumdar, S., Scher, C. D., and Khan, S.(1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 3696-3702). Ab P2 is directed to a 16-amino acid peptide (GluGly-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Val-Asp-Glu-Glu-PheLeu-Arg) of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, and it recognizes the phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor but not the unphosphorylated receptor. We now report that Ab P2 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor and that the recognition is specific for a conformation induced by phosphorylation of the receptor; however, Ab P2 is not directed to phosphotyrosine.

This suggests that the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence may be important in receptor functions. The earliest consequences of the interaction of a growth factor, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 1The abbreviations used are: PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibody. with its receptor are the dimerization of the receptor followed by the activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase site(1Heldin C-H.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11699-11705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported the generation of a conformation-specific antibody to the β-type PDGF receptor. This anti-peptide antibody (Ab P2), directed to amino acid residues 964-979 (GluGly-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Val-Asp-Glu-Glu-Phe-LeuArg) of the cytoplasmic domain of the human β-receptor recognizes specifically the phosphorylated receptor but not the unphosphorylated receptor(3Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A similar finding has also been reported by others(4Keating M.T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12805-12808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that receptor phosphorylation uncovers this peptide epitope and suggests a phosphorylation-induced conformational change of the receptor. This is further supported by the recent observations that only the phosphorylated receptors bind very tightly with intracellular target molecules containing src homology 2 motifs and that such interactions culminate in DNA synthesis and cell division (reviewed in (5Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar)). platelet-derived growth factor epidermal growth factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis antibody monoclonal antibody. Since autophosphorylation is important in receptor-mediated signal transduction and we have identified a peptide epitope in the PDGF receptor whose conformation is highly susceptible to the phosphorylation state of the receptor, we have extended our studies with Ab P2. We now report that this conformation-specific antibody also recognizes the EGF receptor and, interestingly, that the recognition is also phosphorylation-dependent. In addition, we present evidence to indicate that the antigenic determinant for this conformation-specific antibody is a tripeptide, Asp-Glu-Glu. This suggests that the peptide epitope surrounding this intracellular tripeptide is always cryptic in the PDGF and EGF receptor kinases and that receptor phosphorylation uncovers this sequence. Because of its specificity toward phosphorylated receptors, this conformation-specific antibody may be used in clinical settings to detect activated receptors in tumor samples. 3,3′-Bis(sulfosuccinimido)suberate was obtained from Pierce. The B-B homodimeric form of PDGF was purchased from Amgen Biologicals (Thousand Oaks, CA). EGF was purified from mouse submaxillary glands and radiolabeled with 125I by the chloramine-T procedure(6Das M. Knowles B. Biswas R. Bishayee S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Labeled ATP was prepared with 32Pi and γ-Prep A kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's directions. Specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was adjusted to 40-60 Ci/mmol by adding unlabeled ATP(7Bishayee S. Ross A.H. Womer W.R. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human MG-63 osteosarcoma, A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, and murine NR-6 fibroblasts (EGF receptorless variants of 3T3) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human SK-BR-3 breast adenocarcinoma cells overexpressing neu were grown in McCoy 5A modified medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. Plasma membranes from these cells were prepared as described(7Bishayee S. Ross A.H. Womer W.R. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Anti-peptide antibodies Ab P1, Ab P2, and Ab P3 are directed, respectively, to amino acid residues 1013-1024 (peptide 1), 964-979 (peptide 2), and 740-762 (peptide 3) of the cytoplasmic domain of the human β-type PDGF receptor(8Claesson-Welsh L.

Ab Pα1 and Ab Pα2 are directed to amino acid residues 993-1009 (peptide α1) and 956-971 (peptide α2) of the cytoplasmic domain of the human α-type PDGF receptor, respectively(9Matsui T. Heidaran M. Miki T. Popescu N. LaRochell W. Kraus M. Pierce J. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 243: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). All of these antibodies recognize human and murine PDGF receptors in immunoprecipitation and Western blotting(3Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell.

Kanakaraj P. Khan S.A. Bishayee S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These antibodies were generated in rabbits using high pressure liquid chromatography-purified peptides according to the method described previously(3Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody (mAb 425), raised against human A431 carcinoma cells and polyclonal antibody to denatured EGF receptor were gifts from Dr. M. Das and were developed as described (12Murthy U. Basu A. Rodeck U. Herlyn M. Ross A.H. Das M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Murthy U. Basu M. Sen-Majumdar A. Das M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). mAb 425 is directed to a peptide chain of the extracellular domain of the human EGF receptor and recognizes only the native receptor. The mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 1G2, used for purification of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, was generated as described and coupled to activated Sepharose(7Bishayee S. Ross A.H. Womer W.R. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The conformation-specific antibody, Ab P2, which binds specifically to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors for PDGF and EGF was affinity-purified using isolated membranes. For this purpose, plasma membranes from A431 cells, which lack PDGF receptor but express 1-2 × 106 EGF receptors/cell were phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP in the absence of EGF for 2 h at 4°C under autophosphorylation conditions(10Kanakaraj P. Raj S. Khan S.A. Bishayee S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After centrifugation to remove free ATP, the membranes containing phosphorylated EGF receptors were incubated for 4 h at 4°C with Ab P2 antiserum in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM vanadate, protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the membrane pellet was washed three times to remove unbound antibody, and then the bound antibody was eluted with 0.1 M glycine HCl, pH 3.0, neutralized immediately with 3 M Tris, pH 8.8, and stored at −70°C. The antibody was also purified using plasma membranes from NR-6 cells that express PDGF receptors (both α- and β-type) but lack EGF receptor(14Das M. Miyakawa T. Fox C.F. Pruss R.M. Herchman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2790-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The purification procedure was the same as described above except that the membranes were phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP in the presence of PDGF BB. This was carried out as described(2Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Khire J. Das M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11699-11705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-, 35S-, or 125I-labeled receptor preparation was incubated with the indicated antibody either in the absence or presence of cognate peptide for 4 h at 4°C in 20 μl (unless otherwise indicated) of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM vanadate, protease inhibitors, and 40 mM phenyl phosphate. The immune complexes were isolated by incubating the mixture at 4°C for 1 h with formaldehyde-fixed Staphylococcus aureus (The Enzyme Center, Boston, MA). After washing the bacterial pellets to remove unbound radioactivity, the bound radioactivity was eluted by boiling the pellets with SDS sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel unless otherwise indicated). The gels containing 125I- or 32P-labeled receptors were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −70°C with Kodak X-Omat AR film and DuPont intensifying screens. The gels containing 35S-labeled proteins were prepared for fluorography by immersion in acetic acid containing 2,5-diphenyloxazole, washed in water, dried, and exposed to x-ray films(3Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This was carried out essentially as described previously except that the electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) by electrophoresis at 4°C overnight at 0.2 mA (3Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We previously described an anti-peptide antibody (Ab P2) directed to a cytoplasmic domain of the human β-type PDGF receptor (amino acid residues 964-979) that had very high affinity for the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the receptor (Mr 180,000) but not for the unphosphorylated receptor(3Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We also showed that immunoprecipitation of the phosphorylated receptor is not blocked by phenyl phosphate, an analog of phosphotyrosine, indicating that the antibody is not directed to phosphotyrosine. In studies utilizing the human epidermoid carcinoma cell (A431), which is known to express 1-2 × 106 EGF receptors/cell, we were able to immunoprecipitate a 32P-labeled 170-kDa protein with Ab P2 (Fig. 1). The 170-kDa protein is not immunoprecipitated by any other anti-peptide antibodies to the α- or β-type PDGF receptor; however, it is recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb 425) to an external peptide epitope of the human EGF receptor (Fig. 1). Furthermore, Ab P2 failed to immunoprecipitate the 170-kDa protein from the phosphorylated A431 receptor preparation from which the EGF receptor was removed by pretreatment with mAb 425 (not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, phosphorylation of A431 membranes with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of increasing concentrations of EGF resulted in increased immunoprecipitation of the 170-kDa protein by both Ab P2 and mAb 425. These data suggest that the 170-kDa protein recognized by Ab P2 is indeed the EGF receptor and not a truncated form of the PDGF receptor. In addition, the 170-kDa protein was also recognized in Western blot analysis by both Ab P2 and by an EGF receptor-specific antibody (Fig. 3). This suggests that there is direct interaction between Ab P2 and the EGF receptor and eliminates the possibility that the receptor precipitation is due to its tight association with an Ab P2-immunoreactive protein. The slightly higher molecular weight of the receptor in Fig. 3, lane2, is probably due to its phosphorylation, since phosphorylated protein has slower mobility than unphosphorylated protein.Figure 2:Phosphorylation of the 170-kDa protein recognized by Ab P2 is EGF-dependent. Detergent-solubilized A431 membrane preparations were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 4°C in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations (Conc.) of EGF. Following termination of the reaction with a solution containing EDTA (10 mM) and unlabeled ATP (1 mM), the labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with Ab P2 antiserum or mAb 425 and then subjected to electrophoresis and autoradiography. The region containing the 170-kDa band was densitometrically scanned.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:The 170-kDa EGF receptor is recognized by Ab P2 in Western blot analysis. Wheat germ agglutinin-agarose-purified A431 membrane proteins were phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP for 30 min at room temperature or left untreated. The phosphorylated receptor preparation ((P)EGFR) (2 μg/lane) was subjected to Western blotting with a 1:25 dilution of Ab P2 antiserum either in the presence (lane1) or absence (lane2) of cognate peptide P2 according to procedures described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unphosphorylated receptor preparation (EGFR) (2 μg/lane) was also probed with Ab P2 antiserum (1:25 dilution) (lane3) and polyclonal antibody to denatured EGF receptor (1:1000 dilution) (lane4).

Chem. 1988; 263: 12805-12808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated earlier that PDGF alone has no effect on the recognition of the receptor by Ab P2(3Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that ligand-induced receptor dimerization does not expose the antigenic epitope. We investigated whether this antibody also has similar specificity with respect to the EGF receptor. To test this, we studied the effect of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated EGF receptors on the immunoprecipitation of the 32P-labeled receptor by Ab P2. In this experiment, like the previous one (Western blotting, Fig. 3), EGF receptor in A431 cell membranes was phosphorylated in the absence of EGF by prolonged incubation at room temperature with unlabeled ATP. As shown in Fig. 4A, although more than 90% of the immunoprecipitation was blocked by 0.2 μg of the phosphorylated receptor preparation, no such effect could be seen with the unphosphorylated receptor preparation, indicating that the phosphorylated EGF receptor has very high affinity for Ab P2 compared with the unphosphorylated receptor. This was further confirmed by studies conducted with the EGF receptor covalently complexed with 125I-EGF (Fig. 4B). In this experiment, isolated membranes from A431 cells were either phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP in the absence of EGF or left untreated. Both the phosphorylated and control membranes were then incubated with 125I-EGF, chemically cross-linked with 3,3′-bis(sulfosuccinimido)suberate, and solubilized with detergent. The receptor-125I-EGF complexes were then immunoprecipitated with Ab P2 in the presence of phenyl phosphate and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results showed that when phosphorylated receptor was complexed with 125I-EGF, a 170-kDa (monomeric) and a 330-kDa (dimeric) complex were immunoprecipitated by Ab P2, and such immunoprecipitation was blocked by the cognate peptide, P2 (Fig. 4B, lanes1 and 2). However, when unphosphorylated receptor was used, the extent of immunoprecipitation of the receptor complex by Ab P2 was less than that seen with phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 4B, lane5). It should be noted that the extent of immunoprecipitation of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated receptor complexes was the same when mAb 425 was used (Fig. 4B, lanes3 and 6), indicating that phosphorylation per se has no effect on the binding or covalent cross-linking of 125I-EGF to its receptor. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitation of the phosphorylated receptor complex but not the unphosphorylated receptor complex by Ab P2 also suggests that the phosphorylated receptor rather than the dimeric receptor is recognized by the antibody. We also conducted experiments with [35S]methionine-labeled receptor. Extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled A431 cells were purified with wheat germ agglutinin and then left untreated, incubated with 1 μM EGF alone, or subjected to phosphorylation by prolonged incubation with unlabeled ATP. Both the control and treated samples were immunoprecipitated with Ab P2 and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. Ab P2 immunoprecipitated the receptor only from the sample that had been phosphorylated with ATP and not from the untreated sample or from the sample that had been incubated with EGF (data not shown). These results confirm that, as with the PDGF receptor, Ab P2 recognizes the EGF receptor only after it is phosphorylated, and receptor phosphorylation rather than ligand-induced receptor dimerization unfolds the antigenic site. The experiments described above were carried out with rabbit polyclonal antiserum that may contain antibodies directed to different epitopes within the antigenic peptide. To test whether the same antibody recognizes the phosphorylation-induced conformations of both the PDGF receptor and the EGF receptor, the antibody was affinity-purified using phosphorylated membranes from A431 cells that do not express the PDGF receptor (see Fig. 1). Like the antiserum, the affinity-purified Ab P2 also recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of both receptors (data not shown). In addition, the immunoprecipitation of the EGF receptor was competed out by excess phosphorylated PDGF receptor from murine NR-6 cells (an EGF receptor-negative mutant of 3T3 cells) and vice versa, suggesting that the same antibody interacts with both receptors. We investigated why an antibody directed to a peptide epitope of the PDGF receptor recognizes the EGF receptor in a conformation-specific fashion. A computer search revealed that in P2 peptide, there are two tripeptide sequences (Tyr-Gln-Gln and Asp-Glu-Glu) that are also present in the cytoplasmic domain of the EGF receptor. Tyr-Gln-Gln and Asp-Glu-Glu are located in amino acid residues 1148-1150 and 979-981 of the human EGF receptor, respectively(15Ullrich A. Caussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Liebermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayer E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). A dipeptide sequence, Glu-Phe, of the P2 peptide is also present in the EGF receptor (amino acid residues 943-944). To investigate which of these peptide sequences generates the phosphorylation-induced conformation-specific antibody, we synthesized two short forms of P2, one having the sequence Glu-Gly-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Val (N-terminal peptide) and the other one with Val-Asp-Glu-Glu-Phe-Leu-Arg (C-terminal peptide). In addition, we also synthesized a 16-amino acid-long peptide with a Glu-Phe sequence; this peptide corresponds to amino acid residues 931-946 of the human EGF receptor(15Ullrich A. Caussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Liebermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayer E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). Of these three peptides, only the C-terminal peptide with Asp-Glu-Glu blocks the immunoprecipitation of the 32P-labeled EGF receptor by the A431 membrane affinity-purified Ab P2 (Fig. 5). The inhibitory effect of this peptide is highly specific for Ab P2 since it had no effect on unrelated antibodies such as mAb 425 (data not shown). These results suggest that the conformation-specific antibody is directed to Asp-Glu-Glu. It should be mentioned in this connection that the α-type PDGF receptor, which is structurally related to the β receptor but lacks the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence, is not recognized by Ab P2 (10Kanakaraj P. Raj S. Khan S.A. Bishayee S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Raj S. Kanakaraj P. Khan S.A. Bishayee S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Since a phosphorylation-induced conformation of the receptors for PDGF and EGF is recognized by an antibody (Ab P2) directed to Asp-Glu-Glu, we investigated the role of the conformation of the antigenic peptide in Ab P2 recognition. For this purpose, we determined the affinities of the full-length P2 and two short forms of P2 for the antibody. The two truncated peptides are Lys-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Val-Asp-Glu-Glu-Phe-Leu-Arg (K-R peptide) and Val-Asp-Glu-Glu-Phe-Leu-Arg (V-R peptide; same as the C-terminal peptide of Fig. 5), which lack 5 and 9 amino acids, respectively, from the N terminus of P2. However, both contain the antigenic determinant, Asp-Glu-Glu. To determine the affinities of these peptides for Ab P2, the 32P-labeled EGF receptor from A431 cells or the PDGF receptor from NR-6 cells was immunoprecipitated with purified Ab P2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of a peptide. The immune complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography, and the 170-kDa EGF receptor or the 180-kDa PDGF receptor band was densitometrically scanned. There was a gradual decrease in the intensity of the respective receptor bands with increasing peptide concentrations. A plot of the data revealed that a similar concentration of a peptide is required for 50% inhibition of both receptors. For full-length P2, a 50% inhibition of immunoprecipitation of the EGF and PDGF receptors was achieved at 3 and 4 ng/ml, respectively. However, for two truncated peptides, relatively high concentrations were required for 50% inhibition (Table 1). For K-R peptide, which lacks 5 amino acids from the N terminus, 6 μ/ml was required for 50% inhibition of both receptors, whereas 40 and 20 μ/ml of V-R peptide were needed for the EGF and PDGF receptors, respectively (Table 1). Since the antibody is directed to Asp-Glu-Glu, which is present in all three peptides, the drastic reduction of the affinity of peptides for Ab P2 with decreasing chain length strongly suggests that the initial interaction between the antibody and the antigenic determinant is further stabilized through the participation of neighboring amino acids.Table I Open table in a new tab It is not unusual for an anti-peptide antibody to interact with different proteins. Such cross-reactivity is due to partial sequence identity among related proteins. However, the interesting fact about Ab P2 is that it not only recognizes the PDGF receptor in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion, it also displays similar binding characteristics with the EGF receptor, i.e. it recognizes only the phosphorylated EGF receptor and not the unphosphorylated receptor. It should be mentioned here that all of our immunological studies were carried out in the presence of phenyl phosphate, suggesting that the antibody recognizes the phosphorylated protein and not phosphotyrosine. In addition, the lack of an effect of EGF on the binding of the unphosphorylated receptor to the antibody eliminates the possibility that ligand-induced EGF receptor dimerization uncovers the antigenic epitope. A similar finding has also been demonstrated with the PDGF receptor(3Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In P2, there are two tripeptide sequences (Tyr-Gln-Gln and Asp-Glu-Glu) that are also present in the EGF receptor. Our studies conducted with peptides containing either the Tyr-Gln-Gln or the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence suggest that the conformation-specific antibody is directed to Asp-Glu-Glu (Fig. 5). In the human EGF receptors and in the PDGF receptors, the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence is present in the cytoplasmic domain, and it is located 279 (amino acid residues 979-981) and 130 (amino acid residues 974-976) amino acids from the C terminus, respectively. However, irrespective of the location of Asp-Glu-Glu with respect to C terminus amino acids in these receptor molecules, this tripeptide is cryptic in unphosphorylated receptors, and phosphorylation uncovers this sequence. This suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation induces similar conformational changes in the PDGF and EGF receptor that result in unmasking of the Asp-Glu-Glu epitope. It will be of interest to identify the tyrosine residues that must be phosphorylated to bring about such structural changes in the receptors. In the EGF receptors, five autophosphorylation sites have been identified(16Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Out of these sites, Tyr992 is nearest to the tripeptide sequence, and it is 11 amino acids downstream of this sequence. In addition, a putative acceptor site (Tyr954), which is 27 amino acids upstream of the tripeptide sequence, has recently been reported(17Case R.D. Piccione E. Wolf G. Benett A.M. Leichleider R.J. Neel B.J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10467-10474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the β-type PDGF receptor, eight autophosphorylation sites have been identified(18Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 19Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the two tyrosine residues located within the P2 peptide at amino acids 966 and 970 are not among these sites. The tyrosine residues nearest to the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence that undergo autophosphorylation are 35 amino acids downstream (Tyr1009) and 137 amino acids upstream (Tyr857), respectively, of the tripeptide sequence. Working with an anti-peptide antibody (Ab 83) similar to our Ab P2, Fantl et al.(20Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4473-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) demonstrated that unlike the wild type receptor, a murine β-type PDGF receptor mutant, Y825F, in which Tyr825 (in humans, Tyr857) was converted to Phe, was not recognized by the antibody. Based on this and related studies, it was concluded that phosphorylation of Tyr825 is essential for the conformational change and for signal transduction as well. However, since Y825F mutant receptor has considerably lower kinase activity compared with the wild type receptor, it is possible that not all of the acceptor tyrosine sites in the receptor undergo autophosphorylation. Thus, it is an open question whether the failure of the mutant receptor to bind to the antibody is due to lack of receptor phosphorylation at Tyr825 or at some other acceptor site(s). This question can be resolved by using other Tyr → Phe receptor mutants. In addition, since the conformation surrounding the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence is highly susceptible to the phosphorylation state of the receptor, it will be of interest to investigate whether Asp-Glu-Glu or other amino acids surrounding this sequence play any role in biological signal transduction. It should be mentioned in this context that a PDGF receptor mutant with a truncation of 141 amino acids (CT141) from the C terminus displays almost no kinase activity, whereas a mutant with a deletion of 98 amino acids (CT98) retains its kinase activity(21Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21158-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence is located between 141 and 98 amino acids from the C terminus, it is retained in the CT98 mutant (kinase-active) but not in the CT141 mutant (kinase-inactive). It should be mentioned that the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence is also present in neu, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is related to but distinct from the EGF receptor(22Bargman C.I. Hung M.C. Weinburg R.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Unlike the receptors for PDGF and EGF in which the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence is intracellular, in neu it is extracellular (amino acid residues 623-625) and near the transmembrane domain(22Bargman C.I. Hung M.C. Weinburg R.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). However, the 32P-labeled 185-kDa neu from human SK-BR-3 breast adenocarcinoma cells that overexpress neu(23Kraus M.H. Popescu N.C. Amsbaugh S.C. King C.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 24Bangalore L. Tanner A.J. Laudano A.P. Stern D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11637-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is not recognized by Ab P2 (data not shown). Lack of recognition of neu by Ab P2 is probably due to the steric hindrance contributed by the oligosaccharide chains. In fact, there are a number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in neu including a site 8 amino acids downstream of the Asp-Glu-Glu sequence (22Bargman C.I. Hung M.C. Weinburg R.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Alternatively, such lack of recognition may be due to the absence of certain amino acids in neu that play an important role in stabilizing the interaction between Asp-Glu-Glu and Ab P2. This is supported by our finding that truncation of 5 amino acids (Glu-Gly-Tyr-Lys-Lys) from P2 peptide drastically reduces its affinity for Ab P2; however, removal of 4 more amino acids (Lys-Tyr-Gln-Gln) does not further significantly reduce the affinity of the truncated V-R peptide for the antibody (Table 1). Thus, it will be of interest to identify the amino acids within the pentapeptide that influence the complex interaction between Asp-Glu-Glu and Ab P2. In addition, studies using different EGF receptor mutants with or without the tripeptide will give us an insight into this antigen-antibody interaction. Apart from its use as a biological tool in studying the structure-function relationship of receptors, this antibody can be of use in clinical settings. Since autophosphorylation is a consequence of receptor activation and Ab P2 recognizes only the phosphorylated receptor, it is capable of discriminating between activated and dormant kinases. This characteristic of Ab P2 may be exploited in detecting activated EGF receptor in biopsy samples derived from adenocarcinomas and gliomas. At least two other anti-peptide antibodies, one directed to the insulin receptor and the other one to neu, that recognize specifically the phosphorylated receptors have been reported (24Bangalore L. Tanner A.J. Laudano A.P. Stern D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11637-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Herrera R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11980-11985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the later case, the antibody is directed to a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide of neu and the EGF receptor. Although both Ab P2 and neu antibody recognize activated EGF receptor, there are certain differences between these two antibodies. Ab P2 is directed to a peptide epitope, whereas neu antibody is directed to a phosphopeptide. Second, Ab P2 recognizes both the activated PDGF and EGF receptors, whereas neu antibody interacts with activated EGF receptor and neu. Thus, Ab P2 in combination with neu antibody may be useful in clinical settings to detect specifically the activated EGF receptor in biopsy samples. We thank Drs. Gary Butler and Bruce Byrne for help with computer analyses."

The physiological mechanism of inactivation of VIP has not been well clarified, but the primary pathway is thought to involve proteolytic degradation. Several peptidases which were thought to be related to inactivation of VIP have been studied including mast cell tryptase and chymase(9Caughey G.H. Leidig F. Viro N.F. Nadel J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The present study was initiated in an attempt to isolate and characterize such a protease(s) that might specifically degrade VIP and/or related neuropeptides. This type of protease is thought to be present in minute quantity in the tissue, and often in the membrane-bound form. Therefore, special care should be taken to minimize proteolytic degradation that is apt to occur during the isolation procedures from gastric mucosa which contains lysosomal and a variety of other proteases(11Uchino T.

Thus, we used density gradient fractionation in the initial stage of the isolation procedure to minimize proteolytic degradation of the target protease(s), especially by lysosomal proteases. Further, we first chose t-butyloxycarbonyl(Boc)-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) as a routine substrate since VIP and related neuropeptides generally contain several basic residues, often including basic amino acid pairs, at which sites cleavages were expected to occur, and assay was done by HPLC analysis of the cleavage products of the synthetic peptide MCA which is resistant to the action of aminopeptidase unlike simple oligopeptides like VIP. Thus, we could finally isolate a novel membrane-bound neutral endoprotease from porcine antral mucosa which can fairly specifically degrade VIP as well as Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA, and here we report its enzymatic characteristics.

Somatostatin 28, oxidized bovine insulin B chain, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz), carbonic anhydrase, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), Nα-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), Nα-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB), and o-phenanthroline were purchased from Sigma. Lubrol PX, Triton X-100, sodium cholate, EDTA, benzamidine hydrochloride, and 2-mercaptoethanol were from Nacalai Tesque Inc. Human progastrin88–101 peptide was synthesized in our laboratory using an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer model 431A and purified by HPLC. Aminopeptidase B was purified by successive chromatographies on DE52, Sepharose CL-6B, TSKgel butyl-Toyopearl 650, concanavalin A-Sepharose in our laboratory. A mixture of molecular weight marker proteins for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was from Bio-Rad. Other reagents used were of the highest grade available. All steps were performed at 4°C unless otherwise specified. Porcine antral mucosa (25 g) was carefully scraped from fresh stomachs and homogenized in 250 ml of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2) containing 0.27 M sucrose, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 μM leupeptin (TS-PL buffer) first in a Waring blender (15 s × 3 times) and then in a Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was filtered through 4 layers of surgical gauze to remove cell debris and nuclei, and the filtrate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was suspended in TS-PL buffer and recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The fluffy material found on top of the compact vesicle pellet was gently swirled and removed, and the remaining pellet fraction was suspended in 10 ml of 0.27 M sucrose in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2) and gently homogenized. This vesicle fraction was used in the subsequent sucrose density gradient centrifugation. 2.1 M sucrose solution was added to 4.5 ml of the above vesicle fraction to a final volume of 10 ml and a final sucrose concentration of 1.2 M in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2). This was layered on a stepwise gradient composed of 0.27 M (6 ml), 0.8 M (6 ml), 1.45 M (4 ml), 1.7 M (4 ml) and 2.0 M (2 ml) sucrose in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2). After centrifugation for 10 h at 100,000 × g in a Hitachi RPS 27-2 rotor, 1.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom, and density was measured by a refractometer. All enzymatic reactions were done at 37°C. The Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA cleaving activity was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM substrate, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.1% Lubrol PX, and 1 mM CaCl2. The cleavage products were analyzed by an Applied Biosystems 130A separation system using an Aquapore OD-300 C18 column (2.1 × 30 mm) eluted with a gradient of 0-45% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. If necessary, the enzymatic reaction was done in 200 μl of the above reaction mixture containing 3 units of aminopeptidase B (1 unit of the activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme to liberate 1 μmol of AMC/min in the reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM Arg-MCA and 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2)). After addition of 1 ml of the stop solution containing 100 mM sodium chloroacetate, 20 mM sodium acetate, and 0.4%(v/v) acetic acid, the amount of AMC produced by the aminopeptidase reaction was measured fluorometrically with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm in a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer 650-10S. Aminopeptidase B activity was assayed by the method of Usui et al.(17Usui Y. Ohtomo T. Yoshida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) with modifications in 200 μl of a reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM Arg-MCA and 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), and the amount of AMC produced was measured fluorometrically. Acid phosphatase activity was assayed by the modified Lowry method (18Lowry O.H. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 4: 371-372Google Scholar) with 10 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 500 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) at 37°C for 1 h. After the reaction, 500 μl of 0.2 N NaOH was added, and the absorbance at 410 nm was measured. Trypsin-like protease activity toward Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-MCA was assayed fluorometrically as described (11Uchino T. Sakurai Y. Nishigai M. Takahashi T. Arakawa H. Ikai A. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 527-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.1 mM substrate in 200 μl of 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.2). Cysteine protease activity toward Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA was assayed with 0.1 mM substrate in 200 μl of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and the amount of AMC produced was measured fluorometrically. Protein was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm of the sample solution or by the method of Smith et al.(19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano E.K. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olsen B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18702) Google Scholar) using the BCA reagent. The protein finally isolated was microquantitated on SDS-PAGE after silver staining by comparing with pancreatic trypsin inhibitor as a standard protein. All procedures were performed at 4°C. Ten volumes of 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6) containing 10 μM leupeptin and 1% Lubrol PX were added to the 1.5 ml of the active fraction obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the enzyme was solubilized by magnetic stirring overnight. The solubilized sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 25 min in a Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor. The resulting clear supernatant was dialyzed against 40 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.6), 0.2% Lubrol PX. The dialyzed sample was applied to a DE52 column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 40 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.6), 0.2% Lubrol PX, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml, and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (1 × 145 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 40 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.2 M NaCl and 0.05% Lubrol PX. The pooled active fraction from the Sephacryl S-200 was applied to a Mono-Q/FPLC HR5/5 column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.02% Lubrol PX. The active fractions were pooled and applied to a PCMB-agarose affinity column (0.9 × 3 cm) and eluted first with 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.2 M NaCl, and then with 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), and 1.0 M NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6). Each peptide (1,000 pmol) was incubated in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 1 mM CaCl2, 0.1% Lubrol PX, and 5.4 fmol of the purified enzyme. The peptide fragments produced were separated by HPLC with a Hitachi 655A-11/LC5000 system using a TSKgel ODS-120T reverse-phase column (0.46 × 25 cm). Elution was performed with a gradient from 0% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 50% acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid and monitored at 215 and 280 nm. The amino acid composition of each peak was analyzed in an Applied Biosystems 420A derivatizer/analyzer. In sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1), the activity of acid phosphatase, a lysosomal marker enzyme, was mainly distributed in fractions 11-15 while the aminopeptidase activity toward Arg-MCA was mainly in fractions 12-16 and in 5-8 (Fig. 1B). Trypsin-like protease activity toward Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-MCA from the vesicular source was rather low and was observed in a broad region (Fig. 1C), whereas much higher activity was observed in the microsomal fraction (distributed at density 1.23 g/ml) (data not shown). Its activity distribution was different from those of acid phosphatase and aminopeptidase B. Cysteine protease activity toward Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA, requiring a reducing agent, was also broadly distributed in fractions from 7 to 13 (Fig. 1C). To detect a novel protease, we used the synthetic peptide Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA which has often been used as a substrate for furin and related proteases(20Molley S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the fluorometric determination of AMC produced directly by enzymatic reaction, we analyzed the reaction products by HPLC or determined AMC after additional reaction with aminopeptidase B because some proteases may cleave at other site(s) than the Arg-MCA bond in the substrate(21Azaryan A.V. Hook V.Y.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Through this screening method we found a new proteolytic activity unexpectedly cleaving the Arg-Arg bond, but not the Arg-MCA bond, of Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA. This activity was found in fraction 7 (at density 1.17-1.18 g/ml) (Fig. 1D), was not inhibited by leupeptin, and was clearly different from the activities of the trypsin-like protease(s), cysteine protease(s), and aminopeptidase(s) which were also found in gastric mucosal vesicle fractions. When the novel protease fraction obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was chromatographed on DE52, the activity cleaving the Arg-Arg bond of Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA was obtained as shown in Fig. 2A. The active fractions (fractions 20-26) were pooled for the subsequent purification on Sephacryl S-200, which gave a single peak of activity (Fig. 2B). The pooled S-200 fraction (fractions 42-48) was purified further by Mono-Q/FPLC. Upon Mono-Q/FPLC, the enzyme was eluted at 220 mM NaCl as a single peak (Fig. 2C). Based on the preliminary analysis showing that this protease activity was strongly inhibited by PCMB, we then tried to purify the protease further by PCMB-agarose affinity chromatography. Many enzymes are eluted with 10-50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol from a PCMB-agarose or PCMB-Sepharose column (22Hirao T. Hara K. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Hosoi K. Kobayashi S. Ueha T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 24Tsuru D. Fujiwara K. Kado K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unusually, the present enzyme activity was not eluted with 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, but could be eluted with 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol plus 1.0 M NaCl as shown in Fig. 2D. Thus we finally isolated 0.4 μg of the purified enzyme from 21.6 mg of protein of the active fraction obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the antral vesicle fraction (Table 1). Its molecular weight was estimated to be approximately 37,000 by 12.5% SDS-PAGE under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3), indicating that it is composed of a single chain polypeptide. The protease activity coincided well with the band of the purified protein on 12.5% native-PAGE (Fig. 3).Table I Open table in a new tab When various synthetic peptide MCAs were used as substrates, the purified protease showed distinct specificity as shown in Table 2. It cleaved on the N-terminal side of an arginine residue immediately preceding the MCA moiety in some of the MCA substrates (Table 2). The best substrate among them was Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA and the enzyme cleaved the Arg-Arg bond, but the other sites were not cleaved at all.Table II Open table in a new tab On the other hand, when various oligopeptides including gastrointestinal peptides were examined as substrates, the purified protease cleaved only VIP most rapidly, and secretin at a slower rate which has structural similarities to VIP (25Taylor I.L. Mannon P. Yamada T. Alpers D.H. Owyang C. Powell D.W. Silverstein F.E. Textbook of Gastroenterology. Vol. I. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1991: 24-49Google Scholar) and no other peptides were hydrolyzed significantly except that substance P and oxidized insulin B chain were hydrolyzed slowly (Table 3). Interestingly, VIP was mainly cleaved by this protease at three sites which had not been expected from its specificity toward the synthetic peptide MCA substrates as shown in Fig. 4, and no cleavage occurred in the other part of VIP including the Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys sequence of which the Arg-Lys and Thr-Arg bonds were expected to be cleaved by the enzyme as judged from its specificity toward MCA substrates. The cleaving activity of VIP at the three sites (Fig. 4) paralleled the Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA cleaving activity throughout the purification by successive column chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, Mono-Q/FPLC, and PCMB-agarose.Table III Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters with VIP and Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA as substrates were analyzed as shown in Table 4. These results indicated that the enzyme has much higher affinity and catalytic efficiency toward VIP than toward Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA.Table IV Open table in a new tab The protease activity toward Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA was increased about eight times by the addition of Lubrol PX or Triton X-100, whereas sodium cholate was not effective and SDS showed inhibition at above 0.001% (Fig. 5A). Likewise, the protease activity toward VIP was dependent on Lubrol PX (Fig. 5A). This indicated that membrane components are necessary for the endoprotease to have maximal enzymatic activity and that the enzyme is indeed a membrane-bound protease. This protease activity toward VIP and Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA showed an optimum at pH 7.5 (Fig. 5B). This protease was inhibited by serine protease inhibitors such as DFP and PMSF. The activity was completely inhibited by 10 mM DFP, although it was not so effective at 1 mM concentration. Interestingly, this protease was also inhibited by PCMB, chymostatin, and iodoacetic acid, but not by E-64 and leupeptin which are also cysteine protease inhibitors (Table 5). The activity was increased about 40% by 1 mM Ca2+ ion, whereas it was strongly inhibited by metal ions such as Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+.Table V Open table in a new tab Rapid and specific inactivation of a neuropeptide after its function is important and is thought to depend on the action of its inactivating enzyme(s). There have been many reports of different peptidases which may be involved in neuropeptide degradation(16Bunnett N.W. Goldstein S.M. Nakazato P. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 76-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Matsas R. Fulcher I.S. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1509-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Joudiou C. Carvalho K.M. Camarao G. Boussetta H. Cohen P.

J. 1991; 276: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but there is not much convincing evidence as yet for any of them that it is specific for a single peptide. In the present study, we have attempted to isolate a novel protease(s) from porcine antral mucosa which may be involved in neuropeptide processing or degradation using a synthetic peptide MCA substrate, Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA, and could finally isolate a 37,000 dalton neutral endoprotease, which was found to cleave VIP highly efficiently as well as specifically. This new endoprotease activity was distributed in a narrow range in the sucrose density gradient centrifugation as compared with other protease activities (Fig. 1), and showed the optimum activity at pH 7.5 (Fig. 5B), which is higher than that of secretory granules or lysosomes (pH 5.5-6.5). These results indicated the possibility that this enzyme might be associated with some specific membranous structures other than secretory granules or lysosomes. The activity was dependent on some detergents (Fig. 5A). This protease required 0.001% or a higher concentration of a detergent for maximal activity. The enzyme could be kept very stable when Lubrol PX was added to the enzyme solution, but it was very unstable without Lubrol PX (data not shown). Therefore the presence of certain membrane components in vivo seems to be very important for its activity and stability. These results also suggest strongly that the enzyme is bound to a specific membranous structure by hydrophobic interaction. The endoprotease was inhibited by serine protease inhibitors; it was completely inhibited by 10 mM DFP or 1 mM PMSF. It was also inhibited strongly by PCMB and iodoacetic acid and had a high affinity toward a PCMB-agarose affinity column, whereas it was not inhibited by other cysteine protease inhibitors such as E-64 and leupeptin, and it did not require any reducing agent for its activity. Therefore, the present protease appears to be most likely a serine protease although its action as a cysteine protease cannot be completely excluded. This enzyme is thought to have an SH group(s) in the vicinity of the active site, the modification of which results in an extensive inactivation of the enzyme. The present protease showed a distinct substrate specificity as shown in Table II, Table III. The protease cleaved Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA at the Arg-Arg bond. This cleavage pattern is distinct from that of furin and related proteases (20Molley S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The same type of cleavage was also observed at the Lys-Arg and Thr-Arg bonds in Pyr-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA and Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA, respectively, but susceptibility was very low when compared with that of Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA. On the other hand, when various peptides were used as substrates, VIP was found to be cleaved much more specifically than synthetic peptide MCA substrates (Table 4). Unexpectedly, VIP was cleaved at three sites (A-C sites in Fig. 4) not involving arginine residues. These results suggested the possibility that the Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA cleaving activity, and the VIP-degrading activity might be due to different enzymes. However, each cleaving activity in VIP and the Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA cleaving activity coincided well with each other in pH dependence (Fig. 5B) and the effects of inhibitors (Table 5). The protease activity toward VIP was strongly dependent on Lubrol PX as in the case of Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, upon native PAGE of the purified enzyme, both Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA cleaving activity and VIP-degrading activity coincided practically completely with each other (Fig. 3). These results indicate that these activities are due to a single enzyme. The present protease showed high substrate specificity, hydrolyzing only a few substrates. There appears to be some tendency that certain amino acid residues with bulky, but not aromatic, side chains, such as Gln, Met, Lys, Leu, etc., are preferred at the P1 and often at the P1′ positions. However, the amino acid residues at the cleavage sites and in their vicinities are fairly variable, and it is difficult to define clearly the subsite specificity of the enzyme. This enzyme might recognize a specific amino acid sequence(s) and/or conformation in the vicinity of the cleavage site of the target peptide. Taken together, the present enzyme is strongly suggested to be involved in the enzymatic inactivation of certain neuropeptides, especially VIP. However, further studies are necessary to obtain a definite conclusion on the physiological role and the substrate specificity of this novel proteinase.
