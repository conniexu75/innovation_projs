https://openalex.org/W2080410687,"In the freshwater fish Catostomus clarkii, the frequency of alleles for polymorphic serum esterase varies with latitude. The activity of the allele more frequent in southern populations increases as temperature increases from 0 degrees to 37 degrees C, whereas activity of the allele more frequent in northern populations increases as temperature decreases. Coefficients of selection used to calculate allelic equilibrium within populations are derived from the activity profiles of the genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1982340009,Giant mitochondria in hepatocytes that have the average size of nuclei can be consistently produced in the liver of weanling mice by feeding them cuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone). The simplicity of the procedure and the consistency of the results make the feeding of cuprizone a new and useful experimental tool for the study of mitochondrial metabolism.

Subsequently, prerecorded patterns of their brain stimulation were ""played back"" to them. All subjects learned to escape brain stimulation delivered in exactly the same manner as they had previously elected to receive it."
https://openalex.org/W2030903875,The amino acid sequence of fragments obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the mu-chain of a human gammaM-globulin is homologous to the NH(2)-terminal sequences of the gamma-chain of human and rabbit gammaG-globulins and is related to that of human light chains. This supports the hypothesis that light and heavy chains evolved from a common ancestral gene.
https://openalex.org/W2064631662,"An identified molluscan interneuron mediates different cholinergic synaptic actions by increasing the conductance of its follower cells to different ions. We have now found that this interneuron also mediates a new class of synaptic actions which does not involve a conductance change but the activation of an electrogenic sodium pump. This synaptic action results in a prolonged inhibitory synaptic potential which is dependent on metabolism and is selectively blocked by cooling and ouabain. In cells which have this synaptic potential, part of the resting membrane potential is also maintained by an electrogenic sodium pump. The same transmitter, acetylcholine, can independently stimulate both a chloride ion conductance and a sodium pump mechanism in the same follower cell by acting on two different postsynaptic receptors."

Isotope release from EAC1-7 cells proceeded more rapidly and was more extensive than that from EAC1-3 cells. Lysis of these cells was suppressed by pretreatment of leukocytes with antimycin A. Monocyte-enriched leukocyte preparations affected both types of target cell-complement intermediates, whereas purified lymphocytes lysed EAC1-7 cells but not EAC1-3 cells."

The time-honored hypothesis that the major determinanit of the virulence of the plague bacillius is its ability to resist ingestion by phagocytes mutst be reevaluated.

https://openalex.org/W1968681896,"Progesterone administered with estrogen to the intact female chick antagonizes the characteristic effects of estrogen to induce cell proliferation and cytodifferentiation of tubular gland cells in the oviduct, events that are accompanied by the appearance of lysozyme. Progesterone appears to exert its effect by preventing proliferation of cells destined to become tubular gland cells, but once such cells do proliferate, subsequent cytodifferentiation and appearance of lysozyme are not prevented."

Level or decreasing pressures in the esophagus during expiration, and in the blowhole at the onset of expiration, revealed the driving force of expiration to be solely elastic recoil. Active muscular reexpansion of the lungs ensued immediately. Expiration and inspiration were completed in about I second."

https://openalex.org/W1995478254,"SINCE the original discovery of genetic variation in human 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (E.C.1.1.1.44) by Fildes and Parr in 19631, several new variants showing either electrophoretic differences in starch gel or quantitative variation have been demonstrated2. The variants segregate in families in accordance with expectations based on control by autosomal codominant alleles, but with the exception of the “common” variant their frequency is very low. The “common” variant of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) represents the heterozygous genotype PGDA/PGDC and the frequency of the PGDC allele is significantly different in populations in various parts of the world3, ranging from zero in one small group of Central American Indians to 0.152 for Bantu in South Africa. Surveys of Caucasians in Europe, North America and South Africa give values of the PGDC allele ranging from 0.021 to 0.039."

https://openalex.org/W1976709960,"Most of the muscle fibers in the walking legs of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii generate only graded electrical responses. However, some fibers in extensor muscles of the carpopodite have long sarcomeres, about 10 micrometers in length, and generate overshooting spikes that have conduction velocities of 0.3 meter per second. The spikes induce twitch contractions."

https://openalex.org/W2045942088,In their article on serum copper alteration after ingestion of an oral contraceptive OLeary and Spellacy state that mechanism of action of this increase is unknown but may represent a variation in the plasma proteins that bind the various metals. The effect of the principal steroidal constituents of the oral contraceptive used mestranol and norethynodrel as described by these authors is neither unexpected nor unique. The effect of estrogens on serum copper and ceru loplasmin has been recognized for over a decade after a two- to threefold increase in serum copper and ceruloplasmin during pregnancy was reported in 1947 by Holmberg and Laurell. For example Russ and Raymunt found that serum copper and ceruloplasmin in a variety of patients was increased 2-3 times after the administration of .25-1.0 mg of ethinyl estradiol per day for 3-4 weeks an effect exceeding that noted by OLeary and Spellacy. It has been postulated that this estrogen action is mediated through increased biosynthesis or secretion of ceruloplasmin or both by the liver. Thus the changes in serum copper and presumably ceruloplasmin appear to represent a typical response to moderate estrogen or steroid treatment an effect well known in the literature.(FULL TEXT)
