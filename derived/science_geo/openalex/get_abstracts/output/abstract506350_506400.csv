https://openalex.org/W2059586354,"The lack of in vitro prostate cancer models that recapitulate the diversity of human prostate cancer has hampered progress in understanding disease pathogenesis and therapy response. Using a 3D organoid system, we report success in long-term culture of prostate cancer from biopsy specimens and circulating tumor cells. The first seven fully characterized organoid lines recapitulate the molecular diversity of prostate cancer subtypes, including TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, SPOP mutation, SPINK1 overexpression, and CHD1 loss. Whole-exome sequencing shows a low mutational burden, consistent with genomics studies, but with mutations in FOXA1 and PIK3R1, as well as in DNA repair and chromatin modifier pathways that have been reported in advanced disease. Loss of p53 and RB tumor suppressor pathway function are the most common feature shared across the organoid lines. The methodology described here should enable the generation of a large repertoire of patient-derived prostate cancer lines amenable to genetic and pharmacologic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2005274657,"The prostate gland consists of basal and luminal cells arranged as pseudostratified epithelium. In tissue recombination models, only basal cells reconstitute a complete prostate gland, yet murine lineage-tracing experiments show that luminal cells generate basal cells. It has remained challenging to address the molecular details of these transitions and whether they apply to humans, due to the lack of culture conditions that recapitulate prostate gland architecture. Here, we describe a 3D culture system that supports long-term expansion of primary mouse and human prostate organoids, composed of fully differentiated CK5+ basal and CK8+ luminal cells. Organoids are genetically stable, reconstitute prostate glands in recombination assays, and can be experimentally manipulated. Single human luminal and basal cells give rise to organoids, yet luminal-cell-derived organoids more closely resemble prostate glands. These data support a luminal multilineage progenitor cell model for prostate tissue and establish a robust, scalable system for mechanistic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2047783720,"Glutamatergic projections from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) contribute to cocaine relapse. Here we show that silent synapse-based remodeling of the two major mPFC-to-NAc projections differentially regulated the progressive increase in cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving). Specifically, cocaine self-administration in rats generated AMPA receptor-silent glutamatergic synapses within both infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic mPFC (PrL) to NAc projections, measured after 1 day of withdrawal. After 45 days of withdrawal, IL-to-NAc silent synapses became unsilenced/matured by recruiting calcium-permeable (CP) AMPARs, whereas PrL-to-NAc silent synapses matured by recruiting non-CP-AMPARs, resulting in differential remodeling of these projections. Optogenetic reversal of silent synapse-based remodeling of IL-to-NAc and PrL-to-NAc projections potentiated and inhibited, respectively, incubation of cocaine craving on withdrawal day 45. Thus, pro- and antirelapse circuitry remodeling is induced in parallel after cocaine self-administration. These results may provide substrates for utilizing endogenous antirelapse mechanisms to reduce cocaine relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2036561191,"The intestinal microbiota is increasingly recognized as a complex signaling network that impacts on many systems beyond the enteric system modulating, among others, cognitive functions including learning, memory and decision-making processes. This has led to the concept of a microbiota-driven gut–brain axis, reflecting a bidirectional interaction between the central nervous system and the intestine. A deficit in synaptic plasticity is one of the many changes that occurs with age. Specifically, the archetypal model of plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), is reduced in hippocampus of middle-aged and aged rats. Because the intestinal microbiota might change with age, we have investigated whether the age-related deficit in LTP might be attenuated by changing the composition of intestinal microbiota with VSL#3, a probiotic mixture comprising 8 Gram-positive bacterial strains. Here, we report that treatment of aged rats with VSL#3 induced a robust change in the composition of intestinal microbiota with an increase in the abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacterioidetes, which was reduced in control-treated aged rats. VSL#3 administration modulated the expression of a large group of genes in brain tissue as assessed by whole gene expression, with evidence of a change in genes that impact on inflammatory and neuronal plasticity processes. The age-related deficit in LTP was attenuated in VSL#3-treated aged rats and this was accompanied by a modest decrease in markers of microglial activation and an increase in expression of BDNF and synapsin. The data support the notion that intestinal microbiota can be manipulated to positively impact on neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W2080985502,"Objective Our aim was to compare the effect of central obesity (measured by waist-to-height ratio, WHtR) and total obesity (measured by body mass index, BMI) on life expectancy expressed as years of life lost (YLL), using data on British adults. Methods A Cox proportional hazards model was applied to data from the prospective Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS) and the cross sectional Health Survey for England (HSE). The number of years of life lost (YLL) at three ages (30, 50, 70 years) was found by comparing the life expectancies of obese lives with those of lives at optimum levels of BMI and WHtR. Results Mortality risk associated with BMI in the British HALS survey was similar to that found in US studies. However, WHtR was a better predictor of mortality risk. For the first time, YLL have been quantified for different values of WHtR. This has been done for both sexes separately and for three representative ages. Conclusion This study supports the simple message “Keep your waist circumference to less than half your height”. The use of WHtR in public health screening, with appropriate action, could help add years to life."
https://openalex.org/W1968052811,"Previous studies indicate that both Dectin-3 (also called MCL or Clec4d) and Mincle (also called Clec4e), two C-type lectin receptors, can recognize trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate (TDM), a cell wall component from mycobacteria, and induce potent innate immune responses. Interestingly, stimulation of Dectin-3 by TDM can also induce Mincle expression, which may enhance the host innate immune system to sense Mycobacterium infection. However, the mechanism by which Dectin-3 induces Mincle expression is not fully defined. Here, we show that TDM-induced Mincle expression is dependent on Dectin-3-mediated NF-κB, but not nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), activation, and Dectin-3 induces NF-κB activation through the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 complex. We found that bone marrow-derived macrophages from Dectin-3-deficient mice were severely defective in the induction of Mincle expression in response to TDM stimulation. This defect is correlated with the failure of TDM-induced NF-κB activation in Dectin-3-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages. Consistently, inhibition of NF-κB, but not NFAT, impaired TDM-induced Mincle expression, whereas NF-κB, but not NFAT, binds to the Mincle promoter. Dectin-3-mediated NF-κB activation is dependent on the CARD9-Bcl10-MALT1 complex. Finally, mice deficient for Dectin-3 or CARD9 produced much less proinflammatory cytokines and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-specific antibodies after immunization with an adjuvant containing TDM. Overall, this study provides the mechanism by which Dectin-3 induces Mincle expression in response to Mycobacterium infection, which will have significant impact to improve adjuvant and design vaccine for antimicrobial infection.

https://openalex.org/W2028938372,"The mechanisms underlying the large amplitudes and heterogeneity of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapses are unknown. Based on electrophysiology, electron and superresolution light microscopy, and modeling, we propose that uniquantal exocytosis shaped by a dynamic fusion pore is a candidate neurotransmitter release mechanism in IHCs. Modeling indicated that the extended postsynaptic AMPA receptor clusters enable large uniquantal EPSCs. Recorded multiphasic EPSCs were triggered by similar glutamate amounts as monophasic ones and were consistent with progressive vesicle emptying during pore flickering. The fraction of multiphasic EPSCs decreased in absence of Ca2+ influx and upon application of the Ca2+ channel modulator BayK8644. Our experiments and modeling did not support the two most popular multiquantal release interpretations of EPSC heterogeneity: (1) Ca2+-synchronized exocytosis of multiple vesicles and (2) compound exocytosis fueled by vesicle-to-vesicle fusion. We propose that IHC synapses efficiently use uniquantal glutamate release for achieving high information transmission rates."
https://openalex.org/W2016022717,"Sound-evoked spikes in the auditory nerve can phase-lock with submillisecond precision for prolonged periods of time. However, the synaptic mechanisms that enable this accurate spike firing remain poorly understood. Using paired recordings from adult frog hair cells and their afferent fibers, we show here that during sine-wave stimuli, synaptic failures occur even during strong stimuli. However, exclusion of these failures leads to mean excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes that are independent of Ca2+ current. Given the intrinsic jitter in spike triggering, evoked synaptic potentials and spikes had surprisingly similar degrees of synchronization to a sine-wave stimulus. This similarity was explained by an unexpected finding: large-amplitude evoked EPSCs have a significantly larger synchronization index than smaller evoked EPSCs. Large EPSCs therefore enhance the precision of spike timing. The hair cells’ unique capacity for continuous, large-amplitude, and highly synchronous multiquantal release thus underlies its ability to trigger phase-locked spikes in afferent fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2041511660,"The endophytic bacterium, Sphingomonas SaMR12, isolated from Sedum alfredii Hance, appears to increase plant biomass and zinc-extraction from contaminated soil; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. Here, the ability of SaMR12 to promote zinc extraction and its effects on root morphology and exudation were examined in hydroponics. Zinc treatment increased shoot biomass by 30 to 45%, and by a further 10 to 19% when combined with SaMR12 inoculation. Zinc treatment also increased zinc accumulation modestly and this too was enhanced with SaMR12. Both biomass and zinc levels increased in a dose-dependent manner with significant effects seen at 50 µM zinc and apparent saturation at 500 µM. Zinc and the endophyte also increased levels of auxin but not at 50 µM and zinc increased levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide but mainly at 500 µM. As for root morphology, SaMR12 increased root branching, the number of root tips, and surface area. Zinc and SaMR12 also increased the exudation of oxalic acid. For most assays the effects of the endophyte and zinc were additive, with the notable exception of SaMR12 strongly reducing the production of reactive oxygen species at 500 µM zinc. Taken together, these results suggest that the promotion of growth and zinc uptake by exposure to zinc and to SaMR12 are independent of reactive oxygen and do not involve increases in auxin."
https://openalex.org/W2089511839,"Epithelial cells are highly dependent during wound healing and tumorigenesis on the α6β4 integrin and its association with receptor tyrosine kinases. Previous work showed that phosphorylation of the β4 subunit upon matrix engagement depends on the matrix receptor syndecan (Sdc)-1 engaging the cytoplasmic domain of the β4 integrin and coupling of the integrin to human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). In this study, HER2-dependent migration activated by matrix engagement is compared with migration stimulated by EGF. We find that whereas HER2-dependent migration depends on Sdc1, EGF-dependent migration depends on a complex consisting of human epidermal growth factor receptor-1 (HER1, commonly known as EGFR), α6β4, and Sdc4. The two syndecans recognize distinct sites at the extreme C terminus of the β4 integrin cytoplasmic domain. The binding motif in Sdc1 is QEEXYX, composed in part by its syndecan-specific variable (V) region and in part by the second conserved (C2) region that it shares with other syndecans. A cell-penetrating peptide containing this sequence competes for HER2-dependent epithelial migration and carcinoma survival, although it is without effect on the EGFR-stimulated mechanism. β4 mutants bearing mutations specific for Sdc1 and Sdc4 recognition act as dominant negative mutants to block cell spreading or cell migration that depends on HER2 or EGFR, respectively. The interaction of the α6β4 integrin with the syndecans appears critical for it to be utilized as a signaling platform; migration depends on α3β1 integrin binding to laminin 332 (LN332; also known as laminin 5), whereas antibodies that block α6β4 binding are without effect. These findings indicate that specific syndecan family members are likely to have key roles in α6β4 integrin activation by receptor tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2116060378,"The apical dendrites of many neurons contain proximal and distal compartments that receive synaptic inputs from different brain regions. These compartments also contain distinct complements of ion channels that enable the differential processing of their respective synaptic inputs, making them functionally distinct. At present, the molecular mechanisms that specify dendritic compartments are not well understood. Here, we report that the extracellular matrix protein Reelin, acting through its downstream, intracellular Dab1 and Src family tyrosine kinase signaling cascade, is essential for establishing and maintaining the molecular identity of the distal dendritic compartment of cortical pyramidal neurons. We find that Reelin signaling is required for the striking enrichment of HCN1 and GIRK1 channels in the distal tuft dendrites of both hippocampal CA1 and neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons, where the channels actively filter inputs targeted to these dendritic domains."
https://openalex.org/W2036462559,"The metabolic syndrome (MS) is characterized by insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and type-2 diabetes. Consumption of fructose is linked to increased prevalence of MS. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a steroid bile acid with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities and has been shown to improve insulin resistance. The current study aims to investigate the effect of UDCA (150 mg/kg) on MS induced in rats by fructose administration (10%) in drinking water for 12 weeks. The effects of UDCA were compared to fenofibrate (100 mg/kg), an agonist of PPAR-α receptors. Treatment with UDCA or fenofibrate started from the 6th week after fructose administration once daily. Fructose administration resulted in significant increase in body weight, elevations of blood glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), uric acid levels, insulin resistance index and blood pressure compared to control rats. Moreover, fructose increased oxidative stress in aortic tissues indicated by significant increases of malondialdehyde (MDA), expression of iNOS and reduction of reduced glutathione (GSH) content. These disturbances were associated with decreased eNOS expression, increased infiltration of leukocytes and loss of aortic vascular elasticity. Treatment with UDCA successfully ameliorated the deleterious effects of fructose. The protective effect of UDCA could be attributed to its ability to decrease uric acid level, improve insulin resistance and diminish oxidative stress in vascular tissues. These results might support possible clinical application of UDCA in MS patients especially those present with liver diseases, taking into account its tolerability and safety. However, further investigations on human subjects are needed before the clinical application of UDCA for this indication."

Current therapy of TB is lengthy and consists of multiple expensive antibiotics, in a strategy referred to as Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS). Although this therapy is effective, it has serious disadvantages. These therapeutic agents are toxic and are associated with the development of a variety of drug-resistant TB strains. Furthermore, patients treated with DOTS exhibit enhanced post-treatment susceptibility to TB reactivation and reinfection, suggesting therapy-related immune impairment. Here we show that Isoniazid (INH) treatment dramatically reduces Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen-specific immune responses, induces apoptosis in activated CD4+ T cells, and renders treated animals vulnerable to TB reactivation and reinfection.

https://openalex.org/W1965910736,"Background Although the various groups of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) considerably differ regarding socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics, their specificities regarding tobacco smoking have been poorly investigated. We aimed to assess patterns of tobacco consumption across the various groups of PLWHIV and to compare them to the general population, accounting for the specific socioeconomic profile of PLWHIV. Methods We used data of the ANRS-Vespa2 study, a national representative survey on PLWHIV conducted in France in 2011. Prevalence of past and current tobacco consumption, heavy smoking and strong nicotine dependence were assessed among the various groups of PLWHIV as defined by transmission category, gender and geographic origin, and compared to the French general population using direct standardization and multivariate Poisson regression models, accounting for gender, age, education and geographic origin. Results Among the 3,019 participants aged 18–85 years (median time since HIV diagnosis: 12 years), 37.5% were current smokers and 22.1% were past smokers, with marked differences across the various groups of PLWHIV. Compared to the general population, the prevalence of regular smoking was increased among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) (adjusted prevalence rate ratio (aPRR): 1.19, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.07–1.32), French-native women (aPRR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.10–1.57), and heterosexual French-native men (although not significantly, aPRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.98–1.45). Additionally, HIV-infected MSM were significantly less likely to be ex-smokers (aPRR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64–0.82) than the general population and similar trends were observed among heterosexual French-native men (aPRR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.78–1.02) and women (aPRR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.70–1.01). HIV-infected sub-Saharan African migrants were less likely to be regular smokers than the general population. Conclusions Smoking constitutes a major concern in various groups of PLWHIV in France including MSM and heterosexual French-natives, probably resulting from PLWHIV being less likely to quit smoking than their counterparts in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2087074175,"Biofilms have been implicated as an important reservoir for pathogens and commensal enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli in natural and engineered water systems. However, the processes that regulate the survival of E. coli in aquatic biofilms have not been thoroughly studied. We examined the effects of hydrodynamic shear and nutrient concentrations on E. coli colonization of pre-established Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, co-inoculation of E. coli and P. aeruginosa biofilms, and P. aeruginosa colonization of pre-established E. coli biofilms. In nutritionally-limited R2A medium, E. coli dominated biofilms when co-inoculated with P. aeruginosa, and successfully colonized and overgrew pre-established P. aeruginosa biofilms. In more enriched media, P. aeruginosa formed larger clusters, but E. coli still extensively overgrew and colonized the interior of P. aeruginosa clusters. In mono-culture, E. coli formed sparse and discontinuous biofilms. After P. aeruginosa was introduced to these biofilms, E. coli growth increased substantially, resulting in patterns of biofilm colonization similar to those observed under other sequences of organism introduction, i.e., E. coli overgrew P. aeruginosa and colonized the interior of P. aeruginosa clusters. These results demonstrate that E. coli not only persists in aquatic biofilms under depleted nutritional conditions, but interactions with P. aeruginosa can greatly increase E. coli growth in biofilms under these experimental conditions."

For example, color and form are encoded in ventral pathway areas such as V4 and inferior temporal cortex, while motion is preferentially processed in dorsal pathway areas such as the middle temporal area. Such representations often need to be integrated perceptually to solve tasks that depend on multiple features. We tested the hypothesis that the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) integrates disparate task-relevant visual features by recording from LIP neurons in monkeys trained to identify target stimuli composed of conjunctions of color and motion features.

This suggests that LIP plays a role in flexibly integrating task-relevant sensory signals. We often face the challenge of selecting behaviorally relevant stimuli among competing distracters. For example, we might need to choose a red target moving rightward at one moment but a green target moving leftward a moment later. Solving such a task relies on neuronal representations of basic visual features such as color and direction, as well as the ability to keep track of which features are task relevant (Treisman and Gelade, 1980Treisman A.M. Gelade G. A feature-integration theory of attention.Cognit. Psychol. 1980; 12: 97-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (8716) Google Scholar). Decades of work have described neuronal representations of visual features in a network of cortical areas specialized for processing different aspects of the visual scene. For example, motion is processed in dorsal stream areas such as the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas (Born and Bradley, 2005Born R.T. Bradley D.C.

One appealing theory posits that feature-based selective attention allows visual feature representations in visual cortex to be flexibly read out by downstream areas (Treisman and Gelade, 1980Treisman A.M. Gelade G. A feature-integration theory of attention.Cognit. Psychol. 1980; 12: 97-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (8716) Google Scholar). However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms that allow such flexible feature integration remain unknown. While much previous work has focused on the lateral intraparietal area’s (LIP) role in visuospatial functions (e.g., spatial attention, saccadic eye movements) (Bisley and Goldberg, 2003Bisley J.W.

Because LIP participates in both sensory and cognitive functions, it is therefore well positioned to flexibly integrate diverse visual and cognitive inputs. This is further supported by recent work showing that LIP neurons can independently encode, or multiplex, both sensory-motor and cognitive signals (Meister et al., 2013Meister M.L.R. Hennig J.A. Huk A.C. Signal multiplexing and single-neuron computations in lateral intraparietal area during decision-making.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 2254-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Rishel et al., 2013Rishel C.A. Huang G. Freedman D.J.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that LIP integrates task-relevant visual feature representations. We employed a visual matching task in which monkeys used two visual features (color and motion direction) to identify target (i.e., match) stimuli. One of two sample stimuli was followed by a succession of test stimuli. Monkeys had to indicate whether the test stimuli matched the sample in both color and direction. Because the identity of the sample stimulus varied across trials, the task-relevant color and direction also varied from trial to trial. This allowed us to determine how color and direction selectivity in LIP varied according to which features were task relevant. Neuronal recordings revealed substantial color and direction selectivity in LIP. Interestingly, many LIP neurons showed task-dependent shifts in their direction and/or color tuning, with most of these neurons showing shifts toward the direction and/or color that was task relevant. This shows that visual feature representations in LIP are flexible on short timescales and that LIP integrates multiple task-relevant visual features. Furthermore, our observations are consistent with a model in which LIP linearly integrates attention-related response-gain modulations of feature representations from upstream visual areas. Two monkeys performed a delayed conjunction matching (DCM) task in which a sample stimulus was followed by one to three test stimuli (Figure 1A). The stimuli were circular patches (3° radius) of random dot motion patterns that varied across eight directions and eight hues (Figure 1B). To receive a fluid reward, monkeys were required to release a manual touch bar in response to a test stimulus that matched both the sample’s direction and color. On 25% of trials, none of the test stimuli matched the sample, and monkeys were rewarded for withholding their response. On each trial, one of two sample stimuli (“A” or “B”) instructed the monkeys about which feature values were relevant. Sample A was always yellow dots moving downward, while sample B was always red dots moving upward. Each test stimulus could be any conjunction of the eight hues and eight directions (64 unique test stimuli). For each of the three test periods, test stimuli were pseudorandomly picked between five types of stimuli: (1) the stimulus matching the sample, (2) one of the seven nonmatch stimuli whose color matched the sample color, (3) one of the seven nonmatch stimuli whose direction matched the sample direction, (4) the sample stimulus that was not presented on this trial (e.g., sample B during sample A trials), or (5) one of the 48 remaining nonmatch stimuli (both color and direction nonmatch). Both monkeys performed the DCM task accurately (percent correct: monkey M: ∼86%, monkey N: ∼90%), consistent with the monkeys using both features to guide their responses (Figure 1C). An examination of false-alarm errors (i.e., responding to a nonmatch test stimulus) reveals elevated error rates for test stimuli which matched the sample color (Figure 1D), and for which the direction was visually similar to the sample. A central aim of this study is to examine whether feature tuning in LIP varies according to the features that are task relevant. The DCM task allows this by independently assessing each neuron’s test period direction and color tuning on sample A and B trials. Importantly, throughout this manuscript (except for Figure S2 available online), we analyzed only nonmatching test stimuli. This ensures that neuronal activity related to the monkeys’ manual responses does not contribute to the observed effects. We recorded from 127 LIP neurons (monkey M: n = 65; monkey N: n = 62) during DCM task performance. A substantial fraction of LIP neurons were selective for the direction and/or color of test stimuli (three-way ANOVA, with test direction, test color, and sample identity as factors; p < 0.05). During the test period, 99/127 (77%) of LIP neurons were direction selective and 55/127 (43%) were color selective (main effect of either factor and/or interaction between direction/color and sample identity); 12/99 direction-selective neurons showed an interaction between direction and sample identity, while a color sample interaction was observed in 39/55 color-selective neurons. This suggests that neuronal selectivity for test stimuli varied according to the directions and colors that were relevant for solving each trial. A substantial fraction of feature-selective LIP neurons were selective for both direction and color (n = 46, 83% of color-selective neurons and 46% of direction-selective neurons). Example neurons showing sample-dependent modulations of direction and color selectivity during the DCM task are shown in Figure 2. For each neuron, the left panel shows average activity across the sample, delay, and first test period for sample A and B trials. The neurons in Figures 2B and 2C responded preferentially to samples A and B, respectively. The right panel depicts test period responses to each motion direction (Figures 2A and 2B) or each color (Figures 2C and 2D) for sample A (blue) and B (red) trials. Both neurons in Figures 2A and 2B showed shifts in their preferred directions toward the direction of the relevant sample. The example neurons in Figures 2C and 2D showed test period color selectivity, which was strongly influenced by sample identity, with both neurons exhibiting greater activity to test stimuli of similar color as the sample. These examples suggest that visual feature selectivity in LIP can show trial-by-trial modulations in tuning depending on the task relevance of visual features. For population analysis, neuronal direction and color selectivity were characterized separately on sample A and B trials. Each neuron’s preferred direction was determined by computing two vectors—the sum of the average response to each direction weighted by the cosine and sine of their respective angle. Across the population of direction-selective neurons (n = 99), the mean preferred direction was significantly shifted toward the relevant sample direction by 21.6° (William-Watson test, p = 0.001). We examined whether this population-level shift in direction tuning could be due to the impact of a few neurons showing large tuning shifts. A bootstrap analysis (Figure S1, p < 0.05) revealed that 18% (18/99) of LIP neurons showed significant differences in their preferred direction between sample A and B trials. Not surprisingly, this neuronal population showed a large (117.9°) and significant (p = 0.005) shift toward the relevant sample. After removing these 18 neurons from the neuronal pool, we still observed a significant shift toward the relevant direction (n = 81, shift amplitude = 5.6°, Watson-Williams test, p = 0.002). Although the above analysis used a fixed time epoch, we observed variability in the time course of shift effects during the test period across the population (mean latency = 176.1 ms, SD = 101 ms). Thus, we calculated direction tuning shifts using a sliding window approach and found 31/127 neurons whose preferred direction was significantly (p < 0.05) shifted (20/31 toward, 11/31 away; Figure 3A, average shift amplitude = 37.0° toward the sample, Watson-Williams test, p = 8 × 10−4). Among the 18 neurons that showed significant shifts using the fixed window, they all showed the same shift direction using the sliding window. Since qualitatively similar results were obtained using fixed or sliding windows, we will examine the population defined by the sliding window approach (since it yielded a larger population). For each neuron, we computed the difference between the response to each direction during sample A and B trials. As shown by the average population differential response of shifted toward neurons (n = 20; Figure 3D), the representation of the direction of the relevant sample is emphasized. We characterized the color tuning of each LIP neuron by fitting a linear regression to the neuronal responses to each of the eight test stimulus colors. Yellow and red were the end points of the neuronal tuning function, so a neuron tuned to yellow had a negative slope, while a neuron tuned to red had a positive slope. A bootstrap analysis, similar to the one used to characterize the shift in direction tuning, revealed that 44% (56/127) of LIP neurons showed significant (p < 0.05) differences in their tuning slope between sample A and sample B trials (49/56 shifted toward, 7/56 shifted away). Using the sliding window permutation test (mean latency = 165.5 ms, SD = 66.1 ms), we found that 70/127 LIP neurons’ color tuning was significantly shifted (61 shifted toward, 9 shifted away). Among color selective neurons (according to the three-way ANOVA described above), 13/55 were not significantly shifted. The average activity of this population (n = 83 neurons that were color selective or showed significant shifts of color tuning) during the test period is shown in Figures 4A and 4B . This reveals that population-level color preferences reversed depending on the task relevance of each color. Neuronal color tuning was examined by applying a linear regression to each neuron’s (n = 83) average responses to the eight colors, which revealed a mean slope of −0.56 on A trials (indicating a preference for yellow) and 0.58 on B trials (red preference) (paired t test, p = ∼10−13). While LIP showed significant task-dependent shifts of direction and/or color selectivity, we tested whether tuning shift effects were evident in the same pool of neurons. Among 31 neurons that showed significant direction tuning shifts, 25/31 also showed significant color tuning shifts. We examined the relationship between each neuron’s direction-shift and color-shift effects (Figure 5) and found that neurons with larger direction shifts also showed larger color shifts (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.47, p = 0.016). This raises a question about whether feature encoding in LIP is used to detect and respond to match stimuli. To examine this, we compared neuronal responses to stimulus A and stimulus B when they were shown as match and nonmatch test stimuli. We focused on neurons that were both color and direction selective using the three-way ANOVA or showed significant color and direction tuning shifts (n = 71) during the DCM task (using different populations led to similar results). Responses to match stimuli (Figure S2A) were higher than for nonmatch stimuli for both sample A (paired t test, p = 4 × 10−5) and B (p = 0.001) trials. Moreover, the average population response was greater for match compared to nonmatch stimuli during both sample A and B trials (Figure S2B). This shows that, in addition to flexible visual feature selectivity, LIP also reflects the match/nonmatch status of test stimuli. Our results suggest that tuning shifts in LIP stem from modulations of selective attention. However, we considered whether they could instead reflect other cognitive or behavioral processes such as arousal or motor planning, which could covary with the similarity between sample and test stimuli. For example, arousal could increase in proportion to sample test similarity, which could in turn modulate LIP activity. This could yield an apparent tuning shift (i.e., greater firing to test features similar to the sample), and a correlated amplitude of color and direction shifts. We examined test-period activity among significantly shifted (for both color and motion) neurons (n = 25) as a function of sample-test similarity (or “spectral distance”; Figure S3A). We examined activity separately on sample A and B trials for neurons that preferred the direction of samples A and B, respectively. Spectral distance = 1 are the most similar nonmatching test stimuli to the sample in all four plots. A global sample-test similarity effect would result in stronger activity for smaller spectral distances in each plot. Instead, such similarity effects were only evident when the relevant sample was the same as the neurons’ preferred sample (sample A trials, sample A preferring neurons: correlation coefficient = −0.099, p = 0.0023; sample B trials, sample B preferring neurons: correlation coefficient = −0.231, p = 4 × 10−8) but not when they differed (sample A trials, sample B preferring neurons: correlation coefficient = −0.048, p = 0.25; sample B trials, sample A preferring neurons: correlation coefficient = −0.009, p = 0.76), consistent with a tuning shift rather than a global similarity effect. Moreover, the response of these neurons to the 64 test stimuli did not increase with the probability of false alarm responses (Figure S3B). This suggests that neuronal activity does not track sample test similarity and that tuning shifts are not due to factors such as arousal or motor planning. For a subpopulation of LIP neurons (n = 83/127), we assessed direction and color selectivity during passive viewing (PV) in addition to the DCM task. This revealed that a pool of LIP neurons (n = 40/83; one-way ANOVA across 8 directions, p < 0.05) was direction selective during PV, while a comparatively small population was color selective (n = 17/83; one-way ANOVA across 8 colors, p < 0.05). We examined whether feature selectivity during PV was related to selectivity during the DCM task. Among direction-selective neurons during PV, most were also direction selective during the DCM task (n = 36/40; three-way ANOVA for DCM task, one-way ANOVA for PV, p < 0.05). In contrast, many LIP neurons were color selective during the DCM task (n = 53) but not PV (n = 17 during PV; 9/17 also during DCM; three-way ANOVA for DCM task and one-way ANOVA for PV, p < 0.05). A large fraction of LIP neurons (104/127) responded preferentially to one of the sample stimuli (t test, p < 0.01) during the DCM task. The time course of LIP sample selectivity is shown for each LIP neuron in Figure 6 (median latency: sample A selective neurons: 129 ms absolute deviation to the median 83 ms; sample B selective neurons: 200 ms absolute deviation to the median: 155 ms). We asked whether neurons showed similar directional preferences in the DCM and PV tasks. We focused on the neurons (n = 36/83) that were direction selective during PV and responded differentially to the two samples during the sample period of the DCM task. Neurons that preferred sample A during the DCM task had a mean preferred direction of 260° during PV (direction of sample A = 270°). Likewise, neurons that preferred sample B had a mean preference of 136° during PV (direction of sample B = 90°) (Figure 6B). This reveals a relationship between DCM sample selectivity and selectivity during PV. In contrast, we did not detect an obvious relationship between the relatively weak color selectivity during PV and DCM sample selectivity. Among 17 color-selective neurons during PV, 14/17 were sample selective during the DCM task (8 preferred sample A, 6 preferred sample B). The slope of the linear regression for test-period color tuning was negative for 2/8 sample A selective neurons and positive for 6/6 of sample B selective neurons. The small size of this pool precludes strong conclusions about the relationship between passive and DCM-task color selectivity. These results indicate that many LIP neurons show “native” direction tuning outside the DCM task, while a distinct pool of neurons show direction selectivity that is more task dependent. To determine whether these two groups of neurons exhibit the same degree of sample-dependent tuning shifts, we compared the magnitude of tuning shifts between the two populations. Interestingly, LIP neurons that were not direction selective during PV showed larger tuning shifts (61.9°) compared to passively direction-tuned neurons (40.3°, t test, p = 0.029). This suggests that natively untuned neurons show more flexible tuning during the DCM task. We propose a model that suggests that tuning shifts in LIP could arise via linear integration of attention-related gain changes that occur in upstream visual areas, as described in MT and V4 (Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004Martinez-Trujillo J.C.

Martínez Trujillo J.C. Feature-based attention influences motion processing gain in macaque visual cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The model consists of two interconnected neuronal layers, a first layer (L1) sending feedforward connections to a second layer (L2). In this example, L1 and L2 correspond to areas MT and LIP, respectively, as we will focus on the shifts of direction tuning in LIP. But the same model applies similarly to color with L1 neurons corresponding to V4 color selective neurons. L2 neurons integrate multiple inputs from a population of direction-tuned L1 neurons (Figure 7A). The distribution of connection weights between layers determines the direction selectivity of L2 neurons: the sharper the distribution of synaptic weights, the sharper the direction tuning of the LIP neuron. Likewise, an L2 neuron that receives uniform input from L1 neurons would respond uniformly to all directions. Previous work in MT and V4 found that feature-selective neurons show changes in response consistent with a gain modulation due to feature-based attention (Bichot et al., 2005Bichot N.P. Rossi A.F.

Thus, we applied gain modulations to L1 neurons and considered the impact on tuning in L2 (Figure 7). When monkeys are looking for a specific direction, there will be an increase in response gain for L1 neurons tuned to nearby directions. Increases in gain are expected to be strongest for neurons tuned to directions closest to the relevant direction and progressively weaker (or even gain decreases) for larger mismatches in tuning (Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004Martinez-Trujillo J.C.

We examine how perceiving control over setbacks alters neural processing in ways that increase persistence through adversity. For example, a student might retake a class if initial failure was due to controllable factors (e.g., studying) but give up if failure was uncontrollable (e.g., unfair exam questions). Participants persisted more when they perceived control over setbacks, and when they experienced increased negative affect to setbacks. Consistent with previous observations involving negative outcomes, ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal (VMPFC) activity was decreased in response to setbacks. Critically, these structures represented distinct neural mechanisms for persistence through adversity. Ventral striatum signal change to controllable setbacks correlated with greater persistence, whereas VMPFC signal change to uncontrollable setbacks mediated the relationship between increased negative affect and persistence. Taken together, the findings highlight how people process setbacks and adapt their behavior for future goal pursuit."
https://openalex.org/W2089430246,"Type II DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes that catalyze topological rearrangement of double-stranded DNA using the free energy generated by ATP hydrolysis. Bacterial DNA gyrase is a prototype of this family and is composed of two subunits (GyrA, GyrB) that form a GyrA2GyrB2 heterotetramer. The N-terminal 43-kDa fragment of GyrB (GyrB43) from E. coli comprising the ATPase and the transducer domains has been studied extensively. The dimeric fragment is competent for ATP hydrolysis and its structure in complex with the substrate analog AMPPNP is known. Here, we have determined the remaining conformational states of the enzyme along the ATP hydrolysis reaction path by solving crystal structures of GyrB43 in complex with ADP⋅BeF3, ADP⋅Pi, and ADP. Upon hydrolysis, the enzyme undergoes an obligatory 12° domain rearrangement to accommodate the 1.5 Å increase in distance between the γ- and β-phosphate of the nucleotide within the sealed binding site at the domain interface. Conserved residues from the QTK loop of the transducer domain (also part of the domain interface) couple the small structural change within the binding site with the rigid body motion. The domain reorientation is reflected in a significant 7 Å increase in the separation of the two transducer domains of the dimer that would embrace one of the DNA segments in full-length gyrase. The observed conformational change is likely to be relevant for the allosteric coordination of ATP hydrolysis with DNA binding, cleavage/re-ligation and/or strand passage."

https://openalex.org/W2061157014,"Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a member of nuclear receptor superfamily and responsible for the detoxification of xenobiotics. Our previously study demonstrated that PXR is expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) and acts as a master regulator of detoxification genes to protect ECs against xenobiotics. Vascular endothelial cells are key sentinel cells to sense the pathogens and xenobiotics. In this study, we examined the potential function of PXR in the regulation of innate immunity in vasculatures. Treatments with PXR agonists or overexpression of a constitutively active PXR in cultured ECs increased gene expression of the key pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLR-2, -4, -9) and NOD-like receptors (NOD-1 and -2 and NLRP3). In particular, PXR agonism triggered the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the ensuing cleavage and maturation of caspase-1 and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Conversely, selective antagonism or gene silencing of PXR abrogated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, we identified NLRP3 as a transcriptional target of PXR by using the promoter-reporter and ChIP assays. In summary, our findings revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of innate immune by PXR, which may act as a master transcription factor controlling the convergence between the detoxification of xenobiotics and the innate immunity against them."

Smoking cigarettes is associated with a decreased incidence of PE. Based on this observation and previous work, we hypothesize that women who smoke have a lower risk of developing PE because of elevated levels of carbon monoxide (CO) in their blood. The objective of this study was to determine if low-dose CO in ambient air could attenuate the late pregnancy hypertension (HTN) and proteinuria in the Adenovirus (Ad) sFlt-1 PE-like mouse model. Continuous low-dose CO treatment (250 ppm) was started on E10.5 and maintained until E17.5. Compared to control and Ad empty vector, AdsFlt-1 mice displayed late- gestation HTN (E14.5-17.5) (P<0.05), proteinuria (P<0.05) and reduced Bowman's space which were all prevented with CO treatment. Use of the Ad (with/without sFlt-1) or CO had no effect (p>0.05) on litter size, fetal resorption numbers and fetal or placental weights. This study shows that treatment with CO can prevent HTN and proteinuria in a mouse model of PE. It provides a possible mechanism for the reduced incidence of PE in smoking women, and supports the possibility of using CO as a future treatment for PE."
https://openalex.org/W2014507205,"In photosynthetic organisms, thioredoxin-dependent redox regulation is a well established mechanism involved in the control of a large number of cellular processes, including the Calvin-Benson cycle. Indeed, 4 of 11 enzymes of this cycle are activated in the light through dithiol/disulfide interchanges controlled by chloroplastic thioredoxin. Recently, several proteomics-based approaches suggested that not only four but all enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle may withstand redox regulation. Here, we characterized the redox features of the Calvin-Benson enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) from the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and we show that C. reinhardtii PGK1 (CrPGK1) activity is inhibited by the formation of a single regulatory disulfide bond with a low midpoint redox potential (-335 mV at pH 7.9). CrPGK1 oxidation was found to affect the turnover number without altering the affinity for substrates, whereas the enzyme activation appeared to be specifically controlled by f-type thioredoxin. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, thiol titration, mass spectrometry analyses, and three-dimensional modeling, the regulatory disulfide bond was shown to involve the not strictly conserved Cys(227) and Cys(361). Based on molecular mechanics calculation, the formation of the disulfide is proposed to impose structural constraints in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme that may lower its catalytic efficiency. It is therefore concluded that CrPGK1 might constitute an additional light-modulated Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme with a low activity in the dark and a TRX-dependent activation in the light. These results are also discussed from an evolutionary point of view."

The nonconserved Glu129 makes a bidentate link to calcium and defines region E, previously identified as specificity hot spot. The molecular surface of Xyn30D-CBM35 shows a unique stretch of negative charge distribution extending from its binding pocket that might indicate some oriented interaction with its target substrate. The binding ability of Xyn30D-CBM35 to different xylans was analyzed by affinity gel electrophoresis. Some binding was observed with rye glucuronoarabinoxylan in presence of calcium chelating EDTA, which would indicate that Xyn30D-CBM35 might establish interaction to other components of xylan, such as arabinose decorations of glucuronoarabinoxylan. A role in depolymerization of highly substituted chemically complex xylans is proposed. The utilization of biomass as a renewable source of biofuels, chemicals, and added value products has increasing economical and environmental relevance (1.Ragauskas A.J. Williams C.K. Davison B.H.

Valorization of biomass: deriving more value from waste.Science. 2012; 337: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Biomass is composed mainly of plant cell walls, which contain a mixture of lignin and polysaccharides interlocked in a complex lignocellulose matrix. Among cell wall polysaccharides, xylan accounts for approximately one-third of the renewable organic carbon on earth (3.Collins T. Gerday C. Feller G. Xylanases, xylanase families and extremophilic xylanases.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 4.de Vries R.P. Visser J. Aspergillus enzymes involved in degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 497-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). It is composed of a backbone of β-1,4-xylose residues, which can be decorated at O2 with 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid and at O2 or O3 with arabinofuranose residues, which can also be esterified to ferulic acid. Additionally, xylan can also be extensively acetylated. The composition of xylan is highly variable depending on the plant source and tissue, and the term glucuronoxylan is frequently used to describe hardwood xylans (highly substituted with 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid residues), whereas (glucurono)arabinoxylan denominates xylans from grasses and cereals (with a large amount of arabinose residues) (4.de Vries R.P. Visser J. Aspergillus enzymes involved in degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 497-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 5.Scheller H.V. Ulvskov P. Hemicelluloses.Annu. Rev. Plant. Biol. 2010; 61: 263-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Biodegradation of xylan requires the coordinated activity of several enzymes, among which xylanases (1,4-β-d-xylan xylanohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.8) catalyze the cleavage of internal linkages on the xylose backbone. They play a central role in xylan depolymerization and are key enzymes for xylan bioconversion to fermentable sugars and oligomers of potential value as chemicals and prebiotics (6.Grootaert C. Van den Abbeele P. Marzorati M. Broekaert W.F. Courtin C.M. Delcour J.A. Verstraete W. Van de Wiele T.

Biorefinery approaches to deconstruct the plant cell wall for the production of bioethanol and biomaterials have shown the relevance of improving cellulose accessibility to cellulases (8.Meng X. Ragauskas A.J. Recent advances in understanding the role of cellulose accessibility in enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2014; 27: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and that removal of hemicelluloses can be more important than lignin removal (9.Leu S.-Y. Zhu J.Y. Substrate-related factors affecting enzymatic saccharification of lignocelluloses: our recent understanding.Bioenerg. Res. 2013; 6: 405-415Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This evidences the important contribution of xylanases to the production of cellulosic ethanol from lignocelluloses with low lignin content, such as corn stove and other agricultural residues (10.Wyman C.E.

Technol. 2011; 102: 11052-11062Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The chemical complexity and heterogeneity of xylan can account for the multiplicity of xylanases produced by microorganisms (3.Collins T. Gerday C. Feller G. Xylanases, xylanase families and extremophilic xylanases.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 11.Pollet A. Delcour J.A. Courtin C.M. Structural determinants of the substrate specificities of xylanases from different glycoside hydrolase families.Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 2010; 30: 176-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). They are grouped into glycoside hydrolase families based on amino acid sequence homologies and structural features within the CAZy database (12.Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M.

Most characterized xylanases belong to families GH10 and GH11. They do not seem to be specialized for hydrolysis of a particular type of xylan, because they are able to degrade hardwood glucuronoxylans and arabinoxylans (11.Pollet A. Delcour J.A. Courtin C.M.

A small group of bacterial xylanases with specificity for glucuronoxylan has been identified and characterized. These enzymes, which require methylglucuronic decorations for activity, belong to subgroup H of the GH30 family and are considered as glucuronoxylanases (14.Gallardo O. Fernández-Fernández M.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8617-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Opposite to substrate specificity shown by GH30 glucuronoxylanases, an arabinoxylan-specific xylanase has been reported (17.Correia M.A. Mazumder K. Brás J.L. Firbank S.J. Zhu Y. Lewis R.J. York W.S. Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. Structure and function of an arabinoxylan-specific xylanase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22510-22520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The enzyme belongs to family GH5 and seems the only reported example of xylanase with specificity for arabinoxylan. The occurrence of a variety of xylanases with differences in the substrate specificity and mode of action undoubtedly reflects the heterogeneity of plant xylan in natural habitats and contributes to its efficient degradation and utilization. Glycoside hydrolases are frequently modular enzymes that contain catalytic modules joined by flexible linker sequences to carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). 4The abbreviations used are: CBMcarbohydrate binding modulea.u.asymmetric unitGlcAglucuronic acidGHglycosylhydrolaseMeGAmethylglucuronic acidMeGXmethylglucuronic acid-substituted xylooligosaccharideNCSnoncrystallographic symmetryRMSroot mean squarePDBProtein Data Bank. They direct the appended catalytic modules to their target substrates and potentiate the activity against the complex substrates of cell wall. Similar to catalytic modules, CBMs are also classified into families based on amino acid sequence homologies (CAZy (18.Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J.

Advances in understanding the molecular basis of plant cell wall polysaccharide recognition by carbohydrate-binding modules.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2013; 23: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Many xylanases are modular enzymes containing one or more CBMs. These noncatalytic modules found in xylanases belong to different families and recognize a diversity of ligands, including xylans, xylose oligomers, and carbohydrates that are not substrates of the xylanases, such as cellulose, in close proximity to xylan in the plant cell wall (18.Boraston A.B.

Analysis of family 35 CBMs suggested that they could direct the enzymes toward regions of the cell wall that are being actively degraded by pathogens (20.Montanier C. van Bueren A.L. Dumon C.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3065-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Additionally, the disruption of the substrate structure by CBMs of different families has been proposed in several reports (21.Guillén D. Sánchez S. Rodríguez-Sanoja R.

In addition to getting the catalytic modules in close proximity to their substrates, CBMs probably have a more complex role in polysaccharides degradation, with additional functions to enable the deconstruction of cell wall and the catalytic depolymerization of carbohydrates. carbohydrate binding module asymmetric unit glucuronic acid glycosylhydrolase methylglucuronic acid methylglucuronic acid-substituted xylooligosaccharide noncrystallographic symmetry root mean square Protein Data Bank.

Like the few examples of characterized glucuronoxylanases of family GH30, the enzyme shows requirement of methylglucuronic substitutions for catalysis and is not active on arabinoxylans (27.Valenzuela S.V.

However, unlike the structurally characterized GH30 glucuronoxylanases from Bacillus subtilis and Erwinia chrysanthemi (28.St John F.J. Hurlbert J.C. Rice J.D. Preston J.F. Pozharski E.

The glucuronoxylanase contains a carbohydrate binding module of the CBM35 family, which is rarely found in xylanases. Only recently a modular GH30 xylanase from Clostridium papirosolvens, containing a CBM6, has been sequenced and its catalytic domain crystallized, although the biochemical characterization of the enzyme has not been reported (PDB code 4FMV). In our study, we have purified and crystallized glucuronoxylanase Xyn30D and analyzed the three-dimensional structure of the full-length enzyme. Its ancillary CBM35 domain has also been expressed and crystallized, and its binding abilities have been investigated by soaking experiments. Additionally, binding of purified CBM35 to soluble xylans has been analyzed by affinity gel electrophoresis. Xyn30D has a unique GH30-CBM35 modular assembly. The results here presented contribute to deciphering the biochemical function of GH30 xylanases and the contribution of CBM35 to the efficiency of xylan depolymerization. Further studies will be required to ascertain the role of glucuronoxylan-specific xylanases and the function of appended CBM in degradation of xylan in natural habitats. Construction of Xyn30D, Xyn30D-GH30, and Xyn30D-CBM35 expression vectors were previously described (27.Valenzuela S.V. Diaz P. Pastor F.I. Modular glucuronoxylan-specific xylanase with a family CBM35 carbohydrate-binding module.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2012; 78: 3923-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The protein samples were purified from Escherichia coli BL21Star (DE3) recombinant cultures containing plasmids pET101Xyn30D, pET101Xyn30D-GH30, and pET28aXyn30D-CBM35, respectively. Exponential phase cultures (A600 of 0.8) were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 h at 303 K. Cells were collected and disrupted by French press. Concentrated extracts were subjected to immobilized metal affinity chromatography using HisTrap HP columns of 1 ml (GE Healthcare), on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (ÄKTA FPLC; GE Healthcare). Washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl was performed before an elution in a single step with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer of pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. The immobilized metal affinity chromatography elution fractions were concentrated with Centricon centrifugal filter units of 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Millipore) and loaded for a second polishing step in a gel filtration column (Tricorn Superdex 200 10/300 GL; GE Healthcare). Single injections of 1,800 µl were made, and the protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl. The purity of the protein was verified by SDS-PAGE (30.Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar).

Complexes of Xyn30D-CBM35 were obtained by the soaking technique using glucuronic acid (GlcA; Sigma, or aldouronic acid mixture purchased from Megazyme (containing aldotriouronic, aldotetraouronic, and aldopentaouronic acids, 2:2:1). The crystals were soaked for 30 min in solutions made of mother liquor plus 30 mm GlcA or a 1/100 dilution of the commercial aldouronic mixture. For data collection, all crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solutions containing mother liquor supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol before being cooled to 100 K in liquid nitrogen. Crystals showing diverse habits belonged to P212121 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and 55% solvent content within the unit cell. Diffraction data for Xyn30D-CBM35 were collected in-house with a MAR345dtb (MarResearch) detector equipped with a rotating anode generator (MicroStar, Bruker) and Helios mirrors.

Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4145) Google Scholar). The structures of glucuronoxylanase XynC from B. subtilis (PDB code 3GTN) and CBM35 from Amycolaptosis orientalis exo-chitosanase (PDB code 2VZQ) were used to prepare the search model using the program Chainsaw (37.Stein N.

A partial solution containing four molecules of the Xyn30D catalytic domain in the asymmetric unit (a.u.) was found using reflections up to 3.0 Å resolution range and a Patterson radius of 40 Å. Fixing these partial model, a solution containing one additional Xyn30D-CBM35 molecule was found using a Patterson radius of 15 Å. Then a complete Xyn30D molecule was generated and used as template with a Patterson radius of 52 Å, finally leading to a solution including all the four Xyn30D molecules, which after rigid body fitting led to an R factor of 49%. Crystallographic refinement was performed using the program REFMAC (38.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr.

However, the refinement was stuck at an R factor of 38% (Rfree = 39), and lowering space group symmetry to P32, with eight independent molecules in the a.u., was necessary to allow further progress to an acceptable agreement (R factors of 25/29%). Furthermore, two NCS groups composed of the catalytic GH30 and the CBM35 moieties, respectively, were defined, and the refinement was accomplished applying medium NCS restraints. After iterative refinement and rebuilding of the linker regions, the final 2Fo − Fc map showed continuous density for the whole protein in chains A, B, and H, whereas some regions of the linker were not visible in chains C (amino acids 399–400), D/G (amino acids 398–400), and E/F (amino acids 397–401). At the later stages, water molecules were included in the model, which, combined with more rounds of restrained refinement, led to a final R factor of 17.9 (Rfree = 20.4) for all data set up to 2.4 Å resolution. Refinement parameters are reported in Table 1. The structure of Xyn30D-CBM35 was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (36.Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A.

https://openalex.org/W1989447948,"Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is typically asymptomatic and surgery usually increases patient's lifespan only for early stage tumours. Moreover, solid renal masses cannot be confidently differentiated from RCC. Therefore, markers to distinguish malignant kidney tumours and for their detection are needed. Two different peptide signatures were obtained by a MALDI-TOF profiling approach based on urine pre-purification by C8 magnetic beads. One cluster of 12 signals could differentiate malignant tumours (n = 137) from benign renal masses and controls (n = 153) with sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 87% in the validation set. A second cluster of 12 signals distinguished clear cell RCC (n = 118) from controls (n = 137) with sensitivity and specificity values of 84% and 91%, respectively. Most of the peptide signals used in the two models were observed at higher abundance in patient urines and could be identified as fragments of proteins involved in tumour pathogenesis and progression. Among them: the Meprin 1α with a pro-angiogenic activity, the Probable G-protein coupled receptor 162, belonging to the GPCRs family and known to be associated with several key functions in cancer, the Osteopontin that strongly correlates to tumour stages and invasiveness, the Phosphorylase b kinase regulatory subunit alpha and the SeCreted and TransMembrane protein 1."

Materials and Methods Patients with bladder cancer who underwent 3,0 Tesla DW-MRI of the bladder before TUR-B or radical cystectomy were eligible for this prospective IRB-approved study. Histological specimen were immunohistochemically stained for the following markers: p53, p21 and ki67. Two board-certified uropathologists reviewed the specimens blinded to DW-MRI results. Histological grade and T-stage were classified according to the WHO 2004 and the 2009 TNM classification, respectively. Nonparametric univariate and multivariate statistics including correlation, logistic regression and ROC analysis were applied. Results Muscle invasive bladder cancer was histologically confirmed in 10 out of 41 patients. All examined tissue biomarkers were significantly correlated with ADC values (p<0.05, respectively). Based on multivariate analysis, p53 and ADC are both independent prognostic factors for muscle invasiveness of bladder cancer (>/ = T2). (p = 0.013 and p = 0.018). Conclusion ADC values are associated with cell cycle and proliferative biomarkers and do thereby reflect invasive and proliferative potential in bladder cancer. ADC and p53 are both independent prognostic factors for muscle invasiveness in bladder cancer."

However, little is known about the steroid receptor-mediated molecular mechanisms of action of MPA in the female genital tract. In this study, we investigated the regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-12, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, by MPA versus P4, in an in vitro cell culture model of the female ectocervical environment. This study shows that P4 and MPA significantly increase the expression of the IL-12p40 and IL-12p35 genes, whereas IL-10 gene expression is suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, these effects were abrogated when reducing the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels with siRNA. Using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), siRNA, and re-ChIP assays, we show that recruitment of the P4- and MPA-bound GR to the IL-12p40 promoter requires CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-β and nuclear factor κB (NFκB), although recruitment to the IL-10 promoter requires signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3. These results suggest that both P4 and MPA may modulate inflammation in the ectocervix via this genomic mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2038211782,"De novo genome assembly is the process of reconstructing a complete genomic sequence from countless small sequencing reads. Due to the complexity of this task, numerous genome assemblers have been developed to cope with different requirements and the different kinds of data provided by sequencers within the fast evolving field of next-generation sequencing technologies. In particular, the recently introduced generation of benchtop sequencers, like Illumina's MiSeq and Ion Torrent's Personal Genome Machine (PGM), popularized the easy, fast, and cheap sequencing of bacterial organisms to a broad range of academic and clinical institutions. With a strong pragmatic focus, here, we give a novel insight into the line of assembly evaluation surveys as we benchmark popular de novo genome assemblers based on bacterial data generated by benchtop sequencers. Therefore, single-library assemblies were generated, assembled, and compared to each other by metrics describing assembly contiguity and accuracy, and also by practice-oriented criteria as for instance computing time. In addition, we extensively analyzed the effect of the depth of coverage on the genome assemblies within reasonable ranges and the k-mer optimization problem of de Bruijn Graph assemblers. Our results show that, although both MiSeq and PGM allow for good genome assemblies, they require different approaches. They not only pair with different assembler types, but also affect assemblies differently regarding the depth of coverage where oversampling can become problematic. Assemblies vary greatly with respect to contiguity and accuracy but also by the requirement on the computing power. Consequently, no assembler can be rated best for all preconditions. Instead, the given kind of data, the demands on assembly quality, and the available computing infrastructure determines which assembler suits best. The data sets, scripts and all additional information needed to replicate our results are freely available at ftp://ftp.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pub/GABenchToB."
https://openalex.org/W2089322220,"Protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzyme consists of two catalytic (C) subunits and a regulatory (R) subunit dimer (R(2)C(2)). The kinase is activated by the binding of cAMPs to the two cyclic nucleotide binding domains (CBDs), A and B, on each R-subunit. Despite extensive study, details of the allosteric mechanisms underlying the cooperativity of holoenzyme activation remain unclear. Several Markov state models of PKA-RIα were developed to test competing theories of activation for the R(2)C(2) complex. We found that CBD-B plays an essential role in R-C interaction and promotes the release of the first C-subunit prior to the binding to CBD-A. This favors a conformational selection mechanism for release of the first C-subunit of PKA. However, the release of the second C-subunit requires all four cAMP sites to be occupied. These analyses elucidate R-C heterodimer interactions in the cooperative activation of PKA and cAMP binding and represent a new mechanistic model of R(2)C(2) PKA-RIα activation."

DAPI (Molecular Probes) was added to stain nuclei. Confocal images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV-1000, Olympus). Immunohistochemical staining of ear tissue or lung tissues was performed using an established avidin-biotin detection method (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Briefly, 4–6-µm-thick sections of the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut, mounted on positively charged glass slides, and dried in an oven at 56 °C for 30 min. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and then rehydrated in graded ethanol and water. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation in 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by pretreatment of the sections with citrate buffer at pH 6.0 for 20 min at 56 °C in a microwave oven and then allowing the sections to cool for 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific endogenous protein binding was blocked using 1% BSA. The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used for single and double staining: anti-c-Kit (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TGaseII (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-tryptase (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) (1:50; Abcam). After washing, biotinylated secondary antibodies were applied at 1:100 or 1:200 dilutions for 1 h. Color was developed with diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories Inc.).

Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was purchased from Pierce. Lipofectamine and PlusTM reagent for transfection were purchased from Invitrogen. The microRNA array kit was purchased from Koma Biotech (Seoul, Korea). Recombinant TGaseII protein was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. R2 peptide (KVLDGQDP) was commercially synthesized by Peptron Co. (Daejon, Korea). miR mimic and miR inhibitor were purchased from Bioneer Co. (Daejon, Korea). Five-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Nara Biotech (Seoul, Korea) and maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kangwon National University (KW-140707-1). For lung metastasis experiments, B16F1 melanoma cells (1 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml of PBS), after induction of passive systemic anaphylaxis, were injected into the tail vein of BALB/c mice. Fourteen days after IgE sensitization, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumor nodules on the surface of the lungs were counted under a dissecting microscope. H&E staining served to validate the identity of the malignant colonies in the lungs of mice that had received tumor cells intravenously. For H&E staining, lung tumor tissue samples were fixed in 10% (v/v) buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 µm, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) were used. The construction of siRNA was carried out according to the instruction manual provided by the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX). For miR-218 knockdown, cells were transfected with 50 nm oligonucleotide (inhibitor) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences used were 5′-ACAUGGUUAGAUCAAGCACA-3′ (miR-218 inhibitor) and 5′-GCAUCUAUCUAUAUAUCUA-3′ (control inhibitor). To generate miR-218 expression vector, a 621-bp genomic fragment encompassing primary miR-218 gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of the pcDNA3.1 vector. To generate miR-181a expression vector, a 467-bp genomic fragment encompassing the primary miR-181a gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into the HindIII/XhoI site of pcDNA3.1 vector. To generate the pGL3-3′UTR-TGaseII construct, a 1396-bp mouse TGaseII gene segment encompassing the 3′-UTR was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the XbaI/XbaI site of the pGL3 luciferase plasmid. The mutant pGL3–3′UTR-TGaseII construct was made with deletion of the miR-218- or mR-181a-responsive element. The luciferase activity assay was performed according to the instruction manual (Promega). RBL2H3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates and were sensitized with DNP-specific IgE (100 ng/ml) for 16 h. After stimulation with DNP-HSA (100 ng/ml) for 1 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v) for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1% BSA in TBST for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody specific to TGaseII (1:200; BD Biosciences) or FcϵRIβ (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h, followed by washing with TBS-T three times. Anti-goat IgG-FITC (for detection of TGaseII) or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 586 (for detection of FcϵRIβ) secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was added to cells and incubated for 1 h. Coverslips were then washed and mounted by applying Mount solution (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Fluorescence images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope and software (Fluoview version 2.0) with a ×60 objective (FV300, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To examine the effect of miR-218 on the co-localization of HDAC3 (histone deacetylase 3) with FcϵRIβ, RBL2H3 cells were transfected with control vector (1 µg) or miR-218 construct (1 µg). The next day, cells were sensitized with DNP-specific IgE (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, followed by stimulation with DNP-HSA (100 ng/ml) for 1 h. Immunofluorescence staining was performed. Total miRNA was isolated using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). miRNA was extended by a poly(A) tailing reaction using the A-Plus poly(A) polymerase tailing kit (Cell Script). cDNA was synthesized from miRNA with poly(A) tail using a poly(T) adaptor primer and qScriptTM reverse transcriptase (Quanta Biogenesis). Expression levels of miR-218 or miR-181a were quantified with the SYBR Green qRT-PCR kit (Ambion) using an miRNA-specific forward primer and a universal poly(T) adaptor reverse primer. The expression of miR-218 or miR-181a was defined based on the threshold (Ct), and relative expression levels were calculated as 2−((Ct of miR-218 or miR-181a) − (Ct of U6)) after normalization with reference to expression of U6 small nuclear RNA. For quantitative PCR, the SYBR PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used in a CFX96 real-time system thermocycler (Bio-Rad). To determine the level of TGaseII mRNA, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was then reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers (Roche Applied Science). The cDNA was amplified with specific primers and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Western blot and immunoprecipitation were performed according to the standard procedures (24.Kim Y. Kim K. Park D. Lee E. Lee H. Lee Y.S. Choe J. Jeoung D.

For analysis of proteins from tissues, frozen samples were ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle over liquid nitrogen. Proteins were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). The antibody immunoprecipitates were reverse cross-linked. PCR was done on the phenol/chloroform-extracted DNA with specific primers. To examine the binding of TGaseII to the miR-218 promoter sequences, specific primers of the miR-218 promoter-1 sequences (5′-TGCAGGAATTCACCATTTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACACCAACCACTAGGCCAG-3′ (antisense)), miR-218 promoter-2 sequences (5′-TGTCTCACACACAGTTCATCCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACTAGAAGAAGGTACATCGGGGA-3′ (antisense)), and miR-218 promoter-3 sequences (5′-ACATGCATTCAGTGAACCTAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCAATGCAACGGCCTAAAA-3′ (antisense)) were used. To examine the binding of TGaseII to the miR-181a promoter sequences, specific primers of the miR-181a promoter-1 sequences (5′-GCCAAAGTGAAACAAGTTGAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAGCAACCTGTGAGCCAGA-3′ (antisense)) and miR-181a promoter-2 sequences (5′-CTGAATGCATACCATCAGCAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACCTATGCATACTAGCTGAGACT-3′ (antisense)) were used. Construction of siRNA was carried out according to the instruction manual provided by the manufacturer (Ambion). To induce the IgE-dependent TpCR in the ear of female BALB/c mice, mice were sensitized by injecting DNP-specific IgE antibody (10 µg/kg) intravenously. Twenty-four hours later, a cutaneous reaction was evoked by painting with 25 µl of 0.15% DNFB acetone/olive oil (3:1) solution onto each surface of both ear lobes. Ear thickness was measured by using a digital gauge. In order to examine the effect of TGaseII on TpCR, scrambled (100 nm) or TGaseII siRNA (100 nm) was injected intravenously on the day of IgE sensitization. BALB/c mice were passively sensitized with an intravenous injection of TNP-specific IgE (0.5 µg/kg) or DNP-specific IgE (0.5 µg/kg). The mice were challenged 24 h later with an intravenous injection of TNP-BSA (250 µg/kg) or DNP-HSA (250 µg/kg) plus 250 µl of PBS containing 2% (v/v) Evans blue solution. Thirty minutes after TNP-BSA challenge, the mice were euthanized, and the 2% (v/v) Evans blue dye was extracted from each dissected ear in 700 µl of acetone/water (7:3) at room temperature overnight. The absorbance of Evans blue in the extracts was measured with a spectrophotometer at 620 nm. To determine the effect of TGaseII on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), BALB/c mice were given an intradermal injection of scrambled (100 nm) or TGaseII siRNA (100 nm) on the next day of the sensitization with DNP-specific IgE or TNP-specific IgE. One hour after the injection of siRNA, BALB/c mice were challenged with TNP-BSA (250 µg/kg) or DNP-HSA (250 µg/kg) plus 250 µl of PBS containing 2% (v/v) Evans blue solution for determining the extent of vascular permeability accompanied by PCA. For the induction of passive systemic anaphylaxis, BALB/c mice were sensitized by an intravenous injection of DNP-specific IgE (0.5 µg/kg). The next day, sensitized mice were challenged by an intravenous injection of DNP-HSA (250 µg/kg). To determine the effect of TGaseII on the metastatic potential of B16F1 melanoma cells, scrambled (100 nm) or TGaseII siRNA(100 nm) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of a BALB/c mouse on the day of antigen challenge. Five days after the injection of IgE, BALB/c mice were given an intravenous injection of B16F1 melanoma cells. To examine t"
https://openalex.org/W2060803465,"The traffic AAA-ATPase PilF is essential for pilus biogenesis and natural transformation of Thermus thermophilus HB27. Recently, we showed that PilF forms hexameric complexes containing six zinc atoms coordinated by conserved tetracysteine motifs. Here we report that zinc binding is essential for complex stability. However, zinc binding is neither required for pilus biogenesis nor natural transformation. A number of the mutants did not exhibit any pili during growth at 64 °C but still were transformable. This leads to the conclusion that type 4 pili and the DNA translocator are distinct systems. At lower growth temperatures (55 °C) the zinc-depleted multiple cysteine mutants were hyperpiliated but defective in pilus-mediated twitching motility. This provides evidence that zinc binding is essential for the role of PilF in pilus dynamics. Moreover, we found that zinc binding is essential for complex stability but dispensable for ATPase activity. In contrast to many polymerization ATPases from mesophilic bacteria, ATP binding is not required for PilF complex formation; however, it significantly increases complex stability. These data suggest that zinc and ATP binding increase complex stability that is important for functionality of PilF under extreme environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2081373880,"Stem cell-based treatment of traumatic brain injury has been limited in its capacity to bring about complete functional recovery, because of the poor survival rate of the implanted stem cells. It is known that biocompatible biomaterials play a critical role in enhancing survival and proliferation of transplanted stem cells via provision of mechanical support. In this study, we noninvasively monitored in vivo behavior of implanted neural stem cells embedded within poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffold, and showed that they survived over prolonged periods in corticectomized rat model. Corticectomized rat models were established by motor-cortex ablation of the rat. F3 cells expressing enhanced firefly luciferase (F3-effLuc) were established through retroviral infection. The F3-effLuc within PLLA was monitored using IVIS-100 imaging system 7 days after corticectomized surgery. F3-effLuc within PLLA robustly adhered, and gradually increased luciferase signals of F3-effLuc within PLLA were detected in a day dependent manner. The implantation of F3-effLuc cells/PLLA complex into corticectomized rats showed longer-lasting luciferase activity than F3-effLuc cells alone. The bioluminescence signals from the PLLA-encapsulated cells were maintained for 14 days, compared with 8 days for the non-encapsulated cells. Immunostaining results revealed expression of the early neuronal marker, Tuj-1, in PLLA-F3-effLuc cells in the motor-cortex-ablated area. We observed noninvasively that the mechanical support by PLLA scaffold increased the survival of implanted neural stem cells in the corticectomized rat. The image-guided approach easily proved that scaffolds could provide supportive effect to implanted cells, increasing their viability in terms of enhancing therapeutic efficacy of stem-cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2152456838,"Background Measles is a highly contagious and potentially fatal illness preventable through vaccination. Outbreaks in the UK and many other European countries have been increasing over recent years, with over 3,207 laboratory-confirmed cases reported by Public Health England from January 2012 to the end of June 2013. To aid rational decision making regarding measles control versus other use of healthcare resources, it is important to measure the severity of measles in units that are comparable to other diseases. The standard metric for this in the UK is the quality-adjust life year (QALY). To our knowledge, the impact of measles on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in terms of QALYs has not been quantified. Methods and Findings Individuals with confirmed measles were sent questionnaires requesting information on the short-term impact of the illness on their HRQoL using the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. HRQoL was reported for the day the questionnaire was received, the worst day of infection and at follow-up three weeks later. 507 questionnaires were sent to individuals with confirmed measles with 203 returned (40%). The majority of respondents were not vaccinated. The mean time off work or school was 9.6 days. The mean duration of perceived illness was 13.8 days. The mean number of QALYs lost was 0.019 (equivalent to 6.9 days). The overall burden of disease in terms of QALYs lost in England based on the total number of confirmed cases in the twelve month period from 1st June 2012 was estimated to be 44.2 QALYs. Conclusion The short-term impact of measles infection on HRQoL is substantial, both at the level of the individual patient and in terms of the overall disease burden. This is the first attempt to quantify QALY-loss due to measles at a population level, and provides important parameters to guide future intervention and control measures."
https://openalex.org/W2092815412,"Brassica vegetables possess high levels of antioxidant metabolites associated with beneficial health effects including vitamins, carotenoids, anthocyanins, soluble sugars and phenolics. Until now, no reports have been documented on the genetic basis of the antioxidant activity (AA) in Brassicas and the content of metabolites with AA like phenolics, anthocyanins and carotenoids. For this reason, this study aimed to: (1) study the relationship among different electron transfer (ET) methods for measuring AA, (2) study the relationship between these methods and phenolic, carotenoid and anthocyanin content, and (3) find QTLs of AA measured with ET assays and for phenolic, carotenoid and anthocyanin contents in leaves and flower buds in a DH population of B. oleracea as an early step in order to identify genes related to these traits. Low correlation coefficients among different methods for measuring AA suggest that it is necessary to employ more than one method at the same time. A total of 19 QTLs were detected for all traits. For AA methods, seven QTLs were found in leaves and six QTLs were found in flower buds. Meanwhile, for the content of metabolites with AA, two QTLs were found in leaves and four QTLs were found in flower buds. AA of the mapping population is related to phenolic compounds but also to carotenoid content. Three genomic regions determined variation for more than one ET method measuring AA. After the syntenic analysis with A. thaliana, several candidate genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are proposed for the QTLs found."
https://openalex.org/W2040844763,"Inherited retinal degenerations, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), represent leading causes of incurable blindness in humans. This is also true in dogs, where the term progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is used to describe inherited photoreceptor degeneration resulting in progressive vision loss. Because of the similarities in ocular anatomy, including the presence of a cone photoreceptor-rich central retinal region, and the close genotype-phenotype correlation, canine models contribute significantly to the understanding of retinal disease mechanisms and the development of new therapies. The screening of the pure-bred dog population for new forms of PRA represents an important strategy to establish new large animal models. By examining 324 dogs of the Swedish vallhund breed in seven countries and across three continents, we were able to describe a new and unique form of PRA characterized by the multifocal appearance of red and brown discoloration of the tapetal fundus followed over time by thinning of the retina. We propose three stages of the disease based on the appearance of the ocular fundus and associated visual deficits. Electroretinography revealed a gradual loss of both rod and cone photoreceptor-mediated function in Stages 2 and 3 of the disease. In the few dogs that suffered from pronounced vision loss, night-blindness occurred first in late Stage 2, followed by decreased day-vision in Stage 3. Histologic examinations confirmed the loss of photoreceptor cells at Stage 3, which was associated with the accumulation of autofluorescent material in the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium. Pedigree analysis was suggestive of an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance. Mutations in six known canine retinal degeneration genes as well as hypovitaminosis E were excluded as causes of the disease. The observed variability in the age of disease onset and rate of progression suggest the presence of genetic and/or environmental disease modifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2055806884,"Antithrombin III (ATIII) is a key antiproteinase involved in blood coagulation. Previous investigations have shown that ATIII is degraded by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, leading to release of heparin binding fragments derived from its D helix. As heparin binding and antimicrobial activity of peptides frequently overlap, we here set out to explore possible antibacterial effects of intact and degraded ATIII. In contrast to intact ATIII, the results showed that extensive degradation of the molecule yielded fragments with antimicrobial activity. Correspondingly, the heparin-binding, helix D-derived, peptide FFFAKLNCRLYRKANKSSKLV (FFF21) of human ATIII, was found to be antimicrobial against particularly the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy studies demonstrated that FFF21 binds to and permeabilizes bacterial membranes. Analogously, FFF21 was found to induce membrane leakage of model anionic liposomes. In vivo, FFF21 significantly reduced P. aeruginosa infection in mice. Additionally, FFF21 displayed anti-endotoxic effects in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest novel roles for ATIII-derived peptide fragments in host defense."

https://openalex.org/W2049778031,"Increased concentrations of extracellular solutes affect cell function and fate by stimulating cellular responses, such as evoking MAPK cascades, altering cell cycle progression, and causing apoptosis. Our study results here demonstrate that hyperosmotic stress induced H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) by an unrevealed kinase cascade involving polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. We found that hyperosmotic stress induced DNA-double strand breaks and increased γH2AX in HCE cells. Phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139 was catalyzed by hyperosmotic stress-induced activation of Plk3. Plk3 directly interacted with H2AX and was colocalized with γH2AX in the nuclei of hyperosmotic stress-induced cells. Suppression of Plk3 activity by overexpression of a kinase-silencing mutant or by knocking down Plk3 mRNA effectively reduced γH2AX in hyperosmotic stress-induced cells. This was consistent with results that show γH2AX was markedly suppressed in the Plk3(-/-) knock-out mouse corneal epithelial layer in response to hyperosmotic stimulation. The effect of hyperosmotic stress-activated Plk3 and increased γH2AX in cell cycle progression showed an accumulation of G2/M phase, altered population in G1 and S phases, and increased apoptosis. Our results for the first time reveal that hyperosmotic stress-activated Plk3 elicited γH2AX. This Plk3-mediated activation of γH2AX subsequently regulates the cell cycle progression and cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2013332088,"The transcription factor FOXO3 is a well-established tumor suppressor whose activity, stability, and localization are regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation. Previous data by our laboratory demonstrated amplified thromboxane-A2 signaling was associated with poor prognoses in bladder cancer patients and overexpression of the thromboxane-A2 isoform-β receptor (TPβ), but not TPα, induced malignant transformation of immortalized bladder cells in vivo. Here, we describe a mechanism of TP mediated modulation of FOXO3 activity and localization by phosphorylation and deacetylation in a bladder cancer cell model. In vitro gain and loss of function studies performed in non-transformed cell lines, UROsta and SV-HUC, revealed knockdown of FOXO3 expression by shRNA increased cell migration and invasion, while exogenously overexpressing TPβ raised basal phosphorylated (p)FOXO3-S294 levels. Conversely, overexpression of ERK-resistant, mutant FOXO3 reduced increases in UMUC3 cell migration and invasion, including that mediated by TP agonist (U46619). Additionally, stimulation of UMUC3 cells with U46619 increased pFOXO3-S294 expression, which could be attenuated by treatment with a TP antagonist (PTXA2) or ERK inhibitor (U0126). Initially U46619 caused nuclear accumulation of pFOXO3-S294; however, prolonged stimulation increased FOXO3 cytoplasmic localization. U46619 stimulation decreased overall FOXO3 transcriptional activity, but was associated with increased expression of its pro-survival target, manganese superoxide dismutase. The data also shows that TP stimulation increased the expression of the histone deacetylase, SIRT1, and corresponded with decreased acetylated-FOXO3. Collectively, the data suggest a role for TP signaling in the regulation of FOXO3 activity, mediated in part through phosphorylation and deacetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2049287888,"Calcium-dependent activation of human TRESK (TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel, K2P18.1) depends on direct targeting of calcineurin to the PQIIIS motif. In the present study we demonstrate that TRESK also contains another functionally relevant docking site for the phosphatase, the LQLP amino acid sequence. Combined mutations of the PQIIIS and LQLP motifs were required to eliminate the calcium-dependent regulation of the channel. In contrast to the alanine substitutions of PQIIIS, the mutation of LQLP to AQAP alone did not significantly change the amplitude of TRESK activation evoked by the substantial elevation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration. However, the AQAP mutation slowed down the response to high calcium. In addition, modest elevation of [Ca2+], which effectively regulated the wild type channel, failed to activate TRESK-AQAP. This indicates that the AQAP mutation diminished the sensitivity of TRESK to calcium. Even if PQIIIS was replaced by the PVIVIT sequence of high calcineurin binding affinity, the effect of the AQAP mutation was clearly detected in this TRESK-PVIVIT context. Substitution of the LQLP region with the corresponding fragment of NFAT transcription factor, perfectly matching the previously described LXVP calcineurin-binding consensus sequence, increased the calcium-sensitivity of TRESK-PVIVIT. Thus the enhancement of the affinity of TRESK for calcineurin by the incorporation of PVIVIT could not compensate for or prevent the effects of LQLP sequence modifications, suggesting that the two calcineurin-binding regions play distinct roles in the regulation.

Microtubule-affinity regulating (MARK) kinases are currently the only known enzymes that phosphorylate the other two serines of functional importance. Accordingly, the overexpression of MARK accelerates the return of the K+ current to the resting state after the calcium-dependent activation of TRESK in Xenopus oocytes (8.Braun G. Nemcsics B.

TRESK background K+ channel is inhibited by PAR-1/MARK microtubule affinity-regulating kinases in Xenopus oocytes.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e28119Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to the enzymatic interaction, calcineurin is directly anchored to a PXIXIT-like site in TRESK (where X may be any amino acid) (12.Czirják G. Enyedi P.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This mechanism for the targeting of the phosphatase is unparalleled within the ion channel superfamily. The PXIXIT consensus motif was originally described in Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT), and later its functional significance was also reported in several other calcineurin-binding proteins (13.Roy J. Cyert M.S. Cracking the phosphatase code: docking interactions determine substrate specificity.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: re9Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14.Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Interaction of calcineurin with substrates and targeting proteins.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 91-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The affinities of the PQIIIS and PQIVID sequences of human and mouse TRESK channels for calcineurin (KD of 5 or 10 µm, respectively) proved to be higher than that of NFAT (KD = 25 µm for PRIEIT of NFAT1, also called NFATc2) (14.Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Interaction of calcineurin with substrates and targeting proteins.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 91-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, they did not reach the value characteristic for the optimized PXIXIT sequence, the VIVIT peptide (KD = 0.5 µm) (14.Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G.

Affinity-driven peptide selection of an NFAT inhibitor more selective than cyclosporin A.Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The VIVIT peptide binds to a surface of calcineurin A subunit, distinct from the catalytic site, as apparent in the crystal structure of the complex (PDB entry 2P6B, (16.Li H. Zhang L. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Hogan P.G. Structure of calcineurin in complex with PVIVIT peptide: portrait of a low-affinity signalling interaction.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). In good accordance with this arrangement, the PQIIIS motif (Pro at position 200) is located sufficiently far from the substrate serines in the cytoplasmic loop of TRESK. Thus the catalytic site of docked calcineurin may reach and dephosphorylate the substrate residues. Mutation of PQIVID to PQAVAD in mouse TRESK completely prevented the calcium-dependent activation of the K+ current, indicating that the docking of calcineurin to the channel is a prerequisite of the regulation (12.Czirják G. Enyedi P. Targeting of calcineurin to an NFAT-like docking site is required for the calcium-dependent activation of the background K+ channel, TRESK.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, human TRESK behaved differently from its rodent counterpart. The PQAAAS mutant, in which all three isoleucines of the PQIIIS motif were replaced by alanines, was still stimulated by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Because the PQIIIS site was certainly destroyed by the triple A mutation, we hypothesized that there may be another calcineurin-targeting sequence in human TRESK. In addition to PXIXIT, a second calcineurin-binding motif was also identified in NFAT transcription factors (17.Liu J. Masuda E.S. Tsuruta L. Arai N. Arai K.

This motif is described by the LXVP consensus sequence, and its instances have also been found in other proteins (13.Roy J. Cyert M.S.

This region is different from the surface binding to PXIXIT and also from the catalytic site. Thus calcineurin can simultaneously associate to the PXIXIT and LXVP motifs in the same interacting protein (20.Grigoriu S. Bond R. Cossio P. Chen J.A. Ly N. Hummer G. Page R. Cyert M.S. Peti W.

In contrast to PXIXIT, the binding cleft for LXVP is accessible only in the active conformation of the phosphatase (13.Roy J. Cyert M.S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 6227-6235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). TRESK does not contain a perfect match to the LXVP consensus sequence. Considering that the first leucine and the fourth proline may be the cornerstones of the motif, we decided to investigate whether the LQLP sequence (Pro at position 243) constitutes a calcineurin-docking site in human TRESK. Although no other protein has been known to contain leucine instead of valine in the third position of the motif, we demonstrate that LQLP interacts with calcineurin and critically determines the calcium sensitivity of the channel. The cloning of human and mouse TRESK cDNAs and their subcloning into the plasmid suitable for in vitro cRNA synthesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes was previously described (6.Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. The two-pore domain K+ channel, TRESK, is activated by the cytoplasmic calcium signal through calcineurin.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Different mutant versions of these constructs were produced with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain GST-hTRESK(174–280) fusion protein, the coding sequence of fragment 174–280 of human TRESK was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites. For the construction of fragment 232–280, this plasmid was cleaved with BamHI and BglII and the compatible ends were ligated. Both the 174–280 and the 232–280 fragments contained the additional AAVERPHRD amino acids at their C terminus in addition to TRESK coding sequence. Production of GST-mTRESK(164–292) was previously described (12.Czirják G. Enyedi P. Targeting of calcineurin to an NFAT-like docking site is required for the calcium-dependent activation of the background K+ channel, TRESK.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ionomycin (calcium salt, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) was dissolved in DMSO as 5 mm stock solution, and diluted further before the measurement. Carbachol (100 mm) and VIVIT peptide (3.85 mm, NFAT inhibitor, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) were dissolved in water. Chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma, Fluka, or Merck. Enzymes and kits of molecular biology applications were purchased from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA), Ambion (Austin, TX), Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and Stratagene. Mouse brain tissue derived from NMRI mouse strain (Toxicop, Hungary). Xenopus oocytes were prepared, the cRNA was synthesized and microinjected as previously described (6.Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. The two-pore domain K+ channel, TRESK, is activated by the cytoplasmic calcium signal through calcineurin.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected 1 day after defolliculation. Fifty nanoliters of the appropriate RNA solution was delivered with Nanoliter Injector (World Precision Instruments, Saratosa, Florida). All treatments of the animals were conducted in accordance with state laws and institutional regulations. The experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Semmelweis University (XIV-I-001/2154-4/2012). Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed three or 4 days after the microinjection of cRNA, as described previously (6.Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. The two-pore domain K+ channel, TRESK, is activated by the cytoplasmic calcium signal through calcineurin.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Low [K+] solution contained (in mm): NaCl 95.4, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5 (pH 7.5 adjusted with NaOH). High [K+] solution contained 80 mm K+ (78 mm Na+ of the low [K+] solution was replaced with K+). TRESK background K+ current was measured at the ends of 250 or 300 ms voltage steps to −100 mV applied in every 4 s. Because TRESK activation varied substantially between the different oocyte preparations (e.g. 3.8- or 11-fold activation for wild type TRESK in response to 500 nm ionomycin), groups of oocytes were compared only from the same preparation in all graphs and calculations. Cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem from two mice were homogenized for each experiment in 3 ml of ice cold solution A containing (in mm): KH2PO4 50, NaCl 50, MgCl2 2, β-mercaptoethanol 5, PMSF 1, benzamidine 1 (pH 7.0 with NaOH), supplemented with 5% glycerol. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was supplemented with CHAPS (to a final concentration of 1%), and with EGTA (to a final concentration of 2 mm) or CaCl2 (1 mm), and centrifuged at 12,100 × g for 10 min. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of human TRESK fragments 174–280 and 232–280, immobilized on 20 µl of glutathione-agarose (Sigma), were incubated with the cytosol preparation by gently rotating the beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The resins were first washed with 1.3 ml of solution A. The second washing step was a high salt wash for 5 min with solution A containing 1 m NaCl. The final (third and fourth) washing steps were also performed with solution A to remove residual salt. The washing buffers for the first three washing steps were also supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 for the assays also containing Ca2+ in the binding reactions. The proteins were eluted from the resins with SDS sample buffer and separated on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Denatured samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). Nonspecific binding sites of the membranes were blocked by 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20). The primary antibodies in the different experiments were monoclonal anti-HA (HA.11, Covance, Princeton, NJ) 3000× in PBS-T containing 0.5% nonfat milk, rabbit polyclonal anti-calcineurin A (PP2B-A, H-209, sc-9070, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) 500× in PBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), or monoclonal anti-β-tubulin isotype III IgG (Sigma T5076) diluted 5000× in PBS-T containing 1% BSA. The secondary antibodies were anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies, respectively, (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG from goat, R05071 or R05072, Advansta, Menlo Park, CA) diluted 5000× or 10,000× in PBS-T containing 0.5% nonfat milk. The membranes were washed once after blocking and four to six times after the antibodies for 5–20 min in PBS-T. The bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (WesternBright ECL HRP, Advansta) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometry analysis was performed with ImageJ 1.47v software written by Wayne Rasband (Research Services Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD). GST-hTRESK(174–280), GST-hTRESK(174–280)-AQAP, GST-mTRESK(164–292) and GST-mTRESK(164–292)-AQAP fusion proteins immobilized on 10 µl of glutathione-agarose were phosphorylated with Trx-His6-MARK2-T208E for 1 h at 30 °C in 50 µl volume of solution B containing (in mm): Tris-HCl 50 (pH 7.5), MgCl2 5, EGTA 2, β-mercaptoethanol 1.4, PMSF 0.5, benzamidine 0.5, supplemented with 20 µm Na2ATP and 100 kBq [32P-γ]ATP. Preparation of the thioredoxin-hexahistidine-tagged constitutively active MARK2 kinase, containing the T208E phospho-mimicking activator loop mutation, has previously been described (8.Braun G. Nemcsics B. Enyedi P. Czirják G. TRESK background K+ channel is inhibited by PAR-1/MARK microtubule affinity-regulating kinases in Xenopus oocytes.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e28119Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). (MARK2 phosphorylates the functionally relevant calcineurin-substrate residues Ser-274 and Ser-276 in mouse TRESK, which correspond to Ser-262 and Ser-264 in the human channel.) Subsequently, the radioactively labeled proteins were dephosphorylated with mouse brain cytosol for different time periods from 0 to 60 min. The cytosol was prepared as detailed in the “GST Pulldown Assay” section, but one brain was homogenized in 4 ml of solution A. This substantial dilution of the cytoplasm sufficiently slowed down the rate of dephosphorylation, enabling the analysis of its kinetics. Cytosol from one brain was used for 18 dephosphorylation reactions (10 µl resin/reaction). The cytosol was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA in the different reactions. The reactions were stopped by rapidly washing the resin twice with 1 ml solution C containing (in mm): Tris-HCl 20 (pH 7.5), NaCl 50, β-mercaptoethanol 1, followed by elution of the proteins from the resin with sample buffer and separation on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and their radioactivity was detected with phosphorimager (GS-525, Bio-Rad). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was estimated by Student's t test for independent samples. The statistical difference was considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Functional relevance of the PQIIIS calcineurin docking motif of human TRESK (Fig. 1A) has not yet been investigated. To gradually disintegrate the binding site, we designed three mutants: PQIIIA, PQIIAS, and PQAAAS. The mutations (in the listed order) progressively deteriorated the activation of the channel evoked by high (0.5 µm) concentration of ionomycin (Fig. 1B). However, in sharp contrast to the previously reported similar PQAVAD modification of mouse TRESK (12.Czirják G. Enyedi P. Targeting of calcineurin to an NFAT-like docking site is required for the calcium-dependent activation of the background K+ channel, TRESK.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the PQAAAS mutation of the human channel failed to eliminate the activation. Human TRESK-PQAAAS was still activated more than 2-fold by the elevation of cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. (The activation of the PQAAAS mutant was significantly smaller than that of the wild type channel, 2.4 ± 0.3-fold versus 11.0 ± 1.4-fold, respectively, n = 10 in both groups, p < 10−4, Fig. 1B). The PQAAAS mutation interfered with the calcineurin-dependent activation process. The apparently reduced activation was not the consequence of enhanced basal channel activity as indicated by the equally low benzocaine-sensitivity of wild type and PQAAAS mutant TRESK (Fig. 1B). (Benzocaine specifically inhibits the activated TRESK current in Xenopus oocytes (12.Czirják G. Enyedi P. Targeting of calcineurin to an NFAT-like docking site is required for the calcium-dependent activation of the background K+ channel, TRESK.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).) Because the PQAAAS mutation alone did not completely prevent the calcium-dependent activation of human TRESK, we searched for another calcineurin-binding site in the channel. We examined the LQLP sequence, which is similar to the LXVP calcineurin-binding consensus motif, and is located in the vicinity of the serines targeted by the phosphatase (Fig. 1A). The two leucines of the LQLP motif were replaced by alanines in TRESK-PQAAAS. This additional AQAP mutation abolished the residual activation. TRESK-PQAAAS-AQAP has not been affected by ionomycin (1.07 ± 0.03-fold change of K+ current), whereas TRESK-PQAAAS was activated 2.27 ± 0.15-fold (n = 12 in both groups, p < 10−7, Fig. 1C). This indicates that the LQLP motif mediates the residual calcineurin-dependent activation, if PQIIIS is disabled. If the LQLP site of TRESK functions analogously to the LxVP calcineurin-docking motif then its replacement with a canonical LXVP sequence should also reproduce calcium-dependent regulation. To test this assumption, we replaced the TLQLPP sequence of TRESK-PQAAAS with YLAVPQ from NFATc1 (NFAT2). We modified a region of six amino acids, since it has been reported that the tyrosine located N-terminally to LxVP also contributes to the binding of calcineurin (19.Park S. Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. A second calcineurin binding site on the NFAT regulatory domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7130-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal second proline may interfere with the association (22.Martínez-Martínez S. Rodríguez A. López-Maderuelo M.D. Ortega-Pérez I. Vázquez J. Redondo J.M. Blockade of NFAT activation by the second calcineurin binding site.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6227-6235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). TRESK-PQAAAS-YLAVPQ was activated identically to TRESK-PQAAAS in response to ionomycin (Fig. 1C), indicating that the canonical LXVP motif from NFAT functionally substituted for the wild type LQLP sequence. The contribution of the LQLP site to the calcium-dependent regulation was also examined by the AQAP mutation in the context of the wild type channel. The amplitude of the activation of human TRESK-AQAP in response to ionomycin (0.5 µm) was not significantly different from that of wild type TRESK (4.8 ± 0.5-fold (n = 21) versus 6.2 ± 0.6-fold (n = 19), respectively, p = 0.08, Fig. 2A). However, the activation was decelerated by the AQAP mutation, as illustrated in Fig. 2B on a shorter time scale. At the time point indicated with an asterisk, the degrees of partial activation during the application of the ionophore were significantly different between the AQAP mutant (3.1 ± 0.3-fold) and the wild type channel (4.9 ± 0.6-fold, p < 0.01, Fig. 2B). The rates of activation in the two groups (calculated as % activation/second) were also statistically different (data not shown). Thus the AQAP mutat"
https://openalex.org/W2056842319,"The Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL is a double-ring chaperone that assists protein folding with the aid of GroES and ATP. Asp-398 in GroEL is known as one of the critical residues on ATP hydrolysis because GroEL(D398A) mutant is deficient in ATP hydrolysis (<2% of the wild type) but not in ATP binding. In the archaeal Group II chaperonin, another aspartate residue, Asp-52 in the corresponding E. coli GroEL, in addition to Asp-398 is also important for ATP hydrolysis. We investigated the role of Asp-52 in GroEL and found that ATPase activity of GroEL(D52A) and GroEL(D52A/D398A) mutants was ∼ 20% and <0.01% of wild-type GroEL, respectively, indicating that Asp-52 in E. coli GroEL is also involved in the ATP hydrolysis. GroEL(D52A/D398A) formed a symmetric football-shaped GroEL-GroES complex in the presence of ATP, again confirming the importance of the symmetric complex during the GroEL ATPase cycle. Notably, the symmetric complex of GroEL(D52A/D398A) was extremely stable, with a half-time of ∼ 150 h (∼ 6 days), providing a good model to characterize the football-shaped complex."

Collected disease awareness advertisements were used to pilot the evaluation tool and to explore the consistency of information provided with the WHO and Dutch criteria.Eighty materials met our inclusion criteria; 71 were published in newspapers and 9 in magazines. The large majority were news items but 21 were disease awareness advertisements, of which 5 were duplicates. Fifteen out of the 16 disease awareness campaigns were non-compliant with current guidelines mainly due to lack of balance (n = 12), absence of listed author and/or sponsor (n = 8), use of misleading or incomplete information (n = 5) and use of promotional information (n = 5). None mentioned a pharmaceutical product directly.Disease Awareness Campaigns are present in Dutch printed media. Although no brand names were mentioned, the lack of compliance of disease awareness campaigns with the current regulations is alarming. There were information deficiencies and evidence of information bias. A key concern is that the context in which the information is provided, mostly through indirect referral, is likely to support treatment with the sponsor's product."
https://openalex.org/W1580729759,"Whooping cough remains a significant disease worldwide and its re-emergence in highly vaccinated populations has been attributed to a combination of imperfect vaccines and evolution of the pathogen. The focus of this study was to examine the role of IL-1α/β and the inflammasome in generation of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) response, which is required for the clearance of Bordetella pertussis. We show that IL-1β but not IL-1α is required for mediating the clearance of B. pertussis from the lungs of mice. We further found that IL-1β and IL-1R deficient mice, compared to wild-type, have similar but more persistent levels of inflammation, characterized by immune cell infiltration, with significantly increased IFNγ and a normal IL-17A response during B. pertussis infection. Contrary to expectations, the cleavage of precursor IL-1β to its mature form did not require caspase-1 during primary infections within the lung despite being required by bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to live bacteria. We also found that the caspase-1 inflammasome was not required for protective immunity against a B. pertussis challenge following vaccination with heat-killed whole cell B. pertussis, despite IL-1R signaling being required. These findings demonstrate that caspase-1-independent host factors are involved in the processing of protective IL-1β responses that are critical for bacterial clearance and vaccine-mediated immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2048906802,"Infants and adults frequently observe actions performed jointly by more than one person. Research in action perception, however, has focused largely on actions performed by an individual person. Here, we explore how 9- and 12-month-old infants and adults perceive a block-stacking action performed by either one agent (individual condition) or two agents (joint condition). We used eye tracking to measure the latency of participants' gaze shifts towards action goals. Adults anticipated goals in both conditions significantly faster than infants, and their gaze latencies did not differ between conditions. By contrast, infants showed faster anticipation of goals in the individual condition than in the joint condition. This difference was more pronounced in 9-month-olds. Further analyses of fixations examined the role of visual attention in action perception. These findings are cautiously interpreted in terms of low-level processing in infants and higher-level processing in adults. More precisely, our results suggest that adults are able to infer the overarching joint goal of two agents, whereas infants are not yet able to do so and might rely primarily on visual cues to infer the respective sub-goals. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the perception of joint action in infants develops differentially from that of individual action."
https://openalex.org/W2050073458,"Background Epidemiologic clinical studies suggested that chronic exposure to chlorine products is associated with development of asthma and aggravation of asthmatic symptoms. However, its underlying mechanism was not clearly understood. Studies were undertaken to define the effects and mechanisms of chronic low-dose chlorine exposure in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Methods Six week-old female BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA in the presence and absence of chronic low dose chlorine exposure of naturally vaporized gas of 5% sodium hypochlorite solution. Airway inflammation and AHR were evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell recovery and non-invasive phlethysmography, respectively. Real-time qPCR, Western blot assay, and ELISA were used to evaluate the mRNA and protein expressions of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Human A549 and murine epithelial (A549 and MLE12) and macrophage (AMJ2-C11) cells were used to define the responses to low dose chlorine exposure in vitro. Results Chronic low dose chlorine exposure significantly augmented airway inflammation and AHR in OVA-sensitized and challenged mice. The expression of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 and proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and IL-33 were significantly increased in OVA/Cl group compared with OVA group. The chlorine exposure also activates the major molecules associated with inflammasome pathway in the macrophages with increased expression of epithelial alarmins IL-33 and TSLP in vitro. Conclusion Chronic low dose exposure of chlorine aggravates allergic Th2 inflammation and AHR potentially through activation of inflammasome danger signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1990013554,"For novel biotechnology-based termite control, we developed a cellulose bait containing freeze-dried genetically engineered yeast which expresses a protozoacidal lytic peptide attached to a protozoa-recognizing ligand. The yeast acts as a ‘Trojan-Horse’ that kills the cellulose-digesting protozoa in the termite gut, which leads to the death of termites, presumably due to inefficient cellulose digestion. The ligand targets the lytic peptide specifically to protozoa, thereby increasing its protozoacidal efficiency while protecting non-target organisms. After ingestion of the bait, the yeast propagates in the termite's gut and is spread throughout the termite colony via social interactions. This novel paratransgenesis-based strategy could be a good supplement for current termite control using fortified biological control agents in addition to chemical insecticides. Moreover, this ligand-lytic peptide system could be used for drug development to selectively target disease-causing protozoa in humans or other vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2079284505,"Novel cell therapy is required to treat critical limb ischemia (CLI) as many current approaches require repeated aspiration of bone marrow cells (BMCs). The use of cultured BMCs can reduce the total number of injections required and were shown to induce therapeutic angiogenesis in a murine model of hind limb ischemia. Blood flow recovery was significantly improved in mice treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent BMCs that secreted inflammatory cytokines. Angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and blood flow recovery ratio were significantly higher in the GM-CSF-cultured F4/80+ macrophage (GM-Mø)-treated group compared with controls. Furthermore, Foxp3+ cell numbers and tissue IL-10 concentrations were significantly increased compared with controls. There was no significant difference in blood flow recovery between GM-Mø and M-CSF-cultured F4/80+ macrophages (M-Mø). Thus, GM-Mø were associated with improved blood flow in hind limb ischemia similar to M-Mø. The selective methods of culturing and treating GM-Mø cells similar to M-Mø cells could be used clinically to help resolve the large number of cells required for BMC treatment of CLI. This study demonstrates a novel cell therapy for CLI that can be used in conjunction with conventional therapy including percutaneous intervention and surgical bypass."
https://openalex.org/W2090366854,"Form C of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scales (MHLC-C) was designed to investigate health-related control beliefs of persons with an existing medical condition. The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of this instrument in a culture characterized by external control beliefs and learned helplessness-contrary to the societal context of original test development. Altogether, 374 Hungarian patients with cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders were enrolled in the study. Besides the MHLC-C, instruments measuring general control beliefs, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and health behaviors were also administered to evaluate the validity of the scale. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic techniques were used to investigate the factor structure of the scale. Our results showed that the Hungarian adaptation of the instrument had a slightly different structure than the one originally hypothesized: in the present sample, a three-factor structure emerged where the items of the Doctors and the Others subscales loaded onto a single common component. Internal reliability of all three subscales was adequate (alphas between .71 and .79). Data concerning the instrument's validity were comparable with previous results from Western countries. These findings may suggest that health locus of control can be construed very similarly to Western countries even in a post-communist society-regardless of the potential differences in general control beliefs."
https://openalex.org/W2022591378,"Background At the triple border Brazil/Paraguay/Argentina there is easy mobility from one city to another for economic and tourism activities. This constant and fast population mobility is mainly to visit Iguazu Falls, in the Iguazu River, on the border of the Brazilian state of Paraná and the Argentina. As the incidence of tuberculosis is high in this setting, our study aimed to establish a first baseline of circulating genotypic lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Methodology/Principal Findings This study included 120 patients from 10 cities in southwestern Paraná, Brazil with pulmonary symptoms, from July 2009 to July 2011. Information about sex, age, clinical features and address was collected by reviewing the national tuberculosis notification database. Of these, 96 (80%) isolates were identified as M. tuberculosis and 22 (22.9%) were drug resistant (20, 20.8% INH mono-resistant and 2, 2.1% multidrug-resistant). All isolates were subjected to genotyping by Spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing. The distribution of the isolates analyzed by spoligotyping revealed 30 distinct patterns. The four mainly detected clades were Latin American and Mediterranean (LAM), ill-defined T, Haarlem (H) and S. The MIRU-VNTR showed 85 distinct patterns. Spoligotyping combined to MIRU-VNTR allowed 90 distinct patterns. Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrated that there is significant molecular diversity in circulating M. tuberculosis, with predominance of the LAM and T clades in cities of southwestern Paraná, Brazil, bordering Argentina and Paraguay."
https://openalex.org/W2130718332,"The P70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (P70S6K1) is activated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) and regulates proliferation, growth, and metabolism. PF-4708671 is a novel, cell-permeable, has been proposed to be a highly specific inhibitor of p70S6K1. It is used in micromolar concentration range to dissect signaling pathways downstream of mTORC1 and to study the function of p70S6K1. Here we show that PF-4708671 induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activation in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) independently of p70S6K1, due to specific inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I."
https://openalex.org/W1992817705,"To investigate migration and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from the ependymal layer to the nucleus ambiguus (NA) after recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) avulsion. All of the animals received a CM-DiI injection in the left lateral ventricle. Forty-five adult rats were subjected to a left RLN avulsion injury, and nine rats were used as controls. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intraperitoneally. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed in the brain stems at different time points after RLN injury. After RLN avulsion, the CM-DiI+ NPCs from the ependymal layer migrated to the lesioned NA. CM-DiI+/GFAP+ astrocytes, CM-DiI+/DCX+ neuroblasts and CM-DiI+/NeuN+ neurons were observed in the migratory stream. However, the ipsilateral NA included only CM-DiI+ astrocytes, not newborn neurons. After RLN avulsion, the NPCs in the ependymal layer of the 4th ventricle or central canal attempt to restore the damaged NA. We first confirm that the migratory stream includes both neurons and glia differentiated from the NPCs. However, only differentiated astrocytes are successfully incorporated into the NA. The presence of both cell types in the migratory process may play a role in repairing RLN injuries."
