https://openalex.org/W1982869830,"I propose a new scenario for the discovery of America. By analogy with other successful animal invasions, one may assume that the discovery of the New World triggered a human population explosion. The invading hunters attained their highest population density along a front that swept from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico in 350 years, and on to the tip of South America in roughly 1000 years. A sharp drop in human population soon followed as major prey animals declined to extinction."

Syllables from tape recordings of both species of sparrow were spliced into an array of swamp sparrow-like and song sparrow-like temporal patterns. Swamp sparrows learned only those songs made of swamp sparrow syllables. They did so irrespective of whether the temporal pattern was swamp sparrow-like or song sparrow-like. Selectivity was retained by birds reared in total isolation from adult conspecific sounds.
https://openalex.org/W2003513471,"Mass spectrometric methods have long been suggested as ways of measuring (14)C/(12)C ratios for carbon dating. One problem has been to distinguish between (14)N and (14)C. With negative ions and a tandem electrostatic accelerator, the (14)N background is virtually absent and fewer than three (14)C atoms in 10(16) atoms of (12)C have been easily measured."
https://openalex.org/W2045026175,"The (14)C atoms naturally present in a piece of 19th-century wood have been detected directly by means of a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator used as a high-energy mass spectrometer. The (14)C ions were easily resolved from interfering ions with the use of a DeltaE-E detector telescope (this telescope consists of a pair of detectors; one of them measures the specific ionization, DeltaE, and the sum of the signals from both detectors gives the total energy for each ion, ET). The technique offers a number of practical advantages."

https://openalex.org/W1997538544,"Three simultaneous observations of atomic chlorine (Cl) and the chlorine monoxide radical (ClO) are reported which encompass the altitude interval between 25 and 45 kilometers. Together, Cl and ClO form a gas-phase catalytic cycle potentially capable of depleting stratospheric ozone. Observed Cl and C1O densities, although variable, imply that chlorine compounds constitute an important part of the stratospheric ozone budget. The results are compared with recent models of stratospheric photochemistry which have been used as a basis for predicting ozone depletion resulting from fluorocarbon release."

Isolated, unfertilized, immature ovules enlarge in the presence of kinetin, and both enlarge and produce fibers in the presence of indoleacetic acid or gibberellic acid or both. An extract of germinating cotton pollen qualitatively mimics the effect of exogenous hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2013747581,Polar wandering during the past 10(8) years may be recorded by unique quasi-circular structures in the polar regions of Mars. Polar wandering on Mars is likely if deep convection is involved in the origin of the very large constructional volcanic features located near the equator. The magnitude of the nonhydrostatic low order components of the gravity field and their correlation with the equatorial volcanic features may be additional evidence of deep convection and associated polar wandering.

https://openalex.org/W2003545791,"An upper limit of 0.05 is established for the geometric albedo of the newly discovered rings of Uranus. In view of this very low albedo, the particles of the rings cannot be ice-covered as are those of rings A and B of Saturn."
https://openalex.org/W1976769002,"Two sets of passive radio observations of Venus—measurements of the spectrum of the disk temperature near the 1-centimeter wavelength, and interferometric measurements of the planetary limb darkening at the 1.35-centimeter water vapor resonance—show no evidence of water vapor in the lower atmosphere of Venus. The upper limit of 2 × 10-3 for the mixing ratio of water vapor is substantially less than the amounts derived from the Venera space probes (0.5 × 10-2 to 2.5 × 10-2). This amount of water vapor cannot produce dense clouds, and it is doubtful that it may contribute significantly to a greenhouse effect."
