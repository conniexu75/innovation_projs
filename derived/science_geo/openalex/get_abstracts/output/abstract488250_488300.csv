https://openalex.org/W2035622034,"Mature microRNAs (miRNAs), ∼ 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs regulating target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, have been recently shown to be transported into the nucleus where they modulate the biogenesis of other miRNAs or their own expression. However, the mechanism that governs the transport of mature miRNAs from cytoplasm to nucleus remains unknown. Here, we report that importin 8 (IPO8), a member of the karyopherin β (also named the protein import receptor importin β) family, plays a critical role in mediating the cytoplasm-to-nucleus transport of mature miRNAs. Specifically knocking down IPO8 but not other karyopherin β family proteins via siRNA significantly decreases the nuclear transport of various known nucleus-enriched miRNAs without affecting their total cellular levels. IPO8-mediated nuclear transport of mature miRNAs is also dependent on the association of IPO8 with the Argonaute 2 (Ago2) complex. Cross-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis show that IPO8 is physically associated with Ago2. Knocking down IPO8 via siRNA markedly decreases the nuclear transport of Ago2 but does not affect the total cellular Ago2 level. Furthermore, dissociating the binding of miRNAs with Ago2 by trypaflavine strongly reduces the IPO8-mediated nuclear transport of miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2027034252,"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in body tissues or fluids is extensively investigated in clinical medicine and other research fields. In this article we provide a direct quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) as a sensitive tool for the measurement of cfDNA from plasma without previous DNA extraction, which is known to be accompanied by a reduction of DNA yield. The primer sets were designed to amplify a 90 and 222 bp multi-locus L1PA2 sequence. In the first module, cfDNA concentrations in unpurified plasma were compared to cfDNA concentrations in the eluate and the flow-through of the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit and in the eluate of a phenol-chloroform isoamyl (PCI) based DNA extraction, to elucidate the DNA losses during extraction. The analyses revealed 2.79-fold higher cfDNA concentrations in unpurified plasma compared to the eluate of the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit, while 36.7% of the total cfDNA were found in the flow-through. The PCI procedure only performed well on samples with high cfDNA concentrations, showing 87.4% of the concentrations measured in plasma. The DNA integrity strongly depended on the sample treatment. Further qualitative analyses indicated differing fractions of cfDNA fragment lengths in the eluate of both extraction methods. In the second module, cfDNA concentrations in the plasma of 74 coronary heart disease patients were compared to cfDNA concentrations of 74 healthy controls, using the direct L1PA2 qPCR for cfDNA quantification. The patient collective showed significantly higher cfDNA levels (mean (SD) 20.1 (23.8) ng/ml; range 5.1–183.0 ng/ml) compared to the healthy controls (9.7 (4.2) ng/ml; range 1.6–23.7 ng/ml). With our direct qPCR, we recommend a simple, economic and sensitive procedure for the quantification of cfDNA concentrations from plasma that might find broad applicability, if cfDNA became an established marker in the assessment of pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2076163815,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of conserved pattern-recognition molecules responsible for initiating innate and acquired immune responses. Because they play a key role in host defence, these genes have received increasing interest in the evolutionary and population genetics literature, as their variation represents a potential target of adaptive evolution. However, the role of pathogen-mediated selection (i.e. episodic positive selection) in the evolution of these genes remains poorly known and has not been examined outside of mammals. A recent increase in the number of bird species for which TLR sequences are available has enabled us to examine the selective processes that have influenced evolution of the 10 known avian TLR genes. Specifically, we tested for episodic positive selection to identify codons that experience purifying selection for the majority of their evolution, interspersed with bursts of positive selection that may occur only in restricted lineages. We included up to 23 species per gene (mean = 16.0) and observed that, although purifying selection was evident, an average of 4.5% of codons experienced episodic positive selection across all loci. For four genes in which sequence coverage traversed both the extracellular leucine-rich repeat region (LRR) and transmembrane/intracellular domains of the proteins, increased positive selection was observed at the extracellular domain, consistent with theoretical predictions. Our results provide evidence that episodic positive selection has played an important role in the evolution of most avian TLRs, consistent with the role of these loci in pathogen recognition and a mechanism of host-pathogen coevolution."
https://openalex.org/W2035208865,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a hormone that plays a vital role in mediating abiotic stress responses in plants. Salt exposure induces the synthesis of ABA through the cleavage of carotenoid precursors (xanthophylls), which are found at very low levels in roots. Here we show that de novo ABA biosynthesis in salt-treated Arabidopsis thaliana roots involves an organ-specific induction of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Upregulation of the genes encoding phytoene synthase (PSY) and other enzymes of the pathway producing ABA precursors was observed in roots but not in shoots after salt exposure. A pharmacological block of the carotenoid pathway substantially reduced ABA levels in stressed roots, confirming that an increase in carotenoid accumulation contributes to fuel hormone production after salt exposure. Treatment with exogenous ABA was also found to upregulate PSY expression only in roots, suggesting an organ-specific feedback regulation of the carotenoid pathway by ABA. Taken together, our results show that the presence of high concentrations of salt in the growth medium rapidly triggers a root-specific activation of the carotenoid pathway, probably to ensure a proper supply of ABA precursors required for a sustained production of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1993409548,"The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 7 (mGlu7) is an important presynaptic regulator of neurotransmission in the mammalian CNS. mGlu7 function has been linked to autism, drug abuse, anxiety, and depression. Despite this, it has been difficult to develop specific blockers of native mGlu7 signaling in relevant brain areas such as amygdala and limbic cortex. Here, we present the mGlu7-selective antagonist 7-hydroxy-3-(4-iodophenoxy)-4H-chromen-4-one (XAP044), which inhibits lateral amygdala long term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices from wild type mice with a half-maximal blockade at 88 nm. There was no effect of XAP044 on LTP of mGlu7-deficient mice, indicating that this pharmacological effect is mGlu7-dependent. Unexpectedly and in contrast to all previous mGlu7-selective drugs, XAP044 does not act via the seven-transmembrane region but rather via a binding pocket localized in mGlu7's extracellular Venus flytrap domain, a region generally known for orthosteric agonist binding. This was shown by chimeric receptor studies in recombinant cell line assays. XAP044 demonstrates good brain exposure and wide spectrum anti-stress and antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like efficacy in rodent behavioral paradigms. XAP044 reduces freezing during acquisition of Pavlovian fear and reduces innate anxiety, which is consistent with the phenotypes of mGlu7-deficient mice, the results of mGlu7 siRNA knockdown studies, and the inhibition of amygdala LTP by XAP044. Thus, we present an mGlu7 antagonist with a novel molecular mode of pharmacological action, providing significant application potential in psychiatry. Modeling the selective interaction between XAP044 and mGlu7's Venus flytrap domain, whose three-dimensional structure is already known, will facilitate future drug development supported by computer-assisted drug design."
https://openalex.org/W1998400885,"The bone marrow (BM) niche is the primary site of hematopoiesis, and cues from this microenvironment are critical to maintain hematopoiesis. Obesity increases lifetime susceptibility to a host of chronic diseases, and has been linked to defective leukogenesis. The pressures obesity exerts on hematopoietic tissues led us to study the effects of a high fat diet (HFD: 60% Kcal from fat) on B cell development in BM. Seven week old male C57Bl/6J mice were fed either a high fat (HFD) or regular chow (RD) diet for periods of 2 days, 1 week and 6 weeks. B-cell populations (B220+) were not altered after 2 d of HFD, within 1 w B-cell proportions were reduced by −10%, and by 6 w by −25% as compared to RD (p<0.05). BM RNA was extracted to track the expression of B-cell development markers Il-7, Ebf-1 and Pax-5. At 2 d, the expression of Il-7 and Ebf-1 were reduced by −20% (p = 0.08) and −11% (p = 0.06) whereas Pax-5 was not significantly impacted. At one week, however, the expressions of Il-7, Ebf-1, and Pax-5 in HFD mice fell by -19%, −20% and −16%, and by six weeks were further reduced to −23%, −29% and −34% as compared to RD (p<0.05 for all), a suppression paralleled by a +363% increase in adipose encroachment within the marrow space (p<0.01). Il-7 is a critical factor in the early B-cell lineage which is secreted by supportive cells in the BM niche, and is necessary for B-cell commitment. These data indicate that BM Il-7 expression, and by extension B-cell differentiation, are rapidly impaired by HFD. The trend towards suppressed expression of Il-7 following only 2 d of HFD demonstrates how susceptible the BM niche, and the cells which rely on it, are to diet, which ultimately could contribute to disease susceptibility in metabolic disorders such as obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1986031096,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) can cause severe disease and even lead to death in children, and an effective antiviral drug is currently unavailable. The anti-EV71 effect of chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone), a natural flavonoid commonly found in many plants, was tested in this report. By using the predicting program Autodock 4.0 and an in vitro protease inhibition assay, we found that chrysin could suppress viral 3Cpro activity. Replication of viral RNA and production of viral capsid protein and the infectious virion were strongly inhibited by chrysin, without noticeable cytotoxicity. Cytopathic effects on cells were also prevented. Diisopropyl chrysin-7-yl phosphate (CPI), the phosphate ester for chrysin, was generated through a simplified Atheron-Todd reaction to achieve stronger anti-viral activity. CPI was also able to bind with and inhibit viral 3Cpro activity in vitro. As expected, CPI demonstrated more potent antiviral activity against EV71."
https://openalex.org/W2094731304,"To investigate the neuroprotective effect of Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) on focal cerebral ischemic injury in mice and to explore its possible mechanism.Male ICR mice were used to make the model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) after intragastric administration with LBP (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) and Nimodipine (0.4 mg/kg) for seven successive days. After 24 h of reperfusion, neurological scores were estimated and infarct volumes were measured by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Morphological changes in ischemic brains were performed for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The number of apoptotic neurons was detected by TUNEL staining. The Bax, Bcl-2 protein expression and CytC, Caspase-3, -9 and cleaved PARP-1 activation were investigated by immunofluorescence and western-blot analysis.LBP (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) treatment groups significantly reduced infract volume and neurological deficit scores. LBP also relieved neuronal morphological damage and attenuated the neuronal apoptosis. LBP at the dose of 40 mg/kg significantly suppressed overexpression of Bax, CytC, Caspase-3, -9 and cleaved PARP-1, and inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2 expression.Based on these findings we propose that LBP protects against focal cerebral ischemic injury by attenuating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2007084746,"Recent studies indicate that soluble β-amyloid (sAβ) oligomers, rather than their fibrillar aggregates, contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the mechanisms of their neurotoxicity are still elusive. Here, we demonstrate that sAβ derived from 7PA2 cells exert a much stronger effect on the regulation of a set of functionally validated microRNAs (miRNAs) in primary cultured neurons than the synthetic insoluble Aβ fibrils (fAβ). Synthetic sAβ peptides at a higher concentration present comparable effect on these miRNAs in our neuronal model. Further, the sAβ-induced miR-134, miR-145 and miR-210 expressions are fully reversed by two selective N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor inhibitors, but are neither reversed by insulin nor by forskolin, suggesting an NMDA receptor-dependent, rather than PI3K/AKT or PKA/CREB signaling dependent regulatory mechanism. In addition, the repression of miR-107 expression by the sAβ containing 7PA2 CM is likely involved multiple mechanisms and multiple players including NMDA receptor, N-terminally truncated Aβ and reactive oxygen species (ROS)."
https://openalex.org/W2032830230,"Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) not only is cultivated as pasture fodder but also could provide many desirable genes for wheat improvement. It is critical to obtain common wheat-A. cristatum alien disomic addition lines to locate the desired genes on the P genome chromosomes. Comparative analysis of the homoeologous relationships between the P genome chromosome and wheat genome chromosomes is a key step in transferring different desirable genes into common wheat and producing the desired alien translocation line while compensating for the loss of wheat chromatin. In this study, six common wheat-A. cristatum disomic addition lines were produced and analyzed by phenotypic examination, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), SSR markers from the ABD genomes and STS markers from the P genome. Comparative maps, six in total, were generated and demonstrated that all six addition lines belonged to homoeologous group 6. However, chromosome 6P had undergone obvious rearrangements in different addition lines compared with the wheat chromosome, indicating that to obtain a genetic compensating alien translocation line, one should recombine alien chromosomal regions with homoeologous wheat chromosomes. Indeed, these addition lines were classified into four types based on the comparative mapping: 6PI, 6PII, 6PIII, and 6PIV. The different types of chromosome 6P possessed different desirable genes. For example, the 6PI type, containing three addition lines, carried genes conferring high numbers of kernels per spike and resistance to powdery mildew, important traits for wheat improvement. These results may prove valuable for promoting the development of conventional chromosome engineering techniques toward molecular chromosome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2064669289,"Background Accumulating evidence supports the concept that melanoma is highly heterogeneous and sustained by a small subpopulation of melanoma stem-like cells. Those cells are considered as responsible for tumor resistance to therapies. Moreover, melanoma cells are characterized by their high phenotypic plasticity. Consequently, both melanoma stem-like cells and their more differentiated progeny must be eradicated to achieve durable cure. By reevaluating compounds in heterogeneous melanoma populations, it might be possible to select compounds with activity not only against fast-cycling cells but also against cancer stem-like cells. Natural compounds were the focus of the present study. Methods We analyzed 120 compounds from The Natural Products Set II to identify compounds active against melanoma populations grown in an anchorage-independent manner and enriched with cells exerting self-renewing capacity. Cell viability, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, gene expression, clonogenic survival and label-retention were analyzed. Findings Several compounds efficiently eradicated cells with clonogenic capacity and nanaomycin A, streptonigrin and toyocamycin were effective at 0.1 µM. Other anti-clonogenic but not highly cytotoxic compounds such as bryostatin 1, siomycin A, illudin M, michellamine B and pentoxifylline markedly reduced the frequency of ABCB5 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B, member 5)-positive cells. On the contrary, treatment with maytansine and colchicine selected for cells expressing this transporter. Maytansine, streptonigrin, toyocamycin and colchicine, even if highly cytotoxic, left a small subpopulation of slow-dividing cells unaffected. Compounds selected in the present study differentially altered the expression of melanocyte/melanoma specific microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and proto-oncogene c-MYC. Conclusion Selected anti-clonogenic compounds might be further investigated as potential adjuvants targeting melanoma stem-like cells in the combined anti-melanoma therapy, whereas selected cytotoxic but not anti-clonogenic compounds, which increased the frequency of ABCB5-positive cells and remained slow-cycling cells unaffected, might be considered as a tool to enrich cultures with cells exhibiting melanoma stem cell characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1995307716,"Allergic reactions towards β-lactam antibiotics pose an important clinical problem. The ability of small molecules, such as a β-lactams, to bind covalently to proteins, in a process known as haptenation, is considered necessary for induction of a specific immunological response. Identification of the proteins modified by β-lactams and elucidation of the relevance of this process in allergic reactions requires sensitive tools. Here we describe the preparation and characterization of a biotinylated amoxicillin analog (AX-B) as a tool for the study of protein haptenation by amoxicillin (AX). AX-B, obtained by the inclusion of a biotin moiety at the lateral chain of AX, showed a chemical reactivity identical to AX. Covalent modification of proteins by AX-B was reduced by excess AX and vice versa, suggesting competition for binding to the same targets. From an immunological point of view, AX and AX-B behaved similarly in RAST inhibition studies with sera of patients with non-selective allergy towards β-lactams, whereas, as expected, competition by AX-B was poorer with sera of AX-selective patients, which recognize AX lateral chain. Use of AX-B followed by biotin detection allowed the observation of human serum albumin (HSA) modification by concentrations 100-fold lower that when using AX followed by immunological detection. Incubation of human serum with AX-B led to the haptenation of all of the previously identified major AX targets. In addition, some new targets could be detected. Interestingly, AX-B allowed the detection of intracellular protein adducts, which showed a cell type-specific pattern. This opens the possibility of following the formation and fate of AX-B adducts in cells. Thus, AX-B may constitute a valuable tool for the identification of AX targets with high sensitivity as well as for the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in allergy towards β-lactams."
https://openalex.org/W1981638900,"An important component of barley cell walls, particularly in the endosperm, is (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan, a polymer that has proven health benefits in humans and that influences processability in the brewing industry. Genes of the cellulose synthase-like (Csl) F gene family have been shown to be involved in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan synthesis but many aspects of the biosynthesis are still unclear. Examination of the sequence assembly of the barley genome has revealed the presence of an additional three HvCslF genes (HvCslF11, HvCslF12 and HvCslF13) which may be involved in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan synthesis. Transcripts of HvCslF11 and HvCslF12 mRNA were found in roots and young leaves, respectively. Transient expression of these genes in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in phenotypic changes in the infiltrated leaves, although no authentic (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan was detected. Comparisons of the CslF gene families in cereals revealed evidence of intergenic recombination, gene duplications and translocation events. This significant divergence within the gene family might be related to multiple functions of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucans in the Poaceae. Emerging genomic and global expression data for barley and other cereals is a powerful resource for characterising the evolution and dynamics of complete gene families. In the case of the CslF gene family, the results will contribute to a more thorough understanding of carbohydrate metabolism in grass cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W1987085254,"The transmission of infectious prions into different host species requires compatible prion protein (PrP) primary structures, and even one heterologous residue at a pivotal position can block prion infection. Mapping the key amino acid positions that govern cross-species prion conversion has not yet been possible, although certain residue positions have been identified as restrictive, including residues in the β2-α2 loop region of PrP. To further define how β2-α2 residues impact conversion, we investigated residue substitutions in PrP(C) using an in vitro prion conversion assay. Within the β2-α2 loop, a tyrosine residue at position 169 is strictly conserved among mammals, and transgenic mice expressing mouse PrP having the Y169G, S170N, and N174T substitutions resist prion infection. To better understand the structural requirements of specific residues for conversion initiated by mouse prions, we substituted a diverse array of amino acids at position 169 of PrP. We found that the substitution of glycine, leucine, or glutamine at position 169 reduced conversion by ∼ 75%. In contrast, replacing tyrosine 169 with either of the bulky, aromatic residues, phenylalanine or tryptophan, supported efficient prion conversion. We propose a model based on a requirement for tightly interdigitating complementary amino acid side chains within specific domains of adjacent PrP molecules, known as ""steric zippers,"" to explain these results. Collectively, these studies suggest that an aromatic residue at position 169 supports efficient prion conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2050593946,"Background Galectin-1, a member of carbohydrate-binding proteins with a polyvalent function on tumor progression, was found strongly expressed in pancreatic satellite cells (PSCs), which partner in crime with cancer cells and promote the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We evaluated the effects of PSCs derived Galectin-1 on the progression of PDAC, as well as the tumor establishment and development in mouse xenografts. Methods The relationship between immunohistochemistry staining intensity of Galectin-1 and clinicopathologic variables were assessed in 66 PDAC tissues, 18 chronic pancreatitis tissues and 10 normal controls. The roles of PSCs isolated from PDAC and normal pancreas on the proliferative activity, MMP2 and MMP9 expression, and the invasion of CFPAC-1 in the co-cultured system, as well as on the tumor establishment and development in mouse xenografts by mixed implanting with CFPAC-1 subcutaneously were evaluated. Results Galectin-1 expression was gradually increased from normal pancreas (negative), chronic pancreatitis (weak) to PDAC (strong), in which Galectin-1 expression was also increased from well, moderately to poorly differentiated PDAC. Galectin-1 staining intensity of pancreatic cancer tissue was associated with increase in tumor size, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion and differentiation and UICC stage, and served as the independent prognostic indicator of poor survival of pancreatic cancer. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that TGF-β1 upregulated Galectin-1 expression in PSCs, which could further promotes the proliferative activity, MMP2 and MMP9 expression, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, as well as the tumor establishment and growth. Conclusion Galectin-1 expression in stromal cells of pancreatic cancer suggests that this protein plays a role in the promotion of cancer cells invasion and metastasis and provides a therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1996757196,"There are now 10 expanded CAG repeat diseases in which both disease risk and age of onset are strongly dependent on the repeat length of the polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence in the disease protein. Large, polyQ-rich inclusions in patient brains and in cell and animal models are consistent with the involvement of polyQ aggregation in the disease mechanism. This possibility is reinforced by studies showing strong repeat length dependence to the aggregation process, qualitatively mirroring the repeat length dependence of disease risk. Our understanding of the underlying biophysical principles that mediate the repeat length dependence of aggregation, however, is far from complete. A previous study of simple polyQ peptides showed that N*, the size of the critical nucleus that controls onset of aggregation, decreases from unfavorable tetramer to favorable monomer over the range Q23 to Q26. These data, however, do not explain why, for all peptides exhibiting N* ∼ 1, spontaneous aggregation rates continue to increase with increasing repeat length. Here we describe a novel kinetics analyses that maps out the nonlinear dependence with repeat length of a nucleation efficiency term that is likely related to aspects of nucleus structure. This trend accounts for why nucleus size increases to tetrameric at repeat lengths of Q23 or below. Intriguingly, both aggregation and age of onset trend with repeat length in similar ways, exhibiting large changes per added Gln at low repeat lengths and small changes per added Gln at relatively long repeat lengths. Fibril stability also increases with repeat length in a nonlinear fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2054136863,"We characterized the hypolipidemic effects of alpha-lipoic acid (LA, R-form) and examined the associated molecular mechanisms in a high fat fed Zucker rat model. Rats (n = 8) were assigned to a high fat (HF) diet or the HF diet with 0.25% LA (HF-LA) for 30 days and pair fed to remove confounding effects associated with the anorectic properties of LA. Compared with the HF controls, the HF-LA group was protected against diet-induced obesity (102.5±3.1 vs. 121.5±3.6,% change BW) and hypercholesterolemia with a reduction in total-C (−21%), non-HDL-C (−25%), LDL-C (−16%), and total LDL particle number (−46%) and an increase in total HDL particles (∼22%). This cholesterol-lowering response was associated with a reduction in plasma PCSK9 concentration (−70%) and an increase in hepatic LDLr receptor protein abundance (2 fold of HF). Compared with the HF-fed animals, livers of LA-supplemented animals were protected against TG accumulation (−46%), likely through multiple mechanisms including: a suppressed lipogenic response (down-regulation of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase expression); enhanced hepatic fat oxidation (increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase Iα expression); and enhanced VLDL export (increased hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression and elevated plasma VLDL particle number). Study results also support an enhanced fatty acid uptake (2.8 fold increase in total lipase activity) and oxidation (increased CPT1β protein abundance) in muscle tissue in LA-supplemented animals compared with the HF group. In summary, in the absence of a change in caloric intake, LA was effective in protecting against hypercholesterolemia and hepatic fat accumulation under conditions of strong genetic and dietary predisposition toward obesity and dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2008467857,"The 26S proteasome is the end point of the ubiquitin- and ATP-dependent degradation pathway. The 26S proteasome complex (26S PC) integrity and function has been shown to be highly dependent on ATP and its homolog nucleotides. We report here that the redox molecule NADH binds the 26S PC and is sufficient in maintaining 26S PC integrity even in the absence of ATP. Five of the 19S proteasome complex subunits contain a putative NADH binding motif (GxGxxG) including the AAA-ATPase subunit, Psmc1 (Rpt2). We demonstrate that recombinant Psmc1 binds NADH via the GxGxxG motif. Introducing the ΔGxGxxG Psmc1 mutant into cells results in reduced NADH-stabilized 26S proteasomes and decreased viability following redox stress induced by the mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone. The newly identified NADH binding of 26S proteasomes advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of protein degradation and highlights a new link between protein homeostasis and the cellular metabolic/redox state."
https://openalex.org/W2035368770,"Cartilaginous tissues engineered using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be leveraged to generate bone in vivo by executing an endochondral program, leading to increased interest in the use of such hypertrophic grafts for the regeneration of osseous defects. During normal skeletogenesis, canals within the developing hypertrophic cartilage play a key role in facilitating endochondral ossification. Inspired by this developmental feature, the objective of this study was to promote endochondral ossification of an engineered cartilaginous construct through modification of scaffold architecture. Our hypothesis was that the introduction of channels into MSC-seeded hydrogels would firstly facilitate the in vitro development of scaled-up hypertrophic cartilaginous tissues, and secondly would accelerate vascularisation and mineralisation of the graft in vivo. MSCs were encapsulated into hydrogels containing either an array of micro-channels, or into non-channelled 'solid' controls, and maintained in culture conditions known to promote a hypertrophic cartilaginous phenotype. Solid constructs accumulated significantly more sGAG and collagen in vitro, while channelled constructs accumulated significantly more calcium. In vivo, the channels acted as conduits for vascularisation and accelerated mineralisation of the engineered graft. Cartilaginous tissue within the channels underwent endochondral ossification, producing lamellar bone surrounding a hematopoietic marrow component. This study highlights the potential of utilising engineering methodologies, inspired by developmental skeletal processes, in order to enhance endochondral bone regeneration strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2044463321,"T-type (Cav3) channels are categorized as calcium channels, but invertebrate ones can be highly sodium-selective channels. We illustrate that the snail LCav3 T-type channel becomes highly sodium-permeable through exon splicing of an extracellular turret and descending helix in domain II of the four-domain Cav3 channel. Highly sodium-permeable T-type channels are generated without altering the invariant ring of charged residues in the selectivity filter that governs calcium selectivity in calcium channels. The highly sodium-permeant T-type channel expresses in the brain and is the only splice isoform expressed in the snail heart. This unique splicing of turret residues offers T-type channels a capacity to serve as a pacemaking sodium current in the primitive heart and brain in lieu of Nav1-type sodium channels and to substitute for voltage-gated sodium channels lacking in many invertebrates. T-type channels would also contribute substantially to sodium leak conductances at rest in invertebrates because of their large window currents."
https://openalex.org/W2036812903,"We have recently reported that the homologous Rho kinases, ROCK1 and ROCK2, play different roles in regulating stress-induced stress fiber disassembly and cell detachment, and the ROCK1 deficiency in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) has remarkable anti-apoptotic, anti-detachment and pro-survival effects against doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug. This study investigated the roles of ROCK isoforms in doxorubicin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation which is believed to be the major mechanism underlying its cytotoxicity to normal cells, and especially to cardiomyocytes. Different antioxidants have been shown to provide a protective role reported in numerous experimental studies, but clinical trials of antioxidant therapy showed insufficient benefit against the cardiac side effect. We found that both ROCK1−/− and ROCK2−/− MEFs exhibited reduced ROS production in response to doxorubicin treatment. Interestingly, only ROCK1 deficiency, but not ROCK2 deficiency, significantly enhanced the protective effects of antioxidants against doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. First, ROCK1 deficiency and N-acetylcysteine (an anti-oxidant) treatment synergistically reduced ROS levels, caspase activation and cell detachment. In addition, the reduction of ROS generation in ROCK1−/− MEFs in response to doxorubicin treatment was in part through inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity. Furthermore, ROCK1 deficiency enhanced the inhibitory effects of diphenyleneiodonium (an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase) on ROS generation and caspase 3 activation induced by doxorubicin. Finally, ROCK1 deficiency had greater protective effects than antioxidant treatment, especially on reducing actin cytoskeleton remodeling. ROCK1 deficiency not only reduced actomyosin contraction but also preserved central stress fiber stability, whereas antioxidant treatment only reduced actomyosin contraction without preserving central stress fibers. These results reveal a novel strategy to enhance the protective effect of antioxidant therapy by targeting the ROCK1 pathway to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton and boost the inhibitory effects on ROS production, apoptosis and cell detachment."
https://openalex.org/W2073203008,"Youngia japonica, a weed species distributed worldwide, has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is an ideal plant for studying the evolution of Asteraceae plants because of its short life history and abundant source. However, little is known about its evolution and genetic diversity. In this study, de novo transcriptome sequencing was conducted for the first time for the comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity of Y. japonica. The Y. japonica transcriptome was sequenced using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. We produced 21,847,909 high-quality reads for Y. japonica and assembled them into contigs. A total of 51,850 unigenes were identified, among which 46,087 were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database and 41,752 were annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. We mapped 9,125 unigenes onto 163 pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database. In addition, 3,648 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected. Our data provide the most comprehensive transcriptome resource currently available for Y. japonica. C4 photosynthesis unigenes were found in the biological process of Y. japonica. There were 5596 unigenes related to defense response and 1344 ungienes related to signal transduction mechanisms (10.95%). These data provide insights into the genetic diversity of Y. japonica.

Silica Plate Imprinting Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (SPILDI-MSI) is a powerful technique that exhibits great advantages, such as solvent-free and matrix-free characteristics, as well as no sample preparation or separation steps. It also permits accurate identification of mycotoxins and phytoalexins with unique fingerprint profiles in just a few seconds. Results are expressed as chemical images of the 4 identified types of aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1 and G2) and a stilbenoid (resveratrol). Also, SPILDI-MSI allows the comparison between the spatial distribution of aflatoxins and resveratrol found in kernel and skin. This novel application has proven to be useful for instantaneous qualitative assessment of aflatoxins and stilbenoids both in the peanut skin and kernel and offers precise tracking of fungal contamination in nuts and other foodstuffs."
https://openalex.org/W1971856444,"Rhomboid proteases occur in all domains of life; however, their physiological role is not completely understood, and nothing is known of the biology of these enzymes in Archaea. One of the two rhomboid homologs of Haloferax volcanii (RhoII) is fused to a zinc finger domain. Chromosomal deletion of rhoII was successful, indicating that this gene is not essential for this organism; however, the mutant strain (MIG1) showed reduced motility and increased sensitivity to novobiocin. Membrane preparations of MIG1 were enriched in two glycoproteins, identified as the S-layer glycoprotein and an ABC transporter component. The H. volcanii S-layer glycoprotein has been extensively used as a model to study haloarchaeal protein N-glycosylation. HPLC analysis of oligosaccharides released from the S-layer glycoprotein after PNGase treatment revealed that MIG1 was enriched in species with lower retention times than those derived from the parent strain. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the wild type glycoprotein released a novel oligosaccharide species corresponding to GlcNAc-GlcNAc(Hex)2-(SQ-Hex)6 in contrast to the mutant protein, which contained the shorter form GlcNAc2(Hex)2-SQ-Hex-SQ. A glycoproteomics approach of the wild type glycopeptide fraction revealed Asn-732 peptide fragments linked to the sulfoquinovose-containing oligosaccharide. This work describes a novel N-linked oligosaccharide containing a repeating SQ-Hex unit bound to Asn-732 of the H. volcanii S-layer glycoprotein, a position that had not been reported as glycosylated.

Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) hydrolyze proteins localized in lipid bilayers (1.Wolfe M.S.

The relevance of Rho in the physiology of prokaryotes has been poorly investigated. The AarA rhomboid protease from the pathogenic bacterium Providencia stuartii cleaves the N-terminal extension of TatA, a membrane-bound component of the twin arginine protein translocation pathway. Processing of TatA activates the translocation process, allowing the export of an unknown quorum-sensing signal (8.Stevenson L.G. Strisovsky K. Clemmer K.M. Bhatt S. Freeman M.

Rho homologs are widely represented in archaeal genomes, and the predicted proteins contain the typical multispanning transmembrane domains (TMDs) and the amino acid residues involved in catalysis (Ser-His dyad), suggesting that they are probably functional enzymes (10.Maupin-Furlow J.A.

Archaea predominate in environments lethal to most cells, including extreme temperatures, pH values, and salinity. Haloarchaea flourish in habitats containing high salt concentrations (2–5 m NaCl). The only barrier between the cytoplasmic membrane and the harsh environment is the S-layer, a highly organized proteinaceous, two-dimensional crystalline array of one or more proteins that self-assemble around the entire cell surface. S-layer proteins are often glycosylated, and they are thought to play a critical role in the interaction of these microorganisms with the environment (11.Eichler J.

Microbiol. 2010; 2010: 470138Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii, the S-layer glycoprotein is an 81.7-kDa protein containing both N- and O-glycosidic bonds. O-Glycosylation of this protein occurs through binding of glucosyl (1→2) galactose disaccharides to a C-terminal threonine cluster (13.Sumper M. Berg E. Mengele R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8182-8185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the seven putative N-glycosidic sequons found within the S-layer glycoprotein, it was determined that Asn-13 and Asn-83 are modified by a pentasaccharide comprising two hexoses, two hexuronic acids, and a methyl ester of hexuronic acid (15.Abu-Qarn M. Yurist-Doutsch S. Giordano A. Trauner A. Morris H.R. Hitchen P. Medalia O. Dell A. Eichler J. et al.Haloferax volcanii AglB and AglD are involved in N-glycosylation of the S-layer glycoprotein and proper assembly of the surface layer.J. Mol.

Microbiol. 2010; 76: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was also determined that the sequon at Asn-370 is not modified (15.Abu-Qarn M. Yurist-Doutsch S. Giordano A. Trauner A. Morris H.R. Hitchen P. Medalia O. Dell A. Eichler J. et al.Haloferax volcanii AglB and AglD are involved in N-glycosylation of the S-layer glycoprotein and proper assembly of the surface layer.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 1224-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The aforementioned pentasaccharide became a model to study the protein N-glycosylation process in Archaea (17.Calo D. Kaminski L. Eichler J. et al.Protein glycosylation in Archaea: sweet and extreme.Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and it has also been found decorating H. volcanii flagellins (18.Tripepi M. You J. Temel S. Önder Ö. Brisson D. Pohlschröder M. et al.N-Glycosylation of Haloferax volcanii flagellins requires known Agl proteins and is essential for biosynthesis of stable flagella.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 4876-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, growth at different salt concentrations leads to alterations in H. volcanii S-layer glycoprotein N-glycosylation. In high salt, S-layer glycoprotein Asn-13 and Asn-83 are modified by the pentasaccharide. However, when cells were grown in low salt, substantially less pentasaccharide was detected, whereas a distinct tetrasaccharide composed by three hexoses (one of them sulfated) and a rhamnose, which is absent in cells grown at high salinity, was found at Asn-498. Thus, in response to changes in environmental salinity, H. volcanii modulates not only the N-linked glycans decorating the S-layer glycoprotein but also the sites of such posttranslational modification (19.Guan Z. Naparstek S. Calo D. Eichler J. et al.Protein glycosylation as an adaptive response in Archaea: growth at different salt concentrations leads to alterations in Haloferax volcanii S-layer glycoprotein N-glycosylation.Environ. Microbiol. 2012; 14: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that two different glycosylation pathways participate in the synthesis of the tetra- and pentasaccharide (20.Kaminski L. Guan Z. Yurist-Doutsch S. Eichler J. et al.Two distinct N-glycosylation pathways process the Haloferax volcanii S-layer glycoprotein upon changes in environmental salinity.MBio. 2013; 4: e00716-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To explore the biological role of Rho in Archaea, we constructed a null mutant of a zinc finger-Rho (RhoII) in the model haloarchaeon H. volcanii. The mutant evidenced reduced motility and increased sensitivity to novobiocin as well as a different electrophoretic pattern of glycoproteins compared with the parental strain. We report for the first time the presence of N-acetylglucosamine N-linked oligosaccharides in the S-layer glycoprotein of H. volcanii and show that these sugar chains are shorter in the strain deficient in the RhoII protease. Furthermore, we provide information on the structure and composition of this novel oligosaccharide and show that it is linked to Asn-732, a putative glycosylation site where no modification had been reported so far.

E. coli was transformed by the CaCl2 method (22.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). To induce the synthesis of chimeric substrates, the cultures (A600 = 0.4–0.7) were incubated with 0.1 m isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. H. volcanii cultures were grown to an A600 = 1–1.5, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g 10 min, 4 °C). Cell pellets were suspended in 50 mm HCl-Tris, 2 m NaCl (pH 7.5) and disrupted with an ultrasonic processor (3 × 30 s, 80 W). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (70,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C), washed with the same buffer, and recentrifuged for 30 min.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and pellets were suspended in 20 mm HCl-Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 μm pepstatin, and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme. Cells were disrupted, and lysates were clarified as described above. The supernatants were used as a source of Rho substrates. E. coli MG1655 harboring the plasmids with the heterologous substrates were used to prepare cell extracts. These preparations were incubated with H. volcanii membrane fractions in 0.2% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, 50 mm HCl-Tris (pH 7.5), 1.2 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (final volume 75 μl) at 37 °C for 16 h. After incubation, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged (17,000 × g, 15 min), and washed twice with cold 80% (v/v) acetone. Pellets were air-dried and suspended in Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. et al.Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) sample buffer. Samples were applied onto polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, proteins were visualized with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or periodic acid-Schiff staining (25.Dubray G.

For Western blotting, gels were transferred to PVDF membranes and blocked with TBST buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20) with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk. Membranes were incubated with 1:3000 anti-His antibody in blocking buffer, washed with TBST (3 × 10 min), and incubated with 1:10,000 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 2 h. After washing (TBST, 3 × 10 min), blots were developed with 0.33 mg ml−1 nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.01 mg ml−1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phospate. The knock-out constructs were generated as described elsewhere (26.Allers T. Ngo H.P. Mevarech M.

In brief,800 bp flanking each end of the rhoII gene were PCR-amplified and sequentially cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII (upstream region) and the BamHI/XbaI (downstream region) sites of the haloarchaeal suicide vector pTA131. The construct described above (pMIG1) was first amplified in E. coli DH5α and then passed through E. coli GM33 (dam−) to obtain non-methylated plasmid, which was then transformed into H. volcanii H26 using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method.5 A single homologous recombination event between one of the flanking regions on the knock-out construct and the chromosome (pop-in) was selected for by growth on CA medium, which lacks uracil. Recombinants were next grown in liquid 18% MGM with two passages to fresh medium to allow for a second recombination event that would result in excision of the plasmid from the chromosome (pop-out). Liquid cultures were then transferred to CA plates with uracil (10 μg ml−1) and 5-FOA (50 μg ml−1) and incubated at 42 °C for 5–10 days. Colonies were screened by PCR, using the Hvo0727KOverify5′ and Hvo0727KOverify3′ primers, followed by sequencing of the amplicon to confirm that the chromosomal replacement event had occurred. The chromosomal region comprising 207 bp upstream of the rhoII start codon and 113 bp downstream of the endV stop codon was amplified by PCR, using genomic H. volcanii H26 DNA as a template. The amplicon (2037 bp) was cloned in the TOPO-Blunt vector (Invitrogen), digested with ApaI and BamHI, and subcloned into pTA963 previously digested with the same enzymes. The ligation product was transformed into E. coli DH5α and then passed through E. coli GM33 and transformed into H. volcanii H26 or MIG1 as described above. RNA was extracted as described previously (27.Nieuwlandt D.T. Palmer J.R. Armbruster D.T. Kuo Y.P. Oda W. Daniels C.J. Robb F.T. Place A.R. Sowers K.R. Schreier H.J. DasSarma S. Fleischmann E.M. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 161-162Google Scholar), concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, and integrity was assessed by gel electrophoresis in glioxal gels. Contaminant proteins and genomic DNA were eliminated by phenol/chloroform/isoamylic alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v) extraction and digestion with RQ1 DNase, respectively. The absence of contaminating DNA was assessed by PCR amplification using 7SF and 7SR primers. First strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating 2–5 μg of genomic DNA-free RNA and 0.5 μg of the indicated primer at 70 °C (5 min) and on ice (5 min). Then 0.5 mm dNTPs, 2.5 μl of 10× RQ1 RT buffer, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were added (final volume of 25 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped at 70 °C (5 min). Real-time qPCR was performed using a StepOneTM real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Each 20-μl real-time qPCR reaction mixture contained 2 μl of a 1:20 dilution of the corresponding cDNA, a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer, and 10 μl of 2× qPCR reaction mix with SYBR Green as the detection and ROX as a the normalizing dye. The PCR conditions consisted of a denaturation cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 55 °C for 1 min, and a dissociation cycle at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C for 15 s. The melting curve generated at the end of real-time PCR cycles was analyzed to confirm the absence of nonspecific double-stranded DNA-SYBR Green hybrids. Real-time qPCR data analysis was performed using the gene expression function of the StepOneTM software version 2.1 (Applied Biosystems) by means of the comparative CT method (28.Wong M.L. Medrano J.F. et al.Real-time PCR for mRNA quantitation.BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The expression levels of target genes were normalized against that of the 7 S RNA gene (endogenous control), and cDNA from H. volcanii H26 was used as a reference sample. Statistical analyses of data were performed using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test (95% confidence). The protein band corresponding to the S-layer glycoprotein was cut out from the gel, frozen for 3 h, and washed (mixing for 30 min) with (a) acetonitrile, (b) 20 mm NaHCO3, pH 7, and (c) acetonitrile. The gel pieces were dried, and the N-glycans were released by incubation with PNGase F (20 milliunits) (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) overnight at 37 °C in 20 mm NaHCO3, pH 7 (30 μl). The gel pieces were thoroughly washed, and supernatants were removed and dried. Glycans were filtered through an Ultrafree McFilter (Mr 5000), dried, resuspended in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (20 μl), and left at room temperature for 40 min. Finally, the sample was dried and suspended in water. A sample of the released oligosaccharides obtained after PNGase F treatment was hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 100 °C. The acid was eliminated by evaporation; the hydrolysate was dried and resuspended in water for HPAEC-PAD analysis. For HPAEC analysis, a DX-500 Dionex BioLC system (Dionex Corp.) with a pulse amperometric detector was used. The following columns and conditions were employed: (a) for oligosaccharides, Carbopack P-200 column equipped with a P-200 precolumn; gradient elution with 100 mm NaOH, 0–70 mm sodium acetate for 35 min; the flow rate was 0.45 ml min−1; (b) for monosaccharide analysis, Carbopack P-20 column equipped with a P-20 precolumn; (i) for neutral and amino sugars, a 16 mm NaOH isocratic program was used, and (ii) for acidic sugars, a 25 mm NaOH, 80 mm NaAcO isocratic program was used; flow rate, 0.5 ml min−1. The protein band corresponding to the S-layer glycoprotein was cut out from the gel and washed with acetonitrile. The gel pieces were reduced with 10 mm DTT in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 55 °C for 30 min. They were further washed with acetonitrile and alkylated with 55 mm IAA in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 20 min at room temperature in darkness. After washing with 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 10 min and with acetonitrile for 5 min, they were dried in a SpeedVac. The gel slices were rehydrated with 20 ng μl−1 trypsin (Sigma) in 40 mm NH4HCO3, 9% acetonitrile and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The peptides were extracted by sonication with 50% acetonitrile in 1% TFA, and supernatant was taken to dryness. In another case, further digestion was carried upon the addition of 20 ng μl−1 Glu-C (V8) protease (Promega) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, at 37 °C overnight. After incubation, samples were dried in a SpeedV"
https://openalex.org/W1996796227,"Riboswitches are a class of cis-acting regulatory RNAs normally characterized from the 5′-UTR of bacterial transcripts that bind a specific ligand to regulate expression of associated genes by forming alternative conformations. Here, we present a riboswitch that contributes to transcriptional regulation through sensing Mn2+ in Salmonella typhimurium. We characterized a 5′-UTR (UTR1) from the mntH locus encoding a Mn2+ transporter, which forms a Rho-independent terminator to implement transcription termination with a high Mn2+ selectivity both in vivo and in vitro. Nucleotide substitutions that cause disruption of the terminator interfere with the regulatory function of UTR1. RNA probing analyses outlined a specific UTR1 conformation that favors the terminator structure in Mn2+-replete condition. Switch sequence GCUAUG can alternatively base pair duplicated hexanucleotide CAUAGC to form either a pseudoknot or terminator stem. Mn2+, but not Mg2+, and Ca2+, can enhance cleavage at specific nucleotides in UTR1. We conclude that UTR1 is a riboswitch that senses cytoplasmic Mn2+ and therefore participates in Mn2+-responsive mntH regulation in Salmonella. This riboswitch domain is also conserved in several Gram-negative enteric bacteria, indicating that this Mn2+-responsive mechanism could have broader implications in bacterial gene expression. Additionally, a high level of cytoplasmic Mn2+ can down-regulate transcription of the Salmonella Mg2+ transporter mgtA locus in a Mg2+ riboswitch-dependent manner. On the other hand, these two types of cation riboswitches do not share similarity at the primary or secondary structural levels.

Manganese is a redox-active metal, and the manganese ion Mn2+ plays a pivotal role in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms as a required or preferred cofactor in many metalloenzymes including DNA and RNA polymerases, kinases, and varied redox enzymes (1.Kehres D.G. Maguire M.E. et al.Emerging themes in manganese transport, biochemistry, and pathogenesis in bacteria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 263-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2.Tabor S.

U.S.A. 1989; 86: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The bacterial pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi even utilizes manganese to bypass host defense by eliminating the need for iron (3.Posey J.E. Gherardini F.C. et al.Lack of a role for iron in the Lyme disease pathogen.Science. 2000; 288: 1651-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Various metal divalent ion transporters are able to mediate the uptake of Mn2+, thus maintaining the Mn2+ cytoplasmic concentration. In eukaryotic cells, two natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins, Nramp1 and Nramp2, are characterized as divalent cation transporters (reviewed in Refs. 4.Forbes J.R.

Nelson N. et al.The NRAMP family of metal-ion transporters.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 763: 609-620Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Nramp1, particularly, is a proton-divalent cation antiporter mediating the uptake of Mn2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, and others (6.Portnoy M.E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. et al.The distinct methods by which manganese and iron regulate the Nramp transporters in yeast.Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This transporter, expressed exclusively in macrophages, is regarded as a host resistance factor against different intracellular pathogens probably by depleting divalent cations from these bacteria (for reviews see Refs. 4.Forbes J.R.

Krishna S. et al.Metal ion homeostasis and intracellular parasitism.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Consistently, lack of Nramp1 causes an inability of the murine macrophage to destroy intracellular Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, Leishmania donovani, and Mycobacterium bovis (9.Vidal S. Tremblay M.L. Govoni G. Gauthier S. Sebastiani G. Malo D. Skamene E. Olivier M. Jothy S. Gros P. et al.The Ity/Lsh/Bcg locus: natural resistance to infection with intracellular parasites is abrogated by disruption of the Nramp1 gene.J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). As reported from several studies, the intracellular Mn2+ level of bacteria is detected at an order of 0.01 mm; however, expression of Mn2+ transporters can raise this level by more than 10-fold (0.2–0.3 mm) and readily to the millimolar range under specific conditions (1.Kehres D.G.

Maguire M.E. et al.SitABCD is the alkaline Mn(2+) transporter of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3159-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Many bacteria develop an Nramp1-dependent mechanism to transport Mn2+, as the mntH gene, which encodes an Nramp1 homolog, has been characterized in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (13.Papp-Wallace K.M. Maguire M.E. et al.Manganese transport and the role of manganese in virulence.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 187-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, MntH mediates uptake of Mn2+ and several transition metal divalent ions including Cd2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ (14.Makui H. Roig E. Cole S.T. Helmann J.D. Gros P. Cellier M.F. et al.Identification of the Escherichia coli K-12 Nramp orthologue (MntH) as a selective divalent metal ion transporter.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1065-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Additionally, the sitABCD loci in Salmonella encode a member of the ABC-type ATPase superfamily that mediates Mn2+ transport (12.Kehres D.G. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M. Maguire M.E. et al.SitABCD is the alkaline Mn(2+) transporter of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3159-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both MntH and SitABCD are highly selective for Mn2+ over other divalent cations. It seems that SitABCD is mostly active under alkaline pH conditions (12.Kehres D.G. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M. Maguire M.E. et al.SitABCD is the alkaline Mn(2+) transporter of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3159-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mn2+ uptake is important for virulence in pathogenic bacteria. A Salmonella strain harboring mutations at both mntH and sitABCD loci exhibited an avirulent phenotype in a mouse infection model (15.Zaharik M.L. Cullen V.L. Fung A.M. Libby S.J. Kujat Choy S.L. Coburn B. Kehres D.G. Maguire M.E. Fang F.C. Finlay B.B. et al.The Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium divalent cation transport systems MntH and SitABCD are essential for virulence in an Nramp1G169 murine typhoid model.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5522-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Mn2+ overload causes cytotoxicity regardless of its biological importance (16.Nies D.H. et al.Microbial heavy-metal resistance.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 730-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Bacteria establish Mn2+ homeostasis mainly by modulating expression of the Mn2+ transporters. A transcriptional repressor, MntR, plays a major role in regulating mntH expression in Bacillus subtilis. Mn2+ can bind to MntR to facilitate its binding to the mntH promoter via a palindromic sequence, 5′-TTTGCCTTAAGGAAAC-3′, resulting in repression of mntH transcription (17.Que Q. Helmann J.D. et al.Manganese homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis is regulated by MntR, a bifunctional regulator related to the diphtheria toxin repressor family of proteins.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1454-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulators with low identity (∼30%) with B. subtilis MntR have also been characterized in many Gram-negative bacteria (18.Patzer S.I. Hantke K. et al.Dual repression by Fe2+-Fur and Mn2+-MntR of the mntH gene, encoding an NRAMP-like Mn2+ transporter in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4806-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19.Kehres D.G. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M.

In E. coli and Salmonella, binding to Mn2+ facilitates these MntR proteins to interact with a different palindromic sequence termed MntR-box, 5′-AAACATAGCAAAGGCTATGTTT-3′, thus implementing repression of mntH transcription (18.Patzer S.I. Hantke K. et al.Dual repression by Fe2+-Fur and Mn2+-MntR of the mntH gene, encoding an NRAMP-like Mn2+ transporter in Escherichia coli.J.

The mntH transcription is also partially repressed by Fe2+ via a global iron regulator, Fur, which specifically binds Fe2+ and targets a Fur-binding site in the mntH promoter (11.Kehres D.G. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Maguire M.E. et al.The NRAMP proteins of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli are selective manganese transporters involved in the response to reactive oxygen.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1085-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20.Ikeda J.S. Janakiraman A. Kehres D.G. Maguire M.E. Slauch J.M. et al.Transcriptional regulation of sitABCD of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium by MntR and Fur.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 912-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Importantly, inactivation of Fur disrupts Fe2+-dependent repression of mntH transcription but retains Mn2+-dependent repression (19.Kehres D.G. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M. Maguire M.E. et al.Regulation of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium mntH transcription by H2O2, Fe2+, and Mn2+.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Besides the negative regulation, mntH transcription is activated through the H2O2-sensing regulator OxyR, which binds to the OxyR-binding site in the promoter (11.Kehres D.G. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Maguire M.E. et al.The NRAMP proteins of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli are selective manganese transporters involved in the response to reactive oxygen.Mol.

It is known that Fe2+, but not Mn2+, has a high reactivity with peroxide, which generates the reactive hydroxyl radical through a Fe2+-mediated Fenton reaction. Because Mn2+ is regarded as an antioxidant to counter the effect of Fe2+, facilitation of Mn2+ import in response to oxidative stress may allow Mn2+ to replace Fe2+ in some metalloenzymes to prevent protein damage caused by reactive oxygen species (21.Anjem A. Varghese S. Imlay J.A. et al.Manganese import is a key element of the OxyR response to hydrogen peroxide in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 844-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of particular bacterial genes can exert a regulatory effect on either transcription elongation to the downstream region or translation initiation of the open reading frame (ORF). Many of these 5′-UTRs are riboswitches that bind a specific signal molecule, thus forming an alternative conformation via switching between mutually exclusive base pairs to modulate transcription or translation of the downstream region (for recent reviews see Refs. 22.Henkin T.M. et al.Riboswitch RNAs: using RNA to sense cellular metabolism.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23.Breaker R.R. et al.Prospects for riboswitch discovery and analysis.Mol.

Biol. 2012; 22: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The signal molecules, which are mainly metabolites present in the cytoplasm, interact with the ligand-binding domain (or aptamer) of the riboswitches. Most commonly, the riboswitch domain in a nascent transcript can cause a transcription termination by forming an intrinsic transcription terminator (22.Henkin T.M. et al.Riboswitch RNAs: using RNA to sense cellular metabolism.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23.Breaker R.R. et al.Prospects for riboswitch discovery and analysis.Mol.

Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3 (pii:a003533)Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It has been shown that inorganic ions such as Mg2+ and F− can serve as ligands to interact with specific riboswitches (26.Cromie M.J. Shi Y. Latifi T. Groisman E.A. et al.An RNA sensor for intracellular Mg2+.Cell. 2006; 125: 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27.Dann 3rd, C.E. Wakeman C.A. Sieling C.L.

Winkler W.C. et al.The roles of metal ions in regulation by riboswitches.Met. Ions Life Sci. 2011; 9: 141-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally believed that inorganic cations play an important role in neutralizing negatively charged phosphate groups that come into close proximity in the transition states of RNA folding (for a recent review see Ref. 29.Bowman J.C. Lenz T.K. Hud N.V. Williams L.D. et al.Cations in charge: magnesium ions in RNA folding and catalysis.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Essentially, Mg2+ contributes to the folding of all large RNAs (29.Bowman J.C. Lenz T.K. Hud N.V. Williams L.D. et al.Cations in charge: magnesium ions in RNA folding and catalysis.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, particular RNA molecules display high specificity to interact with Mg2+. The 5′-UTR of two Mg2+ transporter genes, mgtA from Salmonella and mgtE from Bacillus, responds to Mg2+ through a riboswitch domain regardless of having no homology at the primary or secondary structure, which subsequently facilitates a transcription termination of the downstream coding region (26.Cromie M.J.

It has been shown that six Mg2+ ions residing in the mgtE riboswitch stabilize the conformation with a Rho-independent terminator, thus facilitating mgtE transcription termination (27.Dann 3rd, C.E.

Also, a regulatory mechanism that controls transcription termination is involved in the mgtA Mg2+ riboswitch function via a Rho-dependent terminator (30.Hollands K. Proshkin S. Sklyarova S.

In this article, we have provided evidence of Salmonella response to Mn2+ through divalent cation riboswitches. By conducting in vivo gene expression assays, RNA structural probing, mutational analysis, and in vitro transcription experiments, we have established that a 5′-UTR of the mntH mRNA functions as a regulatory element by sensing Mn2+ to determine whether transcription reads through into the mntH coding region or stops within the 5′-UTR. We also have demonstrated that the Mg2+ riboswitch can exert its regulatory effect by responding to Mn2+ in a manner similar to Mg2+.

Deletion of the mntH, mntR, and fur genes was carried out using primer pairs 144 and 145, 1253 and 1254, and 1262 and 1263, respectively, to amplify the kanamycin resistance cassette (KmR) from plasmid pKD4 and integrate the resulting PCR product into the chromosome. A lac gene was integrated in the deleted chromosomal mntH location using plasmid pKG137, which was inserted into the FLP recombination target sequence generated after the KmR cassette was removed (35.Ellermeier C.D.

https://openalex.org/W1999367215,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 and its upstream activating kinase JAK2 are essential mediators of cytokine signaling. Their activity is normally tightly regulated and transient. However, constitutive activation of STAT5 is found in numerous cancers and a driving force for malignant transformation. We describe here the identification of the synthetic chalcone α-Br-2′,3,4,4′-tetramethoxychalcone (α-Br-TMC) as a novel JAK/STAT inhibitor. Using the non-transformed IL-3-dependent B cell line Ba/F3 and its oncogenic derivative Ba/F3-1*6 expressing constitutively activated STAT5, we show that α-Br-TMC targets the JAK/STAT pathway at multiple levels, inhibiting both JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Moreover, α-Br-TMC alters the mobility of STAT5A/B proteins in SDS-PAGE, indicating a change in their post-translational modification state. These alterations correlate with a decreased association of STAT5 and RNA polymerase II with STAT5 target genes in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Interestingly, expression of STAT5 target genes such as Cis and c-Myc was differentially regulated by α-Br-TMC in normal and cancer cells. While both genes were inhibited in IL-3-stimulated Ba/F3 cells, expression of the oncogene c-Myc was down-regulated and that of the tumor suppressor gene Cis was up-regulated in transformed Ba/F3-1*6 cells. The synthetic chalcone α-Br-TMC might therefore represent a promising novel anticancer agent for therapeutic intervention in STAT5-associated malignancies."

Of the 1062, 799 (75%) were ART naïve and 348/799 (44%) were first-time HIV testers. Of this group of 348, 225 (65%) were female. Overall their median age, CD4 count and viral load was 34 years (IQR: 28-41), 364 (IQR: 238-542) cells/mm3 and 13,000 (IQR: 2050-98171) copies/ml, respectively. Female first time HIV testers had higher CD4 counts (419 IQR: 262-582 vs. 303 IQR: 199-418 cells/mm3) and lower viral loads (9,100 vs. 34,000 copies/ml) compared to males. Of 183 participants with CD4 count >350 cells/mm3, 62 (34%) had viral loads > 10,000 copies/ml.A large proportion of HIV infected adults not qualifying for immediate ART at the CD4 count threshold of 350 cells/mm3 have high viral loads. HIV-infected men at their first HIV diagnosis are more likely to have lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads than women."
https://openalex.org/W2132883421,"Background The strong anti-oxidative properties of bilirubin largely explain its cardioprotective effects. Insulin resistance is featured by low circulating bilirubin. Thyroid hormone affects both bilirubin generation and its biliary transport, but it is unknown whether circulating bilirubin is associated with thyroid function in euthyroid subjects. Aim is to determine relationships of bilirubin with TSH, free T4 and free T3 in euthyroid subjects without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to assess whether such a relationship would be modified by the degree of insulin resistance. Methods Total bilirubin, TSH, free T4, free T3, glucose, insulin, lipids and transaminases were measured in 1854 fasting euthyroid subjects without T2DM, recruited from the general population (PREVEND cohort). Insulin resistance was assessed by homeostasis model assessment. Results Bilirubin was positively related to free T4 (β = 0.116, P<0.001) and free T3 (β = 0.078, P = 0.001), but bilirubin was unrelated to TSH. The relationship of bilirubin with free T4 was modified by insulin resistance with a larger effect in more insulin resistant individuals (adjusted for age and sex: β = 0.043, P = 0.056 for interaction; additionally adjusted for smoking, alcohol intake, transaminases and total cholesterol (β = 0.044, P = 0.044 for interaction). The association of bilirubin with free T4 was also modified by high density lipoprotein cholesterol (age- and sex-adjusted: β = 0.040, P = 0.072). Conclusions Low bilirubin relates to low free T4 in euthyroid non-diabetic subjects. Low normal free T4 may particularly confer low bilirubin in more insulin resistant individuals."

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) 2The abbreviations used are: SACspindle assembly checkpointAPCanaphase-promoting complexMCCmitotic checkpoint complexC-Mad2closed Mad2O-Mad2open Mad2. is an evolutionarily conserved and essential surveillance mechanism that ensures that chromosome segregation during mitosis proceeds with high fidelity. The SAC monitors the attachment of chromosomes to microtubules of the mitotic spindle and mediates inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) ubiquitin ligase. SAC activity persists until each kinetochore of the sister chromosome pairs have achieved attachment to microtubules emanating form opposite poles of the spindle and are under tension. Kinetochores that are unattached or that are not under tension recruit SAC components that ultimately lead to the activation of the effector molecules Mad2 and BubR1. Upon activation, Mad2 and BubR1, along with Bub3, bind the APC activator/adapter protein Cdc20 to form the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), resulting in inhibition of APCCdc20 activity (1.Sudakin V.

C-Mad2, in this complex, then dimerizes with cytoplasmic Mad2 to catalyze the formation of additional C-Mad2 molecules that directly bind Cdc20.

We have examined the mechanism that permits SAC activity despite the interaction of a key effector molecule with its antagonist. We show that p31Comet interacts with Mad2 solely as an inhibitor. Moreover, we demonstrate that although the two proteins can be found in complex through out the cell cycle, phosphorylation of p31Comet during mitosis weakens the interaction with Mad2, as judged by competition assays, to allow SAC activity. HeLa and HCT116 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were synchronized as described (20.Summers M.K. Pan B. Mukhyala K.

Anti-Myc (9E10) was produced at the Lerner Research Insitute. Commercial antibodies were as follows: cyclin B (GNS1), p31Comet (4RE23), and Mad2 (107–276-3) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; actin (AC-15), FLAG (M2), and p31Comet (4G11) from Sigma; p31Comet (EPR9584) from Abcam. A gateway-compatible open reading frame for p31Comet was obtained from Origene.

Cell extracts were generated in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, and leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymotrypsin, each at 10 μg/ml. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2–12 h and washed in EBC buffer, including inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation samples or equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For analysis of phosphorylation, proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels incorporating 40 μm Phos-tag reagent (Wako) and 80 μm MnCl2. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) probed with the indicated antibodies and visualized with the LI-COR Odyssey near infrared imaging system. HCT116 cells were synchronized and harvested in mitosis after a thymidine-nocodazole block or in late M/early G1, 2 h after release from a thymidine-nocodazole block. Extracts were then prepared by resuspension in extract buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm DTT, 0.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) followed by two rounds of freeze-thaw and passage through a needle. Extracts were supplemented with ATP and an energy-regenerating system. Mitotic extracts were supplemented with non-destructible cyclin B1 and MG132 to maintain the mitotic state. GST-p31Comet was then incubated in extract for 1 h at 30 °C and then captured on glutathione-agarose. After washing, the proteins were resolved on Phos-tag gels as above and visualized with Gelcode Blue (Pierce). Protein bands were digested with trypsin, extracted in 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. After evaporation, peptides were resuspended in 1% acetic acid and analyzed on a Finnigan LTQ-Obitrap Elite hybrid mass spectrometer system. The HPLC column was a Dionex (15 cm, × 75 μm inner diameter) Acclaim Pepmap C18 (2 μm) 100 Å reversed phase capillary chromatography column. Isogenic HeLa cell lines were plated in 24-well dishes and synchronized as above. Expression of p31Comet proteins was induced after release from thymidine. Eight hours post-release, nocodazole was added, and cells were transferred to Leica DMIRB inverted microscope equipped with a Roper Scientific CoolSNAP HQ Cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ), temperature controller (37 °C) and CO2 (5%) incubation chamber (Leica Microsystems GmbH), and a PeCon incubator (PeCon GmbH, Erbach, Germany) controlled by MetaMorph Software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Images of multiple fields per well were collected at 10-min intervals and analyzed using ImageJ and Photoshop. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post tests were performed using GraphPad Prism. APCCdc20 remains inhibited by the MCC in extracts derived from mitotic, SAC-active cells, despite the presence of p31Comet in these extracts (20.Summers M.K. Pan B. Mukhyala K.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, association of p31Comet with Cdc20 increases during release from a nocodazole block (12.Xia G. Luo X. Habu T. Rizo J. Matsumoto T.

Together, these data suggest that an activating event promotes the interaction of p31Comet with Mad2 followed by subsequent silencing of SAC activity. To identify this event, we sought to confirm that the binding of p31Comet to Mad2 follows this model, that is, that p31Comet binds and antagonizes Mad2 during mitotic exit. To analyze the interaction of p31Comet and Mad2, we examined both p31Comet and Mad2 immunocomplexes for the presence of the interacting partner as well as the Mad2 interactor Mad1. Unexpectedly, we found that p31Comet interacted with Mad2 as well as the Mad2 heterodimeric partner Mad1 at all stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). Notably, p31Comet associates with Mad2 and Mad1 in cells arrested in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole, in which the SAC is maximally active and the interaction does not increase upon mitotic exit (Fig. 1, A and B). Several recent reports have confirmed our findings (15.Westhorpe F.G. Tighe A. Lara-Gonzalez P. Taylor S.S. et al.p31comet-mediated extraction of Mad2 from the MCC promotes efficient mitotic exit.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16.Fava L.L. Kaulich M. Nigg E.A.

Santaguida S. Chiroli E. Musacchio A. et al.Homeostatic control of mitotic arrest.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 710-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These data pose a critical question: how does a cell mount a SAC-mediated mitotic arrest, whereas the critical SAC effector Mad2 is readily found in complex with its inhibitor p31Comet? Analysis of the p31Comet ΔN35-C-Mad2 crystal structure demonstrated that p31Comet and O-Mad2 bind C-Mad2 via the same interface (18.Yang M. Li B. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rizo J. Yu H. Luo X. et al.p31comet blocks Mad2 activation through structural mimicry.Cell. 2007; 131: 744-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Given this knowledge, the function of p31Comet, and the interaction of p31Comet with Mad2 throughout the cell cycle, we propose a model for the regulated inhibition of Mad2 by p31Comet (Fig. 2). This model assumes that p31Comet interacts with the C-Mad2:Mad1 heterodimer solely via the O-Mad2 binding interface of C-Mad2. To confirm the validity of this assumption, we asked whether the p31Comet Q83A/F191A mutant was capable of binding to the C-Mad2:Mad1 heterodimer. Consistent with its inability to interact with C-Mad2, p31Comet Q83A/F191A did not co-precipitate Mad1 (Fig. 3A). However, as no other direct p31Comet-interacting proteins are known, it remained possible that the Q83A/F191A mutant is deficient in interactions that are independent of the O-Mad2 interface. Given the crystal structure data, we reasoned that such additional p31Comet-Mad2 interactions would be mediated by the N terminus of p31Comet, which is not present in the structure. p31Comet deleted for the N-terminal 50 amino acids (Δ50) showed no defect in interacting with Mad2 or Mad1 (Fig. 3B). To exclude the possibility that the interaction with the C-Mad2:Mad1 heterodimer is mediated by a p31Comet-Mad1 interaction not predicted by structural modeling, we determined that p31Comet is not able to interact with Mad1 in the absence of Mad2 (Fig. 3C). Finally, we confirmed that immunoprecipitation of Mad2 using an antibody that specifically binds C-Mad2 via the O-Mad2/p31Comet binding surface (see Ref. 16.Fava L.L. Kaulich M. Nigg E.A. Santamaria A. et al.Probing the in vivo function of Mad1:C-Mad2 in the spindle assembly checkpoint.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3322-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) does not co-precipitate p31Comet as would be expected if an additional binding interface exists (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicate that p31Comet interacts with C-Mad2 and the C-Mad2:Mad1 heterodimer solely via the O-Mad2 binding interface. We conclude that p31Comet associates with Mad2 in an inhibitory manner throughout the cell cycle.FIGURE 3.p31Comet only binds Mad2 as an inhibitor. A, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged p31Comet or the Mad2-binding mutant Q83A/F191A. Lysates and FLAG-immunoprecipitates (IP) were probed for the presence of Mad2 and Mad1. B, cells were transfected with FLAG-p31Comet or a mutant lacking the N-terminal 50 residues (Δ50) and analyzed as described in A. C, cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting Mad2. Lysates and p31Comet-IPs were analyzed as described in A. D, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing total Mad2 or C-Mad2 and probed for the presence of Mad1 and p31Comet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested our model, which predicts that the interaction of p31Comet with Mad2 is weakened in mitosis (Fig. 2). We utilized an in vitro capture-chase assay. Recombinant GST-Mad2 bound to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with extracts from cells that were SAC-active (nocodazole-arrested) or SAC-inactive (late mitotic/early G1, nocodazole-released). We then tested the relative strength of p31Comet-Mad2 binding by incubating the bead-bound complexes with increasing amounts of a recombinant p31Comet with the N-terminal 35 amino acids deleted, p31CometΔ35. After washing, we probed the bound complexes for the presence of the full-length, captured p31Comet with an N-terminal specific-antibody. As predicted by model 3, p31Comet captured from mitotic extracts was more readily displaced from Mad2 than the p31Comet from SAC-inactive extracts (Fig. 4A). The altered p31Comet affinity depicted in Fig. 2 is the likely result of a post-translational modification. We therefore tested whether phosphorylation affected the affinity of p31Comet for Mad2. We determined that p31Comet is phosphorylated in mitosis by comparing the migration of p31Comet in extracts of S, G2, or mitosis on Phos-tag gels (25.Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Takiyama K. Koike T. et al.Phosphate-binding tag, a new tool to visualize phosphorylated proteins.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). These analyses indicated that a substantial portion of p31Comet is phosphorylated during mitosis as evidenced by diminished electrophoretic migration (Fig. 4B). We confirmed that this altered mobility was indeed due to phosphorylation by treating mitotic lysates with λ-phosphatase prior to Phos-tag electrophoresis. Phophatase treatment resulted in a loss of the slower migrating forms of p31Comet, confirming that p31Comet is phosphorylated in mitosis (Fig. 4C). To further determine that phosphorylation weakened the interaction between p31Comet and Mad2, we utilized Phos-tag to analyze capture-chase assays similar to those above. To more closely recapitulate the physiological competition between p31Comet and O-Mad2 (or other C-Mad2 binding partners, e.g. BubR1) for C-Mad2, we captured p31Comet from extract with C-Mad2 bound to the Mad2-binding region of Cdc20 (GST-Cdc20111–138) and then challenged binding with the monomeric Mad2 (O-Mad2) (5.Sironi L. Melixetian M. Faretta M. Prosperini E. Helin K. Musacchio A. et al.Mad2 binding to Mad1 and Cdc20, rather than oligomerization, is required for the spindle checkpoint.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17.Mapelli M. Filipp F.V. Rancati G. Massimiliano L. Nezi L. Stier G. Hagan R.S. Confalonieri S. Piatti S. Sattler M. Musacchio A. et al.Determinants of conformational dimerization of Mad2 and its inhibition by p31comet.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1273-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We first captured endogenous p31Comet from asynchronous extracts, which contained a minor but readily detectable mitotic phosphorylated form. When challenged with increasing molar ratio of O-Mad/C-Mad2, the phosphorylated form was lost more readily (Fig. 4D). To more closely examine the situation in mitosis, we phosphorylated a FLAG-p31Comet in mitotic extracts and allowed a molar excess of this protein to bind the GST-Cdc20111–138 and then performed the chase assays as above. The phosphorylated form was more readily displaced once the O-Mad2/C-Mad2 increased over 1:1 (Fig. 4E). These data indicate that phosphorylation lowers the affinity of p31Comet for Mad2 during mitosis. We next sought to identify the mitosis-specific phosphorylation event(s) that mediate the weakened binding to Mad2. To facilitate the purification of p31Comet in quantities sufficient for these studies and circumvent issues with obtaining mitotic, SAC-active cells upon ectopic expression of p31Comet, we phosphorylated recombinant p31Comet in mitotic extracts. Recombinant GST-p31Comet was incubated in SAC-active or SAC-inactive extracts, purified, and resolved on Phos-tag gels to facilitate analysis of the phosphorylated protein (Fig. 5A). Mass spectrometry analysis of phosphorylated p31Comet band identified phosphorylation of Ser-102 in the slower migrating band, whereas the unmodified peptide was identified in the lower, faster migrating band (Fig. 5, B and C). Phosphorylation of p31Comet Ser-102 is a strong candidate for modulating p31Comet-Mad2 binding. Ser-102 lies in a flexible loop adjacent to the Mad2-interacting residue Gln-83 and is thus physically poised to regulate this interaction (18.Yang M. Li B. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rizo J. Yu H. Luo X. et al.p31comet blocks Mad2 activation through structural mimicry.Cell. 2007; 131: 744-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of Ser-102 phosphorylation in vivo, we constructed isogenic HeLa cells harboring tetracycline-inducible wild type p31Comet or the S102A mutant (Fig. 6A). We first tested whether phosphorylation of Ser-102 is required for the decreased electrophoretic mobility we observed for endogenous p31Comet in mitosis (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of p31Comet abrogates Mad2-dependent mitotic arrest. To facilitate the accumulation of exogenous p31Comet-expressing cells in mitosis that is required for analyzing phosphorylation in intact cells, we induced p31Comet proteins in cells overexpressing Mad2 to buffer the effects of increased p31Comet levels and then treated the cells with nocodazole. Mutation of Ser-102 prevented the mitotic phosphorylation shift of p31Comet (Fig. 6B). In conjunction with our data above, these results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-102 alters the affinity of p31Comet for Mad2 in mitosis. Thus, we postulated that the increased affinity of p31Comet S102A for Mad2 would enhance its ability to silence the SAC. We tested the ability of exogenous p31Comet in these cells to silence nocodazole-induced activation of the SAC in asynchronous cells. These analyses revealed a modest increase in SAC silencing by the p31Comet S102A relative to wild type-expressing cells (data not shown). We repeated these analyses in synchronized cells. p31Comet expression was induced (or not) upon release from a thymidine block. Cells were then challenged with nocodazole and the mitotic index was determined. Whereas control cells efficiently accumulated in mitosis, expression of exogenous p31Comet proteins resulted in a dramatic decrease in the mitotic index. Importantly, expression of S102A produced a significantly stronger bypass of SAC activity in comparison with wild type (Fig. 6C). Our experiments thus far indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-102 does play a role in diminishing the antagonism of Mad2 by p31Comet during mitosis. Because phosphorylated p31Comet still binds Mad2, overexpression of these proteins should bypass Mad2-mediated arrests, as has been shown for overexpression of wild type p31Comet. Under these conditions, a single time point may not be sufficient to fully reveal the importance of phosphorylating Ser-102. We thus repeated the experiments above and monitored the duration of mitotic arrest in induced or uninduced cells in real time. Consistent with our above results, these analyses confirmed that exogenous p31Comet proteins are capable of bypassing Mad2-mediated arrest. However, analysis of mitotic duration revealed that failure to phosphorylate Ser-102 enhances the ability of p31Comet to silence SAC activity (Fig. 6, D and E). Together, our results indicate that phosphorylation of p31Comet Ser-102 is an important event in the regulation of Mad2 activity in vivo. Recent studies from a number of laboratories have highlighted the importance of mechanisms that promote recovery from the activation of the SAC, which occurs in every cell cycle. Although several proteins and events have been shown to promote recovery from SAC-mediated mitotic arrest, the regulation of these processes is unknown. p31Comet is the best characterized component of the SAC recovery machinery (12.Xia G.

Recovery from SAC activity requires two steps: 1) termination of SAC signaling and MCC formation and 2) disassembly of preexisting MCCs. p31Comet specifically binds C-Mad2 via the same binding interface as O-Mad2 (9.Mapelli M.

However, it is currently unclear which step p31Comet participates in in vivo as evidence for and against both models has been presented. p31Comet is coordinately expressed with Mad2 during the cell cycle. 3Date, D. A., Burrows, A. C., and Summers, M. K. (2013) Coordinated regulation of p31Comet and Mad2 expression is required for cellular proliferation. Cell Cycle 12, 3824–3832. Whereas Mad2 is required in early mitosis, p31Comet is required for efficient progression beyond metaphase, suggesting that it becomes active to inhibit Mad2 at this point. Consistent with this idea, APCCdc20 remains inhibited in extracts derived from cells arrested in prometaphase by nocodazole treatment, despite the presence of p31Comet. We have shown that this inhibition is mediated by the MCC, suggesting that p31Comet is not active in prometaphase (20.Summers M.K. Pan B. Mukhyala K. Jackson P.K. et al.The unique N terminus of the UbcH10 E2 enzyme controls the threshold for APC activation and enhances checkpoint regulation of the APC.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 544-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, p31Comet interacts with Mad2 throughout the cell cycle. We show that this binding reflects inhibition of Mad2. Thus, regardless of which step(s) of SAC silencing p31Comet promotes, how the SAC is activated despite inhibition of Mad2, is a critical question. We have determined that although the interaction of p31Comet with Mad2 is readily detectable when the SAC is active, the binding between these two proteins is weakened in these cells. Phosphorylation of p31Comet mediates this weakened interaction. Specifically, we identified phosphorylation of Ser-102 in the mitosis-specific phosphorylated form of p31Comet. Ser-102 is positioned near a key residue, Gln-83, in the p31Comet-Mad2 interaction. To address the impact of phosphorylating p31Comet Ser-102 on its interaction with Mad2, we utilized competitive binding assays in vitro. These analyses revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-102 is sufficient for inducing a subtle but significant weakening of the binding of p31Comet and Mad2 in vitro. Importantly, preventing phosphorylation of Ser-102 enhances the ability of exogenous p31Comet to antagonize Mad2 in vivo. Given the dynamic nature of SAC activation in vivo (13.Jia L. Li B.

Together, our data suggest a model of SAC regulation based on modulating the strength of the interaction of p31Comet with Mad2. Although our data strongly support Ser-102 as a key regulatory site, we note that this residue, as with many reported phosphosites in human p31Comet, is not highly conserved in p31Comet from other species. However, we note that these loop regions generally contain potential phosphosites, suggesting that the mechanism is conserved. Attenuating the interaction of p31Comet with C-Mad2 would enhance the ability of O-Mad2 and/or BubR1 to compete with p31Comet for binding to C-Mad2 at the kinetochore or in the MCC, respectively, promoting SAC activity (15.Westhorpe F.G.

Additionally, attenuating constant inhibition of C-Mad2, rather than activating inhibition of Mad2 at metaphase, would ensure rapid APCCdc20 activation and progression from metaphase to anaphase upon satisfaction of the SAC. However, our analyses indicate that the entire pool of p31Comet is not phosphorylated during mitosis, even in nocodazole-treated cells in which the SAC is maximally active. This finding is in line with data showing that p31Comet functions during prometaphase to prevent maximal SAC activation (19.Varetti G. Guida C. Santaguida S. Chiroli E. Musacchio A. et al.Homeostatic control of mitotic arrest.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 710-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, these findings suggest that antagonistic kinase and phosphatase activities are required for regulation of p31Comet in mitosis. It will be important to identify these enzymes to fully understand the importance of this p31Comet phosphoregulation. Future studies will pursue these enzymes and compare the interplay of p31Comet phosphorylation with additional events, including phosphorylation of critical interacting proteins such as Mad2 or Cdc20, which are known to contribute to regulation of the SAC (27.Miniowitz-Shemtov S.

https://openalex.org/W2005873802,"From the early 17th century to the 1970s southern right whales, Eubalaena australis, were subject to intense exploitation along the Atlantic coast of South America. Catches along this coast recorded by whalers originally formed a continuum from Brazil to Tierra del Fuego. Nevertheless, the recovery of the population has apparently occurred fragmentarily, and with two main areas of concentration, one off southern Brazil (Santa Catarina) and another off central Argentina (Peninsula Valdés). This pattern suggests some level of heterogeneity amongst the population, which is apparently contradicted by records that traced individuals moving throughout the whole geographical extension covered by the species in the Southwest Atlantic. To test the hypothesis of the potential occurrence of discrete subpopulations exploiting specific habitats, we investigated N, C and O isotopic values in 125 bone samples obtained from whaling factories operating in the early 1970s in southern Brazil (n=72) and from contemporary and more recent strandings occurring in central Argentina (n=53). Results indicated significant differences between the two sampling areas, being δ13C and δ18O values significantly higher in samples from southern Brazil than in those from central Argentina. This variation was consistent with isotopic baselines from the two areas, indicating the occurrence of some level of structure in the Southwest Atlantic right whale population and equally that whales more likely feed in areas commonly thought to exclusively serve as nursing grounds. Results aim at reconsidering of the units currently used in the management of the southern right whale in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. In the context of the current die-off affecting the species in Peninsula Valdés, these results also highlight the necessity to better understand movements of individuals and precisely identify their feeding areas."
https://openalex.org/W2083760146,"Oxysterols, oxidized metabolites of cholesterol, are endogenous small molecules that regulate lipid metabolism, immune function, and developmental signaling. Although the cell biology of cholesterol has been intensively studied, fundamental questions about oxysterols, such as their subcellular distribution and trafficking pathways, remain unanswered. We have therefore developed a useful method to image intracellular 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol with both high sensitivity and spatial resolution using click chemistry and fluorescence microscopy. The metabolic labeling of cells with an alkynyl derivative of 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol has allowed us to directly visualize this oxysterol by attaching an azide fluorophore through cyclo-addition. Unexpectedly, we found that this oxysterol selectively accumulates in the Golgi membrane using a pathway that is sensitive to ATP levels, temperature, and lysosome function. Although previous models have proposed nonvesicular pathways for the rapid equilibration of oxysterols between membranes, direct imaging of oxysterols suggests that a vesicular pathway is responsible for differential accumulation of oxysterols in organelle membranes. More broadly, clickable alkynyl sterols may represent useful tools for sterol cell biology, both to investigate the functions of these important lipids and to decipher the pathways that determine their cellular itineraries."
https://openalex.org/W1969820796,"BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor that is over-expressed due to chromosomal translocations, or other abnormalities, in ∼40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. BCL6 interacts with co-repressor, SMRT, and this is essential for its role in lymphomas. Peptide or small molecule inhibitors, which prevent the association of SMRT with BCL6, inhibit transcriptional repression and cause apoptosis of lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In order to discover compounds, which have the potential to be developed into BCL6 inhibitors, we screened a natural product library. The ansamycin antibiotic, rifamycin SV, inhibited BCL6 transcriptional repression and NMR spectroscopy confirmed a direct interaction between rifamycin SV and BCL6. To further determine the characteristics of compounds binding to BCL6-POZ we analyzed four other members of this family and showed that rifabutin, bound most strongly. An X-ray crystal structure of the rifabutin-BCL6 complex revealed that rifabutin occupies a partly non-polar pocket making interactions with tyrosine58, asparagine21 and arginine24 of the BCL6-POZ domain. Importantly these residues are also important for the interaction of BLC6 with SMRT. This work demonstrates a unique approach to developing a structure activity relationship for a compound that will form the basis of a therapeutically useful BCL6 inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2001777630,"Intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) is usually applied as boost radiotherapy for superficial residual of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after primary extern-beam radiptherapy (ERT). Here, we evaluated the outcome of endoscope-guided interstitial intensity-modulated brachytherapy (IMBT) boost radiation for deep-seated residual NPC.Two hundred and thirteen patients with residual NPC who were salvaged with brachytherapy boost radiation during 2005-2009 were analyzed retrospectively. Among these patients, 171 patients had superficial residual NPC (≤1 cm below the nasopharyngeal epithelium) were treated with ICBT boost radiation, and interstitial IMBT boost radiation was delivered to 42 patients with deep-seated residual NPC (>1 cm below the nasopharyngeal epithelium). We found that IMBT boost subgroup had a higher ratio of T2b (81.0% VS 34.5%, P<0.001) and stage II (90.5% VS 61.4%, P = 0.001) than that of ICBT boost subgroup. The dosage of external-beam radiotherapy in the nasopharyngeal (63.0±3.8 VS 62.6±4.3 Gray (Gy), P = 0.67) and regional lymph nodes (55.8±5.0 VS 57.5±5.7 Gy, P = 0.11) was comparable in both groups. For brachytherapy, IMBT subgroup had a lower boost radiation dosage than ICBT subgroup (11.0±2.9 VS 14.8±3.2 Gy, P<0.01). Though the IMBT group had deeper residual tumors and received lower boost radiation dosages, both subgroups had the similar 5-year actuarial overall survival rate (IMBT VS ICBT group: 96.8% VS 93.6%, P = 0.87), progression-free survival rate (92.4% VS 86.5%, P = 0.41) and distant metastasis-free survival rate (94.9% VS 92.7%, P = 0.64). Moreover, IMBT boost radiation subgroup had a similar local (97.4% VS 94.4%, P = 0.57) and regional (95.0% VS 97.2%, P = 0.34) control to ICBT subgroup. The acute and late toxicities rates were comparable between the both subgroups.IMBT boost radiation may be a promising therapeutic selection for deep-seated residual NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2030868212,"Regulation of human placental syncytiotrophoblast renewal by cytotrophoblast migration, aggregation/fusion and differentiation is essential for successful pregnancy. In several tissues, these events are regulated by intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IKCa), in part through their ability to regulate cell volume. We used cytotrophoblasts in primary culture to test the hypotheses that IKCa participate in the formation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast and in syncytiotrophoblast volume homeostasis. Cytotrophoblasts were isolated from normal term placentas and cultured for 66 h. This preparation recreates syncytiotrophoblast formation in vivo, as mononucleate cells (15 h) fuse into multinucleate syncytia (66 h) concomitant with elevated secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Cells were treated with the IKCa inhibitor TRAM-34 (10 µM) or activator DCEBIO (100 µM). Culture medium was collected to measure hCG secretion and cells fixed for immunofluorescence with anti-IKCa and anti-desmoplakin antibodies to assess IKCa expression and multinucleation respectively. K+ channel activity was assessed by measuring 86Rb efflux at 66 h. IKCa immunostaining was evident in nucleus, cytoplasm and surface of mono- and multinucleate cells. DCEBIO increased 86Rb efflux 8.3-fold above control and this was inhibited by TRAM-34 (85%; p<0.0001). Cytotrophoblast multinucleation increased 12-fold (p<0.05) and hCG secretion 20-fold (p<0.05), between 15 and 66 h. Compared to controls, DCEBIO reduced multinucleation by 42% (p<0.05) and hCG secretion by 80% (p<0.05). TRAM-34 alone did not affect cytotrophoblast multinucleation or hCG secretion. Hyposmotic solution increased 86Rb efflux 3.8-fold (p<0.0001). This effect was dependent on extracellular Ca2+, inhibited by TRAM-34 and 100 nM charybdotoxin (85% (p<0.0001) and 43% respectively) but unaffected by 100 nM apamin. In conclusion, IKCa are expressed in cytotrophoblasts and their activation inhibits the formation of multinucleated cells in vitro. IKCa are stimulated by syncytiotrophoblast swelling implicating a role in syncytiotrophoblast volume homeostasis. Inappropriate activation of IKCa in pathophysiological conditions could compromise syncytiotrophoblast turnover and volume homeostasis in pregnancy disease."

The NPHS2 gene product podocin is a key component of the slit diaphragm cell junction at the kidney filtration barrier and part of a multiprotein-lipid supercomplex. A similar complex with the podocin ortholog MEC-2 is required for touch sensation in Caenorhabditis elegans. Although podocin and MEC-2 are membrane-associated proteins with a predicted hairpin-like structure and amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytoplasm, this membrane topology has not been convincingly confirmed. One particular mutation that causes kidney disease in humans (podocinP118L) has also been identified in C. elegans in genetic screens for touch insensitivity (MEC-2P134S).

NS also affects children, about 10% of whom do not respond to standard glucocorticoid therapy and usually progress to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplantation. An important cause of this disorder is mutation in the NPHS2 gene, which encodes the protein podocin (1.Hinkes B.G. Mucha B. Vlangos C.N. Gbadegesin R. Liu J. Hasselbacher K. Hangan D. Ozaltin F.

Loss of podocin results in failure of the kidney filtration barrier. The human kidneys filter about 180 liters of primary urine per day. This primary filtrate is free of protein. The filter resides in about 1 million of microvascular units, called the glomeruli, which contain a three-layered filtration barrier (6.Haraldsson B. Nyström J. Deen W.M. et al.Properties of the glomerular barrier and mechanisms of proteinuria.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 451-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) comprised of podocytes (the visceral epithelial cells), the underlying glomerular basement membrane, and the fenestrated endothelium. Podocytes are highly specialized cells that elaborate primary and secondary foot processes that closely enwrap the glomerular capillaries. Secondary foot processes of adjacent podocytes interdigitate and are connected by the slit diaphragm, a specialized cell-cell contact (7.Pavenstädt H. Kriz W. Kretzler M. et al.Cell biology of the glomerular podocyte.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 253-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar).

These experiments highlight the importance of the membrane topology of podocin and MEC-2 and provide a possible mechanism for SRNS in affected humans. Mouse podocin, human nephrin, human TRPC6, human CD2AP, and C. elegans MEC-2 cDNA constructs have been described previously (14.Huber T.B. Schermer B. Müller R.U. Höhne M. Bartram M. Calixto A.

Mutations of podocin and MEC-2 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Double-tagged human podocin constructs were generated using standard cloning procedures. Antibodies were obtained from Sigma (anti-FLAG M2 mAb, catalog no. F3165 and anti-FLAG pAb, catalog no. F7425), Serotec (anti-V5 mAb, catalog no.

Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen, and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. HEK 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C). For transfection experiments, cells were grown to 60–80% confluency and transfected with plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate method for HEK 293T cells. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method. After incubation for 24 h, cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed on ice in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm PMSF, and 5 mm Na3VO4) for 15 min and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min). Supernatants containing equal amounts of total proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. When indicated, cell lysates were treated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs, catalog no. P0704) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. In brief, 8 μl of cell lysate was incubated with 1 μl of 10× glycoprotein denaturing buffer and 1 μl of double-distilled H2O for 10 min at 95 °C. Then, 2 μl of 10× G7 reaction buffer, 2 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μl of PNGase F were added, filled to 20 μl with double-distilled H2O, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Deglycosylated proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Cells were incubated for 24 h after transfection, washed with PBS, lysed in ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm PMSF, and 5 mm Na3VO4) on ice for 20 min and cleared by ultracentrifugation (Beckmann TLA-55, 50,000 rpm, 4 °C, 60 min). Supernatants containing equal amounts of total protein were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Then the beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The preparation of DRMs was performed as described previously (17.Huber T.B. Simons M. Hartleben B. Sernetz L. Schmidts M. Gundlach E. Saleem M.A. Walz G. Benzing T. et al.Molecular basis of the functional podocin-nephrin complex. Mutations in the NPHS2 gene disrupt nephrin targeting to lipid raft microdomains.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3397-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293T cells were homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm Na3VO4, and 0.25 mm PMSF) by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation for 10 min at 3.000 rpm at 4 °C (Eppendorf F45-30-10 rotor), supernatants (lysates) containing equal amounts of total proteins were carefully adjusted to 45% sucrose (1.6 ml final volume) and pipetted at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. Samples were then overlaid with 1.6 ml of 30% and 0.8 ml of 5% sucrose (in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.1 mm EDTA) to create a sucrose gradient. Samples were centrifuged for 16 h at 41.000 rpm at 4 °C in a swingout rotor (SW60Ti, Beckman Instruments) and seven fractions were collected starting from the top and, together with the non-fractionated lysate, analyzed by SDS-PAGE. HEK 293T cells were seeded on collagen A-coated coverslips and transfected with double-tagged podocin constructs as indicated using the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min without permeabilizing them, blocked with 5% normal donkey serum, and incubated with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody. After washing with PBS, the FLAG antibody was fixed at its position by a second fixation step (2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min). Then cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum + 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody. After extensive washing, cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 45 min. All incubation steps were done for 1 h at room temperature. Between the single incubation steps, cells were rinsed extensively with PBS. Confocal images were taken with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a white light laser and a HCX PL APO ×100/1.40 oil objective (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Images were processed using ImageJ/Fiji software version 1.48 (25.Schindelin J. Arganda-Carreras I. Frise E. Kaynig V. Longair M. Pietzsch T. Preibisch S. Rueden C. Saalfeld S. Schmid B.

Methods. 2012; 9: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30160) Google Scholar). The lysates of five 10-cm HEK 293T dishes transfected with mouse podocinP120L were pooled and separated using SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, the gels were washed thoroughly in water and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands of interest were cut out and minced using a scalpel and then transferred to a 1.5-ml reaction tube. After destaining with 100 μl of 50% 10 mm NH4HCO3/50% acetonitrile (ACN) at 55 °C and dehydration in 500 μl of 100% ACN gel, pieces were equilibrated with about 30 μl of 10 mm NH4HCO3 containing porcine trypsin (12.5 ng/μl, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) on ice for 2 h. Excess trypsin solution was removed, and tryptic hydrolysis was performed for 4 h at 37 °C in about 20 μl of 10 mm NH4HCO3. For peptide deglycosylation, tryptic digests of both bands were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which hydrolyzes nearly all types of asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides from glycopeptides/proteins, leaving the oligosaccharides intact. PNGase F deaminates asparagine to aspartic acid, resulting in a mass difference of +0.984 Da. 5 μl of the in-gel tryptic digests were mixed with 0.5 μl of PNGase F (500,000 units/ml, New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) or 0.5 μl of PNGase buffer as a control, respectively, and incubated overnight at room temperature. Microcrystalline layers were prepared on MALDI target plates by mixing 0.5 μl of the PNGase F-treated sample and the control, respectively, with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fluka, 10 mg/ml, 50% ACN/50% 0.1% aqueous TFA) on the target plate. For peptide mass fingerprinting, positively charged ions in the mass-to-charge (m/z) range of 700–4000 were acquired on a 4800 Plus MALDI-TOF/TOF analyzer (AB SCIEX, Darmstadt, Germany) in the reflector mode. Sums of 50 spectra were recorded from 50 different sample spot positions, resulting in 2500 spectra in total using the 4000 Series Explorer operating software (AB SCIEX). The mass spectrometer was calibrated on the basis of near-neighbor calibrant spectra using Calmix solution (Applied Biosystems). Automatic annotation of monoisotopic peptide signals in tryptic digests was performed using internal calibration on trypsin autolysis peaks at 842 and 2211 m/z. To determine the amino acid sequence of the tryptic peptides containing amino acid residue 201, nano-LC electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS was performed. The residual PNGase F-treated sample after MALDI MS of the upper band was desalted using STAGE Tipp C18 spin columns (Proxeon) as described elsewhere (26.Rappsilber J. Mann M. Ishihama Y. et al.Protocol for micro-purification, enrichment, pre-fractionation and storage of peptides for proteomics using StageTips.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1896-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). Tryptic digests of the lower band were acidified with 5 μl of 5% TFA, and the gel pieces were extracted twice with 20 μl of 0.1% TFA and then with 20 μl of 60% ACN/40%H2O/0.1% TFA, followed by a subsequent two-step treatment using 30 μl of 100% ACN. The supernatant and the extractions were combined, concentrated to a volume below 65 μl using a SpeedVac concentrator (Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany), and desalted using STAGE Tip C18 spin columns (Proxeon). Peptides eluted from STAGE Tips were concentrated to a volume of about 10 μl in vacuo and then diluted with 0.5% acetic acid in water to a final volume of 20 μl. Experiments were performed on a LTQ Orbitrap Discovery (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer that was coupled to a split-less Eksigent nano-LC system (Axel Semrau). Intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at 30,000 resolution in the m/z range of 300–2000. Internal calibration was performed using the ion signal of (Si(CH3)2O)6H at m/z 445.120025 as a lock mass. For MS/MS analysis, collision-induced dissociation was used as a peptide fragmentation mode. Up to five collision-induced dissociation spectra were acquired following each full scan. Sample aliquots of 3–8 μl were separated on a 10-cm, 75-μm internal diameter, reversed-phase column (3 μm, 120 Å, ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ, Proxeon). Gradient elution was performed from 2 to 40% acetonitrile within 40 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. For MALDI peptide mass fingerprinting data, a Mascot search (Matrix Science Ltd., London) on a local server (version 2.2) was applied using the Swiss Protein Database of Mus musculus for protein identification (27.Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. et al.Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data.Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). A mass tolerance of 20 ppm was allowed for intact peptide masses. For nano-LC ESI-MS/MS data, a Sequest search was applied using the ipi.mouse database version 3.71 (March 2010), including an added entry containing the amino acid sequence of podocin with an aspartic acid instead of asparagine at position 201. A mass tolerance of 10 ppm was allowed for intact peptide masses and 0.8 Da for collision-induced dissociation fragment ions detected in the linear ion trap. Methionine oxidation was allowed as a variable modification. cRNAs for mouse podocin, mouse podocinP120L, and human TRPC6 were all linearized with Notl or Mlul and in vitro-transcribed using T7, T3, or SP6 promoter and polymerase (Promega). Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with cRNA (10 ng, 47 nl of double-distilled water). Water-injected oocytes served as controls. Three to four days after injection, oocytes were impaled with two electrodes (Clark Instruments Ltd, Salisbury, UK), which had a resistance of <1 mΩ when filled with 2.7 mol/liter KCI. Using two bath electrodes and a virtual-ground head stage, the voltage drop across Rserial was effectively zero. Membrane currents were measured by voltage clamping (oocyte clamp amplifier, Warner Instruments LLC, Hamden, CT) in intervals from −90 to +30 mV in steps of 10 mV, each 1 s. The bath was perfused continuously (ND96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate (pH 7.55)) at a rate of 5 ml/min. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). All compounds used were of highest available grade of purity and were from Sigma or Calbiochem. The compounds used in this study were usually applied at recommended maximal concentrations to achieve full activation or inhibition, respectively. Student's t test was used to compare any two different groups. Differences in multiple groups were anal"
https://openalex.org/W2052364955,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) surveillance was initiated in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China in 2007, a crucial scrutiny for monitoring the prevalence of enterovirus serotypes associated with HFMD patients. However, this surveillance mostly focused on enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16; therefore, information on other enterovirus serotypes is limited. To identify the other circulating enterovirus serotypes in the HFMD outbreaks in Inner Mongolia in 2010, clinical samples from HFMD patients were investigated. Six coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) strains were isolated and phylogenetic analyses of VP1 sequences were performed. Full-length genome sequences of two representative CVB4 isolates were acquired and similarity plot and bootscanning analyses were performed. The phylogenetic dendrogram indicated that all CVB4 strains could be divided into 5 genotypes (Genotypes I-V) with high bootstrap support (90-100%). The CVB4 prototype strain (JVB) was the sole member of genotype I. CVB4 strains belonging to genotype II, which were once common in Europe and the Americas, seemingly disappeared and gave way to genotype III and IV strains, which appear to be the dominant circulating strains in the world. All Chinese CVB4 strains belonged to Genotype V, a newly identified genotype supported by a high bootstrap value (100%), and are circulating only in mainland of China. Intertypic recombination occurred in the Chinese CVB4 strains with novel unknown serotype EV-B donor sequences. Two Chinese CVB4 strains had a virulent residue at position 129 of VP1, and one strain also had a virulent residue at position 16 of VP4. Increased surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence of new genetic lineages of enteroviruses in areas that are often associated with large-scale outbreaks. In addition, continued monitoring of enteroviruses by clinical surveillance and genetic characterization should be enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W2068189936,"Gdown1, the substoichiometric 13th subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II), has an important role in pausing during the initial stage of transcript elongation. However, Gdown1 quantitatively displaces the essential initiation factor TFIIF from free pol II and elongating pol II. Thus, it is not clear how or even if pol II can initiate in the presence of Gdown1. Using an in vitro transcription system with purified factors and pol II lacking Gdown1, we found that although Gdown1 is strongly inhibitory to transcription when prebound to pol II, a fraction of complexes do remain active. Surprisingly, when Gdown1 is added to complete preinitiation complexes (PICs), it does not inhibit initiation or functionally associate with the PICs. Gdown1 does associate with pol II during the early stage of transcript elongation but this association is competitive with TFIIF. By phosphorylating TFIIF, PICs can be assembled that do not retain TFIIF. Gdown1 also fails to functionally associate with these TFIIF-less PICs, but once polymerase enters transcript elongation, complexes lacking TFIIF quantitatively bind Gdown1. Our results provide a partial resolution of the paradox of the competition between Gdown1 and TFIIF for association with pol II.

Significance: Pathways exist allowing Gdown1 to enter the transcription complex early in elongation, thus allowing Gdown1 to affect pausing. A significant fraction (30–50%) of mammalian RNA polymerase II purified from tissue sources bears a 13th subunit called Gdown1 (1.Hu X. Malik S. Negroiu C.C. Hubbard K. Velalar C.N. Hampton B.

Pol II that contains Gdown1 (pol IIG) supports transcript elongation in promoter-independent assays (1.Hu X. Malik S. Negroiu C.C. Hubbard K. Velalar C.N. Hampton B. Grosu D. Catalano J. Roeder R.G. Gnatt A. et al.A mediator-responsive form of metazoan RNA polymerase II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9506-9511Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, Gdown1 strongly facilitates pausing during the early stages of transcript elongation for promoter-dependent pol II complexes assembled with nuclear extracts (3.Cheng B. Li T. Rahl P.B.

Gdown1 may therefore be an essential part of establishing the poised polymerases that are found at ∼50 bp downstream of most active mammalian promoters (6.Nechaev S.

Consistent with this possibility, ChIP studies demonstrate that Gdown1 co-localizes with poised pol II, although Gdown1 is also present upstream of transcription start and along with pol II within transcription units (3.Cheng B.

An additional property of Gdown1, which is particularly important in the context of gene regulation is the competitive interaction of Gdown1 and TFIIF with pol II. TFIIF is a general transcription factor (GTF) required for the assembly of the pol II PIC (9.Hahn S. et al.Structure and mechanism of the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). TFIIF can bind directly to pol II and was originally isolated based on its affinity for polymerase (10.Sopta M. Carthew R.W. Greenblatt J. et al.Isolation of three proteins that bind to mammalian RNA polymerase II.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIF also strongly stimulates transcript elongation in vitro (11.Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. et al.Dynamic interaction between a Drosophila transcription factor and RNA polymerase II.Mol.

Thus, Gdown1 completely blocks the ability of TFIIF to increase elongation rates (3.Cheng B. Li T. Rahl P.B. Adamson T.E. Loudas N.B. Guo J. Varzavand K. Cooper J.J. Hu X. Gnatt A. Young R.A.

This is consistent with the significant overlap of the surfaces on pol II that are involved in the interaction of free polymerase with Gdown1 or TFIIF (5.Wu Y.M. Chang J.W. Wang C.H. Lin Y.C. Wu P.L.

The ability of Gdown1 to displace TFIIF from free pol II suggests that Gdown1 should inhibit transcription at the initiation stage. Results consistent with this idea have been reported using an assay with supercoiled plasmid templates that do not require the full set of GTFs (4.Jishage M. Malik S. Wagner U. Uberheide B.

Recent findings from in vitro studies point to a pathway that could allow loading of Gdown1 into the pol II PIC before the start of transcription. When TFIIF is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2), the phosphorylated factor (P-IIF) retains the ability to bind to pol II and support efficient PIC assembly (15.Újvári A. Pal M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 23160-23167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, P-IIF is relatively unstable within the PIC, and it can be removed with a gentle wash step (16.Čabart P. Újvári A. Pal M. Luse D.S. et al.TFIIF is not required for initiation by RNA polymerase II but it is essential to stabilize TFIIB in early transcription complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15786-15791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PICs, which have lost P-IIF, are nevertheless fully competent for transcript initiation. Thus, although TFIIF is required for PIC assembly, it need not remain in the complex at the initiation step, although loss of TFIIF from the PIC may partially destabilize TFIIB (16.Čabart P. Újvári A. Pal M. Luse D.S. et al.TFIIF is not required for initiation by RNA polymerase II but it is essential to stabilize TFIIB in early transcription complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15786-15791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that after the departure of TFIIF from the PIC, Gdown1 could join the transcription complex, making Gdown1 available to mediate pol II pausing further downstream. This assumes that inclusion of Gdown1 in the PIC does not affect initiation, a possibility that has not been addressed. The ability of Gdown1 to displace TFIIF effectively from free pol II (5.Wu Y.M.

Cell. 2012; 45: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) raises the additional question of whether Gdown1 can displace TFIIF from a PIC containing nonmodified TFIIF. A comparison of the location of the Ssl2p subunit of TFIIH in the yeast PIC (17.Grünberg S. Warfield L. Hahn S. et al.Architecture of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex and mechanism of ATP-dependent promoter opening.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with the interaction sites of Gdown1 with pol II (5.Wu Y.M. Chang J.W. Wang C.H. Lin Y.C. Wu P.L. Huang S.H. Chang C.C. Hu X.

Chang W.H. et al.Regulation of mammalian transcription by Gdown1 through a novel steric crosstalk revealed by cryo-EM.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3575-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggests that XBP (the mammalian analog of Ssl2p) might also interfere with the binding of Gdown1 to pol II (but see also Refs. 18.He Y.

This further complicates the interpretation of the inhibitory effect of Gdown1 at the stage of PIC assembly. In the present work, we show that Gdown1 cannot inhibit initiation by preformed PICs and cannot functionally associate with complete PICs, including PICs that have lost TFIIF. Gdown1 does bind to the elongation complex and blocks TFIIF stimulation of transcript elongation, but at least early in elongation, TFIIF can compete with Gdown1 for association with pol II. The high affinity of Gdown1 for pol II does not prevent transcript initiation. DNA primers and oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, NTPs and CK2 were from New England Biolabs, CpA was from TriLink, streptavidin-coated M280 Dyna Beads were from Invitrogen, RNasin Plus was from Promega, and 800 Ci/mmol [α-32P]CTP was from PerkinElmer Life Science. Templates contained either the adenovirus major late promoter (Ad ML) or the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) with overall lengths of 1199 and 1258 bp, respectively. Each template had 56 bp upstream of transcription start. Templates were generated by PCR amplification with the upstream primer biotinylated to enable bead attachment.

Recombinant His-tagged Gdown1 was expressed in E. coli and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin before purification on a Mono Q column (3.Cheng B. Li T. Rahl P.B. Adamson T.E. Loudas N.B.

Cell. 2012; 45: 38-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Gdown1 was stored and diluted in HGKEDP (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% PMSF) with 10 μg/ml BSA. Preinitiation complexes were assembled for 20 min at 30 °C with the following per 10-μl reaction: 50 ng of bead-attached template, 0.4 μl of pol II (∼6 ng, ∼12 fmol), 95 fmol of TBP, 72 fmol of TFIIB, 72 fmol of TFIIF, 3.3 fmol of TFIIE, and 1 μl of TFIIH (∼75% saturation of activity). Transcription activity was completely dependent on each of the GTFs. Final buffer for PIC assembly was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.12 mg/ml BSA. In some cases, PICs were gently rinsed with BC100 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl) containing 1 mm DTT and 10 μg/ml BSA followed by a rinse with buffer M5 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.25 mm EDTA, 65 mm KCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm DTT and 10 μg/ml BSA. Treatment of pol II or PICs with Gdown1 or HGKEDP buffer was performed for 5 min at room temperature. The pol II-Gdown1 incubations were performed at a final KCl concentration of 313 mm and the PIC-Gdown1 incubations at a final KCl concentration of 76 mm. Unless otherwise specified, 240 fmol Gdown1 was added per reaction, which represents a 20-fold molar excess over the amount of pol II present. When noted, PIC supernatant was removed after Gdown1 treatment and replaced with buffer M5 containing 1 mm DTT and 10 μg/ml BSA before initiation. Transcription was initiated to generate early elongation complexes (EECs) on the Ad ML promoter in a 10-μl reaction volume with 0.25 mm CpA (initiating position −1), 50 μm dATP, 0.5 mm UTP, 0.7 μm [α-32P]CTP and 0.5 units/μl RNasin Plus for 5 min at 30 °C followed by incubation with 0.1 mm CTP for 2 min at 30 °C. EECs were generated on the CMV promoter in a 10-μl reaction volume with 0.25 mm CpA, 50 μm GTP, 50 μm ATP, 1 μm UTP, 0.7 μm [α-32P]CTP and 0.5 units/μl RNasin Plus for 1 min at 30 °C. PICs were prepared on the −9/+3 Ad ML bubble template as described above but with only 10 ng of template per reaction. In some cases, TFIIE and TFIIH were omitted from these reactions, as indicated in Fig. 7. EECs on the bubble template were generated in a 10-μl reaction volume with 0.25 mm CpA, 0.5 mm UTP, 0.7 μm [α-32P]CTP and 0.5 units/μl RNasin Plus for 5 min at 30 °C followed by incubation at 0.1 mm CTP for 2 min at 30 °C. Transcripts were resolved on 18% denaturing acrylamide gels and imaged on a Typhoon Trio; quantitation was performed with ImageQuantTL software. EECs were prepared as above and high salt-rinsed with a buffer containing 1.6 m KCl followed by a 40 mm KCl rinse to remove excess salt. When challenged with Gdown1, EECs were incubated with 240 fmol of Gdown1 per initial 10-μl reaction for 5 min at room temperature. Chases were performed in 12.5 μl of reaction volume in MEMDM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) with a final KCl concentration of 52 mm for up to 1 min with 100 μm NTPs unless otherwise noted. When EECs were chased with TFIIF, 166 fmol of TFIIF or P-IIF were added with NTPs at the start of the chase per 10-μl initial reaction. Reactions were stopped with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% sarkosyl, and 0.2 mg/ml tRNA. Transcripts were resolved on 12% denaturing acrylamide gels. For continuous transcription assays (see Fig. 5), PICs were prepared as above with full-length TFIIF or truncated 1–227 TFIIF without rinsing. (In 1–227 TFIIF, the largest subunit is truncated to only the 227 N-terminal amino acids.) After 60 s of pulse labeling, complexes were directly chased without rinsing by addition of 100 μm NTPs and, where noted, 166 fmol of TFIIF with final concentrations of 60 mm KCl and 6 mm MgCl2 in the chase buffer. High salt-rinsed complexes containing labeled 30-mer transcripts (EECs) were generated on the Ad ML promoter template pML20-40 31g (total template length ∼ 390 nt) as described (15.Újvári A. Pal M. Luse D.S. et al.The functions of TFIIF during initiation and transcript elongation are differentially affected by phosphorylation by casein kinase 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23160-23167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, PICs were assembled with the same conditions as described above for initiation assays and rinsed with BC100 and M5 buffer. Complexes were labeled in M5 buffer with 0.5 mm ATP, 50 μm UTP, and 2.5 μm [α-32P]CTP with 0.5 units/μl RNasin Plus for 2 min at 30 °C followed by a chase with unlabeled 50 μm CTP for 30 s at 30 °C. The resulting complexes, which contained predominantly 30-nt RNAs, were rinsed with a wash buffer containing 1.6 m KCl followed by a 40 mm KCl wash buffer to remove excess salt. Complexes were released from the beads by cleavage with Cac8I for 25 min at 30 °C in MEMDM buffer containing 40 mm KCl, followed by addition of 1.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA per μg template. The EECs were diluted 5-fold and treated with 173–230 fmol of TFIIF (25–33 fmol/μl) or 240 fmol of Gdown1 for 5 min at room temperature per initial 10-μl reaction followed in some cases by additional challenge by 231 fmol of TFIIF (33 fmol/μl) for 5 min at room temperature. Glycerol was added to a final volume of 10%, and samples were resolved on 4% Tris-glycine native acrylamide gels run at 7 watts for 4 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and analyzed with a Typhoon Trio phosphorimager and ImageQuantTL software. We investigated the effect of Gdown1 on pol II function using in vitro approaches. We employed immobilized DNA templates (double-stranded except for Fig. 7) containing the strong CMV or Ad ML TATA box promoters. Pol II PICs were assembled with recombinant (TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, and TFIIE) and purified (TFIIH) human GTFs and purified human pol II. Western blots with Gdown1 antibody did not reveal any Gdown1 in our pol II preparation, when we would have detected 1% of the polymerases containing Gdown1 (data not shown). Transcription was initiated with a brief pulse of NTPs at limiting levels including 32P-labeled CTP, generating an EEC. As shown in Fig. 1, transcripts in the EECs were typically 20–30 nt in length with the CMV template (lane 1). To study the response of the EECs to elongation factors, we first rinsed them with 1.6 m KCl to remove any TFIIF. Addition of excess nonlabeled NTPs to these complexes allowed pol II to continue transcript elongation at ∼100 nt/min (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3), as expected from earlier work (15.Újvári A. Pal M. Luse D.S. et al.The functions of TFIIF during initiation and transcript elongation are differentially affected by phosphorylation by casein kinase 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23160-23167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Supplementing the elongation reactions with TFIIF stimulated the elongation rate by 3–4-fold (lanes 4 and 5), also as expected (15.Újvári A. Pal M. Luse D.S. et al.The functions of TFIIF during initiation and transcript elongation are differentially affected by phosphorylation by casein kinase 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23160-23167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We anticipated from earlier studies that Gdown1 would block the ability of TFIIF to stimulate elongation by pol II. In those experiments, the initial EECs were generated with nuclear extracts (3.Cheng B. Li T. Rahl P.B. Adamson T.E. Loudas N.B. Guo J. Varzavand K. Cooper J.J. Hu X. Gnatt A. Young R.A.

To verify that EECs produced with GTFs respond similarly, we incubated recombinant human Gdown1 (in large excess over pol II) with high salt-rinsed EECs and then chased with nonlabeled NTPs, with or without TFIIF. As shown in Fig. 1, lanes 6–9, Gdown1 alone had no significant effect on elongation rate (as expected, see Ref. 3.Cheng B. Li T. Rahl P.B. Adamson T.E. Loudas N.B. Guo J. Varzavand K. Cooper J.J.

Upon activation by ligand binding, GPCRs catalyze guanosine diphosphate (GDP) dissociation from the Gαβγ heterotrimer substrate; guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding to Gα follows and leads to functional dissociation of Gβγ from Gα and effector enzyme activation (1.Gilman A.G. et al.G proteins: transducers of receptor-generated signals.Annu.

Detailed studies of the Gq-PLCβ signaling system revealed a novel paradigm in G protein signaling, called kinetic scaffolding, where the intrinsic Gq-GTPase stimulating function leads to spatially and temporally focused PLC activation (19.Ross E.M. et al.Coordinating speed and amplitude in G-protein signaling.Curr.

Phospholipase Cβ is often found in physical complexes with GPCRs through interactions with intermediary scaffolds. One such class of scaffolds is postsynaptic density-95/disc large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing proteins. PDZ domains are independently folded protein modules that specifically bind and recognize PDZ ligand consensus sequences at the extreme C terminus of target proteins (21.Suh P.G. Hwang J.I. Ryu S.H.

In the present studies, we investigated a direct interaction between the M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R), a prototypical Gαq-coupled receptor, and its effector enzyme, PLCβ3. We demonstrate here that M3R binds to PLCβ3 and drives plasma membrane enrichment of PLCβ3 in cells. Interaction sites for direct protein-protein binding that alter the efficiency of G protein-dependent PLC activation are also defined. Taken together, the direct binding interaction between M3R and PLCβ3 may represent a regulatory mechanism for PLC signal output beyond receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange on Gαq. n-Dodecyl β-maltoside was purchased from Dojindo Molecular Technologies. Resins for purification were from GE Healthcare (glutathione-Sepharose 4B), Qiagen (Ni-NTA-agarose), and Genscript (protein G-agarose).

Each fragment was inserted between EcoRI- and SalI-cut sites in the modified pGEX4T2, resulting in an N-terminal GST tag and a C-terminal His6 tag. PLCβ3 (human, 1–1234) in pBluescript was moved into pciNeo vector (Promega) for mammalian expression and into pFastbac HTb vector (Invitrogen) for baculoviral insect cell expression between EcoRI and SalI sites. To generate deletion/mutant constructs at the extreme C terminus of human PLCβ3, fragments were generated by PCR flanked by a native 5′ KpnI site (nucleotides 2090–2095) and 3′ SalI site and ligated into vector with a purified N-terminal fragment digested with EcoRI and KpnI. Deletions were made by removing the PLCβ3 PDZ consensus motif NTQL at 1231–1234 (ΔPDZ). A larger deletion from the C terminus (1–886, ΔCT) was made by PCR to generate a fragment flanked by EcoRI and SalI for ligation into pciNeo. YFP-PLCβ3 (rat) full length (FL), pleckstrin homology (PH) (1–147), C2 (712–809), and CT (845–1234) in pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) were generated as described previously (35.Adjobo-Hermans M.J. Crosby K.C.

Signal. 2013; 25: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To create ΔPDZ versions of PLCβ3 FL and PLCβ3 CT, fragments were generated by PCR flanked by a native 5′ HindIII site (nucleotides 2531–2536) and 3′ EcoRI site for vector ligation. GFP-PLCβ3ΔCT was constructed in pciNeo with a NheI/EcoRI-digested fragment encoding for enhanced GFP from pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) and an EcoRI/SalI-digested PLCβ3ΔCT fragment (human). Primers and sequencing results from regions generated by PCR are available upon request. All buffers for protein purification were ice-cold and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (133 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 21 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 42 μg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Reported protein concentrations were quantified using an amido black protein assay. Protein purity was estimated by analyzing Coomassie-stained protein gels using band densitometry functions in ImageJ. GST-M3R loop fusion proteins (GST-M3Ri1, GST-M3Ri2, GST-M3Ri3N/M/C, and GST-M3RCT) were transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli. BL21 Rosetta strain was used for some constructs that were otherwise difficult to express. For each protein, up to 3-liter cultures were grown in LB/carbenicillin and induced at A600 ∼0.50 with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and then resuspended in 1× PBS. The pellets were then frozen with liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C. Samples were thawed, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mm imidazole, and 30 mg of lysozyme/liter of culture) followed by addition of 1 mg of DNase I/liter of culture and 10 mm MgCl2. To enrich for fully translated proteins, purification was achieved by taking advantage of the C-terminal His6. Supernatant was collected after 100,000 × g ultracentrifugation and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 1-ml column of Ni-NTA resin. The loaded column was washed with 600 mm NaCl, re-equilibrated, and eluted with 100–250 mm imidazole. PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) were used to equilibrate purified proteins in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The proteins were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C in aliquots. For the screening of M3Ri3Na single alanine mutants, glutathione affinity chromatography was used. Protein expression was carried out with 25 ml of BL21 cultures. Cell lysis and supernatant extraction were performed as described above except with a proportional reduction in scale. Each protein extract was applied to pre-equilibrated 50% glutathione-Sepharose slurry (100 μl) for 3 h. Resin washing was performed essentially as described above except with buffers without imidazole addition. The partially purified proteins were stored on ice in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Protein stoichiometry was quantified by Coomassie staining of 15% SDS-PAGE with the inclusion of pure protein standards of known concentration. The protein amount of each mutant was normalized to the fully translated GST fusion protein band. Expression and purification of G proteins αq or αs/αolf were performed using Ric-8A or Ric-8B affinity chromatography, respectively, as described previously (36.Chan P. Gabay M. Wright F.A. Kan W.

Briefly, His6 N-terminally tagged PLCβ3 protein and variants were expressed in 250 ml of High Five cells infected (at 2 × 106/ml) with freshly amplified baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. 48 h after infection, a collected cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl. The suspension was subjected to four cycles of liquid nitrogen freeze/thaw. The NaCl concentration was adjusted to 1 m (resupplemented with protease inhibitors), and the mixture was then ultracentrifuged at 140,000 × g. The supernatant was diluted 5-fold with buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether (C12E10), and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and recentrifuged. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 4-ml Ni-NTA column. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 15 mm imidazole and 800 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 50 mm NaCl and 125 mm imidazole. The yield was ∼40 mg of purified protein/liter of High Five culture. PD-10 columns were used to equilibrate purified proteins in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm EDTA. No further purification steps were deemed necessary to produce ∼80% pure protein. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at ∼¼ confluence. The following day, they were transiently transfected with YFP/GFP-PLCβ3 constructs either with pciNeo vector or 3xHA-M3R (∼500 ng of each per dish for a total of 1 μg). Prior to live cell imaging, medium was replaced 18 h after transfection with imaging buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5.5 mm glucose, 0.56 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm Hepes, and 1.2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The following settings were used: for enhanced GFP, excitation, 488 nm; emission, 510 nm; for enhanced YFP, excitation, 515 nm; emission, 527 nm. z stacked (one stack = 1 μm) images were acquired directly from each dish using an Olympus FV1000MP microscope in confocal mode with a LUMPLFL 40× 0.8 numerical aperture W (Olympus) lens. A complete z stack was taken for every field of view from the top to the bottom of cells. For estimation of the plasma membrane/cytosol ratio of protein distribution, regions of interest were selected from the same z level either along the entire edge of a cell for plasma membrane or from those in the body of the cell excluding the nucleus for cytosol. Mean fluorescence intensities within each region of interest were measured using Olympus Fluoview version 2.0. A z level with the highest fluorescence intensity at the plasma membrane edge was chosen for analysis and for representative images. Because contribution of fluorescence from the cytosol was not subtracted, a ratio value of 1 does not indicate a 1:1 distribution of fluorescence between plasma membrane and cytosol; rather, it represents the baseline value of fluorescence distribution for cytosol-localized proteins. Approximately two to six cells were visible per field of view. Fluorescence ratios were calculated for all cells in every field of view captured for each experimental group. At least 20 independently acquired images from three separate transfections were analyzed for each condition. Rounded cells (height more than 20 μm), indicative of poor health, were discarded from the analysis. Where indicated, a blinded observer (unaware of the experimental conditions behind each image) scored cells with plasma membrane distribution of fluorescence from entire image data sets. For this purpose, the order of images was randomly shuffled. Each representative micrograph at one z plane is supplemented with a line profile analysis below. Fluorescence intensities were measured along points a to b and plotted as a function of distance AB. CHO cells were grown on a 35-mm dish at ∼⅓ confluence. The following day, each dish of cells was transiently transfected with YFP-PLCβ3 and/or 3xHA-M3R. Empty pciNeo vector was added to equalize between experimental groups"
https://openalex.org/W2067780221,"Objective Current medical practice for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions remains a clinical challenge due to the limited self-repair ability of articular cartilage. Both experimental and clinical researches show that moderate exercise can improve articular cartilage repair process. However, optimal timing of moderate exercise is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of timing of moderate treadmill exercise on repair of full-thickness defects of articular cartilage. Design Full-thickness cartilage defects were drilled in the patellar groove of bilateral femoral condyles in a total of 40 male SD rats before they were randomly assigned into four even groups. In sedentary control (SED) group, no exercise was given; in 2-week (2W), 4-week (4W) and 8-week groups, moderate treadmill exercise was initiated respectively two, four and eight weeks after operation. Half of the animals were sacrificed at week 10 after operation and half at week 14 after operation. Femoral condyles were harvested for gross observation and histochemical measurement by O'Driscoll scoring system. Collagen type II was detected by immunohistochemistry and mRNA expressions of aggrecan and collagen type II cartilage by RT-PCR. Results Both 10 and 14 weeks post-operation, the best results were observed in 4W group and the worst results appeared in 2W group. The histochemistry scores and the expressions of collagen type II and aggrecan were significantly higher in 4W group than that in other three groups (P<0.05). Conclusions Moderate exercise at a selected timing (approximately 4 weeks) after injury can significantly promote the healing of cartilage defects but may hamper the repair process if performed too early while delayed intervention by moderate exercise may reduce its benefits in repair of the defects."
https://openalex.org/W2099326935,"As computing technology and image analysis techniques have advanced, the practice of histology has grown from a purely qualitative method to one that is highly quantified. Current image analysis software is imprecise and prone to wide variation due to common artifacts and histological limitations. In order to minimize the impact of these artifacts, a more robust method for quantitative image analysis is required.Here we present a novel image analysis software, based on the hue saturation value color space, to be applied to a wide variety of histological stains and tissue types. By using hue, saturation, and value variables instead of the more common red, green, and blue variables, our software offers some distinct advantages over other commercially available programs. We tested the program by analyzing several common histological stains, performed on tissue sections that ranged from 4 µm to 10 µm in thickness, using both a red green blue color space and a hue saturation value color space.We demonstrated that our new software is a simple method for quantitative analysis of histological sections, which is highly robust to variations in section thickness, sectioning artifacts, and stain quality, eliminating sample-to-sample variation."
https://openalex.org/W1967275357,"Understanding how space affects the occurrence of native and non-native species is essential for inferring processes that shape communities. However, studies considering spatial and environmental variables for the entire community - as well as for the native and non-native assemblages in a single study - are scarce for animals. Harvestmen communities in central Europe have undergone drastic turnovers during the past decades, with several newly immigrated species, and thus provide a unique system to study such questions. We studied the wall-dwelling harvestmen communities from 52 human settlements in Luxembourg and found the assemblages to be largely dominated by non-native species (64% of specimens). Community structure was analysed using Moran's eigenvector maps as spatial variables, and landcover variables at different radii (500 m, 1000 m, 2000 m) in combination with climatic parameters as environmental variables. A surprisingly high portion of pure spatial variation (15.7% of total variance) exceeded the environmental (10.6%) and shared (4%) components of variation, but we found only minor differences between native and non-native assemblages. This could result from the ecological flexibility of both, native and non-native harvestmen that are not restricted to urban habitats but also inhabit surrounding semi-natural landscapes. Nevertheless, urban landcover variables explained more variation in the non-native community, whereas coverage of semi-natural habitats (forests, rivers) at broader radii better explained the native assemblage. This indicates that some urban characteristics apparently facilitate the establishment of non-native species. We found no evidence for competitive replacement of native by invasive species, but a community with novel combination of native and non-native species."
https://openalex.org/W1988241761,"Estrogen plays an important role in the maintenance of bone formation, and deficiency in the production of estrogen is directly linked to postmenopausal osteoporosis. To date, the underlying mechanisms of estrogen-mediated osteogenic differentiation are not well understood. In this study, a pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line C2C12 was used to induce osteogenic differentiation and subjected to detection of gene expressions or to manipulation of cyclin G2 expressions. C57BL/6 mice were used to generate bilateral ovariectomized and sham-operated mice for analysis of bone mineral density and protein expression. We identified cyclin G2, an unconventional member of cyclin, is involved in osteoblast differentiation regulated by estrogen in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the data showed that ectopic expression of cyclin G2 suppressed expression of osteoblast transcription factor Runx2 and osteogenic differentiation marker genes, as well as ALP activity and in vitro extracellular matrix mineralization. Mechanistically, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is essential for cyclin G2 to inhibit osteogenic differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, the current study presents the first evidence that cyclin G2 serves as a negative regulator of both osteogenesis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Most importantly, the basal and 17β-estradiol-induced osteogenic differentiation was restored by overexpression of cyclin G2. These results taken together suggest that cyclin G2 may function as an endogenous suppressor of estrogen-induced osteogenic differentiation through inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling."

Materials and Methods 151 consecutive patients were prospectively included and randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 47) underwent combined heart, neck, and head CTA using prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral (Flash) scan protocol with a single-phase intravenous injection of iodinated contrast and saline flush; Group 2 (n = 51) underwent single coronary CTA with Flash scan protocol; and Group 3 (n = 53) underwent single coronary CTA with prospective sequence scan protocol. All patients were examined on a dual source CT (Definition FLASH). The image quality was determined for each CT study. Results Patients of scanning protocol Group 1, 2, and 3 showed no significant differences in age, sex, heart rates, and BMI. Evaluation of coronary artery image quality showed comparable results in the three scanning protocol groups on a per patient-based analysis. In group 1, image quality was found to be sufficient to be diagnostic in all arterial segments of carotid arteries. The mean dose-length product (DLP) for group 1 was 256.3±24.5 mGy×cm and was significantly higher in comparison with group 2 (93.4±19.9 mGy×cm; p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference of DLP between group 1 and group 3 (254.1±69.9 mGy×cm). Conclusions The combined heart, neck, and head arteries scan using prospectively electrocardiography (ECG)-triggered high-pitch spiral scan protocol in 1 single examination resulted in an excellent opacification of the aorta, the carotid arteries, and the coronary arteries and provided a good image quality with low radiation dose."
https://openalex.org/W2084398450,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by alveolar simplification with decreased alveolar number and increased airspace. Previous studies suggested that transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) may contribute to arrested alveolar development in BPD. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) control cellular signaling and gene expression. HDAC2 is crucial for suppression of inflammatory gene expression. Here we investigated whether HDAC2 was involved in the arrest of alveolarization, as well as the ability of HDAC2 to regulate TGF-α expression in a rat model of BPD induced by intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results showed that LPS exposure led to a suppression of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 expression and activity, induced TGF-α expression, and disrupted alveolar morphology. Mechanistic studies showed that overexpression of HDAC2, but not HDAC1, suppressed LPS-induced TGF-α expression. Moreover, the HDAC inhibitor TSA or downregulation of HDAC2 by siRNA both significantly increased TGF-α expression in cultured myofibroblasts. Finally, preservation of HDAC activity by theophylline treatment improved alveolar development and attenuated TGF-α release. Together, these findings indicate that attenuation of TGF-α-mediated effects in the lung by enhancing HDAC2 may have a therapeutic effect on treating BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2100429982,"Measurement of bacterial burden in animal infection models is a key component for both bacterial pathogenesis studies and therapeutic agent research. The traditional quantification means for in vivo bacterial burden requires frequent animal sacrifice and enumerating colony forming units (CFU) recovered from infection loci. To address these issues, researchers have developed a variety of luciferase-expressing bacterial reporter strains to enable bacterial detection in living animals. To date, all such luciferase-based bacterial reporters are in cell-associated form. Production of luciferase-secreting recombinant bacteria could provide the advantage of reporting CFU from both infection loci themselves and remote sampling (eg. body fluid and plasma). Toward this end, we have genetically manipulated a pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain, ATCC25922, to secrete the marine copepod Gaussia princeps luciferase (Gluc), and assessed the use of Gluc as both an in situ and ex situ reporter for bacterial burden in mouse tissue cage infections. The E. coli expressing Gluc demonstrates in vivo imaging of bacteria in a tissue cage model of infection. Furthermore, secreted Gluc activity and bacterial CFUs recovered from tissue cage fluid (TCF) are correlated along 18 days of infection. Importantly, secreted Gluc can also be detected in plasma samples and serve as an ex situ indicator for the established tissue cage infection, once high bacterial burdens are achieved. We have demonstrated that Gluc from marine eukaryotes can be stably expressed and secreted by pathogenic E. coli in vivo to enable a facile tool for longitudinal evaluation of persistent bacterial infection."

In the present study, we investigated whether baseline serum IGF-1 levels predict time-to-progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). A total of 155 consecutive treatment-naive patients with HCC who had undergone TACE as initial treatment were included from a prospective cohort. Baseline serum IGF-1 levels were analyzed with regard to their associations with disease progression and survival. During a median follow-up period of 41.8 months, patients with low IGF-1 levels showed significantly shorter TTP (median, 6.0 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-7.6) than patients with high IGF-1 levels (median, 16.5 months; 95% CI, 4.9-28.1; p = 0.003). In the multivariate analysis, BCLC stage, serum vascular endothelial growth factorlevels, and IGF-1 levels were independent risk factors for disease progression. The hazard ratio (HR) of progression for each 10 ng/mL decrease in IGF-1 level was 1.072 (95% CI, 1.029-1.117; p = 0.001). Furthermore, together with tumor size, stage, and treatment response, IGF-1 levels were an independent predictor of poorer survival (for each 10 ng/mL decrease in IGF-1 level; HR, 1.057; 95% CI, 1.001-1.115; p = 0.045). In conclusion, low baseline IGF-1 levels independently correlated with shorter TTP and poorer OS in patients with HCC who underwent TACE."
https://openalex.org/W2046768251,"The EZSCAN test was recently developed to screen for early dysglycemia through an assessment of sudomotor function. Given the associations of dysglycemia and autonomic dysfunction with the development of arterial stiffness, EZSCAN may also detect early arterial stiffness. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of EZSCAN with arterial stiffness across blood glucose levels.A total of 5532 participants without diabetes or established cardiovascular disease were evaluated with EZSCAN. Their central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were also measured. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess the association between the EZSCAN value and the cSBP, baPWV, and ABI measurements in all of the participants, with additional subgroup analysis that separated participants into a normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group and an impaired glucose regulation (IGR) group. The frequency of the IGRs increased with quartiles of the EZSCAN value (P for trend <0.0001). The levels of cSBP and baPWV increased while the levels of ABI decreased across quartiles of EZSCAN value in both NGT and IGR individuals (P for trend <0.0001 for all). In multivariable analyses, the EZSCAN value was positively associated with cSBP (log-transformed beta = 8.20, P<0.0001) and baPWV (log-transformed beta = 1.82, P<0.0001) but inversely associated with ABI (log-transformed beta = -0.043, P<0.0001) and was independent of conventional factors. Further adjustment for fasting and postprandial glucoses did not attenuate the associations. The results were also unchanged when stratified by IGR.The EZSCAN results were associated with arterial stiffness independent of conventional factors, blood glucose levels, and glucose tolerance status, suggesting a probable link between the EZSCAN value and arterial stiffness through autonomic dysfunction. The EZSCAN test may help us detect the development of arterial stiffness in high risk individuals to prevent unfavorable cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W1994720270,"Left atrial appendage (LAA) volume has been shown to be increased in patients with acute cryptogenic stroke. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a well-recognized risk factor but it is not the only one associated with LAA enlargement. The aim of the study was to clarify the multifactorial etiology of LAA enlargement in cardiogenic stroke/TIA patients without AF.Altogether 149 patients with suspected cardioembolic stroke/TIA (47 females; mean age 61 years) underwent cardiac CT. Diagnosed AF on admittance was an exclusion criteria but 24-hour Holter ambulatory ECG revealed paroxysmal AF (PAF) in 20 patients. Body surface area adjusted LAA volume was evaluated. Eighteen different variables were registered including general characteristics, definite and potential causal risk factors for ischemic stroke/TIA, clinical echoparameters and CT based cardiac volumetric and adipose tissue measurements. A stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to achieve a model adjusted for the number of predictors of LAA volume increase.In linear regression analysis, the best model accounted for 30% of the variability in LAA volume, including PAF (19%) and enlarged left atrial volume (6%), enlarged left ventricle end-systolic diameter (3%) and decreased pericardial adipose tissue (2%). No multi-colinearity between variables was observed. In addition to PAF, no other definitive or potential causal risk factors could account for the LAA volume in these patients.LAA volume increase seems to be poorly associated with currently known stroke/TIA risk factors, except for AF. Targeting more comprehensive ECG monitoring for stroke patients with increased LAA volume should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2054815848,"Receptor-mediated activation of the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins requires allosteric communication between the receptor binding site and the guanine nucleotide binding site, which are separated by >30 Å. Structural changes in the allosteric network connecting these sites are predicted to be transient in the wild-type Gα subunit, making studies of these connections challenging. In the current work, site-directed mutants that alter the energy barriers between the activation states are used as tools to better understand the transient features of allosteric signaling in the Gα subunit. The observed differences in relative receptor affinity for intact Gαi1 subunits versus C-terminal Gαi1 peptides harboring the K345L mutation are consistent with this mutation modulating the allosteric network in the protein subunit. Measurement of nucleotide exchange rates, affinity for metarhodopsin II, and thermostability suggest that the K345L Gαi1 variant has reduced stability in both the GDP-bound and nucleotide-free states as compared with wild type but similar stability in the GTPγS-bound state. High resolution x-ray crystal structures reveal conformational changes accompanying the destabilization of the GDP-bound state.

Significance: G protein signaling is critical for numerous cellular functions, and GDP release is the rate-limiting step of the cycle. Heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) switch between activation states to elicit cellular responses (1.Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. et al.Heterotrimeric G protein activation by G-protein-coupled receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In the Gα subunit, signaling competence is encoded into surface conformations that reflect the identity of bound guanine nucleotide. The GTP-bound form of the Gα subunit is considered the activated state as its Switch regions adopt conformations that can interact with effector molecules. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP changes the conformations of these regions and converts the Gα subunit to a state that instead associates with Gβγ. GDP-bound Gαβγ then traffics to the membrane where it can interact with G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorGTPγSguanosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphateEMBextra meta II buffermeta IImetarhodopsin IINEBnucleotide exchange bufferP-loopphosphate binding loopROSrod outer segment.

Surprisingly, however, when the K341L mutation was introduced into chimeric Gαt/Gαi1, it did not similarly improve the affinity for receptor (26.Herrmann R. Heck M. Henklein P. Kleuss C. Wray V. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. et al.Rhodopsin-transducin coupling. Role of the Gα C-terminus in nucleotide exchange catalysis.Vision Res. 2006; 46: 4582-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because both G proteins and cognate GPCRs transmit signals via allosteric networks, one possibility for this apparent contradiction is that this C-terminal mutation influences the allosteric network within the Gα subunit in a way that disfavors the receptor binding state and thus reduces receptor coupling efficiency and GDP release. Here, we used the K345L variant of Gαi1 to probe the allosteric pathway linking receptor binding to guanine nucleotide exchange. Our results combine measurements of basal and receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange, receptor binding studies, high resolution crystallography, and stability measurements to demonstrate how the K345L mutation alters the different nucleotide-bound states of the Gα subunit. An interaction between the P-loop and Switch I in the crystal structure of the K345L Gαi1 subunit identifies one potential conformational intermediate of nucleotide exchange. This allows us to propose a new connection between structural elements of Gα subunits, and suggests how the P-loop and Switch I help to coordinate nucleotide release. The cDNA encoding Rattus norvegicus Gαi1 was amplified from the pPAL7 vector (generously donated by Dr. Ongun Onaran (Ankara University)) using appropriate primers and subcloned into the pSV277 expression vector (Vanderbilt University) to include an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site. The E43A and K345L mutations were introduced using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis ki (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing (GenHunter). Gαi1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Gold (DE3) as described (27.Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. et al.Mapping of effector binding sites of transducin α-subunit using Gαt/Gαi1 chimeras.J. Biol.

Briefly, cultures were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin A until the A600 reached 0.6. Expression was induced with 30–60 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 18–20 h at 22 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C. Before purification, cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm NaHPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm GDP, pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.1 mm PMSF or 1 mm Pefabloc and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The resuspended cells were disrupted by sonication, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 220,000 × g (50,000 rpm in a Ti70 rotor). The supernatant was treated with 10 μg/ml DNase and RNase, filtered, and added in batch to TALON Cobalt affinity resin equilibrated in lysis buffer. After 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was transferred to a gravity flow column and washed with lysis buffer, then lysis buffer supplemented with 5 mm imidazole pH 8.0. Protein was eluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 100 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, concentrated using an Amicon 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugal concentrator at 2000 × g, then diluted 20-fold. Thrombin was added (1 unit/mg of purified protein), and the sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C to cleave the N-terminal affinity tag. The protein sample was further purified over TALON Cobalt affinity resin equilibrated in lysis buffer and by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S200 10/300GL column equilibrated in storage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20 μm GDP, pH 8.0). Purified Gαi1 was concentrated to 10 mg/ml as determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) in triplicate, and glycerol was added to 10% (v/v) before storage at −80 °C. The purified protein contained two additional N-terminal residues (Gly-Ser) derived from the thrombin recognition sequence. Endogenous rhodopsin and transducin were purified as previously described (28.Thaker T.M. Kaya A.I. Preininger A.M. Hamm H.E. Iverson T.M. et al.Allosteric mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. A structural perspective.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 796: 133-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, dark-adapted rhodopsin was stored as aliquots of urea-washed rod outer segment (ROS) membranes that were prepared by washing retinas twice with EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) and once with urea buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 7 m urea, pH 7.5). Pelleted membranes were then resuspended in 10 mm MOPS, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm PMSF, pH 7.5, and aliquots stored at −80 °C. Transducin was purified from light-adapted bovine ROS membranes. Membranes were washed 4 times with isotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, 130 mm KCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0) and two times with hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0). Transducin was then released into the supernatant by resuspending ROS membranes with hypotonic buffer containing 0.1 mm GTP. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing transducin was dialyzed against transducin storage buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm NaCl, 10 μm GDP, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Purified transducin was stored at −80 °C. The rate of GDP exchange for GTPγS in Gαi1 was determined by monitoring the increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 290 nm, λem = 340 nm) using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. The fluorescence signal from basal nucleotide exchange was measured at 21 °C. In this assay the basal fluorescence from 500 nm wild-type or variant Gαi1 (in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) was collected for 5 min, after which time 10 μm GTPγS was added and mixed by pipetting. The fluorescence was then recorded for a minimum of 60 min. Receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange was monitored for heterotrimeric G protein, Gαi1β1γ1, reconstituted by incubating wild-type or variant Gαi1 with Gβ1γ1 purified from endogenous transducin in a 1:1 molar ratio for at least 20 min. 2 μm dark rhodopsin in urea-washed ROS membranes was added to 500 nm heterotrimeric G protein in assay buffer and incubated in the dark for a minimum of 20 min to allow complex association. GTPγS was added to a final concentration of 10 μm mixed by pipetting and fluorescence-monitored for an additional 5 min to measure the basal signal. Finally, the samples were light-activated and mixed by pipetting, and the fluorescence signal from receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange was monitored at 21 °C for a minimum of 60 min. Time courses for both basal and receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange experiments were determined empirically by monitoring fluorescence signal decay after the addition of GTPγS and were 60 and 90 min, respectively, in the experiments reported here. Nucleotide exchange rates were calculated from data for three independent experiments with four replicates per experiment and fit in Prism Version 6.0c using a one-site exponential association equation of the form F=Fo+(Fmax−Fo)(1−e−kt)Eq. 1 where t is time (min), Fo is the magnitude of the fluorescence signal at t = 0, Fmax is the maximum fluorescence signal, F is the fluorescence signal observed at time = t, and k is the rate constant (min−1). Values were normalized to wild-type Gαi1. Wild-type and variant Gαi1 binding to rhodopsin was measured in urea-washed ROS membranes as previously described (29.Preininger A.M. Funk M.A. Oldham W.M. Meier S.M. Johnston C.A. Adhikary S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Hamm H.E.

Gαi1 (5 μm) was incubated with Gβγ (10 μm) and rhodopsin (50 μm) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C and assessed under three different conditions: dark-adapted, after light activation, and after light activation with the addition of GTPγS (100 μm). Supernatants were separated from membranes by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h, and the dark-adapted supernatants were removed under dim red light. Isolated fractions were boiled, visualized by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, and quantified by densitometry using a Bio-Rad Multimager. Quantities of 37-kDa Gαi1 in either the soluble or insoluble fraction are expressed as a percentage of the total protein in both. Data reported are the average of at least three independent experiments. The formation of metarhodopsin II in ROS membranes was measured on an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer in the presence of increasing concentrations of G proteins previously described (4.Dratz E.A. Furstenau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. et al.NMR structure of a receptor-bound G-protein peptide.Nature. 1993; 363: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G protein was reconstituted from purified wild-type or variant Gαi1 in the same manner as used for receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange measurements. Rhodopsin (2 μm) in dark-adapted urea-washed ROS membranes were incubated with varying concentrations of wild-type or K345L Gαi1β1γ1 in Extra Meta II buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0) on ice for ∼10 min. Absorption spectra for both dark and light-adapted samples were then collected at 4 °C. After collection of a dark-adapted spectrum, samples were exposed to 2 quick flashes of light ∼30 s apart. The light-adapted spectrum was then immediately collected. The extra meta II signal was calculated as the change in meta II formation (ΔA380 nm − ΔA440 nm) before and after light activation at 4 °C. The EC50 values for wild-type and mutant Gαi1 were calculated by plotting data as a function of the Gαi1β1γ1 concentration and fit to a four-parameter, variable slope equation (21.Aris L.

https://openalex.org/W2036958962,"We investigated how preferred and nonpreferred tastes influence the disposition of fat. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were infused with 5 ml of 20% intralipid through an intragastric catheter and with 0.3 ml of a taste solution through an intraoral catheter. At 120 min postinfusion, plasma concentrations of fat fuels (triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids) were either unchanged or slightly higher after rats tasted a preferred sweet taste solution (0.125% saccharin +3% glucose) than after they tasted water. They were markedly lower after rats tasted a non-preferred solution–either a bitter solution (0.15% quinine hydrochloride) or a sweet solution that had previously been the conditioned stimulus for lithium-induced taste aversion. The distribution of 14C-triolein mixed with the gastric load was determined at 4 h postinfusion. Rats that received a non-preferred bitter taste had significantly more 14C remaining in the stomach than did those that received a preferred sweet taste. These results suggest that taste hedonics–either unconditioned or conditioned aversive tastes–influence fat disposition by altering gastric emptying."
